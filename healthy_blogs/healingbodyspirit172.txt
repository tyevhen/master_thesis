I just finished the cycle of sprouting sunflower seeds. If you send me your email I will email you instructions on how to sprout these small black seeds. pattyb@q.com. They are delicious in salads, on sandwiches, or in juices.
Sunflower greens are a nutritional powerhouse packed with vitamins A, B complex, D, and E; they also contain minerals including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus and zinc. In addition to these vitamins and minerals, sunflower greens are a rich source of lecithin which helps break down fatty acids into an easily digestible water soluble form, and chlorophyll which benefits many functions within the body, including building blood supply, revitalizing tissue, calming inflammation, activating enzymes, and deodorizing the body (from Dr. Robert Young).
They would be a great item for food storage.
