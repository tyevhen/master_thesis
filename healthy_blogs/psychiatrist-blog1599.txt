The FDA just approved a generic Trileptal, an anticonvulsant related to the mood stabilizer, Tegretol (carbamazepine), and sometimes used to treat bipolar disorder. It is thought to have fewer problems with liver toxicity than Tegretol.

See the FDA announcement for more details. Three companies were approved to make the new generic.
