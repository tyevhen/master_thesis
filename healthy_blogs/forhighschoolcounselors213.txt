As a school counselor do you feel comfortable assisting students and their families in the area of trauma or in a school/community disaster? To be honest, I certainly feel vulnerable in this area and I am always looking for trauma training.  One possible training for school counselors in this area is offered by the American Red Cross.  According to the American Counseling Association, this training will be offered at their next conference in Orlando (March, 2015). In addition to this training, ACA offers a list of trauma fact sheets for counselors created by the ACA Traumatology Interest Network.
