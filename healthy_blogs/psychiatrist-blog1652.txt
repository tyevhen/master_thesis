One month ago today I posted the Who Reads Shrink Rap? poll on our sidebar. We know we get roughly 1500 unique visitors a week, but people aren't much for polls. We took guesses, we even set up a poll to see who folks wanted to win the guess about how many people would actually take our poll (say what?). I guessed we'd have 275 responses, ClinkShrink said 186, Roy said 246. With 251 responses, Roy is both the closest and he hasn't gone over. You Go, Roy!

So Who Reads Shrink Rap?
21 shrinks (really? I bet they don't vote)
40 other mental health professionals
10 non-shrink physicians
29 other health care professionals
4 of our friends (I thought we had more friends...)
84 patients
69 curious bystanders (whatever that means)
53 others.

Who are The Others? I feel like I'm on LOST.

So there you have it. Thank you for voting and have a good day. Roy is away, we'll have to think about his prize?
