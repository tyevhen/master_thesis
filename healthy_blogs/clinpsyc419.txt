The AHRP blog has a great post on how academics sold out in the case of Paxil/Seroxat. The story includes the text of a likewise great piece from the British Medical Journal on the same topic. On at least one of the Paxil studies authored by "independent" academics, the suicidality of participants magically turned into "lability" and serious aggressive behavior turned into "hostility." The study authors simply renamed the adverse events to sound more tolerable -- I'd certainly rather be "labile" than suicidal, wouldn't you? Here's a link to the abstract of said study so you can see the names of the authors who let this slip by them. Sadly, these are some of the big names in child psychiatry.

According to Joe Collier, Panorama shows how GSK had: "written up" the pediatric Paxil trial for publication; "bought and manipulated (apparently willingly) opinion formers; worked to promote the product for use in children (although it was not, and never has been, licensed for such use);" and how the information about the safety and efficacy of Paxil was distorted in letters to prescribers, in advice to their sales force, and in messages to the media.
