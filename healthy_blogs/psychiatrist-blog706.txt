For today's blog post, I'm going to send you over to Thought Broadcast to read Steve's discussion on
I Just Don't Know What to Believe Anymore. 

Two new blogs I thought I'd put in a plug for:

Shrink2B is writing about his residency training experience (now on day #6) over at 
Sizing Up the Shrink.


There's a patient blog worth looking at over on
Lithium and Lamictal.
