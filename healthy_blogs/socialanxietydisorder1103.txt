Anxiety Panic Attack
An anxiety panic disorder is described as a anxiety panic attack that is brought on because of extreme and unrealistic levels of fear. A major characteristic of an anxiety panic attack is the overwhelming feeling of impending doom. Even though an anxiety panic attack is relatively harmless, it can be one of the most terrifying experiences, simply because you feel like you are going 'crazy' and 'out of control'.
The world's leading mental health advisors indicate that almost a third of the earths population suffer from some form of anxiety panic disorder.

Anxiety panic disorder / attacks unfortunately have the lowest rates for people reporting them or seeking help.

I had my first anxiety panic attack when I was 28, and spent months trying to figure out what was going on with me. After months of bouncing from doctor to doctor, I was finally diagnosed as having an anxiety panic disorder.

Question :
Is there a difference between a normal Anxiety/Panic Attack, or a Drug Induced Panic/Anxiety Attack?
What is the difference.. (If there is any) between a normal Anxiety attack people get when Anxious... or a drug-induced one? Appreciate any answers. Thank you.
Answer :
Anxiety often triggers panic attacks, or anxiety attacks. This can make someone feel as though they are having a heart attack. They feel all of the symptoms of a heart attack and usually end up in the emergency room of the hospital. A normal anxiety attack is the result of too much stress.

Anti depressants are different than anti anxiety drugs. Anti depressant drugs are usually prescribed with anti anxiety drugs but are meant to be used on a long term basis.These drugs are called SSRIs. Drug induced anxiety attack are side effects to using SSRI medication.

They include vivid and extraordinary dreams, dizziness, weight loss or gain, inability to achieve sexual pleasure, panic attacks, and photosensitivity.

Question :
Other than benzodiazepines, are there any other types of medications to help with anxiety/panic attacks?
I ve been on a benzo before, and sometimes I have horrible panic/anxiety attacks. Besides taking a depression medication, is there a med that I can take only as needed during an attack?
Answer :
Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed for anxiety, and are taken as needed but they only treat physical symptoms. They can be dangerous.

In some states marijuana can be prescribed for anxiety.

There s a drug called Buspar which is prescribed for anxiety, and sometimes on an as needed basis.

There are other ways of dealing with panic attacks; I suggest you look into these either instead of or along with medication.
Question :
Is there a difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack?
I kno if there is a difference then i have one of them, i just dont kno which one. If there is no difference then im havin it or them...whatever
Answer :
No there is no difference. If you want to split hairs, a panic attack is the result on escalated anxiety. So by that logic, an anxiety attack is what causes the physical symptoms of a panic attack.

Rather than worry about the difference between the two, you may want to consider learning how to calm down from a Panic Attack.
