Because we have a tendency to forget, I felt that today’s article should be a reminder that Memorial Day is not the official beginning of summer and just another holiday from work.  Yes, I am a veteran so I am biased.  And, no, I am not an idealist that believes that all wars and the deaths associated with them are necessary.



I am a realist, however.  I have visited many of our national cemeteries and seen the price paid by those who served.  Whether the deaths were in the defense of our country or the result of a mandate (a call to arms) by our leadership, these men and women died and deserve to be remembered and honored.

So please, take a moment Monday and remember those who have paid the ultimate price so that we can be together with family and friends enjoying the beginning of summer.  “Lest we forget.”

The meaning of Memorial Day

Officially, Memorial Day, observed on the last Monday of May  honors the war dead.  The day was originally known as "Decoration Day" because the day was dedicated to the Civil War dead, when mourners would decorate gravesites as a remembrance.
 
The holiday was first widely observed on May 30, 1868, when 5,000 people helped decorate the gravesites of 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers buried at Arlington National Cemetery. 
 
After World War I, the observances were widened to honor the fallen from all American wars--and in 1971, Congress declared Memorial Day a national holiday.
 
Towns across the country now honor military personnel with services, parades, and fireworks.  A national moment of remembrance takes place at 3 p.m.  At Arlington National Cemetery, headstones are graced with small American flags.
 


This day is not to be confused with Veterans Day, which is observed on November 11 to honor military veterans, both alive and dead.
