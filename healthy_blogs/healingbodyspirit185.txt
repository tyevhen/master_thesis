David's daughter, Kemy, (my step-daughter) was in Park City, having flown in from Brea , California, July 3rd for a family reunion with all of her children and siblings. We were eager to see her and celebrate her 50th birthday. While we were driving up the canyon, she was water sKiing at the Jordenelle Resivoir and had a massive stroke. She was flown to University Hospital and was pronounced brain dead on July 4th.
Her wish was to donate her organs. She is gone, but others may have their life spared, prolonged or enriched because of her desire to share. .
