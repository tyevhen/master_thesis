PharmaGossip has a link to a good review regarding how atypical antipsychotics stack up to their much cheaper generic competitors. Suffice to say the review is not flattering, though I'd say it's more positive toward the atypical meds than is deserved.

Of course, I've been ranting about these overpriced, under-effective, and dangerous meds since the inception of this site in September 2006. We'll see when the results of research will be able to override the drug reps, infomercials, er, continuing medical "education", misleading journal supplements, and the like; in other words, how much research must be published showing the atypicals are overrated before prescribing practices change and serious resources are placed into researching better medications for psychosis?
