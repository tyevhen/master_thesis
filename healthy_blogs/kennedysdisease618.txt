In This month’s CostCo Connection, there is a good article written by David and Amanda Horowitz titled, “Take Care with Medicare.” It discusses the Medicare fraud issues plaguing users and our government today. Below are a few highlights from the article.

Protect yourself from Medicare fraud by taking these steps. (Note: The advice is also good for any health insurance claim)


Make sure providers are Medicare approved. Go to medicare.gov or call 1-800-633-4227 to see if the provider is approved.
Keep a record. Record your healthcare services including dates and keep the receipts. Review your Medicare (or insurance) statement of services provided and compare it to your records. If something doesn’t appear to be correct. Contact your local Senior Medicare Patrol (smpresource.org) or your provider to discuss the potential issue.
Protect your Medicare card and number. Know who you are sharing your personal information with, be on guard for potential scams, and do not give out personal or sensitive information to anyone you do not know. If you believe you lost your card or it was stolen, contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213.
Be suspicious of healthcare providers, doctors or suppliers who call and say they represent Medicare or the federal government. Or, they offer free Medicare services, or non-medical transportation or housekeeping services that are supposedly approved by Medicare. The adage, “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”
If you suspect Medicare fraud, contact Medicare immediately at 1-800-633-4227.
