Say “Cheese,” use your smile muscles. The brain can’t tell the difference between a real smile and a phony smile. Smiling and laughing both raise serotonin levels.

Walk in the sunshine or on a cloudy day get a sun tan.

Exercise-walk, swim, dance, jog, biking, jump on a mini trampoline, do Thai Chi or yoga.

The Attitude of Gratitude

For every problem under the sun,
There is a remedy or there is none.
If there be one hurry and find it—
If there be none, never mind it.

“If we realize that what we think about becomes our reality, we become very careful about what we think about.” Wayne Dyer


You cannot keep the birds of sadness
From flying over your head
But you can keep them from
Nesting in your hair.
