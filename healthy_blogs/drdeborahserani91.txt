Empty Nest Syndrome is a phrase used to explain the psychological experience of loss when a child leaves home. Often shortened to Empty Nest, parents move through feelings of sadness, loss and worries regarding their own identity since their day-to-day responsibilities have changed.

Empty Nest is most often seen in the Fall when teenagers leave for college, in Summer when kids leave for camp - but can occur anytime a child leaves home (getting married, new job, etc.)

Some parents move through the transition of children leaving home without much difficulty. Others experience bouts of weepiness, loneliness or irritability. These are very normal and natural.

If you find that time has not helped you adjust to your new life, and symptoms are worsening, it might help to seek a support group like Daily Strength Empty-Nest Support Group or consider professional help. Attachment and loss can be an overwhelming experience for some parents. Don't let the excitement of your child's new life make you feel as if you have to hide your heartache.
