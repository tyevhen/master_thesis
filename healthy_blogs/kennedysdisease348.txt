Time flies! It is hard to believe it has been seven months since I started taking dutasteride.

I was reviewing my journal this weekend. I
averaged 108 minutes of exercise every other day. The average time was down slightly because of a trip and a visitor on two occasions where I had to end the workouts early.

I still have not experienced any negative side effects.

Worth noting was that several times over the last month I commented that I had a very strong workout and I could have performed many more reps because I wasn’t tired.

Even more important in my opinion are my comments about the sustained energy level that I continue to experience. For most of us with Kennedy’s Disease, the ups and downs we experience in energy are frustrating. I have just not had any ‘down’ days. For me, that is worth the price of admission.

ASC-J9


NIH is testing the oral version of ASC-J9 on small animals. I have written about this possible treatment in several articles (see below).  J9 provides a lot of hope. It will be many months before the results are known, but I am keeping my fingers crossed.
