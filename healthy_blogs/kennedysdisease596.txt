I rarely ever do this, but for those new to this blog, I need to ask if you have visited “The Writer’s Corner”. It is my author’s website and blog. That site is focused on my books, short stories and poetry. My author’s blog is about my other world–the one not associated with Living with Kennedy’s Disease.

What makes him a man is that in the midst of the battle he does not lose himself.” For me, this battle is not over, but I need to find my ‘Self’ once again.
