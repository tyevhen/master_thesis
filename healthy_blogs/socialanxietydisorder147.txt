Maggie D. Matney researched a lot about cellulite to do his paper
There is loads of information on weight loss these days but pretty much every program tells you to do or not to do something. If you are one of the people who have been trying various different types of weight loss programs I'm certain you've seen many programs that tell you cannot eat particular sorts of food. Obviously these programs are not just about depriving you of food, but a lot of them also tell you that large amounts of exercise is required. This type of deprivation is a thing that can cause significant mood swings and also result in bingeing which defeats the goal of your diet in the first place. Many people do not realize that they have the ability of losing weight without feeling deprived of anything at all. For individuals who want to lose weight without feeling deprived we are going to be talking about a couple of things you are able to do in this post.

Question :
Since you can trip from sleep deprivation ... could the feds make it illegal?
HAHA.

If you can trip naturally this way ... then why are entheogens illegal but sleep deprivation isn t? Or fasting? Or going into trance?

Believe it or not ... I ve experienced trips before that were incredibly strong and psychedelic ... and they weren t from entheogens.

Your brain has the power ... entheogens just "unlock" it..

So why not make our brains illegal?

To make this question even MORE daring ... if you wish to ... why not share what legal thing you do that makes you trip?

I do transcendental meditation, trance work, sleep deprivation, fasting, sweat lodge, chanting, hell ... a lot of things trigger trips for me...and I LOVE it. Such a blessed gift I have.

Question :
Adrenal Fatigue - Going to the doctor - What to expect?
I ve been reading and it seems like adrenal fatigue is only curable through at-home, change in life-style type of ways.
I made an appointment to go see the doctor about it. I have been having a problem reacting to stimulants (caffeine, sports performance, etc.) and I have over 6 of the symptoms listed for adrenal fatigue.

One way it is said to be caused is from bad eating habits, sleep deprivation, etc. But I am a fitness fanatic. I eat clean, healthy & get over 7 hours of sleep. So the only way I think I could have gotten it would be from excessive use of caffeine, as my stress level isn t all that high. I do, however, get mild depression (which is a symptom).

Is there anything the doctor can prescribe to me? I don t have much as far as anxiety goes. How can I cure this quickly?
Answer :
Are you talking about ADDeral? if so the Dr. can prescribe you a different brand like ritian, etc. or prescribe you a lower dose.
Question :
Is this sleep deprivation?
I sleep okay. I just recently got on a new sleeping schedule. I go to bed at around 9 and wake up at 530 every morning. Before I went to bed at 530 and woke up at 2 in the afternoon. Right now I feel really, really, really, tired and out of it and I jist feel deprived from sleep, and I dont know why; because I m sleeping. I haven t had a good sleeping sschedule in years due to anxiety and stress, and I still deal with that everyday but take meds for it. Could I just feel this way because my body isn t use to the schedule yet?? It s confusing me. And I m worried and freaking out. :( help
Answer :
"I recently started on a new sleeping schedule."
That s your problem, and it s exactly because your body isn t used to it. The good news it your drifting towards a natural sleep schedule. You seem to be on the right track to a good sleeping schedule. If you don t feel drastically better in a little while, I would be concerned.
I would also recommend joining a gym, exercise is great for stress and it should improve your nights sleep.
