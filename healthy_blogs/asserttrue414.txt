Erwin Chargaff, working with sea-urchin sperm in the 1950s, observed that within double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine (A = T) and guanine equals cytosine (G = C), which we now know is the basis of "complementarity" in DNA. But Chargaff later went on to observe the same thing in studies of single-stranded DNA, causing him to postulate that A = T and G = C more generally (within as well as across strands of DNA). The more general postulation is known as Chargaff's second parity rule. It says that A = T and G = C within a single strand of DNA.

The second parity rule seemed to make sense, because there was and is no a priori reason to think that DNA or RNA, whether single-stranded or double-stranded, should contain more purines than pyrimidines (nor vice versa). All other factors being equal, nature should not "favor" one class of nucleotide over another. Therefore, across evolutionary times frames, one would expect purine and pyrimidine prevalences in nucleic acids to equalize.

What we instead find, if we look at real-world DNA and RNA, is that individual strands seldom contain equal amounts of purines and pyrimidines. Szybalski was the first to note that viruses (which usually contain single-stranded nucleic acids) often contain more purines than pyrimidines. Others have since verified what Szybalski found, namely that in many organisms, DNA is purine-heavy on the "sense" strand of coding regions, such that messenger RNA ends up richer in purines than pyrimidines. This is called Szybalski's rule.

In a previous post, I presented evidence (from analysis of the sequenced genomes of 93 bacterial genera) that Szybalski's rule not only is more often true than Chargaff's second parity rule, but in fact purine-loading of coding region "message" strands occurs in direct proportion to the amount of A+T (or in inverse propoertion to the amount of G+C) in the genome. At G+C contents below about 68%, DNA becomes heavier and heavier with purines on the message strand. At G+C contents above 68%, we find organisms in which the message strand is actually pyrimidine-heavy instead of purine-heavy.

I now present evidence that purine loading of message strands in proportion to A+T content is a universal phenomenon, applying to a wide variety of eukaryotic ("higher") life forms as well as bacteria.

According to Chargaff's second parity rule, all points on this graph should fall on a horizontal line at y = 1. Instead, we see that Chargaff's rule is violated for all but a statistically insignificant subset of organisms. Pink/orange points represent eukaryotic species. Dark green data points represent bacterial genera. See text for discussion. Permission to reproduce this graph (with attribution) is granted.

To create the accompanying graph, I did frequency analysis of codons for 58 eukaryotic life forms (pink data points) and 93 prokaryotes (dark green data points) in order to derive prevalences of the four bases (A, G, C, T) in coding regions of DNA. Eukaryotes that were studied included yeast, molds, protists, warm and cold-blooded animals, flowering and non-flowering plants, alga, and insects and crustaceans. The complete list of organisms is shown in a table further below.

It can now be stated definitively that Chargaff's second parity rule is, in general, violated across all major forms of life. Not only that, it is violated in a regular fashion, such that purine loading of mRNA increases with genome A+T content. Significantly, some organisms with very low A+T content (high G+C content) actually have pyrimidine-loaded mRNA, but they are in a small minority.

Purine loading is both common and extreme. For about 20% of organisms, the purine-pyrimidine ratio is above 1.2. For some organisms, the purine excess is more than 40%, which is striking indeed.

Why should purines migrate to one strand of DNA while pyrimidines line up on the other strand? One possibility is that it minimizes spontaneous self-annealing of separated strands into secondary structures. Unrestrained "kissing" of intrastrand regions during transcription might lead to deleterious excisions, inversions, or other events. Poly-purine runs would allow the formation of many loops but few stems; in general, secondary structures would be rare.

The significance of purine loading remains to be elucidated. But in the meantime, there can be no doubt that purine enrichment of message strands is indeed widespread and strongly correlates to genome A+T content. Chargaff's second parity rule is invalid, except in a trivial minority of cases.
