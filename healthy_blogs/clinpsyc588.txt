Hat tip to PharmaGossip for the summary of the New York Times story on drug companies providing funding for training doctors to resist the persuasive tactics of drug reps. Yes, you read that correctly. The following is a partial quote from PG's site:

"Medical schools in several states are boosting programs that teach doctors and students to challenge the sales pitches of drug companies and avoid being dazzled by them.

Big Pharma spends billions of dollars a year on marketing to doctors; sometimes throwing lavish events to seal the deal on certain medicines.

Critics say slick promotion is unduly influencing how drugs get prescribed, sometimes to the detriment of patients.

A small number of schools are now adding lectures and continuing education seminars aimed at persuading doctors to challenge claims made during sophisticated sales presentations.

But here's the kicker!

The money for some of the university programs about drug advertising comes from a $430 million legal settlement over promotion practices by Pfizer.

The company was accused of illegally paying doctors to prescribe its drug Neurontin for uses that had not been approved by the FDA. The settlement has so far awarded $11 million to 28 institutions."
