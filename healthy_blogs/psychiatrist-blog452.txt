I just thought I'd share a bunch of links with you, no specific theme.

The New York Times has a piece by a mom about Ritalin as a treatment for a disorder versus a academic enhancer -- I enjoyed this, and while some children really need the medication to make life work in any reasonable way, we should be questioning the use of medicine as treatment versus making someone the best they can be, at a cost.  Raising the Ritalin Generation. 

So psychoanalysis is big in Argentina.  Who knew?  I'll go have me a steak and get myself analyzed.  Do Argentines need therapy? Pull up a couch.

The media tells us that Jared Loughner is now competent to stand trial.  He has pleaded guilty to the charges against him for the Tuscon shootings, a life sentence, no death penalty.  So it's over, no trial, no insanity defense.  He still remains in a forensic hospital, but I assume he will be transferred to a prison at some point.  Here is a video on World News with Diane Sawyer.

Oh, and there was an article I wanted to comment on about a violent patient in a state forensic facility who was deemed incompetent to stand trial and one of the attorney's was quoted as saying they would keep the patient there for now, treating him with "aspirins" or whatever.  But I can't access the article without paying a fee, much less the quote, and I really just wanted to say that I think those involved in the prosecution or defense of people with major mental illnesses might like to know that we have new treatments now that sometimes work better than aspirins.  And even if they don't, the attorneys might sound  a little more sophisticated if they referred to treatments with psychotherapy and psychiatric medications, rather than aspirins.  I hear it does help headaches.  No link, I'm not sure I have my facts straight so I'm just rambling here.
