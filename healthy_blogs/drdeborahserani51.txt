Every year on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention sponsors International Survivors of Suicide Day - reaching out to thousands of people who have lost a loved one to suicide.


On November 23, 2013 conferences, supportive workshops and community walks and awareness campaigns will bring together those who have lost a loved one to suicide.

It is critical to know that bereavement following a suicide is different from the grieving after other types of deaths. Research shows that there are three significant experiences that are distinctive to survivors of suicide: 

1) Feelings of guilt and shame about not being able to prevent a loved one's death

2) The unending question “Why?” 

3) Stigma from society about the suicide.

If you are someone struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out for help. Resources are listed below. And if you are someone who lost a loved one to suicide, consider reaching out support for your loss.
