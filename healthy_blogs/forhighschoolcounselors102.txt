This year I have a senior with a learning disability who is in the preparation stage for taking one of the exams for college admissions. Even though I talk to parents and students about taking college entrance exams, I feel like a novice when it comes to assisting my own flesh and blood.  As I was sitting down tonight to help her gather free study resources, I ran across a Reddit post from students who were talking about how to prepare for the SAT or ACT.  At first I was skeptical about their preparation tips, but after researching advice from the "professionals", I found the kids were spot on!  So, what do students say about preparing for these exams?
student advice can be useful
Take numerous practice tests.
Practice with official ACT/SAT questions.
"Understand how they make easy questions look more difficult than they are and make sure you answer the question that they ask you".
 "Start early (junior year) and take the tests multiple times if you can. Almost every student will see their scores improve on their 2nd and even 3rd attempts...after the 3rd attempt, most students' scores tend to hit a plateau".
Practice with time constraints.
Don't take it...thought I would throw that one in for fun!

Although my daughter is rather nonchalant about preparing for her test,  expecting to take the SAT or the ACT without a study plan is like an athlete running a race without ever training for it! So, how much time do you need to study for the SAT or ACT?  According to FastWeb, students need at least three months to really prepare for either exam. In addition to having a good preparation plan, students need to be educated about which test they should take.

  In this post, I have included several SAT and ACT resources for you to share with your parents and students.
