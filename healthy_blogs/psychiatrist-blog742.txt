I remember when birthdays were a quiet thing. A few phone calls from first degree relatives. A couple of cards from extended family members. A special meal with family, and a couple of gifts.

Now there's Facebook.

Birthdays are have become a multi-media event. The phone rings, repeatedly, a friend drops by with a giraffe toilet paper holder, there are text messages from ....my cousin, my kid, my kid's girlfriend, a friend of my other kid, and yes, a text message from the Vision Care place where I get my contact lenses. My father-in-law sends an e-card with music. Forty of my closest friends, including people I haven't talked to since elementary school, and my prom date, wish me the best. The request to serve on yet another committee comes in an email and notes "Happy Birthday." And yes, the Vision Care place also sent a happy birthday email, complete with animated balloons. For the first time ever, my beloved sibling seems to think that writing on my Wall suffices and I don't warrant a phone call, and this year, I did not get a greeting card from the Toyota dealer.

As long as the roses and chocolate continue IRL (in real life), then count me in! When the cake turns virtual, I'm signing off.
