Who reads Shrink Rap?  We have a vague idea (we think) who comments.  But who reads it?

We took a survey years ago [Roy: 2007], I thought we should repeat it.
Please choose a single identity--whichever best describes you.

Also, I'd like to put together a list of current psychiatry blogs.  If you're a psychiatrist with a Blog, please leave us your URL in the comment section and please please give a few-word description of your blog and how long you've been posting for.

If you're not a shrink, but you know of other Shrink Blogs, please let us know that as well.
I'm only interested in active, ongoing blogs. 
Thank you!
