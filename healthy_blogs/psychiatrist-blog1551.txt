[36] . . . [37] . . . [38] . . . [All]
Sorry for the delay in getting podcasts out, folks. This one may be a bit confusing, as we recorded it prior to the new sound equipment, so it is not "new and improved". This is actually #37. So, the next one to come out will be #39 (later this week... really! :-).


December 9, 2007: #37 Poop-Out

Topics include:
SSRI Poop-out (a.k.a. tachyphylaxis). This is the phenomenon where a drug is working, then seems to wear off or stop working after some period of time. (see also How a Shrink Picks an Antidepressant, Family Intervention Overcomes Poop-Out, and Stassen's article on resilience.) (I also referred to the use of gestures when speaking.) Also discussed placebo response, light therapy, and Dinah's shpiel.

Google Ads. We discuss issues about our minimal use of ads on the blog.

Q&A from Tony. Refer back to Questions for the Doctor.

Clink's Opera Post.
