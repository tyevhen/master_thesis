The Need to Trust

As children bring their broken toys
With tears for us to mend,
I brought my broken dreams to God
Because he was my friend.
But then instead of leaving Him
In peace to work alone,
I hung around and tried to help in ways
That were my own.
At last I snatched them back and cried,
"How could you be so slow?"
"My child," he said, "What could I do?"
"You never would let go."
