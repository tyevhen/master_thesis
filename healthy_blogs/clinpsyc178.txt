Wow. I noted yesterday in a History (and Future) Lesson that Aubrey Blumsohn posted a list of scientific misconduct related goodies that occurred on various years on October 8th. Proving that October 8th was not an anomaly, he's now posted a list of scientific misconduct related events that have occurred on October 9th over the years.

His posts from the last two days are mandatory reading. In fact, I declare that the Scientific Misconduct Blog is ON FIRE! Today, I will post nothing more so that you can run to the Scientific Misconduct Blog and read the excellent posts noted above.
