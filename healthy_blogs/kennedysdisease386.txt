Things continue to go well for me. I averaged 120 minutes of exercises every other day. I continue to do a short 15 minute exercise program on the light days. The 120 minutes is up 8 minutes from my previous average. I did not have a ‘down day’ this last month. I believe that is one of the greatest benefits for me. I have not experienced any side effects that I am aware of.

Also, about a year ago we were considering have the bathroom remodeled because I was having difficulty getting into and out of the shower (4” lip). That has not been an issue since starting dutasteride.

Someone asked recently if I am stronger. I can only give a subjective response to that question since I have not been tested. I feel stronger than I did a year ago. My exercise program is longer and more intensive without any noticeable side effects. I have not fallen in the last year even though I am on my feet a lot more. I haven’t experienced what I call a ‘slide’ in a long time ... and boy is that a great feeling.

On the flip side, a friend who is also taking dutasteride is considering stopping. He wrote yesterday, “I am considering stopping it; I have had my worst 9 months ever. I have pain in my
hands which I have never had before and I generally seem to have much less energy. I know everyone can react differently but are you aware of anyone else who has stopped this medication for side effects. Any comments welcome.”

A Question:  If you have had any positive or negative experiences using dutasteride please let me know.

Soon I will have my one year review with my doctor. It will be interesting what he says and my blood tests show.
