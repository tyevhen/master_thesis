PharmaGossip has links (most recent and older, but still relevant) to what, at the very least, is an interesting mudslinging match between a controversial psychiatry "professor" (it's murky whether he is actually a professor, apparently) and Big Pharma. Dr. Sharma is accused of fraud and falsifying his academic credentials. He has, among other things, conducted trials involving antipsychotic medications and has apparently served as an investigator for several drug companies. He denies allegations and claims he is being scapegoated for drug industry failures.

A news story in the Observer from late May is also relevant and interesting.
