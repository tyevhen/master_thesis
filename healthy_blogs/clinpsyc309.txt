...according to a new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry. The authors estimate that about a quarter of depression diagnoses merely reflect people having a difficult time adjusting to a loss. In other words, people often become upset, sometimes exhibiting symptoms of depression (sadness, lack of pleasure in formerly pleasurable activities, excessive guilt, etc.), when they lose a job, a pet, etc.

The current diagnostic system does not weed out these people as not having depression. In fact, the only thing that counts as an "excuse" to have a significant number of depressive symptoms is bereavement (having a loved one die). So if you lose a job, get divorced, lose a pet, have a falling out in a relationship with a friend or family member, etc... the current system says if you have significant symptoms of depression for two weeks or more, then BAM, you're depressed.
And we all know that "depression" is predominantly treated with medications. Sure, you might get psychotherapy but the odds of receiving medication are certainly greater than getting psychotherapy. The "epidemic" of depression has been very sweet to those who sell SSRIs.

So, to summarize, tens of thousands of people who have been experiencing difficulties as a result of a loss of some sort have likely been mislabeled as depressed, likely leading to unnecessary treatment. Should real depression be treated? Yep. Should people receive "therapy" of some sort because their boyfriend/girlfriend kicked them to the curb and that's led to a rough month in their life? Hmmm...

Hat Tip: Furious Seasons. BTW, I'd like to write something waaaaaaay more insightful here, but there's only 24 hours in a day, so maybe next week??
