I received this note from one of our therapist and wanted to share it with you all. This is a self-explanatory session, and it is what Primal Therapy is about.

We started the session by the patient saying that he felt like something was preventing him from applying the business ideas he had had recently. 

I will make it short, but at some point between talking and crying he said “Around me there is plenty of what I want but I can’t get it.” Then he cried about how he was actually feeling OK inside as a child but his parents constantly diverted him from this feeling by repeatedly asking him to do things he didn’t want to do. After crying about this for a while this is what he said:

“But I am OK, I feel good, I feel sweet, soft, gentle inside. I am fine. I am OK the way I am. In adult words, it means I am rooted, I am stable. We are all looking for what we already have inside. Satisfied or dissatisfied doesn’t mean anything. I just feel OK. It is a normal feeling, not an ecstatic feeling, only an ordinary normal feeling and it’s enough. I don’t need understanding because I am understanding myself. I don’t need anything, I am OK. This is so incredible!”

There is more, and he spent most of the session exploring and feeling that deep yet normal feeling of simply being OK. 

Wow, it was incredible for me too!!!!
