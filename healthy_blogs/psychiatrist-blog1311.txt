It's been months, literally.
We've done two that haven't been posted yet-- fortunately it's psychiatry and not the Dow Jones Industrial average, or gas prices, so they're not terribly time-sensitive. But Roy didn't want to put them up as if we'd just done them, so we made a new one this evening.

Roy and I had been battling it out at Risk.
Stay tuned.....
