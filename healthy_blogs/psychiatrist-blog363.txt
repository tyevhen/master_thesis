Last week, when New York legislators approved the New York SAFE Act on gun control, several people wrote in asking us to comment on mandatory reporting of dangerous persons to state authorities.  Of course we couldn't keep quiet about such a topic, but interestingly, Clink and I had somewhat different interpretations and opinions about the legislation.  We've both written articles over on Shrink Rap News on the Clinical Psychiatry Website and I'll invite you to surf over there to read:
