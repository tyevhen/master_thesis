The US House of Representatives passed a bill (H.R.20) that encourages NIH to spend more money on PPD, recognizing it as an underfunded area of research.

Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) has been pushing this bill for 5 years or so (in honor of Melanie Stokes). (He needs to work on his blog.)

This is a really great effort. The bill goes to the Senate now. Let both of your Senators know how you feel about this bill.
