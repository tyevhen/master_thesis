If you are a technology professional or novice, YOU must consider joining #SCCHAT on Twitter.

What is #SCCHAT?
School Counselor Tweet Chat or #SCCHAT began as a collaboration on Twitter between School Counselor Blog and Scope in 2011. 

What is a Twitter Chat?
Well, first you have to be on Twitter to participate in a chat.  Next, you follow a conversation of participants who answer questions posed by the moderator using a common hash tag.  

How to Participate?
It is imperative that you sign up for a Twitter account. Once you sign up  for Twitter, it is highly suggested that you sign up for a Twitter conversation management platform like: Tweet Chat, Tweet Deck, or Hoot Suite. 

I could continue to ramble on, but Danielle Schultz, author of the School Counselor Blog, has put together a great post on how to create, log in, and follow a Twitter Chat.  So, now I will turn it over to Danielle.
