Dinah works part-time. I am a wimp. This morning, I have a meeting from 8 to 11 AM about lots of things I either don't care about or things I do care about but can't do anything to change. From 1-8, I'm scheduled to see 8 reliable patients, most of whom will show up right on time, and there's no break in there. At 8 Pm, I'm due back at another meeting which may well go to 11 PM, a follow-up on this morning's meeting about things I don't care about or things I do care about but will be unable to change. Today, and today only I hope, I will not be a wimp.

Tomorrow, I will be a wimp.
