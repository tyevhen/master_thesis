I just stumbled across this on the Amazon web site and had to post it. People have been writing lately about the effects of technology on kids, but I guess it's not that serious since we're making 'real' technology for babies now. What's next? Baby-safe web sites? Infant chat rooms? Babble blogs? (Oh what, we've got those already...)
