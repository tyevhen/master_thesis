This sounds really interesting: there's a radio play going out on BBC Radio 4 at 2.15 pm on 14th June 2016, which is about a patient subject to Sec.37/41 (I guess) who appeals to a Mental Health Tribunal. The writer, Clara Glynn, tells me she got inspiration from reading the Masked AMHP blog, so it ought to be good!

If you can't listen to it live (some of us will be at work), you'll be able to catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.


Clara Glynn (pictured) is a writer/director with extensive experience in drama and documentary production. She has written and directed a number of dramas and documentaries, including I met Adolf Eichman a documentary that won the gold medal at the New York Festival. 

I can't wait to hear it!
