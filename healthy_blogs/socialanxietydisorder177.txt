Question :
What s so great about True Blood?
I m not a hater of True Blood, but I would genuinely like to know from the fans, what is so great about it? What about it do you love? What made you watch it in the first place? What got you hooked? Do their southern accents irritate you to? The reason I ask is because I ve seen a couple of episodes and wasn t impressed. Maybe it s the southern accents that irritate me or the endless sex and lacking plot. I m no prude and probably didn t watch enough episodes to let the plot develop. I m very intrigued by the vampire premise but that s pretty much it. I value all of your opinions and thank you in advanced for the answers, it is greatly appreciated!
