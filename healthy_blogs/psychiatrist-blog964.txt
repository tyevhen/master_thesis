I was rummaging through the legal news lately when I came across a case that made me flash back to our old Cure for Fish Phobia post.

It appears that the state of Arizona has passed a law banning the use of tiny little fish for pedicures. Arizona wasn't the first either. New Hampshire decided that the fish were "beauty salon tools" that had to be cleaned in between use. Texas is concerned that the fish bowls aren't cleaned between use and could transmit disease.

Will pedicure fish now come with a black box warning? CAUTION: Fish, use only as directed. For external use only. Possible side effects may include drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, the aftertaste of sushi, syncope, seizures, coma and death. Oh yeah, and scaly skin.
