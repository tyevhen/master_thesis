I came across this one-page PDF on Kennedy's Disease on the ALS Society of Canada website.

https://www.als.ca/sites/default/files/files/Fact%20Sheets/Kennedy%27s%20Disease.pdf

This is a well thought out document providing a good deal of information on Kennedy's Disease, aka Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy. It could be printed and taken to your doctor, or the link could be shared with anyone interested.

I am hoping the KDA will development something like this. Check it out when you have a chance and let me know what you think.
