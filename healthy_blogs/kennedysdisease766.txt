The Preamble of our Constitution states, "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Tomorrow is Independence Day, Unfortunately, I have to ask what happened to our country? It appears Sir John Dalberg-Acton was right. “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

The United States is a "melting pot," a fusion of nationalities, cultures, and ethnicities - different elements "melting together" for the common good of all. 

I’m certain our foundering fathers couldn’t agree on everything. Each representative probably thought their way was the best for the country. Yet, they were able to set aside their differences and come together to create a nation. They knew the United States would not be perfect, nothing ever is. But, it would be far better than the alternatives.

They forged a nation that allows everyone 
to have an opinion
to practice their own beliefs
to disagree without fear of retaliation
These are our rights. 

Not everything has to be an “all-or-nothing” situation. Compromise shouldn’t be considered a weakness. Meeting somewhere in the middle allows for “Win-Win” situations for the common good of all.
I wish you a safe and happy 4th of July
