State swim finals are tomorrow. Fish made it into the finals in his 2 individual events. The 2 relays he is in made it into the consolations. It was a great day for him. Tomorrow we all go....My two RADishes have been having a rough go of it since Christmas. This is a pretty major set back for Taz. I'm wondering if it will take a trip to the Attachment therapist or two to get him back in gear. I usually seem to be able to handle it but seem to say all the wrong things currently. Teen RAD is tough.
