In honor of 100 years of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore cinematographer Richard Chisolm, along with Kindall Rende,  created this movie of members of the department talking about psychiatry at Hopkins.  Many of the people shown in the film have been guest bloggers on Shrink Rap, and they include our mentors, colleagues, and friends.  Both ClinkShrink and I are proud to be members of the department and we are both grateful for the education we've received, so we hope you'll spend a few minutes watching Richard's tribute.
