Remember this scene from Star Wars ?


Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.

Obi-Wan: (influencing the stormtrooper's mind) You don't need to see his identification.

Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.

Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.

Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.

Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.

Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.

Obi-Wan: Move along.

Stormtrooper: Move along. Move along.


This snippet of dialogue showing how "The Force" works is similar to the technique known as Positive Direction.

Positive Direction is a style of communication that works toward making positive behaviors happen. Don't and Stop are negative words that often fail to register as we think. Instead, it's human nature to register the words that come after the Dont's and the Stop's.

When you use Positive Direction, you give a child or an adult a positive image to attain. And there's likely to be more cooperation, less rebellion. And, well,  everyone feels good. A win-win all around.

Examples

Instead of: Don't throw your coat on the floor!
Try: Hang you coat up.

Instead of: Stop interrupting me when I'm on the phone.
Try: Wait and I'll talk to you later.

Instead of: Don't be so loud!
Try: Talk in a quiet voice.

Instead of: No, you can't go out with your friends, you have homework to do!
Try: Yes, you can see your friends when you finish your homework.


Positive Direction takes some practice, but it could be worth the time and energy.


Now, move along....
