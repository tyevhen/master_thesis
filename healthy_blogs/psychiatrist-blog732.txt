Shrink Rap is hosting our third Grand Rounds on June 21, which is the first day of Summer. In keeping with the summer solstice, we will be accepting submissions that have a theme of "hot." Use your creativity to link your post with this theme. For example, "hot" can refer to temperature, spiciness, luck, passion, anger, popularity, etc.

Our first Grand Rounds in 2007 featured a clicky brain, and the second featured the then-new iPhone 3G, complete with clicky iPhone apps. This time, we will be using clicky pictures that exemplify the "hot" theme, so submissions must have a "hot" picture (keep it PG rated, folks ;-). If you don't feel hot looking at the picture, you might want to pick another one. (We don't want to ignore the southern hemisphere, so if you live where June 21 kicks off the winter solstice, feel free to use a "cold" theme and picture.)
Submit your post on our Facebook page or on Twitter to @shrinkraproy (or email if you must; it's in the sidebar). Deadline is Sunday night.

In the meantime, stay cool!
