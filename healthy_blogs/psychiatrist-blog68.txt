Yesterday, I was a speaker at the University of Maryland's Cultural Diversity Day.
The theme was Urban Trauma: Understanding Its Impact and Navigating Access to Mental Health Care. I thought I would share some of my slides with our readers.  And now I know how to put a PowerPoint Presentation into a blog.
