Above are some pictures of a Swiss Army Knife and a tape measure, both adorned with the Zyprexa name, which can be purchased on Ebay. The Swiss Army Knife was apparently used in the Zyprexa Primary Care marketing campaign as a gift to doctors (see the documentation here). Not sure where the tape measure came from, but I'd bet it was also some sort of marketing tool.

More on the Zyprexa marketing story can be seen here, here, here, and here.
