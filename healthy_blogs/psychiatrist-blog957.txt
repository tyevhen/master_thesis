The American Psychiatric Association's Annual Meeting began on Saturday and goes through to Wednesday.  Lots of great talks here.  I'm trying to learn a lot more about TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), for one.  There have been a number of talks on the use of social media, as well, including the use of blogs, facebook, and twitter.


I'll post more soon, but just wanted to give our readers a heads up on the meeting.  Also, you can follow the twitter stream on tweets from the meeting on TweetChat using the hashtag #APANOLA2010.  A stream of these tweets is in our sidebar for the rest of this week, and is also below in this post.
