Our regular podcast listeners know that the Shrink Rappers love to bicker. The topic doesn't matter: Xanax, allocation of health care resources or punctuation, if there's a potential for argument we will have one. Some of our reviewers commented that the bickering makes them uncomfortable or is embarrassing to listen to. All I can say to those listeners is: we've always been this way, we're never going to change and we wouldn't do it if it weren't fun for us.

Everybody probably knows someone who likes to debate. If you say one thing, they'll say something different just for the sake of having a discussion and engaging someone. It's a relationship thing, like talking about the weather. Nobody really cares if it's sunny or too hot or if there's a storm approaching, it's just a way of maintaining a connection. For some people, bickering serves the same function.

I appreciate a good debate occasionally because this keeps me sharp mentally. When someone tells me I'm wrong I question my assumptions, do some homework and learn something. My bickering friend learns something too (I hope). If the debate goes on too long or gets uncomfortable, I disengage or admit that I'm too tired to continue. It's not a big deal. People who maintain relationships with bickerers can't be too sensitive. There's nothing personal about it, it's just a way of life.

And by the way, Dinah was right: the period goes inside the quotation marks. Dinah effectively affected a change in my writing affectation. Can you guess what her writing quirk is??

Affectionately yours,
