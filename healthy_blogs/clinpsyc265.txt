Philip Dawdy at Furious Seasons has started a contest where readers can throw in their bid for naming the newly christened version of bipolar disorder currently known as "subthreshold bipolar disorder." SBD sounds pretty lame, so I am quite excited about this new event. Please feel free to add it your two cents here. Background on this story here, here, and here.

For my vote, can we go with DUMBASS-$ (Diagnosing Usually Mundane Behavior As Seroquel Scripts $oar) That's my off-the-cuff take, but others have already offered much better. Sigh...
