Thank you, kindred spirit! The knowledge you have shared so unselfishly will always be at my disposal. I haven’t felt this good for so long. Just knowing there is at least something to do other than dwell in the spiral. I am buying all of your books. I've been looking for somewhere to start this is it! T. G.

Dear T. G.
