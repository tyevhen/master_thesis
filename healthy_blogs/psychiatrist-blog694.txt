I've been thinking we should start a Clinical Encounters series where psychiatrists can write in with cases and other psychiatrists could give opinions-- all anonymous, of course.  Clink and Roy aren't so sure this is a good idea (or they are sure it's a bad idea!) but I thought I would try a preview with my own confabulated encounter and ask for your insights---this one is open to everyone.  It's an altered version of something that happened to a shrink friend of mine many years ago, so while the details are disguised, the uneasiness of the situation is not.  


Dr. Mind is a psychiatrist in private practice who is having an embarrassing little problem and he goes to see a urologist.  He needs a procedure, something quick that can be done in the office on an outpatient basis.  In comes the nurse to assist Dr. Phallus, the urologist, and the nurse greets Dr. Mind with a smile.  Ah, she is a former patient of Dr. Mind-- the now very vulnerable patient who does not want this nurse/ex-patient of his in the room to have any part of his procedure or rather sensitive body parts.  He's in quite the pickle here: He's the patient and he has his feelings to consider, but he can't exactly divulge to Dr. Phallus, "Your nurse was my patient and I don't want her here"-- complete with any incriminating things he might know: she's got a drug problem, she told me stories about her treatment of patients that made me cringe...or she's a wonderful person but he just doesn't want her here.  

Your thoughts on how Dr. Mind should handle this?
