Yesterday’s KDA chat room chat was interesting.  Our topic was “What works for you?”  I asked, “What have you found that helps improve your quality of life?”



Some of the items (some big and some small) that have been instrumental in improving the quality of my life are:
Jar/bottle opener – Without this little instrument I would be asking my wife for help all the time.
Bed pedestals – This elevates the bed to a good height for easier exiting.
Adjustable height shower stool – I love my showers and they would not be safe without this stool.
Removable grab bars for the shower – Safety is ‘job #1’ at our house.  And, if you are traveling somewhere, take them with you.
Wheelchair’s elevated seat – This helped make life a lot easier. It is easier to stand up and also allows me to be closer to eye-level height when visiting.
VMI equipped van – I am now safer and freer to travel alone.
Tallette – I never go anywhere without this because commode heights are way to low.
Recliner with elevated seat – Without this I would have to spend a lot more time in my wheelchair.
Rechargeable screwdriver and socket set – Lightweight, but very handy.  It allows me to still do a lot of repairs and maintenance.
Golf cart – This allows me to visit neighbors, get outdoors and commune with nature, and take my dog for walks several times a day.
Now it is my turn to ask for you to take a few moments  to let me know, “What have you discovered that makes your quality of life safer and better?”  In other words, “What works for you?”
