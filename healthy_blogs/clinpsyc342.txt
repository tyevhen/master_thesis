California House Representative Henry Waxman, in his role as chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has requested information from Lilly and AstraZeneca regarding their marketing of antipsychotics Zyprexa and Seroquel, respectively. AZ was further asked to provide information regarding its marketing of Actiq, a narcotic lollipop (!) and Fentora, a narcotic lozenge.

Information regarding the safety and purported off-label use of drug coated stents from Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson was also requested.
I’d like to point out that bloggers, including Philip Dawdy, myself, and Roy Poses, have written about the shenanigans associated with Zyprexa’s marketing while the major news outlets (except the New York Times) have remained stunningly silent. Perhaps Waxman’s latest move will revive the brain dead media from the fascination with Anna Nicole Smith, Britney Spears, and other stories that are completely unworthy of journalistic attention.
What, is that a blond celebrity with her breasts becoming unhinged from her top? Zy-what? Sero-who? Ugh.
