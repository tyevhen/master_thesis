At least once a year I write an article about this important subject.  And, yesterday, while reading a book, I saw the following quote.

“The only thing potentially worse than not being able to see the forest for the trees is not being able to see the trees because of the forest.”  Anonymous


I loved this quote because it is so true.  We often become blinded with the little knowledge we have and miss important factors concerning our health.  This often happens because we just believe or want to associate most health issues with Kennedy’s Disease.

Twice in the last week I have received emails from men that related symptoms that are not normally associated with Kennedy’s Disease.  I am happy men are asking rather than ignoring the symptoms.

So, let me say it again.  “Do not assume that every health issue is related to Kennedy’s Disease.”  Consult with your family doctor and neurologist whenever a new symptom shows up that is not normally associated with this health condition.

In 2009 I wrote about this:  Not Everything is Related to KD 
Again in 2010 I addressed the issue in this article:  Frequently Asked Questions
And  early this year I again reminded my readers:  Not Every Health Issue is Related to KD 

Each article takes a little different spin on the same subject.  The message can be reduced to seven words …


When in doubt … have it checked out!
