Happy first day of October everyone! October is my favorite month because I love (normal) October weather here in Minnesota. And who can argue with Halloween? 

This last week was uneventful. My newly rearranged schedule worked out, and I managed to make all of my scheduled goals for the week. Work is going well, and I got lots read and lots published on my blog. 

On my blog, I published notes on chapter 2 and chapter 3 of How to Read the Bible, by James Kugel, which I'm reading in preparation for my Bible Group Read next year. I also published a review of Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, by Robert Sapolsky.

Watched: Tremors and the third season of Castle





Currently Reading: How to Read the Bible, by James Kugel; Stiletto, by Daniel O'Malley; and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J. K. Rowling. Yes, I know, they're the same books I've been reading for two weeks. And at the rate I'm going, they'll probably be the books I'm reading next week, too.
