Memorial Day was designated as a National Day of Remembrance by Congress because it seemed that so many people had forgotten the true meaning of Memorial Day.

Memorial Day is a day when we remember and honor soldiers who have served our country and who gave the ultimate sacrifice of their lives.

As a National Day of  Remembrance, we're asked on Memorial Day to pause at 3 PM to quietly remember those who died.  It is a small thing to ask for those who gave so much.
