Dear AB Curtiss


I have recently been fascinated with physiology. Everything you can do to your brain you can almost literally be a superhero. I starting look up stuff to mess with myself, I started with making myself crave different things. Then I looked into depression and read an article you wrote. I have a little depression and I wanted a trick and the nursery rhythm worked!! Though the article was short it supported a few of your books("Depression is a Choice"). I can't wait to get my hands on this book. I don't like reading much so it's a lot for me to say. I just gotta get a hold of it without my mom knowing or she will freak out.... Thanks a bunch again!

Sincerely,
A
