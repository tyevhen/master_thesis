I've gone on a little endocannabinoid paper feast so I should have some more entries about that up soon.  Very interesting stuff, very complicated and interrelated with everything, and a zillion papers from the last several months, so cutting edge too.  The sort of system you don't want to screw up if you can help it.

In the mean time, you might have noticed my "Donate" button added to the right there.  I held off adding one for a while but it seemed like the right time now that there are a couple of options to give people.  If you feel this website is of value to you, feel free to donate - if you don't want to donate but still want to support the site financially, click though my blog at Psychology Today.  I've already received a few donations and they are much appreciated!  The textbooks do add up - I don't anticipate these websites or endeavors to break even in the near future (if ever),  but every little bit helps it to be less of a financial drain on the family.  That said, the intellectual value to me from doing the work for the site and the participation and back and forth of ideas in the comments is really invaluable.

Thanks so much!
