Is sugar Causing your Child's Tantrums
Today’s post is coming about an hour after one of the worst tantrum’s I have experienced as a parent. It is a type of tantrum that does not happen often; however, I have seen it before and it comes with the same cycle of events every time. The one thing that is directly related to this tantrum is – sugar.

Sugar can cause a yeast overload even in toddlers and that can cause all sorts of behavior problems.
