The purpose of Menâ€™s Health Month is to increase the awareness of preventable health problems and encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys. 

This awareness month encourages health care providers, public policy makers, the media, and individuals to encourage men and boys to seek regular medical advice and early treatment for disease and injury.
