There is now a site that will issue movie-like ratings to blogs, and as you can see, I'm G-rated. I've never been called G-rated in my life! Not sure if this is a sign of my site being "family friendly" or if this means that I need more profanity, nudity, and cocaine on my site...

Hat tip to the R-rated Scientific Misconduct blog and the PG-13 rated Pharmagossip. I'd like to congratulate Philip Dawdy at Furious Seasons for his NC-17 rating.
