It has been 3 1/2 months since I have posted any blog or anything. It has been a very busy 3 months and I have been beginning some new professional en devours while I have been gone. In the coming months I will be teaming up with another organization that brings the world of social media and social work together. Until that is solidified and complete I hope to continue what I started on this blog which was to educate the masses about social work and psychology in our everyday lives. So with that I say get ready, get set and jump on(again) and roll with this Blog.

Thank you for your support!
