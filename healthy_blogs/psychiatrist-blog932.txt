Katina writes to us from onlinecolleges to let us know about a post on which jobs are the top ten most depressing:

Check it out here: 10 Professions with the highest levels of depression.

What I found to be interesting is that the assumption is that the jobs cause the depression.
For example:

Social Workers: If you had to deal with abused children, unkind foster parents and less than stellar family dynamics all day, you might be depressed too. Those working in this field are three times more likely to be depressed than the general population, and many are so focused on helping others they don't get the help that they need themselves.

There's nothing in the post that addresses the chicken-or-egg? question. Maybe people with depression are drawn to certain fields. Artists are listed, with the statement that those who chose to work in the field "found it depressing." And everyone kind of gets it: doctors, nurses, social workers, lawyers, artists, janitors, food service people, finance, nursing home and childcare workers. What's left? What's the depression rate among bloggers?
