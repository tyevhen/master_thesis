Graham Lee, someone living with Kennedy’s Disease, posted a link to Medscape, another resource on our condition, on the KD-UK Facebook page. Many years ago, I visited Medscape, but found it lacking on information concerning Kennedy’s Disease. The reason could have been that Medscape shows it as Kennedy Disease (no 's). If you search for SBMA, Kennedy's Disease, or anything similar, it won't provide any information.:-)



The information found on Medscape isn’t new to most of us, but it is comprehensive and I found it to be an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA).



If you haven’t visited this resource recently, check it out. I believe these pages would be an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about this condition.
