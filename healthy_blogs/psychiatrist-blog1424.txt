Check out the Wall Street Journal Health Blog-- Thanks to Scott Hensley for writing about those mean psychiatrists. Most aren't, just so you know. But Cruella.....

My 15 minutes of Blog Fame, though I am quite glad that Cruella is well-disguised.

The Shrink Rappers are off to APA. The blog may be quiet for a few days.

Note to my co-bloggers: Clink, all my emails to you bounce back. And I dropped my phone into the toilet tonight...the SIM card is saved and I could transfer it, so you can call me, but most of my numbers haven't transferred, and I haven't figured out how to text on the temp phone. Call if you need me.
