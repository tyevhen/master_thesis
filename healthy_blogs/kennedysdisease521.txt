Every summer the Kennedy’s Disease Association begins accepting research grant proposals.  The actual grant(s) are awarded in the fall of each year.

Concept:
Because the KDA is relatively small and funding is limited, our focus in recent years has been to provide “seed-money” to post-doc and other young researchers who do not currently have the funding or credentials to receive funding from larger organizations such as the National Institute of Health or the MDA. This “seed-money” normally provides the researcher an opportunity to further his/her research while giving him/her time to apply for other grants

Process:
In recent years, the awarding process takes place in the fall. In the late summer, the KDA announces to all known Kennedy’s Disease Researchers that anyone interested should send in their grant requests as outlined in the proposal notification.  The Scientific Review Board reviews all applications with a focus on research projects that are specific to or could be used in finding a treatment or cure for Kennedy’s Disease.  The Scientific Review Board recommends to the Board of Directors which applicant(s) should receive research funding.  The Board of Directors notifies all candidates and awards the grants normally in October.

2013 Research Grants
The Kennedy’s Disease Association (KDA) is planning to fund one or more research grants in the fall of 2013 to further the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of Kennedy’s Disease.  The KDA projects that funding for each grant will be up to $25,000 and, in certain circumstances, could be funded for a second year at a similar amount.  Applications from junior investigators and from senior post-doctoral fellows are encouraged.

Submission requirements, dates and proposal guidelines can be found in the attached PDF: 2013 Grants-PDF or WordDoc file: 2013 Grants-doc .  If you cannot open either of these files, please let the KDA know.
