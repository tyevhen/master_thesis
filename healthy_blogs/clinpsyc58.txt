I've read on and off about brain shrinkage being linked to antipsychotics. I have not paid a lot of attention to research on the topic but kept it on my mental backburner. And now Furious Seasons notes that Nancy Andreasen is reporting that her research shows antipsychotics are strongly linked to brains getting smaller. The longer one takes these drugs, the smaller the brain. Does anyone want to set up a YouTube "This is your brain on drugs" video?

Interestingly, a group of researchers has claimed that olanzapine (Zyprexa) has "neuroprotective" qualities; it's good for your brain. Um, color me skeptical. Their research was based on rats, whereas Andreasen's work is on humans. Andreasen's latest work is not yet published, making it difficult to judge the quality of the findings. But research on monkeys exposed to antipsychotics found that:
In conclusion, chronic exposure of non-human primates to antipsychotics was associated with reduced brain volume.
I am not a neuroscientist, but if both sets of findings were accurate, then we'd have people taking antipsychotics who have smaller but better brains. The more neuroscientifically inclined may wish to comment on this possibility, because it seems a little odd to me.
