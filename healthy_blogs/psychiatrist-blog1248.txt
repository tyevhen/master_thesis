It occurred to me recently that most of us carry a fair about of memory devices around in our pockets, purses, and belts.  I pointed out to Dinah at dinner recently my new 16GB thumb drive (Buy.com, $25).  After making some sort of dirty crack, I realized that I typically carry around over 40GB of memory on my person (new 16gig thumb drive, old 8gig thumb drive, 1GB thumb drive on keychain, 16GB iPhone 3G, and my Treo has a 500MB flash memory card in it).

So, I want to know... How many gigs are in YOUR pocket?
Let us know below.  Then post a picture of your gigs to Flickr, using the tag "gotgigs".  I'll put the pics here (as soon as I figure out how to do a flickr gadget).
