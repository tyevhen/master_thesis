My presentation with Jamie is this afternoon at 1:55 pm at Rolfe Hall.  Bigger post with pictures laterâ€¦ yesterday I was thrilled to meet (or meet again) seemingly most of the Paleoblogosphere, including Jamie Scott, Melissa McEwen, Chris Masterjohn, John Durant, Stephan Guyenet, Mark Sisson, Paul and Shou-Ching Jaminet, Dave Csonska, Andrew from Evolvify, Denise Minger, Richard Nikoley, Mike and Mary Dan Eades, Robb Wolf, Brent Pottenger, Jimmy Moore, and a bunch of other amazing people.  From the looks of them, they practice what they preach (everyone really looked terrific.)

I'll see many of you (perhaps) around UCLA today.
