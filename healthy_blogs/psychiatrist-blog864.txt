Week 5: Sunil - Frances - Jesse - Adele
 Paul is upset that Adele doesn't have any Motrin to treat his headache. Adele doesn't recall his son's name fast enough. On the scoreboard, Adele is losing.

Paul gets up and walks around the room. Adele wants him to sit. He doesn't, at least not at first. He tells her a little about his patient, "You know what's going on here, it's perfectly obvious." But she doesn't. He wants her suggestions and Adele doesn't want to be both therapist and supervisor.

Paul talks about Max (his son, not my dog). He makes a lot of assumptions about....everything. Adele sums up the session by telling Paul that he has been pushing her to take care of him. She cites the evidence to prove her case.
