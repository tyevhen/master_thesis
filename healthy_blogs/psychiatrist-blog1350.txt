So what, exactly, does the term "lock down" mean to you?

From time to time, dear ClinkShrink tells me the prison or the hospital or her kitchen is on "lock down." She says this so matter-of-factly that I've never pressed for details. Hmmmm, did the garlic try to escape? Can you leave if you want? What if someone has to go to the bathroom? Where is your cell phone during this process? What if your meter runs out? How long is the longest a lock down can last? Is everyone locked down? To what?

I have visions. This doesn't sound good. If ClinkShrink weren't so matter of fact, I'd worry, but she never does.

What images does Lockdown conjure up for you?
