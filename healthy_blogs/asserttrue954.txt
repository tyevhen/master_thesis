JSViews is a Firefox plugin that does a code-dump (into one or more new browser windows) of remote ".js" code referenced by any web page. I don't know yet what the limitations are, but it's definitely a worthwhile plugin. I recommend you install it right now, restart Firefox, go to http://www.cnn.com, right-click on the page, choose View External JS, and watch about a dozen Javascript source-view windows open (some containing ad-tracker code).
