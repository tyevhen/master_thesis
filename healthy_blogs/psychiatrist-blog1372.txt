Wow, almost three weeks since my last post. Life has moved quickly, but all for the better. Roy has his new iPhone, Max has a new bandana (quite attractive for a dog), and I have a new job. Here is my favorite quote from orientation:
"The people here are dangerous, no if's, and's or buts about it. It's a fun job, though."
Hard to beat an introduction like that. And it's true that security was called to the wards twice in one day during my first week. It's also true that I think this is going to be fun.

More later. I'm still catching my breath.
