This is the third year that our school will celebrate College Colors Day. College Color Day is a yearly event where students and staff are encouraged to wear their favorite college team colors to celebrate the college experience. This year's events at our school include:
a luncheon tailgate for the front office staff hosted by our peer helpers;
a staff door and student locker decoration contest (our principal is giving $50 to the winner of the locker contest);   
creating a staff bulletin board called "My College" that shows where each staff member attended school;
decking out the lunchroom with college pennants.
Signing students up to talk live with a representative via College Week Live.  College Week Live is a great event to promote and advocate for higher education among your high school students.
