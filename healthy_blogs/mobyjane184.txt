Dear A. B.


Thank you so much for replying so thoughtfully to my message. Your books have helped me so much. My sister gave me her copy of Brainswitch and I love it. At first, when you wrote that I was
probably very angry that my life wasn't working out the way I wanted, I was taken aback. I never think of myself as angry but I guess I am. .Some things in life cannot be willed or forced...like the big ones. I want...marriage and family. And it definitely bothers me that it has come easily to friends and not to me.

I am really going to take your advice to heart. I'm going to join a toast masters group because I am doing a toast at my sister's wedding. And I am going to take French classes so that I can pursue my dream of working in Africa with Doctors without Borders. And, I'm going to take art classes because I love art and miss it.

Meanwhile, I'm just living minute by minute...praying a lot, talking to my family a lot, being fully present and compassionate with my patients...and planning to not spend much time alone until I feel better. With some searching and being present, I hope my next step in life will be a good one.

Thank you so much for your kindness and help. T.

Dear T,

Sounds like you are headed in a very positive direction. A. B. Curtiss
