A year ago, I started this blog with an invitation to come together to celebrate midlife and beyond.

I had no idea what blogging would be like.

Oh, I had certain goals. My literary agent wanted me to blog to increase my online presence.

I wanted to find my own voice again as a writer after more than forty years of writing to assignment and to varying formulas.

In preparation for writing a memoir, I wanted to practice (and increase my comfort level) with writing in the first person after many years of keeping my own stories inside -- first as a journalist, then as a psychotherapist.

In preparation for writing a book about my therapy cats, I wanted to try writing occasionally about cats -- my own and others -- in a way that was heartfelt but not cloying.

To varying degrees, I've realized those objectives.

But there has been so much more.

I had no idea that my readership would be world-wide.

I had no idea how many wonderful writers, thinkers, humorists and new friends were in the blogosphere.

I had no idea how much I would come to treasure each one and the warmth of the blogging community.

I had no idea how much fun it would be!

I had no idea that blogging would come to be a pleasant and worthwhile experience on its own instead of merely a stepping stone to another goal.

I had no idea how much I would look forward to another year of blogging.

Thank you all for making this past year such a pleasure! I look forward to many more shared thoughts, stories and adventures in the next year!
