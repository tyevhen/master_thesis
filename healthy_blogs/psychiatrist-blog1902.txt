The Medical Blog Network took a survey in the past few months on the "healthcare blogosphere", asking bloggers why they do that thing that they do. The results are available as a pdf. (Note that the surveyor, Envision Solutions, cautions that the results are not scientific (wasn't randomized) and should not be generalized all healthcare bloggers.)
about 200 healthcare bloggers (>30% of posts are health-related) participated
3/4 were from US
about evenly split by gender
21% were physicians, 7% patients, 5% nurses
majority are age 30-50
Some notable figures:
39% blog anonymously
about half spend 1-2 hours/day on it
one-fourth accept advertising, while half are willing to do so
the group was split on how ads may affect perceived credibility, though most feel the credibility of the particular blogger outweighs any potential negative impact from ads
11% get paid to blog
20% have more than 500 unique visitors/day
more than half have been at it for less than a year
10% spend at least 3 hours/day (must be the ones getting paid?)
