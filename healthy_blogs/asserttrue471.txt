Eli Lilly Sales Organization backgrounder.

Weight gain and diabetes are among the small-print risks for all major atypical antipsychotic medications now. But not all atypicals are equal. What patients knew intuitively is now established scientifically: Lilly's Zyprexa produces the worst weight gain of all of the major atypicals. You don't have to dig through the medical literature to find out how bad the situation is. Just ask a friend. Or if you don't have any friends on Zyprexa, go online to the health forums, or to YouTube, where you won't have any trouble locating people who've gained 25% or more in body weight from taking Zyprexa.

Just for fun, you might want to hear how these drugs are sold to doctors. The  video below is by a guy who sold Zyprexa for a living. Have a listen. The spin job begins with Corporate, funnels down through Sales, reaches your doctor, and ends with (guess who?) you.
