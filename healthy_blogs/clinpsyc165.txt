Wow. I've recently seen a study on aripiprazole (Abilify) that boggled my mind. It was in the category of godawful. I'll be writing more about it, likely within the next few days. Stay tuned. It goes to show that Bristol Myers Squibb will stop at nothing to market their product, but I suppose their recent large settlement for naughty marketing of Abilify already indicated they had no qualms in how they pimped their product.

The atypical antipsychotics keep taking a beating on this site (1, 2) -- lots of hype for these medications treating, um, everything, yet little supporting data.
