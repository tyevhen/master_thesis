Why does blogger ask this? 
 Do I look like a robot?
 Do I act like a robot? 
 Do I sound like a robot? 
 NO!
 Why?  Because I am not a robot.

I'm sorry the "Prove You're Not a Robot" demand for blog commenters is sometimes hard to complete.  Unfortunately, this is a blogger issue, and not something we control.  It makes Shrink Rappers prove we are not robots as well, and sometimes I find the mere implication a bit annoying.
Oh, but it was fun writing this post.
