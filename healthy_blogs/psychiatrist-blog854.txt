Week 6: Sunil - Frances - Jesse
Frances continues to be flirtatious and provocative. She insists that Paul open and read her cancer gene results, just as she tried to get him to run play lines with her, but this time he bites. The results are negative. They are both relieved, but the sparring continues.

Frances remains jealous that her daughter wants to be with her dying sister, Patricia (Paul's former patient of 20 years ago).

Last night, Frances had sex for the first time since her husband left her, with a man 20 years her junior. She seems to enjoy giving Paul the details.

And what happened between you and my sister, Frances asks Paul. She says you were in love with her. Were you? If Paul's not provoked by this, maybe he can see it through.

Frances isn't going to see her dying sister. Paul tries to explore this and he finally tells her, point blank, that she needs to go see her sister before she dies or she will regret it forever. This as he chases her to the door.

Why are Paul's patients always storming off with him on their tail?
