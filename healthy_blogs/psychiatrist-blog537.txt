I read today in BusinessWeek about an L.A. startup called Therapick.com, that makes short videos of therapists being interviewed about their practice and style, and allows people to search for therapists based not only on the usual location, insurance, and gender, but also on those intangible qualities best gleaned from a video.

Here's their pitch:

Finding a therapist is a personal experience. On Therapick, you can search videos, read profiles, and email therapists you might want to work with. If you don't like the vibe of a psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist, move on to the next one. It's that simple. Our videos let you choose.

We've interviewed hundreds of licensed psychotherapists in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, the Bay Area, and many other popular cities to give you the best selection for individual, couples, and family counseling in the United States. Whether you're looking for psychotherapy, marriage counseling, or even hypnosis, Therapick's videos give you a better sense of who a therapist is before going in for your first visit.
Sounds like an interesting idea. What do you all think?
