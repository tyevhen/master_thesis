Doc Gurley did something pretty cool for this week's Grand Rounds -- a LIVE edition.  Click on the image to go to her post and listen to GR... or you can read it there, as well.

Interesting or shrinky topics: dating site for folks with mental illness; how to tweet your next conference; "what if real life were like health care?" (this one by Doc Rob is pure brilliance); long-term outcomes of deep brain stimulation (Dr Shock); what's the ICD9 code for saving the whales? (Cockroach Catcher); and the ICD-10 code for Insect bite of anus, Initial encounter (S30.867A).
