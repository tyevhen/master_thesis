Our brain originally has been hard-wired to detect danger. Did you know that when an individual is under chronic stress, their brain is so engaged in producing the Neurochemicals needed to sustain the Fight of Flight response that it is unable to access the Prefrontal Cortex (the thinking part of the brain). To sustain this "Neurochemical dump" the brain generates electromagnetic surges in specific areas, therefore until this surging is decreased the Neurochemicals will continue to be produced. To address this we can use medication to pump more and different Neurochemicals into the brain OR use Neurofeedback that actually retrains the brain to reduce this electromagnietic surging so naturally the brain senses the additional Neurochemicals are not needed any longer, it will smoothen the hard-wiring...
