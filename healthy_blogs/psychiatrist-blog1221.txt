The National Alliance on Mentally Ill Mental Illness came out with their report card on how each state is taking care of mental health issues. The national average is a big, fat D. As the kids would say, "epic FAIL!".

Only 6 states scored a B (sorry, no A's): Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Oklahoma. Nice to see in Maryland we moved from a C in 2006 to a B.

What prevents us (all states) from doing better?
