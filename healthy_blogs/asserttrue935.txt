The IBM Systems Journal is one of those rare publications that you wish would come out more frequently (just the opposite of drain-clogs like eWeek, which I wish would come out half as often). The journal's content is uniformly excellent, and the subject matter frequently delights. Such is the case with Volume 45, Number 1, 2006, devoted entirely to (of all things) Online Game Technology.
