Good posts that warrant your attention include:
In terms of efficacy, antidepressants + mood stabilizer = placebo + mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder according to a new study. I've not yet read it, so I'll refer you to Furious Seasons for an analysis (1, 2).
Oh, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). It seems like nary a week goes by without some sort of serious ethical/corruption issues rear their ugly heads. For more on the situation, check out Health Care Renewal. Maybe that's why Lilly partnered with them to create a Center of Excellence for Psychiatry?
