Why wonâ€™t people listen?

I keep on telling them I donâ€™t need it. I donâ€™t want it. And, to keep it. But, they wonâ€™t listen.

My wife came down with some kind of crud (cold?) and it really nailed her. I told her, I didnâ€™t want it. But, no, she just had to share. It is day three and it is not pretty. If she wanted to share something, why not her health?

My daughter, who lives in Minnesota, has ridiculously cold weather right now. I told her to keep it. But, no, she sent is anyway. it arrived and this next week will be 20-30 degrees below normal for the entire week. If she wanted to share something, why not her time â€“ a visit would be a lot better than the freezing cold.

I donâ€™t consider myself a complainer, but I go out of my way to avoid people that are sick. Yet, it is hard to avoid your wife. ðŸ˜‡

And, since cold temperatures do a job on my muscles, I moved south to avoid it. Whatâ€™s all the flack about global warming? It feels like the beginning of the ice age.

Iâ€™m done complaining. Back to my normal PMA.
