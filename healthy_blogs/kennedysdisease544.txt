The new health insurance program being implemented will impact many Americans â€“ some positively and some negatively. Some of the information available has changed substantially over the last year as states have adopted the new program or rewrote their current programs. I also believe programs and regulations will continue to change over the next few years as the program is rolled out.

NORD, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, has added a new section to its website that provides health insurance and related information. This resource will list information for each state and will be updated as new information is made available.

Open enrollment in the state marketplaces begins October 1, 2013.
