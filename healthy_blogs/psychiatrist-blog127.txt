I need  your help.  This year at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in Toronto, I will be talking on what adds 'value' to mental health care from the patient perspective.  It's a symposium, and the other speakers will be approaching the issue from the perspective of the insurance company, the hospital, employers, and looking at things like quantifiable measurements of success measured with standardized tools and how to recognize waste in the systems.  I won't be talking about standardized tools.

So I need input.  If you're a  health professional and you've never seen a psychiatrist as a patient, please don't answer.  I want to hear what people see as 'value in mental health care' straight from a patient's perspective.  

Some possible questions include those below, but please feel free to tell me what you value about your mental health care.

 I'd like to hear what experiences and outcomes make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth?    
Why do you go to treatment?
What are you looking to get from it?
Do you have specific goals that you'd like to see measured by objective criteria?
Have you ever seen a psychiatrist for treatment, gotten better from your disorder, and yet not valued the care? Why?
Do you like that insurers and providers are looking at what makes for good value, meaning the best outcomes for the lowest cost?
In short: what makes for a good experience with a psychiatrist?  You can also tell me what makes for a bad experience.
While I've got you here, do you value having your psychiatric chart in an electronic medical record?
