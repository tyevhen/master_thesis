After reading Suzanne Shaffer's blog on the top 25 counselors for parents to follow, I was inspired to create my own top high school counselor twitter list.  In my opinion, my list consists the 35 most active high school counselors and counselor educators on twitter.  In fact, most of these pages have 1,000 or more tweets available for you to find resources and information.  I hope you will find their twitter pages as interesting as I do!!

Enjoy!!
