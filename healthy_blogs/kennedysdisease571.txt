“Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference”
Winston Churchill 

Anyone that follows my blog knows that I am an advocate of maintaining a positive attitude. In my opinion, ‘living with’, rather than just surviving, Kennedy’s Disease is 90% mental. Quest Magazine published an article, Accentuate the Positive, by Christopher Anselmo, that I recommend. He does an excellent job of showing how he ‘lives with’ his condition.

Mr. Anselmo provides six tips that everyone should note. To wet your appetite, I’ve provided his first tip below.

“1. Figure out what disability will never take away.
With a late-onset disease, you lose the ability to do many things — run, lift heavy objects, climb stairs, eventually even walk. It is impossible from time to time not to dwell on what you have lost. But my biggest regret looking back was wasting time lamenting what I was no longer able to do. Things only began to turn around for me when I took an afternoon and literally wrote a list of what I still could do:
I can love.
I can laugh.
I can make others laugh.
I can write.
I can go back to school.
I can make a difference in the lives of others.
Disability will never take any of this away from me. (What would be on your list?)”

Please, read the article. I know you will find several thoughts worthwhile and worth considering.
