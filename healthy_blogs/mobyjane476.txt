Yesterday I was talking about wanting as, perhaps, the antithesis of despair. This morning I had only a tinge of depression kind of like a stain left over from yesterday which hid in the brain shadows and ventured out. ZAP! It was easily dispelled with a moment or two of "1,2,3,4 who are we for" exercise. Then, before I got up, I lay in bed a few minutes and thought a bit about wanting. Maybe it was, indeed, a possible mood changer to think about wanting something.

Then I realized that it was important to want something you already have, rather than wanting something you don't have. Wanting something you don't have is a bit stressful. Wanting, or desire, as a kind of fear to get you going is a bit different. It's okay to want something you don't have in order to put a fire under yourself to strive to do better to attains your goal. And it's good to have goals. But wanting what you already have is a gratitude that puts you in a nice place to start the day and wouldn't be a bad thing to think about more often.
