Stolen from the Hopkins Mental Disorders YouTube site, Dr. Peter Rabins, co-author of The 36 hour Day, talks about how to figure out if you have dementia.  Note to ClinkShrink who always teases me: losing your keys (and presumably your cell phone) is not a symptom of depression.  Clinically, what I hear most is that people have trouble retrieving words, and this is usually associated with normal aging or with medications, not as a typical early symptom of Alzheimer's Disease.
