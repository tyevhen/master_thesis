Into The Wild is the true story of Christopher McCandless - a twenty two year old man, who decided to leave everything and everyone behind to travel across the United States to live in the Alaskan wilderness.


Many saw his story as an idealistic journey but I wondered if something more was going on. I wondered if some of his behaviors were similar to individuals experiencing Schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia frequently surfaces in late adolescence, often making its impact in college age individuals. It is an illness that distorts the ability to think clearly, and is often accompanied by hallucinations &/or delusions, among other symptoms. Schizophrenia is generally stereotyped. Versions of maniacal people cringing in paranoia or hiding in shadows are never accurate depictions. I couldn't help but wonder if Christopher McCandless was experiencing Schizophrenia or something along those lines, and not an unbridled zest for an unencumbered life.

If you saw the movie or read the book , tell me what you think.
