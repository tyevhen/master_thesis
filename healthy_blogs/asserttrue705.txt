Yes, I'm back from Hiatus, which is a small island nestled between Anomie and Ennui in the southern Doldrums. Actually, I decided to take a break from JavaScript hackery and other forms of bitbanging for a while in order to do a little painting (linseed-oil therapy).

But I'm back now, so I'll be posting updates here more regularly as the summer winds down. Which it's doing all too quickly, I fear.
