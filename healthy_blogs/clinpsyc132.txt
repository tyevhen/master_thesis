As noted on the Scientific Misconduct Blog and PharmaGossip, there is an online test available (the Political Compass) that claims to measure one's political leanings. If one is inclined to think that one's political views might influence a person's writing, then my potential bias is revealed in the graph below. I encourage everyone who blogs about pharma, mental health, or related topics to take the test and post the results on your blog. If you're not a blogger, it is still an interesting test that is probably worth your time.

Disclaimer: I can't attest to the validity of this test. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
