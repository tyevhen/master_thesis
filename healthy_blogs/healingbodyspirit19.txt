A delicious & healthy hot cocoa recipe you can feel good about drinking!! Organic cacao powder creates a decadent chocolate flavor that's accentuated with a touch of ground cinnamon,  and a pinch of sea salt. My favorite way to fix it is with coconut or almond milk. So yummy!
Serves: 1

Ingredients

1  1/4 cup almond or coconut milk
 2 tablespoons of organic raw cacao powder  1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon powder
1 packet of stevia
1 pinch of sea salt 
 Directions
Measure the cacao powder,  cinnamon, stevia and sea salt into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and slowly pour 1/4 cup of the milk into the spices, stirring constantly until dissolved and all the spices are mixed together, making sure to press out any lumps with the back of your spoon. 

When the mixture is smooth, stir in the rest of the milk and heat the cocoa until it's warm enough to drink (don't let it boil over). Pour into your favorite mug and drink right away, or dollop some whipped cream on top sprinkled with extra cinnamon or a pinch of cayenne for a little spice.
