Teenage Drug Abuse Project
Drugs Are Part of a Teen's Everyday Life
Today's teens face more challenges and temptations than any other generation has. More is expected from them in their schooling- their course loads are bigger with more required curriculum. There are new drugs and forms of drugs that are easily and readily accessible. Alcohol is popular as ever and more teens are sexually active. Peer pressure is a constant strain and influence on their choices. Relationships with parents and siblings are vitally important and have a strong pull in decision making.
Drugs play more of a role in a teenager's attitude, schooling and health than most parents realize. Drugs are becoming more and more accessible to teenagers everyday. TeenDrugAbuse.net is dedicated to informing parents about these drugs and also helping them help their teen by offering treatment centers and alternatives to public schooling.
THE LIBERAL RESPONSE WAS AS IRRATIONAL AS THE SHOOTER --OF COURSE

The deranged man had been steadily going downhill. His bizarre anti-social behavior and angry outbursts had caused him to be suspended from college classes. He spiraled downward into a vortex of madness and nursed a weird political grievance until finally he went on a murderous rampage with a 9-mm semi-automatic pistol, killing six people and wounding more than a dozen others.
But nobody blamed Sarah Palin or the Tea Party for this bloody crime, because it was December 1993, and the deranged gunman was Colin Ferguson. And his killing spree didn't happen in Arizona, but on New York's Long Island Railroad, where he opened fire in a train full of rush-hour commuters.
The remarkable parallels between Ferguson's mass murder and Saturday's shootings in Tucson include not only the choice of weapons and the number of victims killed, but also the fact that in both cases, liberals downplayed the idiosyncratic motives of the gunmen and immediately seized upon both crimes to advance their political agenda.
Liberals predictably used Ferguson's murders to promote gun-control legislation. Just days before the Long Island Railroad massacre, President Clinton had signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, requiring background checks on firearm purchasers. Of course, Ferguson had already bought his 9-mm Ruger pistol during a visit to California, where state law required a 15-day waiting period. And despite his increasingly paranoid behavior, there was evidently nothing in Ferguson's record that would have prevented him from buying a gun. Several months later, Congress passed and Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which prohibited the manufacture or import of certain semi-automatic weapons - wrongly described as "assault weapons" - as "high capacity" ammunition magazines. It has often been wrongly asserted that the so-called "assault weapons ban" outlawed these weapons and magazines, but it did not. Existing weapons and magazines of the prohibited type, already owned by many thousands of Americans, remained perfectly legal; it simply became illegal to manufacture such items in the U.S. or import them from overseas. Collectors who stocked up on the banned weapons and magazines before the Clinton-era law went into effect were able to reap handsome profits in the re-sale market during the 10 years before the law expired in 2004.
