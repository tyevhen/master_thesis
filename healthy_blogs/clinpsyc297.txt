And they're pretty good. Of psych note, Zyprexa sales were up 10% compared to the 1st quarter of '06; Cymbalta sales up 89% from 1Q '06, and Strattera sales down 8% from 1Q '06. Overall, sales were up 14%. Source.

According to Bloomberg, Lilly is planning to ramp up marketing of Cymbalta and Zyprexa. Can you say Viva Zyprexa Strikes Back? How about Anxiety Hurts (1, 2)? I wonder to whom Lilly will market Zyprexa? Seriously -- they've tried primary care, psychiatrists, and likely the geriatric market, so who's next? How about pediatricians? Tantrum = Zyprexa?
