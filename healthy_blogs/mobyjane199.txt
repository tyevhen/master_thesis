Hi,

I just wanted you to know that even though I've never read your book, it changed my life.  In 2002  I noticed a coworker reading your book "Depression is a Choice"  and that was the day my life changed forever.

With your four words as my motto, I was able to transform a lifetime of self loathing and negativity and give myself permission to be happy.  It was all up to me...

Thank You,
L.

Dear L.

Thank you for your letter. For many years I have regretted my publisher's choice of title because so many people told me they felt "insulted" by it. As far as sales ere concerned it was not the title, therefore, that people felt comfortable recommending to a friend for fear of offending them. Because of you letter, well, maybe the title was perfect after all.

If you ever have any specific questions, I will be glad to answer them. A. B. Curtiss
