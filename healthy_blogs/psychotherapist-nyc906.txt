These days many couples are opting to participate in pre-marital couples counseling before they get married or live together to find out if they're suitable to make a lifelong commitment to one another and to strengthen their relationship.

When couples are in the early days of their relationship, when they're experiencing those heady, in love feelings, often, they're not thinking about whether they're compatible enough to create a life together. Those heady, in love feelings, which often last a year or two, are not a good indicator of whether you and your partner have shared values and you're ready to make a lasting commitment.

It can be very useful for you and your partner to explore your feelings about commitment, sex, finances, a family, and other important issues that couples often face when they're in a committed relationship. While it's true that you might discover that you're not suited for one another, it's also true that exploring these issues can help to strengthen your relationship and help you avoid many of the pitfalls that couples often experience when they get married or move in together without examining these issues.

Couples counseling is not just for couples who are having problems. Pre-marital counseling can be a very important step in learning about yourself and your partner as well as ensuring that you and your partner will be happy together.
