In Indiana, a recent story regarding Seroquel (which, as I've posted earlier, AstraZeneca is trying to get marketed for anxiety)...

"A Lowell couple is suing pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca in federal court for failing to disclose the true dangers of its popular anti-psychotic drug Seroquel...

"The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Hammond, says Randall Waugaman developed "diabetes and/or diabetes-related injuries" while taking the prescription drug.

Jim Minnick, a spokesman for AstraZeneca, declined to comment on the Waugaman's case, but said in general the company is disputing the claims in the swell of litigation filed in federal courts across the country.

"The safety of patients who use our medications is our highest priority," Minnick said Tuesday. "(Seroquel) is a safe and effective medication when used as directed as a prescribed medication."

Seroquel was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997. A promotional news release says Seroquel is the most popular "atypical antipsychotic" prescribed drug in the United States, with global sales of almost $2.8 billion last year."

Like many other litigants, the Waugamans claim that AstraZeneca covered up the results of its own studies on the drug that found it also could affect weight gain and hyperglycemia, potentially causing diabetes."

Well, well, well. Although it's fairly clear that Seorquel isn't a diabetes/weight gain inducer to the extent of Zyprexa, there is indeed evidence that Seroquel is often not good for one's weight (as can be seen here and here, among several others). Add this to additional lawsuits regarding the safety and marketing of Seroquel, and it makes one wonder if Seroquel will continue to be a cash cow.
