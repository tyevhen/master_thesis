On Tuesday, May 3rd at 3 PM Eastern time, tune in to NPR for Talk of the Nation with Roy and Dinah as guests (and Clink in spirit). It's a call-in show, and we'd love to hear from you. (Listen to the the 31 minute segment on NPR)

And while we're at it:
Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work
is now available on Amazon at
