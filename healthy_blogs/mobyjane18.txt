                     Human Motivation

How can you face the hard things in life?
First, call on the best that is in you.
And boldly make a start.
Shake off the easy cringe of fear
Step forth with a willing heart.
Resolve to accomplish what needs to be done
There is help for the one who will ask.
Call on your courage
Gather your tools
And present yourself to the task.
