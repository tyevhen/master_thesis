AstraZeneca is really pulling out all the stops in marketing Seroquel.

*First, there was the misleading marketing regarding Seroquel that got them slapped by the FDA.
*Let's also not forget about the new astroturfing campaign involving NAMI.
*Add in the clinical trials testing Seroquel for everything (here, here, here, and here). Once these trial results are published, look for Seroquel to be marketed (stealthily) off-label.
*And, of course, we have the sponsored editorials -- this time, it's the same one I mentioned earlier (here and here) and it appears in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. As I've said before, it's well beyond unacceptable for an "independent" journal to run a sponsored editorial. Unbelievable.

I've got my own idea for a spot in a journal...
Stealth Marketing. It may be more common than you think.
