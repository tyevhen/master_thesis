Anne is a Man. That's the name of a blog that reviews and recommends podcasts. It looks like he's done over 360 podcasts, categorized into topics, with a leaning towards politics and history. Wow! I didn't know this resource was out there. Anne the Man likes ShrinkRapRadio (no relation, but now I have to check it out).

Wanna guess what podcast is featured today??
