BrandweekNRX has a very interesting story about the government attempting to push GlaxoSmithKline's Nicorette rather than going "cold turkey" to stop smoking. According to some evidence, it appears that there is actually little data to support such an idea -- meaning that cold turkey is no less effective than Nicorette. I am not directly familiar with the evidence on this point, but if true, that's sure interesting.

But there's another layer to the story. The folks writing the government guidelines for how to best quit smoking -- well, some of them are on GSK's payroll. How convenient...
