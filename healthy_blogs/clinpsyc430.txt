Much of the writing about the Zyprexa documents has appeared in the New York Times, but the Times of London is now chiming in as well. Here's a couple of choice cuts:
In one document dated October 9, 2000, Robert Baker, a senior Lilly clinical research physician, e-mailed colleagues about a meeting of an academic advisory board he had attended in Atlanta. It had “reinforced my impression that hyperglycemia remains quite a threat for olanzapine and may merit increasing even further medical attention and marketing focus on this topic”. Dr Baker added: “[The board was] quite impressed by the magnitude of weight gain on olanzapine and implications for glucose.”
Another internal document dated October 14-15, 1998, described the risk of weight gain as a “top threat” to Zyprexa.
