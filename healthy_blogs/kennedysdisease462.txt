From one father to all of you father’s out there … I wish you …

HAPPY FATHER’S DAY

One of the greatest joys in my life are my children.



I just hung up from a 2½ hour conversation with my daughter in Minnesota. We laughed and occasionally cried … tears of joy.

The previous day I heard from my son who also lives in Minnesota.



Even though we could not be together today, knowing that I am in their thoughts and prayers … and being able to share our memories makes this day extra special.

I am truly blessed.
