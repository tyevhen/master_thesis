Over on Clinical Psychiatry News, I have a post up on how it's going with the NY SAFE Act and the provision that requires reporting of mentally ill patients who are judged to be "likely to be dangerous."  If you're interested, surf over there.  Comments are welcome on either site. 

Hopefully, I'll be back later with more posts.  Life has been a bit busy lately!
