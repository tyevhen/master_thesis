Many people, especially people who suffer from depression, are in a current mental state of negativity.  Their thoughts are constantly negative, which in turn leads to negative feelings, actions and beliefs.  Even if they are in a positive or neutral situation, they turn it into a negative situation through their thoughts about the situation.  They see the class half empty as opposed to half full or they discount the positive. 



Discounting the Positive and Seeing the Glass Half Empty are common cognitive distortions (ANT’s – Automatic Negative Thoughts) that depressed people use that  perpetuate their depression; they only add to the complex depressive cycle they’re in.  Learning to combat and challenge cognitive distortions (ANT’s) is a process that has proven to help depressed people learn to manage and combat depression.  




Using the worksheet below can help you begin to combat and control the ANT’s mentioned above and develop lasting, positive thinking patterns.  Developing enduring, healthy thought patterns is something you can accomplish on you own and will most assuredly help you achieve your goal of learning how to deal with depression and any uncomfortable mental state.
