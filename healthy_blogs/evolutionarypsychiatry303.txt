My interview with Leslie Irish Evans is at 3pm EST today (Monday Oct. 25th) on Blog Talk Radio. I have the honor of being her last guest on Blog Talk before she moves onward and upward to the I'm Thankful Radio Network with a potential audience of millions of people. Go Leslie!

Here's a soup I threw together Sunday afternoon, a bit regretfully, as this week and next week will be our last CSA shares until late spring 2011. The coconut was not from the CSA share, but rather purchased at Whole Foods. I'm not particularly concerned about being ultra low-carb as long as the carbohydrates are non-toxic. For dinner I had a small bowl full and a few smoked muscles* on the side.

End of the Season Butternut Squash Coconut Curry Soup

1 butternut squash, peeled and seeded and chopped
Water from one coconut (drill a hole in the eye and drain)
Meat from 1/2 coconut (Mister Doctor Deans used his machete, or maybe the band saw).
2 shallots (or small red onions)
3 purple dragon carrots (from the CSA share - regular carrots are just as good, but not as pretentious)
1 purple top turnip
1 clove garlic
2 tbs coconut oil
2 tbs green curry paste
cinnamon
salt
pepper
dulse flakes
several glops of olive oil
1 container of chicken broth (we got the free range low sodium stuff. More awesome folks would have chicken stock frozen and available, but not I)


Simmer the whole lot for 35-40 minutes or so.
Blend with stand blender off the heat to desired chunkiness.
Season to taste.
Eat.

Macronutrient ratios: No clue
