Sometimes, I like to bother pharmacists.  They are the nicest people, and very patient about looking up medication costs for me.  Once, I wrote a post called The Co$t of Being Depressed, where I compared the cost of anti-depressants. Today,  I'm writing over on our Clinical Psychiatry News website about The Surprisingly High Cost of Abilify. 

Here's the short form, but do surf over there for details:
I called three pharmacies and compared prices on Abilify.
Please remember, this data is for three pharmacies only
A single 2 mg tablet cost between $30 and $33 dollars.  More don't cost appreciably less per pill so a 90 day supply ran $2700 at a local independent pharmacy to $2724.81 at Wal-mart.  If you do the math, you'll realized that at Wal-mart there was some discount for bulk : the pill price for 90 tablets is about 30 cents/pill less than for 90 pills. 
A single 30mg tablet runs $38-$47.  
A 2mg tablet costs the same as a 15mg tablet --which is the same as a 5mg and 10mg tablet
A 20mg tablet costs the same as a 30mg tablet.
It costs a whole lot less if you split the pills.
This stuff is expensive.
 You'll note the graphic above is an animated Abilify commercial.  I hope the pharmaceutical company appreciates the free advertising.
