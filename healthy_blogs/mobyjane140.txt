Hi AB

I tried posting to your blog under the comment section, but it takes me to a page that asks if I want to be a blogger. Anyway, here's a response to taking our space...

Yes you did publish the second paragraph some time ago. We had a discussion about fear. I posed a question wondering about where my fear had come from. I indicated that my parents were gentle people and yet somehow I was always fearful of most things.

Starting in grade one and on into grade seven, it was like I had 'come bully me' stamped on my forehead. By then, I had had enough. It took only once of standing up for myself and people didn't bother me again.

Taking my place / space has taken a very long time... I always thought that depression was my main problem. But using the techniques and gathered wisdom from your books I've had new insight. "Green frog" has allowed me to drop the stress level so much that I was able to see I was struggling with something beyond depression.

I can't say specifically how it all fell into place. A continuous focus and confrontation of my fears was part of it. I have become more socially at ease. It (the social unease), still gets away from me every once in a while, but a quick refocus at the moment, usually helps that. It is a very good feeling to be able to walk into a room full of people and be able to watch the room, engage with people, and not be overwhelmed with a feeling of wanting to run away.

Thanks again for writing your books. It has become so obvious to me (with the help of your books) that I can change my life without medication. Just taking that first step to break the cycle of depression is so important.

Thanks,
A

Dear A,

Thanks so much for your letter. I’m sure it will inspire others to risk the fear of “taking their space.” A. B. Curtiss
