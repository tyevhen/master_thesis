Lilly is represented by multiple legal firms, one of which is Covington & Burling. Let's think about it -- Lilly is being sued over Zyprexa for such things as off-label marketing and health risks. Well, C & B knows a little about health risks. They represented Big Tobacco, for which their shining work at helping to conceal the risks associated with smoking and secondhand smoke earned them a stern reprimand from a judge. They are apparently not ashamed of their work with the Tobacco Institute (Big Tobacco's former lobbying group), as it is mentioned on C & B's website. I don't mind looking at their website, as they have visited my site on several occasions.

Below are a few articles you may enjoy regarding Covington & Burling's stalwart representation of Big Tobacco, and how they covertly got involved with the "science" surrounding the health effects of secondhand smoke. I highly advise reading them, then thinking about the current Zyprexa controversy.

So, in line with C & B being intimately involved with the Tobacco Institute and Center for Indoor Air Research, I suggest that they set up something similar for Zyprexa. What do you think of the following?
Center for Diabetes Studies
Center for Weight Management Research
Institute for The Appropriate Marketing of Pharmaceuticals
