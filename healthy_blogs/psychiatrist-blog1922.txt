I just read that, due to budget cuts and political brinksmanship, the MA state hospital system has to make severe cuts, resulting in them no longer taking any new admissions through the end of the year.
Will where they go if the state is not an option.  Is there enough excess bed capacity in Massachusetts? Will the ERs fill up?  Will they be transferred out of state or left out in the cold?  How will this work?
