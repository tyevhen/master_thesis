Observed every February, and celebrated this year from February 11-17, 2018, #RAKWeek is an annual opportunity to connect with others through kindness. 

Led by the Random Acts of Kindness (RAK) Foundation, this seven-day celebration demonstrates how kindness starts with just a simple act. Itâ€™s an opportunity for you to do something in this world that will inspire others to do the same.

Acts of kindness needn't be complicated or involved. A simple smile, holding a door open, putting a shopping cart back in its place, leaving a generous tip you can afford, holding an elevator, doing something special for a loved one. It doesn't take much. Just a little effort and a gentle kindness.  

Practicing kindness every day offers tremendous physical and emotional benefits. From lowering blood pressure to increasing the feel good hormone oxytocin and serotonin, kindness is a simple act that benefits those who give it and those who receive it.
