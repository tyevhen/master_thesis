Several weeks ago, I got an email from one of my best friends from medical school. She graduated top honors in the class and went on to Johns Hopkins, where she was a chief resident, then a fellowship, and basically has torn her way through the ranks in academic medicine like the firecracker. She told me once I ought to be in academic medicine (other than my tiny finger hold teaching a section of one class), but I’m not all that great dealing with something called a “boss,” so let’s just say I’m better off where I am. It’s very handy to have a crackerjack gastroenterologist as a friend when one is interested in the gut brain connection. Ergo…her email started off: “Saw this paper and I thought of you.”
