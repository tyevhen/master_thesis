In a prior article, I described low self esteem and gave some examples of what people with low self esteem might think and feel about themselves.

What Are the Effects of Low Self Esteem?

So, what are the affects of low self esteem?

People with low self esteem might:

* avoid making friends
* avoid social situations
* perform poorly at work or at school
* be unable to defend themselves from criticism or abuse
* drink excessively or abuse drugs

Low self esteem can be caused by circumstances related to childhood issues or it can be caused by stressful life circumstances, like losing a job, losing a house, financial problems, abusive relationships, the death of a loved one, and so on.
So, we begin to see that low esteem can be a serious problem. In future posts, I'll address what can be done about low self esteem.

If you feel like you are struggling with low self esteem, you might benefit from getting professional help.
