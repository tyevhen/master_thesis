This post was taken from the Online Peer Mediation Platform (OPMP), a project funded by the JAMS Foundation and managed by the National Association of Peer Program Professionals.  OPMP will offer the opportunity for schools, which lack peer mediation programs, to utilize peer mediation services for its students in conflict.  Feel free to share this information with schools that lack a peer mediation program and check out the webinar which I will be co-hosting!!! 

About the webinar...

Due to lack of resources, time and staff, many schools don’t have a peer mediation program, which allows students to help each other resolve school-related conflicts.

The Online Peer Mediation Platform (OPMP), a JAMS funded project, now offers an alternative solution. OPMP has trained a group of highly skilled peer mediators to assist other students across the country – online, in a safe and confidential environment.

During this FREE 30-min webinar two OPMP Team Members (Dr. Cynthia Morton and Prof. Karen Devoogd) and two Rockdale County students/online peer mediators will explain:
What online peer mediation means and how it works
How school administrators can request an online peer mediation for their students, by filling out an online form available on the OPMP website
Which cases are suitable for online peer mediation
How students can participate in an online peer mediation with their PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android tablet or smartphone
The Online Peer Mediation Platform is a project funded by the JAMS Foundation, currently managed by the National Association of Peer Program Professionals, and previously managed by the Association for Conflict Resolution.
