"Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected." ~Carl Jung, Psychology and Religion

Self with Shadow is a depiction of Jung's concept of the Shadow. I think that while on the whole unconscious, the Shadow, should we be able to access it, will provide insight into what work we have to do to become more self-realized individuals.

I have painted a few pieces with the same subject rendered more than once. It is part of an ongoing "Doppelganger series", paintings of twins, or apparent twins. They could also be different facets of one's personality, as in Self with Shadow. The most important thing though is that the viewer ultimately does not know their relationship and must draw their own conclusions.

I wanted to do a painting of myself twice; two sides, the dark and the light, the yin and yang dichotomy that I think we all have in ourselves to varying degrees. One of my cats, Sasha, came into the composition by chance but I am pleased that he did. I think his shape helps to balance that area of the painting.

This piece is 22"x28", oil on canvas.
