Hi A.B. Curtiss,

I am a photographer and was photographing a house for a realtor this week when I finally came across "the" green frog.

Paxil and Celexa were prescribed to me on different occasions years apart and years ago.  They were semi-adequate, but each time I came off them, things got way worse.  So I read your book, Depression is a choice.  I tried to green frog it and it worked great.  It was so effective I had no symptoms for over a year.  When the symptoms returned, I green frogged it again. Again it worked.  The bummer is depression onset never goes away, but I don't stress because for me green frogging always extinguishes the symptoms.

Thanks for writing a great book!
