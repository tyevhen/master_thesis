What is the best at home genetic testing you have found? So far I'm only finding 23&me.
Ans. 23andme. It's still the most complete test around and the best bang for your buck.. They may only report on a limited number of things, but that's why people upload their genetic data to one of the many interpretation sites like Livewello, so they can get better info off the raw data..
