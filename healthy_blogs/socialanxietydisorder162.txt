Answer :
Its obvious that they own most of the companies in the Data mining bussiness. Now All insurance companies consult Choicepoint C.L.U.E. report before they aprove you for home or even car insurance. They know things about anyone like how many accidents you have, if you were at fault, and how many traffic tickets you have. Thats the new way for this companies to detrmine how much are they going to charge you for insurance. All you need to have is a couple of mistakes and boom you get stock with higher rates, awesome bussiness dont you think?. They have one of the biggest databases in the nation that now even FBI uses them or buy their information instead of doing their own investigations. How comfortable Aint it? There is no doubt that Choice point is one poses one of the most dangerous databases in america. And there is no way to put controls to their marketing of a citizen own and personal information. A monopoly ! we can agree they are the biggest in the market right now.

Question :
Bpd..i cant shake the unbearable feelings?
I was disgnosed with bpd in march 2011 (emotionally unstable, and anorexia) when i was in hospital for a 6 month stay with anorexia. A lot of the stuff they said i didnt really believe, i didnt really look at symptoms until the last week or so properly. I can see a lot of myself in the things described, yet i feel the stigma of the individual being claimed as very manipulative, angry+outburst at other people or refusing to believe you are wrong etc, very hard because that isnt me at all. Im the first one to take on responsibilty of being wrong. I never set out to hurt somebody i dont yell.
Im very empty and not coping well right now, my self harm is...here again. I have such rapid moods, of feeling so happy and confident in the morning for example, then two hours later i am crying and cant make sense of anything. Ive gone from feeling like i can take on the world to achieve what i want and strong etc, to questioning what the heck is life, and unberable insecure. My confidence and esteem is on a major low. I get upset if im not included with friends, and i get upset when i am included, and then angry and upset t myself because i cant make sense of these feelings and why i react to things in such a dramatic and sad way.
I want to change my cpn. I hadnt seen her for 4 weeks and the last time i saw her she just nodded and looked straight ahead, i knew i shouldnt have hoped for anything. i guess i just hoped for more than a nod. Again I dont even know what i hope for anymore, i know there are no cures. But reading through things makes me feel like im a lost cause because i have been with the mental health teams since i was 17. I was with camhs before. Because of my anorexia and hospital admissions, ive had 2 sets of cbt, 3 sets of dbt and 2 sets of c.a.t, which i end next week. That is all in the last 8 years. So surely there is nothing out there left for me. Ive been on lots of different meds as i experience hallucinations at times and i had a brief episode of being cyclothymic in 2009. yet i have no idea whether that is still a current diagnosis, not that it really matters. Im currently on prescribed anti-deps, anti-psychotics and sleeping meds. Ive been on the same ones for atleast 2 years now.
I dont want to see my cpn anymore, i dont even have the energy to encounter her again, its not because of our last communication, just because i think we ve had our time, and i dont feel like im getting understood or getting anywhere, again i dont even know what those two things mean for me.
She also said the consultant pyschiatrist has to come to my review with the eating disorders team. On two seperate occasions i told her i really dont want him to be there. I cried the last time i saw him, he is not friendly in the slightest, i mean i know thats not his job, but there is no compassion that comes across. That would also mean there would be 6people in one room at the review and me, that is horrible. Yet my cpn still is reluctant and not respecting my wishes.
Im scared to change my cpn in this way, i dont want to have a reputation amongst other cpn s. Its not that i dont like my cpn, i do, i just have no energy left in me with anything. i have no motivation most days to walk, and no fullfillment out of my days. sometimes i can conquer lots of things but so much of relies on others around me, or making sense of the world, and being so scared and alone inside. I feel like i have so many needs, and yet i cant take any step to find them.
If anyone has been through similar stuff to this,it would be great to hear from you, or any advice on ths or my cpn and psychiatrist issue.

thanks
