Dear Ms. Curtiss:

I had the great pleasure of meeting you and I purchased two of your books: In the Company of Bears and Time of the Wild, which you graciously autographed for me. I have since read both the books a few times and wanted to express to you just how enjoyable I found them to be. I am especially fond of Time of the Wild! You have shared great wisdom to live by in both books and done so in absolutely beautiful prose. I will cherish these books and share your great insights with my friends and family. Thank you!

Blessings...
Constance Knapp
