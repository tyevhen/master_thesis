My husband, David, has traveled to over 100 countries and worked in forty one as a chemical engineer and expert consultant on evaporates, mainly salt production. He has traversed the peaks of Tibet at 14,000 feet to the depth of the Dead Sea, 1388 feet before sea level. He has come face-to face with death on at least nine occasions and survived a helicopter crash.
