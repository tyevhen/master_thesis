Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
Nasdaq has notified Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated that the Company is not in compliance with continuous listing standards for inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market because (i) pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5), the Company’s price per share for its Common Stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for 30 consecutive business days, and (ii) pursuant to Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(3), the Company’s stockholders’ equity reported on its Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2006 did not comply with the minimum $10 million requirement.
