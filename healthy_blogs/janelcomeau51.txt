This week, I'm that special combination of overheated and busy that leads to short blog posts. 

But at least there are ten fine-ass mustaches to stare at. 

10. Charles Dickens

You might say that I had some 'Great Expectations' for this writer's mustache.



9. Ernest Hemingway

This is one old man who's about to have a sea... of ladies.

8. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Sherlock Holmes himself couldn't figure out what's going on with this author's mustache.

7. Kurt Vonnegut

Mustache of Champions.

8. George Orwell

Big Brother wants to know the secret of that tiny, creepy mustache.

5. William Golding

Looks like Golding may have taken the 'living unkempt in the wilderness' thing a little too seriously.

4. William Shakespeare

I'd make much ado about that mustache.

3. John Steinbeck

Mustache of wrath.
2. William Faulkner

Half of that mustache actually won Faulkner the Pulitzer prize. The other half won him the Nobel.

1. James Joyce

Look at that fucking mustache/eye patch/fancy-ass pose combination.
