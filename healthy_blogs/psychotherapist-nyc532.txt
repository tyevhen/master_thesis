For years, we've been hearing about the benefits of meditation with regard to decreasing stress.  Now, we have research by neuroscientists to show that, among regular meditators, meditation can decrease the negative effects of stress, mild depression and anxiety (see link for article below:  "Can Meditation Change Your Brain:  Contemplative Neuroscientists Believe It Can" by Dan  Gilgoff of CNN).


Research Shows Meditation  Can  Change Your Brain

People Who Meditate Regularly Tend to Be Calmer and Happier
Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D. of University of Massachusetts Medical School, conducted studies that reveal that regular meditators tend to be calmer and happier (see link below:  Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society).

I often recommend meditation for psychotherapy clients in my private practice in NYC to help with anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
