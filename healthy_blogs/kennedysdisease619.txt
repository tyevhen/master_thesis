I don’t know about you, but after a serious fall that involved an injury, getting back on the horse is no easy task. Yes, I know it needed to be done, but I constantly asked myself, “Am I ready?”


After two weeks of sponge baths, yesterday I decided I was ready to take a shower. I thought I was ready on Monday, but I second guessed myself and put it off. Yesterday, when I came back from taking my dog for a walk (I ride and he walks), I told my wife, “Let’s do it.”

During the process of undressing and preparing to step into the shower, there were several moments that I paused and considered if this was the right time to try it. My metatarsal still isn’t healed; nor is the sprain. And, the left hyper-flexed knee still gives me some problems. 

Should I wear a shoe to protect the foot?
What happens if I do more damage stepping into or out of the shower?
What if my left knee and foot won’t hold all of my weight?

What kept my moving forward was the affirmation, “Come on, Bruce, you’ve done this a thousand times. Just get it done.”

I find it interesting how my mind works. From day two after the injury, I started exercising the legs. This wasn’t my regular routine; just side-to-side shifts. I added ten each day until I was up to 50 reps. Next I added standing leg lifts. I started small, but within a week I was up to 70 of them. So far so good. I began taking my dog out (transferring to and from the golf cart was another milestone in the recovery process. Everything went very well and ahead of schedule.

But, taking a shower was the one thing I continued to put off. Okay, now that the shower is behind me, I am one step closer to the day I can say ‘fully recovered’. WHEW!
