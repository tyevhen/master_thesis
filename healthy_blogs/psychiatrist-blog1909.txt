I'll get in on this bloggle (bloggle:blog::gaggle:goose) about legislating common sense.
In Maryland's last legislative session, a well-meaning senator introduced Senate Bill 329, which provides for mandatory obesity screening for every child in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 8th
grades. The child's Body-Mass Index (BMI) would be measured, and a "health report card" would be sent home to the parents, informing them of the results.
Imagine that, getting a letter from school informing you that your son is fat. I can imagine the conversation now at the dinner table.
"So, Johnny, we got your health report card today. Your teacher says you got a 32! Why didn't you tell us you were getting fat?"
"I thought I was doing okay."
"What do you eat in the school cafeteria?"
"Just what they feed us. McDonald's burgers, fries, pizza, soda."
"Well, until you get your grade down to a 25, you are grounded, young man. Now, go upstairs to your room and watch TV."

Fortunately, the bill died.
