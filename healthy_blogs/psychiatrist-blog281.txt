It's August, and  I've been away.  Now I'm back.  While I was gone, there were a number of articles in the New York Times that were Shrink Rap material.  Here is a list, with thanks to Jesse for keeping me informed:

Mark Epstein on The Trauma of Being Alive.  It's a nice piece about how people deal with loss, and it's feeling a little to relevant these days. 

Here are the response letters to the article. 

 I didn't see Epstein's article as a deterrent to getting care, as one trauma therapist who responded did, but rather as a suggestion that we take grief as it comes, however it comes, with no comment on what more to do about besides accept and "lean into" the emotions (whatever that may mean).  I figured that if one's response to the distress of a loss was to want to seek help, then the author,  a psychiatrist, probably wouldn't be blocking the door.   

Pam Bellack wrote on the successes of forced outpatient care in Programs Compelling Outpatient Treatment for Mental illness is Working, Study Says.

In a response letter, three professors wrote about Forced Drug Treatment.

Don't hold your breath waiting for the Shrink Rapper book on this -- it will be years in the coming.

In Lawyers of Sound Mind, Melody Moezzi writes about the hassles newly minted lawyers have to go through in some states to enter the Bar if they've been treated for psychiatric disorders. 

In When Doctors Discriminate, Juliann Garey writes about her experiences with doctors who've dismissed her health problems after learning she takes psychotropic medications.

And in New Sign of Stimulants' Toll on the Young, Sabrina Tavernese discusses the increased rate of ER visits for stimulant-related problems, especially for those who obtain them without a prescription and for those who combine stimulants with alcohol. 

And over on Clinical Psychiatry News, ClinkShrink chides the president of APA for irresponsible tweeting.
