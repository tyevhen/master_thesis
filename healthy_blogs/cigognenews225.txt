Dear Art,

 I write to wish you a happy 90th birthday and as many healthy and happy years ahead as you wish yourself.

 Your 90th birthday should be a day of joy and glorification for a life that has brought true meaning to the lives of thousands of others and laid the groundwork for those of millions of others yet to benefit from it. You have made an indelible imprint in the sands of time.

 Your discovery and practice of Primal Therapy are no doubt a silent revolution in the knowledge of Man. Man has over the years conquered the science of everything but of Man himself. You have successfully re-discovered Man. Your discovery and development of Primal Therapy have laid the path for the understanding of the link between Man and himself, between the human mind and the human body, the understanding of causes and origin of major illnesses and afflictions, the causes and origin of poverty, of the wealth or poverty of persons or nations, of success and failure, of sanity and insanity, and of sadness and joy, of longevity and short lives, and many others. You have laid the path for the resolution of the ever-aching conflict between Man and himself, between his mind and his body.

 Sometimes great men like you are not discovered in their lifetime. What is, however, certain, is that you will be discovered or re-discovered in the course of time. And the world will be happier for it.

 I use this opportunity to say how lucky I am to have met you through some of your works and in person. I am lucky, too, to be associated with your discovery of Primal Therapy. Indeed, the whole world is lucky that there has been an Arthur Janov,except that most of them are not aware of it.

 Congratulations on your 90th birthday.
