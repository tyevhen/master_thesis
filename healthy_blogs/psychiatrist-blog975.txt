In Dinah's post Fly Those Friendly Skies she talks about the new FAA policy regarding pilots on antidepressant medication. We found out something about pilot life span. Retired pilots live five years longer than their non-flying peers.

We talk about the New York Times article In Therapy: Cell Phones Ring True. The article discusses what therapists learn about their patients through their cell phone conversations and pictures.

Roy introduced us to the Lanny-yap blog, where we found a picture of Roy's dog, Eddie. This blog has a reference to a Scientific American article on anisomycin, an experimental medication that has been used in rats to wipe out fearful memories. Shades of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)!

Finally, we talk about a prospective study of 16,000 adults who started college and tried to guess which psychiatric diagnoses were most associated with failure to complete college. The full study can be found in the April edition of Psychiatric Services.

Once again, we talk about our upcoming book. We still need a title we can all agree on. Help us out by sending ideas to mythreeshrinksATgmail.com!
