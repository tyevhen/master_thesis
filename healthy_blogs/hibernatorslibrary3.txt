Against the Tide, by Tui T. Sutherland


This is the fifth book in Spirit Animals, a middle-grade fantasy series imagined by Brandon Mull. It continues the story of the four kids who have been paired to the four fallen Great Beasts rather than to a normal spirit animal. I won't say more, for fear of spoilers for earlier in the series.

Cute book. I like the way this series is written by different authors for each book, because it introduces me to new authors. This one was quite enjoyable. I got a couple of good laughs, and it was hard putting this short book down.
