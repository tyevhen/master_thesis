I posted a while back about Janssen doing some "research" on why people with schizophrenia stop taking their antipsychotic medications. They partnered with the National Association of Social Workers to conduct a survey as to which patients were unlikely to comply with taking their medications. A group of social workers and academics was unimpressed with the science behind said survey and that the NASW was willing to accept a bribe, er, donation from Janssen in order to push this survey on its membership

In a related note, at the American Psychiatric Association convention, a press release featuring Dr. John Kane (a Janssen consultant with a monetary investment in Janssen) said that the main reason physicians cite for patients not complying with their medication is "poor insight into illness". I don't know if poor efficacy or side effect burden was even mentioned by this survey. These results came from a survey designed by (who else?) Janssen.

What am I getting at? Well, we've got two related surveys, one given to social workers, the other to physicians. Both of them emphasize that patients tend to not comply with their schizophrenia medications. Well, phew, Janssen, whose patent on oral Risperdal is about to expire, has the patent for an injectable form of Risperdal (Risperdal Consta), which won't expire for a while. So, they send out these surveys under the guise of research, but the point is far from research -- we already know people don't generally enjoy taking antipsychotics.

The point is marketing. People don't comply with their medications, so we have to give it to them in injectable, long-acting format so that their compliance with treatment will be acceptable.
