… not by the hair of my chinny chin chin, sayeth Martin Keller, or so it would appear.
Not sure how I neglected to mention this in a prior post, but here goes: Keller (on video), was asked about a study which showed placebo was superior to paroxetine (Seroxat or Paxil). In response, Keller, while smiling, reached out and stroked the reporter under the chin. I don’t really know what that gesture meant, but it struck me (and some individuals who have emailed me about it) as pretty strange.
