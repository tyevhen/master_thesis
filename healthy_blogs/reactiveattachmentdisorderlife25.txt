The LAST day of October. Then we fly right into the busiest time of year. With Christmas only a couple of months away and high school swim team starting at our house it gets pretty hectic. Add in grad school for me and it is a whirl wind. We still need to stop and smell the roses, take care of our healthy relationships and look for the gifts God has given us.

Eagle: Is looking for a second job to help make ends meet. She is hanging in there!

Dancer: Has been involved in several volunteer programs at her school and is looking at a great summer opportunity that would work to help others while giving her some great social services experience.

Bear: Is feeling much better. But it is H1N1 so we are being careful. He was actually a pretty nice guy while he was sick. He is feeling better today so I see the old habits creeping back but we'll work on it. It was inspiring to see the sweetness under there.

Fish: Has a swim meet today and is PUMPED! I am home with the sick child so look forward to hearing about it when they get back!

Taz: We watched The Boy in Striped Pajamas last night. I had no idea it was going to be so sad. Taz had read the book. When it got to the part with the tragic ending he got up and left before it came on. Does that sound like RAD to you? Not at all. Wonderful to see him developing a tender heart.

Have a glorious weekend. Don't forget to set your clocks back tonight!
