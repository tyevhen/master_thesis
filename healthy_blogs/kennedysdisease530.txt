The United States Library of Medicine has published the “Genetic Home Reference - Your Guide to Understanding Genetic Conditions.” I found this website to be a very user-friendly, yet a comprehensive guide to most genetic disorders including Kennedy’s Disease (SBMA). The explanations are well written and for the layperson. Below are a series of screenshots of the main pages of the guide. Check it out and let me know what you think.
