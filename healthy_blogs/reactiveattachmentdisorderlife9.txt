See that handy dandy little device? KitchenAid calls it a food chopper. It is my vegetable hider. I just picked it up recently and have had great success. There are also a series of books called Sneaky Chef. If you check out the website you will find some free recipes.  Taz has just plain flat out decided he is not eating anything healthy and tries to do a refined carb load whenever possible. I tried preparing healthy meals and leaving the choice to him. He has only grown worse as a teen, which I realize all kids do. But it is like he has declared war on healthy food. Fine.

I've figured out the art of hiding veggies. The key is to pick veggies that blend in color wise with what you are preparing. If your kids like mac n cheese? Easy peasy. I switched to whole wheat pasta, low fat cheese and when I make the cheese sauce, I pour it in the chopper with some cooked cauliflower. NO ONE COULD TELL. Toss some bread crumbs in a little butter and sprinkle on top and put it in the oven until crunch. In any spaghetti sauce I mix fresh spinach, fresh tomatoes, peppers, onions. Put them in the chopper until they become liquid. The only complaint I have about the chopper is that it is a little small so I sometimes have to do more batches, but it is only around $30 and you can't beat that. It is well made. Any food that contains sauce can also contain hidden vegetables!

There are some benefits besides the nutrients he is now getting. ALL of us are getting the added nutrition, not just Taz. He himself says "Wow this is really good" every time I do it. It makes the food more flavorful. It is giving him some taste for these veggies so as an adult, he may taste them and say "This reminds me of something".

Never, never, never quit! If what you are doing doesn't work....stop doing it...and do something else. If you don't know what to do. Ask a mom on here. Email me at  radmoms@hotmail.com If I don't know I will find someone who does. We are in this together ladies.
