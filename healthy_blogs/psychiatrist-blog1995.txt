A colleague of mine walked into my office today and handed me a slip of paper with the URL for a great resource that I thought I'd share with our readers: Free Medical Journals is a metasearch engine that links to major medical publishers offering free full-texts of their articles. It covers all the medical specialties as well as some non-medical journals for psychologists. You can also sign up for the free email subscription service and have summaries of selected journals sent to you on a weekly basis. For a list of available psychiatry and psychology journals, follow this link.
