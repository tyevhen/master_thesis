As pointed out by Ed at Pharmalot, Utah is now added to the list of states suing Lilly over its promotion of Zyprexa. Read some of the statements from Attorney General Mark Shurtleff regarding the lawsuit. The lawsuits just keep stacking up.

It must suck to be Lilly these days. The documents that may incriminate Lilly are just hanging out in full public view. Any enterprising attorney general just needs to get their feet wet by looking through a handful of documents (which can be downloaded here and here) and by perhaps taking a peek at a few posts by your humble correspondent and Philip Dawdy, such as the following:
The Zyprexa Chronicles: Marketing Zyprexa As The New Mood Stabilizer For Bipolar Disorder And Downplaying Diabetes And Weight Gain Concerns
Zyprexa: Off-Label Promotion?
Zyprexa Off Label Marketing(?): Part 2
Demented Marketing of Zyprexa?
Good thing that Lilly's lawyers are just the right team for the task. More on that in a soon-to-come post...
