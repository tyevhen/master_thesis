According to Reuters:
Wyeth on Thursday said low doses of its experimental drug Pristiq were effective against both depression and hot flashes and caused less nausea than seen in prior studies of higher doses, boosting prospects for the company's most important experimental drug.
Well, good. With antidepressants, we all know by now that "effective" means "slightly better than placebo" on average. Pristiq, a knock-off of Effexor, is hoping to nab FDA approval early in 2008. Can't wait to see the ad campaign. Depression Hurts is already taken, so with the depression/hot flash combo, I have the following idea:

Does Depression Make You Hot? Let Pristiq Cool You Down.
