One thing to guard against when you are depressed is that you must not forget that depression is a state of alarm. Nothing is really wrong with you. You are fine. Take a deep breath. Nothing has changed. One time you felt okay and the next moment you were in a horrible place. That's all depression is. It is a room in your brain that you have been rudely pushed into.

But the door is not locked. It can never be locked. In can't be locked because you have control of your own thoughts and thoughts are powerful enough to move you into another room in your brain. Pull yourself away from thinking about how you feel. Self focus keeps you from seeing that you can move away from your depression. Self-focus is what pushed you into that dark door.

Decide to move out of the doorway. Focus on anything else, the sky, the ceiling,. You may not feel any better. But you won't be so afraid either. You will have already weakened the pull of depression. Keep moving away from self focus anyway you can. Sing a song, laugh out loud, smile and "crack the great stone face." You may not be happy, but you will be courageous. Being courageous is better than being depressed. A. B. Curtiss
