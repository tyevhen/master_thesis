You know that 1979 Boomtown Rats song, "I Don't Like Mondays." (This Youtube music video features a very young-looking Bob Geldof.)  The song is about the 1979 shooting spree on a Monday morning at a San Diego elementary school. The shooter's only state reason for doing it was that she didn't like Mondays.

The silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload
And nobody’s gonna go to school today
She’s gonna make them stay at home

It turns out that -- contrary to popular impression that Mondays are the worst day of the week -- Tuesdays are the worst day of the week.  According to a piece by Chris Hall (@hallicious) on HealthCentral, Tuesdays are the worst day of the week (moodwise) while Sundays are the best. This is based on mood rating scores from 500 users of the Mood 24/7 service, which HealthCentral licenses from Johns Hopkins University. After you sign up for the free service, the software sends you a text message at random times, and you text back your mood rating for that day.

So, you'd think that the latest date of the coming apocalypse, October 21, might be on a Tuesday. But it's not -- it's on a Friday.  Maybe it will get moved again.
