This is one of those weeks in which I feel I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off, yet there's nothing much to say about it in my update! With my new job (with strange hours) ramping up, I feel over-committed to family, friends, and volunteer work so that I have very little free-time for myself. I ended up having to borrow free time, missing two events last week. But I've now rearranged certain aspects of my schedule - hopefully that will help.


I am sadly behind on my book reviews, but I have penciled into my calendar to write a review for The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm on Tuesday and Why Zebras Don't Have Ulcers on Thursday. We'll see if proactively planning my reviews gets me caught up!

The activity my blog HAS seen this week is that I decided to organize a full Bible Group Read through the year 2017. I already have a group interested on LibraryThing, if you prefer that venue. Or if you would like to casually or all-out join me reading / blogging about the Bible next year, let me know!

This week I completed To Kill a Mockingbird, and I loved it. Though the ending made me laugh because it reminded me of when my mom told me "I didn't understand that book..." When I got to the ending I understood why. lol. Mom. So literal. 


In light of my new plan to read the Bible, I decided to read some preparatory non-fiction. I've temporarily set aside The Myth of Sisyphus, which I started last week. Also, The Fifth Child won last week's vote, so that's what I'll be reading for Halloween. This week I'm reading How to Read the Bible, by James L Kugel, Stiletto, by Daniel O'Malley, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J. K. Rowling. 


I'm linking this post back to the Sunday Salon (on Facebook) and Caffeinated Reviewer's Sunday Post. Oh, and oh, so cute, I found this Loving Life Meme too. Check it out! What I love about life today is my friend Charity, whom I haven't seen in months - got to see her last night as a surprise hang-out.
