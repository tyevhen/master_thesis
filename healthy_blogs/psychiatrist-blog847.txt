 Happy Birthday, Jesse! He's 17 and in all the glory of adolescent angst. Jesse is a black hole of need. To make 17 all the harder, Jesse continues to deal with issues of identity and belonging. It's probably not the easiest age to be gay or to be discovering birth parents.

Jesse's relationship with Paul has gotten much better, much warmer. I liked when Paul told him he would gain strength from his struggle. Finally, he has something positive and encouraging to say to a patient. And he's tender with Jesse as the parallels continue with his own angsty relationship with his son, Max.
