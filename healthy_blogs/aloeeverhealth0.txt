The kidneys: these are a pair of a brownish bean like shaped organs that are delicate, complex and very important to normal body functioning. They lie just in the middle back which they are located on the either sides of the spine.

Basic Functions of the kidney:

What is chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease can be understand to be the gradual loss of proper functioning of the kidney over time due to one thing or the other that will eventually lead to permanent kidney failure if proper care is not taken.
In the United States, young adults and above (20 years and above) are presently having kidney disease. These young adults and above, account for over 15 per cent but less than 18 per cent of the total population of USA. In the USA, 1 in 6 persons has kidney disease. Also in UK, 1 in 5 people have kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is much more common among the elderly (60 years and above), this may be associated with some diseases and conditions that plague the old age. Some diseases and conditions boost up the chances of having chronic kidney disease. Presently, over 490000 people are on dialysis.
Kidney disease can be diagnosed through Urine test, Blood test, X-rays, Ultrasound scan, and biopsy.

-          Reducing intake of protein per day.
-          Staying away from salt or little amount of salt to add tiny taste to it. Or if probably, stay away from salt completely.
