As reported on Pharmalot and Furious Seasons, the antiepileptic/"mood stabilizer" class of drugs has been stuck with a suicide warning by the FDA. Granted, the FDA wasn't exactly quick to come to their conclusion -- these drugs have been on the market for quite some time, but better late than never. Others have noted similar concerns prior to the FDA's interest in the topic. Hey, does this remind anyone else of the SSRI-suicide story (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)?

But wait a minute, aren't these supposed to be "life saving" medications? Wait, I can hear it coming now... Drug Wonks and others with similar views will be complaining that because the FDA is irresponsibly "fearmongering," people will stop taking their life saving medications and masses of suicide will ensue.
