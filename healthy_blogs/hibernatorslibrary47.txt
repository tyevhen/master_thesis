Winter has come! It's cold and windy outside, and supposed to drop even lower next week. I've gotten out my winter jacket, and still need to figure out what happened to my gloves. Nothing much happened this week worth noting. Hero has recovered splendidly from her surgery and everything is calm here at Casa Hibernator. 

On the blog I noted my plans for 2017 & reviewed The Price of Silence by Liza Long and A Confusion of Princes by Garth Nix. 

Currently Reading: Same as last week. 



Completed: Finished this weeks The Week, and the indie novel Chaos, by Julian Kincaid (review and author interview upcoming)


Acquired: My copy of We Need to Talk About Kevin has arrived!
