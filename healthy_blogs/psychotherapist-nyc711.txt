I recently read Almost a Psychopath by Ronald Schouten, MD, JD and James Silver, JD.  Both authors have extensive experience working with psychopaths and "almost psychopaths."  According to Schouten and Silver, people who are "almost psychopaths" are individuals who don't quite meet the full  criteria for being a psychopath.  In their book, they discuss in details how we can distinguish between the two, and they give many examples of people who are "almost psychopaths."

As a therapist who meets many different clients, it was fascinating to read about how common "almost psychopaths" are.  According to Schouten and Silver, they are all around us.  More importantly, they discuss what you can do if you are with someone who is almost a psychopath or if you recognize yourself to be in this category.

One important difference between a psychopath and someone who is almost a psychopath has to do with empathy.  Someone who meets the full diagnostic criteria for being a psychopath lacks empathy for the people that he or she hurts.

If this is a topic that interests you, either because you're with someone who displays psychopathic tendencies or you think you might be psychopathic yourself, I recommend that you read "Almost a Psychopath," which is an informative and interesting read.
