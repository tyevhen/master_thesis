Thank you to everyone has been participating in our multi-post discussions of Capitated Care versus Fee-for-Service.  Based on the input of our readers,  I've come to the conclusion that in systems with capitated care (i.e., a national health system): 1) Our readers are pleased with that, feel it provides better blanket coverage to a large population and the emphasis is more on medicine and less on money.  2) Capitated care is less about service with a smile.  3) Capitated care does a better job with treating populations but may not be the best care for the individual with an outlier problem.  We've heard about systems in Canada, the UK, and Hong Kong, and of course, the USA.  I can't recall whether our Australian readers chimed in.

In today's New York Times, I wanted to give a shout out to a couple of articles about psychiatry. 

Robert Cantu and Mark Hyman have a book out called Concussions and Our Kids, and Dr. Cantu has an op-ed piece in today's paper, "Preventing Sports Concussions Among Children,"  talking about measures we should take to prevent brain injury during routine team sports for children under age 14.  The bottom line: children should not play tackle football, head the ball during soccer, body-check in hockey,  add chin-straps to batting helmets and eliminate head-first slides in baseball, and require helmets for field hockey and lacrosse players.  As psychiatrists, we're rather fond of intact brains.  The authors challenge us to re-think our approach to children's sports.  

The New York Times also has a nice article on the NYPD's Emergency Service Unit, an elite squad of 300 police heroes who talk people off bridges and rooftops.   So far this year, the NYPD has gotten 519 calls for people who are about to jump.   See Wendy Ruderman's, "The Jumper Squad."
