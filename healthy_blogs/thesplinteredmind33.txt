I recently posted a new article about procrastination over at my Family Guy blog. It was originally intended to be about keeping promises, but became about finishing projects. I have this project, you see. A glorious, unfinished project that I’ve been dying on for some time. It’s a rundown, formerly gorgeous dollhouse, and if I’m not careful, my daughter will have daughters before I get around to refinishing it! Three years have passed now since I said I’d finish it by Christmas, so I’ve decided to do something about it.
Projects are easy to procrastinate when they are out of your sight. That’s one reason why the garage never gets cleared out, the taxes in a box under the recyclables you keep meaning to deliver never get filed, and any other number of glorious, unfinished projects that you’ve been meaning to get around to are still waiting for you to get around to them. I’m pretty good about tackling projects, but this one escaped my focus because it was in the garage. Each time I ran into the garage for an errand or something, I’d see the dollhouse and think, “Oh yeah! I gotta do that! But not now!!!” Then I’d forget about it until I went in there again. In Overcome Procrastination: Why ADHD Adults Do It, How Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Can Change It, I cover the steps I usually take to break the long chain of procrastinated days. I hope you find them useful.
I may cover the steps I took to complete the project and post about it here. Or I may forget again. Christmas is eleven months away anyway, right?
