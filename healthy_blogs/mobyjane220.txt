Dear A. B. Curtiss

I read extensively in several disciplines (among which is psychology) and have amassed a fairly respectable library. Were I to rank all my books according to how effectively they dealt with their topic, Depression is a Choice would be at, or very near, the top. I am in my fourth reading since acquiring the book in, I believe, 2000. After my first reading, my focus has been not so much on depression, but on “choice.” (I wouldn’t even hazard a guess as to how many times I’ve read page 89.)

I say all the foregoing to introduce the following question: Have you ever considered, or would you consider writing a book on “choice,” not just as it pertains to depression, but as it pertains to all of life? I have come to the conclusion that “choice” is a marvelous and sizeable treasure that is simply handed to us long before we are capable of handling it responsibly. It has become disgustingly common and popularly acceptable for people, when confronted by their difficulties or failures, to deny the existence of choice or their misuse of it. Refusal to accept personal responsibility is so prevalent that, in my  opinion, it has become an element of our culture. Who knows if a book on the topic would change anything, but believe me, if I had credentials that would lend credibility to such a work, I’d try it myself. I hope you will give this serious consideration.

Thank you for Depression is a Choice. A applaud you for your honesty, and for mustering the courage to bare yourself to your readers.

Very Sincerely,

R.G.S.

Dear R.G.S.

Your letter encouraged me to read page 89 myself.  It’s good to be reminded, even for me. It is always a danger when we think we “know it all” already, and cease to remember that each day is new and therefore,  each day we see things not as they are, but as we are that particular day.  A. B. Curtiss
