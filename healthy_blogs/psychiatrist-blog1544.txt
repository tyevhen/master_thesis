Hey, you've gotta get over and see SHP's Grand Rounds for this week.  She has done a great job of introducing each post with an haiku.  
Example (NeoNurseChic will like this one):

How to Cope With Pain

Also, if you have a Medscape account (they are free) then you can read Nick Genes' interview with SHP, talking about how her bipolar disorder affects her writing and also about the NHS problem in Great Britain.
