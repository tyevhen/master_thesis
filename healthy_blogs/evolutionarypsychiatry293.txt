Very excited to announce Jamie Scott's podcast over on Carbohydrates Can Kill.  I think the turning point happened when he realized that it would be incredibly difficult to burn off 5g per kg of recommended athlete carbohydrate intake per day and still keep a day job.  Best, I think, to eat like a human, not a hummingbird, when it comes down to it.  Great interview!
