Since 2012,  our district has participated in an annual college application day.  Each high school has designated days in November where school counselors, volunteers, and college representatives host an Apply to College Early event for high school seniors and their families. This year, one of our schools is even extending our application day to include a Saturday. Have you wanted to host your own event?  Well, you are in luck because this event has gone national!  This year, the White House has proclaimed November as National College Application Month.  Want to know more about this event?  Check out this month's High School Counselor Chat hosted by Amber Shepherd Thompson. Also, I have added some additional resources for high school counselors to use when working with their college bound seniors!
