I came to Shrink Rap to look at the MAOI poll. Please vote on our side bar. As someone who hasn't prescribed MAO Inhibitors, I'm learning a lot from reader comments on my MAOI post (Thank you to Graham for the inspiration).

Anyway, I realized we now have search bar, Shrink Rap versus Web. Had to be Roy, just had to be. But the funny thing is that wasn't on his To Do List.

If anyone else would like to nag Roy, remind him that we recorded two podcasts with Ray DePaulo, the chairman of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins. Then remind him that we're waiting on his section of the Shrink Rap book so we can look for an agent.

Roy Was Here! He left us a search bar.
