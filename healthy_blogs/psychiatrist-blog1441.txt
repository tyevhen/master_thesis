A couple of things caught my attention today:

An article by Matt Richtel about 24/7 bloggers, some of whom have blogged themselves to death. I'm trying not to be one of them:
Of course, the bloggers can work elsewhere, and they profess a love of the nonstop action and perhaps the chance to create a global media outlet without a major up-front investment. At the same time, some are starting to wonder if something has gone very wrong. In the last few months, two among their ranks have died suddenly.

Also about cyberspace, Virginia Heffernan wrote an article called Soft Cell with ClinkShrink in mind:

Prison Talk, a big board with nearly 150,000 members and 2,500 regular readers a day, is a case in point. It caters to what turns out to be an underserved consumer niche: family and friends of the incarcerated.


ClinkShrink and Roy were kind enough to go computer shopping with me today and we got pizza afterwards. Is there a better way to spend a Sunday?
