Starting 6/1, CMPS will be using an alternative diagnostic system instead of DSM-5.
This will be the only diagnostic system allowed on our new EHR system. See:

The Diagnostic Manual of Mishegas:
potchkied together and .com-piled by 

Jay Neugeboren, Michael B. Friedman, Lloyd I. Sederer M.D. 

THE DIAGNOSTIC MANUAL OF MISHEGAS (DMOM)

The authors cut through the hundreds of categories in the 1000-page D.S.M. by dividing all mental disorders into two realms: mishegas major and mishegas minor. And for each of the sub-categories it analyzes—spilkes major (and spilkes minor), yenta, kvetch, alter kocker, shnorrer, dementia-with-benefits, etc. THE DMOM will enable readers to transform ordinary tsuris and mishegas—the glooms, blues, angsts, and general chazzerie of their lives—into transcendent and easy-to-understand categories. It will turn kvetching into kvelling and guilt into gelt, so that readers will learn to live at peace with their inner mishegas and to treasure its precious and life-giving absurdities.
