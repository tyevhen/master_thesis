My concern is about the number of people and seniors who are over-medicated, which can lead to severe depression or even suicidal thoughts. Always check with your pharmacist to see if your medications are compatable. I am aware of a senior who was put on three antidepressants and a sleep medication. She attempted suicide because of the bad interactions of these four drugs prescribed by her family doctor. A psychiatrist was able to help her get on the right medications. I prefer clients see a psychiatrist for antidepressants because they know how medications interact with each other.
If you are depressed and not on medication, check out some of the natural remedies in Dr. Balch's book, "Nutritional Healing." Fish oil is essential to help overcome postpartum and regular depression. The more alkaline your diet, the less depressed you will be.
Check out other blogs here on "Defeating Depression, Fish Oil,Twenty Tips for Beating the Blues, and other blogs on depression. Also check out the book on Amazon, "Defeating Depression & Beating the Blues."

When I have been depressed, L-Tyrosine, fish oil, B-Vitamins, and Calcium and magnesium have been very helpful. It has been twenty years since I have taken an anti-depressant and even then I had a very bad reaction to the drug.
