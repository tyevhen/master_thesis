EFT- Emotional Freedom Technique

EFT can be used to lose weight, reduce fear, anxiety, and heal the body and spirit.


Verbally measure your pain, fear, anxiety, or whatever problem you have on a scale of one to ten. Ten is feeling really bad, one is very mild.

Find the tender spot about a hands width below the neck and at the end of fingers. It is just above the armpit (about two inches over) and about three or four inches to the inside of your body above your breast bone. Press or massage this spot (the spot will be tender) with your fingers as you say--

1.Now, say, “Even though I am in pain,” I truly love and accept myself.”

2.Begin tapping seven times each, start above the eyebrow.

3.Below the eye

4.Below the nose

5. Below the lips

6. On your side, under your arm pit, about where the bottom of your bra strap will be for women.

7.Find the spot on your hand between your little finger and ring finger and about one inch up between the fingers and tap there as you

8.Move your eyes to the right as you tap seven times

9.Move your eyes to the left as you tap seven times

10.Move your eyes in a rotating circle around your nose to the right

11.Then eyes to the left in a rotating circle

12.Then close your eyes and tap seven times

13.Open your eyes and tap

14.Sing happy birthday as you tap seven times

15.Count to five as you tap

16.Sing happy birthday again

17. Tap to the left of the sore spot

Now measure your pain, or fear –or whatever else on a scale of one to ten. If it hasn’t improved, repeat the tapping process and measure again, on a scale of one to ten.
