Lithium in drinking water significantly lowers suicide risk in men: ow.ly/Ivvbs

Great explanation of NNT --Number Needed to Treat-- versus NNH -Number Needed to Harm. theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/how-…

And the psychiatric quote of the day goes to Allen Frances for, "Advocacy for the mentally ill has been so ineffective in part because it has so split in the often bitter civil war between the medical model and the recovery model."  Read his article about a therapeutic community here, and by the way, I'd like to register to live there -- not as a doc, but as a patient who wakes up to a day of organic farming, exercise, art... sounds nice.  The quote was too long to tweet.
