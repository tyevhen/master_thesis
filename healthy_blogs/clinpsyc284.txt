Lilly has apparently threatened to sue the pants off an individual who disseminated some of its documents regarding the Zyprexa debacle. Health Care Renewal indicated (via a Nature article unavailable to most) that David Egilman, who played a role in getting the infamous documents disseminated may face severe legal sanctions. The kind that cost a lot of money.

The irony is that Lilly claims that the documents which paint a rather awful picture of its off-label marketing (here, here, here, and here) are taken out of context, yet they refuse to make any additional information available. If the documents are out of context, why don't you provide some context? Indeed, they are suing those who tried to disseminate information pertaining to the drug. And let's also not forget about the email exchange where a Lilly employee discussed ways in which a study casting dispersions on the "safety" of Zyprexa could get deep-sixed through nefarious means.
