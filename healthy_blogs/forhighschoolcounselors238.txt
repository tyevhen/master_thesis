It has been almost a year since I started my high school counseling blog and I have received almost 13,000 hits!  Seems like there are a lot of high school counselors out there looking for resources and information.  

In 2014, I am planning some new features for my blog including high school resource giveaways, lesson plans, a high school counselor twitter chat, and some other goodies!  If you have some additional ideas of what you would like to see featured on my blog, please don't hesitate to let me know!  

Look forward to blogging in 2014! 
Happy New Year!!
