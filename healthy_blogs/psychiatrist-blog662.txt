One option was to let the day pass without a blog post.  The other was to say something about the fact that it's September 11th, a day that left so many people so distressed.  It was never an option to post on an unrelated topic.

I find myself pushing thoughts of that day out of my head, and then, periodically, I'm drawn to watching a YouTube video of the towers falling.  Mostly, though, I've had nothing to say because what is there left to say?   It was horrible. 

My patients have not been talking about 9/11.  They all want to tell me where they were during the earthquake that shook us a few weeks ago, and whether they lost power during Hurricane Irene.  I'd asked a former guest blogger who lives in NYC if he wanted to write about 9/11, and he said he'd think about it and I haven't heard back.  Another friend was standing under the towers when they collapsed.  I asked if he'd like to write for a psychiatry blog and he said he'd been unable to write about it, perhaps in his memoir, and last year he left the country on the day.  This was a tragedy that evades words and pulls us to places that are difficult to go.  I want to thank David Hellerstein, again, for writing a guest post for us on Resilience in honor of the anniversary.  When I first read his post, I liked it, but I thought it was about resiliency, and not the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.  Perhaps that is truly the best place to go as we all carry on with hope in our hearts.

And finally,  I'd like to link to a memorial note for for my friend, Carlos DaCosta.

Peace to all.
