Well, it's been an eventful month for me. I started my EMT class and training for a new volunteer opportunity. And I put in my 2-weeks' notice at work (next week will be my last). I didn't set out to make the New Year a mini-rebirth, but I feel like a lot of good changes are coming for me soon.

My week was uneventful (thankfully). I  had my first exam for the EMT class and got a suitable grade. Below are my blogging & reading achievements for the week.
