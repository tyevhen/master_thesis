This site tends to be a little serious, so I thought I would switch gears and offer readers the chance to check out the Gizoogle version of the blog. For those of you not familiar with Gizoogle, it translates sites into a Snoop Dogg version of gangsta slang.

Link is here. May contain language inappropriate for non-thug minors. You'll either fall over laughing or scratch your head in puzzlement.
