QUERY:

It seems I have to go back to the basic tools which I learnt to get out for sometimes which I started from yesterday. 

RESPONSE:

Itâ€™s true for all of us. We need to start all over every day. Start with meditation, gratitude that we are alive and get up and do our best each moment. When we fail one moment, we regroup, gather our wits and begin again with the next moment. This is the great gift of life. Every moment can be a new beginning.
