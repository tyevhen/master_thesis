SCORING

For each "frequently" you checked, give yourself 2 points; for each "occasionally," give yourself 1 point; and for each "never," give your' self 0 points. Total your points for a score in the range of 0 to 50. This is your "emotional eating" score.

INTERPRETATION

This questionnaire is designed to give you a quick view of whether you are an emotional eater. If your overall score (your emotional eating score) is more than 35, it is likely that you have serious trouble with emotional eating, and regardless of what else is working, you must get the self-defeating nature of your emotions under control. If your score is between 15 and 35, you struggle with emotional eating at times, and you have room for improvement. There may be isolated areas, such as stress or depression, in which you can change.
