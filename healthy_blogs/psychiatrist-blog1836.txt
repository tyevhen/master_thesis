Well, it seems we made the switch, but darned if I could tell the difference. Where's the cool drop-down selectors for the archives and for the blogroll?
I'll check out the Template area, maybe there's something there. This whole widget business looks interesting, also. If any of our readers have some good tips about using the new Blogger, especially the widget feature, please comment.
Oh, Dinah is under the weather so we might not make our podcast tomorrow.
