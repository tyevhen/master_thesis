Remember Sam, the student who applied for a competitive internship and didn't know whether to check yes or no for the question about whether he has a psychiatric disorder?  If you forgot the discussion, you can read it here: http://psychiatrist-blog.blogspot.com/2011/11/tell-me-ethical-dilemma.html


I thought I would let you know that Sam checked yes on the box that asked if he had a psychiatric disorder.  I thought I would also let you know that Sam was chosen for the competitive internship.
