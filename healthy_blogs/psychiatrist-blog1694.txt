Lilly is complaining that all the lawyer ads about suing Lilly for diabetes is resulting in pts stopping their meds and relapsing.
Lilly on Wednesday released the results of a company-funded survey that asked 402 psychiatrists who treat patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia to complete an online questionnaire. More than half of the participating psychiatrists said they believed their patients who stopped medication or reduced the dosage did so after seeing lawyers' advertisements about anti-psychotic drugs.
Wonder how many people went on Zyprexa due to Lilly ads?
