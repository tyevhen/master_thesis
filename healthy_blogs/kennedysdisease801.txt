This season, 
I once again pray for peace

Think of what we could accomplish if we worked together for the good of mankind

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
Have a safe, healthy and happy 2018 filled with love

Stay Upright!
And a special thank you to our armed forces and their families 
They sacrifice so much in service to our country
