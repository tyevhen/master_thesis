Hi Art.

We've only really met once and you couldn't understand my Nottingham accent. I got the chance to thank you though and I will tell you there was a lot more behind those two words. Primal therapy saved my life, I believe. Also in making my wife and I more real it enabled us to give the kids a much better childhood than they might have had which is priceless. I find it hard to put into words how grateful I am and how privileged I feel to have been able to do primal therapy and especially to have come to the primal center.

Thank you again, all my best wishes and have a great birthday.

Hi Dr Janov:

In case I forget, happy upcoming 90th birthday.

I would like to again thank you for all your inspiring and important work in psychotherapy. These days, I am re-reading one of the major works of the counter-culture "The Greening of America" by Charles Reich (now about your age), which came out about the same time as "The Primal Scream". I am thankful and in awe that you both were able to create such important works, some clarity and insight within all pervasive neurotic culture which stifles us. It means a lot to me, especially now that I too am getting older.
