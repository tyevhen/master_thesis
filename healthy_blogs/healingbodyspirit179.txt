This is the question I was asked this morning.
Patty's answer: I have recovered from Chronic Fatigue but was able to work--just barely. I had to take medical leave for several months after my last husband died. My doctor wanted to give me medical disablity when he discovered I had CFIDS because I was so ill, but I wouldn't take it. Most days I felt like I had the drop=dead flu. My husband was seriously ill and on dialysis and had no insurance. I had to work, we needed the inusurance. However, in reality I was too exhausted to work. I don't know how I did it. I would go home and flop on the bed and not get up until morning when I had to drag myself out of bed. I slept all weekend. I could never accept that I would have chronic fatigue forever. I had to find a way to get better. I went from doctor to doctor, prayed and prayed, and finally found a doctor who discovered I had candida. That was the beginning of my recovery. Other older blogs explains a little bit about how I recovered. Going to work everyday was like beating a dead horse or dragging one behind me. There was no hurry in me. Still, I was a school counselor and could sit down and counsel students. If I was talking to a teacher or student in the hall, I would lean against the wall. Summers were my refuge, but they were not long enough.
