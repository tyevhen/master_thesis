As the ADA turns 25...

On July 26, 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law, marking an important step forward for individuals with disabilities and their families.  The legislation elevated the importance of equal access for children and adults with disabilities and engaged the country in a conversation about the inherent rights every person has, regardless of ability.  The ADA changed the landscape for people with disabilitiesâ€”it is the primary reason we have accessible parking spaces and building entrances and why those of us with limited mobility can navigate school campuses and access and enjoy public libraries, retail stores, movie theaters and doctors' offices. 

As the ADA turns 25, we come together to celebrate the accomplishments of this legislation while maintaining our focus on continued, collective efforts to protect and enhance the rights of our disability community, where there is still much work to be done.

Being an 'old-timer', I find it difficult to believe that it was only 25 years ago that things started to change for those living with a disability. I still become frustrated when I do not have access to certain buildings or a handicap bathroom is nothing more than two grab bars attached to a normal toilet. Yet, I am thankful for all the changes that have been made to allow me access to facilities including designated parking areas. Probably the biggest change is the mindset of the majority of people. Thank you ADA.
