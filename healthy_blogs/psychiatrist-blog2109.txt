According to a recent post on CNN.com, workers would give up their morning coffee to surf the 'Net. What I'd like to know is how these people can be awake enough to find their computers.

OK, I'll relate this post to psychiatry somehow. Fortunately, I had a link set aside on my browser bar for just such a moment. It's an old post, but a goodie: What De-Institutionalization Means to Jane & Joe Public. This is a post for those of you who struggle to support loved ones with mental illness or wonder what it's like having a mentally ill family member.

Also, tune in for Mike Wallace's last day on the air on 60 Minutes this Sunday. Both he and his wife have publically discussed his struggle with depression.

Meanwhile, given our recent discussion of the Angry Patient, I thought I'd link to a recent study published in the American Journal of Cardiology. This study suggests that people who "tend to experience negative emotions and to inhibit the expression of these emotions in social interactions" are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events. The study refers to a "Type D" personality, although I'm at a loss to know how they validated their "Type D personality scale". I think this finding is more likely explained by the known relationship between clinical depression and cardiovascular disease.

See, I did become relevant eventually...
