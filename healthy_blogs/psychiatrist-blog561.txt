Check out Kaitlin Bell Barnett's blog over on Psych Central.  She's a young journalist who has a book coming out called Dosed: The Medication Generation Grows Up.  Kaitlin interviewed people who've been on medication since they were children/teens and gets their perspectives.  I'm looking forward to reading this one--- it's a really important topic because we know so little about long term treatment of people with developing brains.  She got funding on Kickstarter.com and you can watch her talk about her book on the video above.
