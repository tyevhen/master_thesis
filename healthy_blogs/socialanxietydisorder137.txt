HRB338 is an In-Depth Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine Study (Diagnosis and Treatment) of Anxiety Disorder and Mental Illnesses (Unmad in Ayurvedic Sanskrit), along with examination of related Vata Anxiety Disorders, Pitta Anger Violence Mania, Suicidal Tendencies (Suicide), Kapha Sadness Depression and Melancholy. Comparison - Contrast of Anxiety Depression classical Diagnosis (Assessment), Etiology (Causes), Pathology (Disease Process - Progress) and Treatment (Therapies) in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (T.C.M. or Traditional Oriental Medicine and Acupuncture) and Ayurveda - both styles Indo-Tibetan Buddhist and Hindu Ayurveda with along with Tibetan Medicine (Traditional Ayurvedic Medicine - T.A.M.).
Continuing Education Course Title is:
"One-Earth Therapeutics - Kaya Chikitsa - Integrated Ayurvedic-Chinese-Western Remedies for Anxiety (Atattvabhinivesha), Panic, Post Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), Obsessive Compulsive (OCD) and Depression according to 200 B.C. Charaka Samhita - Level I"
Course Codes are: HRB338, HRB538, HRB638, HRB738
These Hi-Def HDTV videos and the MP3 audio files are the first in a 1.5 trimester unit (22.5 class hours long) series of lectures aimed and comparing, contrasting and synthesizing Anxiety Diagnosis and Anxiety Treatment in both the 2500 year old Chinese Medicine (Zhong Yi or TCM) with the 2500 year old Indian Ayurveda and 1300 year old Tibetan Ayurveda systems (TAM). The goal of this lecture program is to assist the student in seeing and understanding their vast commonalities in both theory (concepts) and practice (clinic) of ancient Indo-Sino-Tibetan psychological - psychiatric therapies in order to learn integrated practice modalities.
This rarely presented synthesis of the healing wisdom of these three great cultures (China, India and Tibet) will not only compare-contrast the theoretical and practical aspects of psychology - psychiatry within the framework of these two time-honored healing systems, but more importantly, will examine in detail the clinical practice aspects of manic - depressive bi-polar treatment - both herbal connections (Indian, Tibetan and Chinese herbs and minerals) and acupressure (Marmas in Ayurvedic Sanskrit) with acupuncture in the Chinese system.
We examine the mind and mental illness from the perspective of the Ayurvedic three doshas (Tridosha - Vata-Pitta-Kapha) and look at their relationship to major concepts in Chinese Medicine that are often spoken of by acupuncturists to their patients. Some of these relationship comparisons include:
1. Vata Dosha (Space and Air - Wind, Cold, Qi Prana in Ayurvedic Sanskrit),
2. Pitta Dosha (Fire and Water - Spleen Qi Jathar Agni in Sanskrit, Heat, Damp-Heat, Blood Rakta Dhatu in Sanskrit, and Yang),
3. Kapha Dosha (Water and Earth - Phlegm-Mucous Ama in Sanskrit, Damp-Cold, Jing Qi Ojas in Sanskrit and Yin).
Commentary on and Lectures from the ancients texts of Indo-Sino-Tibetan Medicine: Chinese Classic of the Yellow Emperor - Huang Di Nei Jing (200 B.C.), Shang Han Lun (150 A.D. traditional Chinese Shang Hn Ln), Divine Farmers Materia Medica (150 A.D. The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic (traditional Chinese Shnnng bencao jing) with Charaka of Patanjali (200 B.C.), Sushruta of Nagarjuna (200 A.D.), Astanga Hridayam of Vagbhata (700 A.D.) and the "Four Tibetan Medical Tantras" (800 A.D. "rGyud - bzhi" in Tibetan, pronounced "Ju Shee" - "Si-Bu-Yi-Dian in Mandarin - in Sanskrit it is called the "Amrta-hrdaya-astanga-guhyopadesa-tantra" or Amrita Hridaya Astanga Guhyopadesha Tantra)
