Who could follow the Obama Health Care reform debates? Thousands of pages and emotions flying high, and it all became a partisan fiasco, where the patients got lost in the reams.

So Kevin MD --- links to How Heath Care Reform Will Affect Mental Health-- a post by blogger Diane Lee at Somebody Heal Me. It's a hopeful and optimistic post about how reform will increase the number of insured, increase access to treatment and medications, shrink donut holes, prevent insurance companies from refusing to insure those with mental illness, and do overall good things for the country. I like optimism.

Are you feeling hopeful?
