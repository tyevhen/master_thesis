Amber Sheppard and Katrina Eisfeldt hosted the first ever High School Counselor chat on August 11th.  The theme of the chat was "New Beginnings for a New School Year".  There was so much excitement by participants that the group decided to have a bimonthly chat every 2nd Monday at 8:30 EST.  If you are interested in joining the next chat, stop by on twitter on September 9th!!
