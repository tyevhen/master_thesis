Over the last few days I've been reading online discussions and blog posts about the Norwegian spree killer and also reading a book on Google about Charles Guiteau, President Garfield's assassin. I thought it was a bit eerie how similarly the arguments sounded for and against insanity, and how little has changed regarding attitudes toward politically-motivated violence in the last 130 years. I put up a post about the topic over on Clinical Psychiatry News. For more, see Political Violence: A Challenge for Forensic Psychiatrists.
