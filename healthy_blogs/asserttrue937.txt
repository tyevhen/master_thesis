While digging around for news/views on JRockit, I happened to stumble onto an XQuery-engine comparative evaluation by (of all people) the Washington Publishing Company, a seller of EDI and HIPAA publications. In case you don't have time to wade through the full study (which is a good read, incidentally), the bottom line is, for maximum performance, robustness, and flexibility, you want the Saxon engine running atop the BEA JRockit JVM.
