5 year throwback.
I miss you Grandma!

This week wasn't as eventful as last week. I started working with my boss to have a smooth transition out - though I'm leaving him in a tight spot, so the transition won't be much easier than if I strolled out in the middle of the day and never came back. I caught the stomach flu from my sister and was sick a couple of days. Spent a nice Olive Garden dinner with a friend, and that's about it!
