Some time ago I had back surgery. I wanted pain killers afterward for a lot of pain. Sorry, they said, the medical committee had come in and shut down heavy pain killers because of the possibility of abuse. So we all suffered. We suffered because men from the state capitol, who obviously managed to cover their pain, decided we didn’t need it. Today in the N.Y. Times is a story about the same thing. Washington State has pretty much decided the same thing. The abuse they say is too widespread, and it may be, but what about those who need it and are not abusing it? How can they tell the difference? Did they know how much pain killers I need? No they don’t. Only I do and I do. They doctor from that state who shall remain nameless, decided that we have to cut down on drugs. There is a picture of him in the paper; he is very very fat. So he manages to cut down on pain by stuffing his face with food, while he doesn’t like us to take pills to do the same thing. Shame.

Is it possible that more and more of us are in pain? Is it possible we need it? Do people who are not in pain compulsively take pain killers? I doubt it. Why on earth would they? Why do people stuff food down? Do they need it? They seem to. If we stopped them they would be in plenty of pain; then they would need pills; then they would know what pain was about. Alas, they can eat and never find out.
