I attended Dr. Russell Sabella's workshop titled "Going Gaga for Google" at ASCA14. Dr. Sabella is a Google god and I could not wait to share the contents of his workshop with you.  Here is the link to the workshop content from Google Docs and I have attached some additional resources from Dr. Sabella.
