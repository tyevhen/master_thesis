Longtime American activist for LGBT rights, Chastity Chaz Bono, born to Sonny & Cher, is beginning the process of transitioning from female to male. Bono says he will avoid being in the lens of the public eye as surgery and reassignment proceed, but hopes that his journey will educate others.

Having a healthy gender identity means that a person experiences harmony with their sense of self and their own physical sex. However, Transgender people find their sense of self differs from their physical sex. There is anguish about being in the wrong body. Research over many years has shown that there is a strong genetic base that underscores gender issues.
I hope this journey will bring Chaz Bono a sense of peace and help others understand and celebrate the differences in us all.
