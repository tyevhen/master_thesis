I'm so encouraged by how well I feel today. My back problem seems completely healed. Even if the anxiety comes back now and then I think that I'm in good shape to handle any setback. But I did get a taste of how difficult it is to do brainswitching when you are really anxious. As with anything else, our intention that we can be well and healthy puts us on the road to recovery. Thanks again for all your cards and letters of encouragement. We are a resource for each other. A. B. Curtiss
