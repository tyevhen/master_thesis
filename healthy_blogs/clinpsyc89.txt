Philip Dawdy at Furious Seasons has noted that Eli Lilly released a short report in which they describe the funding they provided to a variety of organizations. All in the name of science and charity, of course. Beneficiaries of Lilly's largess include:
The American Psychiatric Association
Massachusetts General Hospital's Psychiatry Department
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill
Medscape
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
Center for Medical Knowledge
Continuing Medical Education, LLC
Institute for Continuing Healthcare Education
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Postgraduate Institute for Medicine
University of California -- Irvine
These were just some of the big recipients. The report itself is well worth checking out. One will note that Lilly is kindly funding a lot of "education" about fibromyalgia just as they try to move Cymbalta for all things pain-related. The amount of "education" regarding bipolar disorder is also instructive. Um, Viva Zyprexa?

Read some of the details at Furious Seasons and read Lilly's report as well. To Lilly's credit, at least they are making an attempt at disclosure; their industry colleagues are more than welcome to follow suit. Remember that the figures from Lilly's report are from the first quarter of 2008 only.
