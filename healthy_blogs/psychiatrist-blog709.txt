This is the first My Three Shrinks podcast since the publication of our book, Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work.   We had a little production glitch and the podcast is a bit slow for the first two minutes, and it's a bit shorter than our usual.

We talk about the process of writing the book and the issues that physicians fact when writing about their patients and whether this is different for psychiatrists versus other physicians.  Clink talks about her post Doctors Who Write and discuss the dilemma doctors face when writing about their patients.
We talked about how we chose names for our characters in the vignettes.
An article called  Inside Higher Education, Cornell Proposes Nets for Gorge Bridges got us to revisit a topic we haven't talked about in several years: suicide on college campuses.   We mentioned the case of an MIT student whose family sued the university after she died from suicide.
Roy talked about AADPRT (he likes acronyms) which obviously stands for American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Training and their link on how to use social media.  Roy notes that he is growing old (the rest of us aren't) because he began a Schizophrenia researcher Listserv twenty years ago on Gopher.
In the next podcast, we answer reader questions: Sarebear wants to know what a "nervous breakdown" is and we respond to a question about how it may be harder to make psychiatric diagnoses in people with co-existing autism. But we didn't talk about those things in this podcast.
