Don’t forget about the KDA Forum. 



The forum is a place where you can ask and answer questions, give your thoughts and opinions, and learn more about living with Kennedy’s Disease. I visit the forum several times a week and am always amazed at the quality of the content. Participation is voluntary, but there are always ‘regulars’ and usually one or two new members willing to impart or gain some knowledge.



Yes, ‘members’. However, you don’t need to sign up if you are just searching or reading the forum. If you want to participate (ask, answer, etc.), you will need to sign up.


Give the KDA Forum a try and let me know what you think about it.
