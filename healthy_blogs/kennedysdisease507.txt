My wife and I spent several hours last night watching the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. This morning we started watching the news again still trying to absorb what has happened.

We cannot imagine what the parents, family and friends went through, are going through today, and will continue to go through for years to come. And, we thank God that the teachers were able to respond in an intelligent and calm manner to protect and then evacuate their students.

Of course, we all ask ‘why did this happen’ and ‘how could this happen’? And, even when we have the answers we will never really understand. Our conscious mind just cannot digest something as horrible as this.

As a nation, and across the world, our hearts reach out to this community. We pray for them, no matter what our beliefs.

At a time like this I think of John Lennon’s song, ‘Imagine’.

“… Imagine all the people living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us and the world will be as one”
