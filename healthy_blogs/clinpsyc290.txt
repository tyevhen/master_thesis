I bow down to Peter Rost. Why? Let's see... He broke the latest AstraZeneca Arimidex off-label marketing scandal. Rather than being a one-time story, it has continued to unfold, looking worse and worse for AZ. Rost continues to serve up hot AZ insider information, as the scandal grows wider in scope. He has also backed up his brand of investigative journalism with evidence (here and here) that points quite directly at AZ marketing their product in an off-label fashion. And the plot continues to thicken, as you can see here.

Keep up the good work Peter!
