Well, my first week of tests for the EMT class is over. These were just practice tests - one practice test for the EMT certification exam and one for the National Registry practicum. I did adequately in both, and am hoping to pass both real exams soon. On next Monday I take the real practicum, on Wednesday I take the class final exam, and sometime in the next month I'll take the NREMT (certification exam). Then I can start looking for an EMT position!

Additionally, I took a part-time job as a medical scribe. It's apparently another great way to prepare for a physician's assistant program. Unfortunately, it requires 30 hours of unpaid, online training, which is due two weeks from Wednesday. I may not have enough time to get through all of it while I'm studying for my last week of EMT class. We'll see!
