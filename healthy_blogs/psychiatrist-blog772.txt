In case you missed it, we were on Dr. A's BlogTalkRadio show last night-- Family Medicine Rocks hosted by Dr. Mike Sevilla. Sarebear and Crazy Girl called in-- it was fun! And we got to ramble about our book and what went on behind the scenes, with a shout out or two to our oh-so-tolerant editor, Jackie.

If you missed it, don't worry, it's preserved for all time on the internet and here's the link to the Family Medicine Rocks website/blog with all the info. Mike writes:

We had a great conversation about the origins of the book, the process of editing/finalizing the book, and how they didn't kill each other during this process - Hehe.
The setup for the book is interesting that they wrote fictional characters to explain how psychiatric patients are taken care of. For example, since Roy takes care of hospital based patients, his section talked about that. Clink is a forensic psychiatrist and she tacked questions like "What's it like in a prison setting?" And, Dinah is in private practice and she talked about issues like "What it's like inside the walls of a psychiatrist office during an appointment."
Oh, but I cheated just a little and changed Roy and Clink back to Roy and Clink, just for our Shrink Rap blog (they've long ago outed themselves...).
