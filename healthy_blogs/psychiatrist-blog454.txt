Our society values the qualities that go with extroversion.  You're supposed to be social, to get out, to collaborate, to gain energy from social events, and if you don't, damn it, well you're an introvert, or shy, or avoidant, or socially phobic.  "I wish Johnny got out more."  "I wish granny would go to the senior center."  We grow up believing that boys shouldn't wear dresses, that it's your fault if you're fat, and that it's of the utmost importance be outgoing.  Now introverts often do play well with others (Clink, in fact, plays very well, but don't ever try to get her to go out with you after she's in her pj's).  So I know several people who have gained some comfort from the book "Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking" (that would be me, except of course on our podcasts where Clink just won't shut up).  So ClinkShrink enjoyed Susan Cain's book and even wrote a review of it HERE.  I found this TED talk by Susan Cain -- it's cute, funny, and insightful, so I thought I would share it. If you have other TED talks you've enjoyed, please do give me the links.  They don't need to be about psychiatry, but I enjoy funny and thought-provoking.  Thanks to Laszlo, I found this on his facebook feed.
