Today we had our second annual Shrink Rap Segway Roll. It was great. We were joined by our new Shrink Rap friend and human sacrifice afficionado, Victor. Roy got to try a Segway for the first time and I have to tell you, he was a natural. He was running practice rings around those orange traffic cones like he was born with a gyroscope in his feet. Dinah and I did our Segway roll last year so we were both already licensed but it was still nice to have a quick refresher. They didn't make us work our way up to top speed like they did last year, which was nice, however all involved Segwayers wanted to go faster than the machines would allow. Dinah had an unfortunate experience with her machine, which occasionally whined and sputtered like a finnicky horse before dying. Why are we not surprised this happened to Dinah? Eventually she traded for a new machine. I'm thinking it's bad technology karma brought on by washing her cell phone.

The tour was followed by a nice lunch overlooking the harbor, then a delightful afternoon of podcasting attended by another special guest and podcaster. (How's that for a teaser?) Roy took the picture here, as well as some video that will get linked as soon as he has a chance to put it up. Now we are truly multi-media.
