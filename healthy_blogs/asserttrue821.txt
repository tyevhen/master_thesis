There was an outbreak of the bogus "visiting this web site may harm your computer" warning-page redirection on Google this morning. Apparently there have been occurrences of this phenomenon before (judging from blogs going back to 2007). You run a search on Google, and all of a sudden every hit has a warning link under it that says "visiting this web site may harm your computer", and if you try to go to the page in question, you get directed to a Google warning page that urges you not to go to the actual page you want.

On Twitter, people began labelling the problem #GOOGLEMAYHARM, which of course is phonetically similar to GOOGLE MAYHEM.

Naturally, I went to work on a Greasemonkey script to fix the situation. And naturally, in the time it took me to write the script, Google fixed the silly redirection thing.

In any event, if you are seeing the "harmful site" warning, here's a Greasemonkey script that should allow you to bypass the Google redirection page:

// ==UserScript==
// @name           GoogleHitFixer
// @namespace      fixer
// @include        http://www.google.com/*
// ==/UserScript==

// Routes around the bogus warning page that says
// "visiting this web site may harm your computer"

( function main( ) {

    var signature = "interstitial?url";

    var address = location.toString( );

    if ( address.indexOf( signature ) == -1 )
       return;
 
    var newUrl = address.split( "?url=" )[1];

    location.href = newUrl;
