Girls on the Run is a life-changing, non-profit program for girls in 3rd through 5th grade. Our mission is to educate and prepare girls for a lifetime of self-respect and healthy living. We do this by combining training for a 5K (3.1 miles) running event with healthy living education.
Our program instills self-esteem and strong values through life skills development, health education, mentoring and physical training. Our active collaboration with girls and their parents, schools, volunteers and community helps make this happen.
In five years, the Kent County Girls on the Run program has grown rapidly. More than 700 girls participated in the 2009 season. We also hosted a Girls on Track program for middle school girls at two of our sites in 2009. Girls on Track members train toward a running goal in conjunction with age-appropriate discussions about topics such as eating disorders, alcohol and tobacco use, personal/Internet safety and harassment.
This is more than a running program. Were here to encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development in girls.

Commonly question about Nice Signs Of Eating Disorders photos
Question :
Is this a bad thing to do?
I am sixteen and I have dealt with bad anxiety and a eating disorder. I don t have anorexia, I am not underweight. According to my BMI, I am 22, a healthy range.

I have tried starvation and purging and it makes me depressed and sick. So I am over this. The thing that brought it on, was mostly by my family. Not my family that I live with, they are nice to me. My aunts and my grandmother. I have two cousins that are 18 and they are models and are absolutely gorgeous, they both have a fast metabolism, so they are naturally skinny.

I was very jealous of them and felt so ugly. But I am over this and I learning to deal with it. My aunties always compare our body shapes to each other. Apparently according to a dietician and fitness trainers, because I am a marathon runner. I have an athletic build. I have very muscly thighs that I have hated. But nothing will get rid of them, unless I stop exercising but I will not give up netball and running.


So what I did was a took a photo, which I will provide a link. I am holding a sign telling them how I feel. My family all has flickr, so I am going to post it on there to show them, that they should stop comparing my body and lay off me. Am I making the wrong choice? I just feel like its the only thing that will work without me talking to them in person.

Answer :
Sorry I couldn t see the photo but I think it s a great idea. I can kinda relate I have two cousins who I am close with and love to death that have naturally quick metabolisms and are tall and thin like models (without barely having to exercise) whereas I am more curvy with the inclination to be either muscular (in the calves) just chubby.

Is there a reason why you don t want to talk to them in person? That may be the best way as it will keep a family matter within the family and won t complicate anything. However if you feel this is the only way to make them listen or that you re comfortable with then go for it.
Question :
Do I have a right to be angry with my parents when this was my abusive childhood and subsequent problems?LONG?
I m an adult with a wonderful husband and 4 children, top in the uk at my job and all is pretty good There are some reasons that I m very angry with my parents. I need objective opinions from you please, as to whether I have the right to feel angry and I want to know what you think about the things that happened? Long! But if you the time..x Thankyou x

My parents have always given the impression of a nice successful happy family. But that is far from the truth! Firstly my dad spent my whole life at work or on his computer and my mum worked day and night. I was totally ignored day by day, except my dad occasionally jeered at me, and he took naked photos of me and my older sister aged 4-9 which I later found alongside porn stash. And he would sometimes lose his temper and be quite violent towards me (strangling. kicking when I argued back) though not my sisters. I had to do a paper round to buy second hand clothes, and walk/ bus everywhere and yet my sisters were lavished with expensive designer stuff and cheuffered around. My mum divulged a couple of affairs to me at a young age. She has always dumped everything on me. She told me she could read my mind, so as a child I would control my thoughts to gain her approval. I was constantly under threat I d go to a childrens home which I imagined was a place where I d be tied up like dog. I was extremely bright and had the chance to take my exams at age 12 instead of 16 but my parents declined, and also said they wouldnt put me through uni, but they put my other sisters through uni, gave them driving lessons, let them live with them into adulthood whereas I was told to leave at 17 after coming home from hospitalisation from an eating disorder, and that I could sleep on a park bench for all they cared.
My mum witnessed me being touched in my underwear during a medical at school when I was 4 (it was a routine thing they did but I was deeply disturbed by it). At the same time, unbeknown to my parents, I was mildly sexually abused by my best friends stepdad (who was later convicted of abuse towards her) because we used to play around unsupervised back in the 80s.I developed anxiety,poor school performance, nightmares and paranoia and sexual behaviour. Bizarrely I felt ugly and unwanted because my friends stepdad abused her more than me.
When I was 11 our doctor straddled me and felt my newly formed breasts in front of my mum during an examination for a heart condition which I believe was probably anxiety. My mum said "That was all a bit unneccessary!" and nothing was ever said again. She let me return unaccompanied a year later to that doctor for a routine gp appointment, where he abused me.

I went on to suffer from severe anorexia, bulimia, ocd and excercise addiction from which it s a miracle I survived let alone fully recovered! My friends mum first took me to the doctor, but he was reluctant to refer me for treatment as I suspect he was worried the abuse would be detected, so once the condition worsened to near death, my nan who was a nurse managed to get me admitted via A&E because my pulse and BP were so low they were barely detectable. I remember at the stae of near death wanting to eat a bowl of cereal and my mum removing it saying that if the nurses saw they wouldnt believe I was ill (I was a skeleton waiting to die with barely a pulse or blood pressure at that point so it was obvious I was ill).
My parents got me to sign an insurance policy over to them which secured a large sum for each night I was hospitalised. My dad promised if I recovered he d give me 1000 of it which I intended to use for a holiday and he promised he d fulfill my dream of a flying trip. It was an incentive that helped me a little along the way to recovery but of course he never did what he promised. They spent the money on their house and a few months after I returned from hospital they kicked me out, and my bulimia then spiralled out of control and I started taking party drugs and drinking. I can t believe I survived!
There is a lot more to this but these are the main reasons for my angst. They should have loved me and protected me, not ignored me and put me down or put me in trouble or used and manipulated me. I want to go back to that time and give Me a hug and tell me my life would turn out just fine in the end.
I haven t been dwelling on my childhood, but I ve just recently been able to see clearly the reason for my eating disorder and my descent into an unhealthy early adulthood. I ve made it my own way and I m finally free from my mental illness by working my way though life and from the love for and from my husband and children.
I m at a final stage where I want to say all this to my parents and tell them I m angry that it s taken me til my 30s to overcome their crap parenting.
But do you think thay can argue back that it wasn t that bad? Being honest? Do I have a right to feel a
Answer :
You have the right to feel any way you want. If you choose to be angry at your parents than you ll have to bear the burden of that anger.

Carrying that kind of anger around will eat you up. You re an adult with 4 children. You have an example to set and trust me when I say your kids pick up on way more than we realize. If you choose to be angry, they re going to feel it, sense it, and react to it.

Until you talk to your parents and tell them that how they raised you still hurts you, and bothers you to this day, you ll never be able to move forward. Let them know what it is, and why it bothers you. Once you get it off your chest you ll be able to figure out where you stand. Carrying this around as long as you have should show you that time doesn t change those feelings, but expressing how you feel will.

You re now a parent. You ve made parenting mistakes along the way. Mistakes do NOT include abuse. Sexual, physical, verbal, and emotional. Parents cannot undo the damage done by those types of abuse. Kids can heal but they have to have love and support to do it. As we grow older our memories fade but they never go away. We carry more with us into adulthood than we realize and usually it will appear in our behavior and social ability with other people.

Sometimes it s easier to write a letter. It gives you the chance to think about what to say. Change things that don t come out right. Express all your feelings instead of getting caught up in the moment. When we share conversations we tend to cut people off as we try to make a point or argue our point. We start in one place and end up completely off subject. I suggest writing your parents a letter. It also gives them something in their hands to re-read and refer to. Tell them you d like to discuss it further in person. Hopefully they ll be willing to do that. If they don t respond, or don t reply, or deny anything ever happened you need to be ok with that. You don t have to like it or agree with it, but you can be ok with moving you, your husband, and your children forward without any lingering childhood skeletons in the closet coming along for the ride.
