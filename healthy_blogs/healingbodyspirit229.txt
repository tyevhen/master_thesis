First of all, always have snacks that include foods like cucumber, celery, jicima, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, avocado, grapefruit, raw greeb, yellow or red pepper slices, almonds, pumpkin seeds and pine nuts to snack on. There is no limit to the number of vegetables you can eat.
