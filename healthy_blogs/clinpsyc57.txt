Some good material is coming. Unfortunately, it involves the same old people doing the same old tricks. But the scandal factor is reasonably high, so I assure that regular readers will not be disappointed.

In the meantime, check out another hot, hot psych blog: The MacGuffin. This fellow anonymous mental health blogger hates bad science. We're peas in a pod that way.

Furious Seasons updates us on the FDA and child bipolar disorder.

As per usual, the Scientific Misconduct Blog has items related to scientific misconduct. Questions surrounding the behavior of a so-called regulatory agency and drug safety are brought to the fore yet again.

Findings from my latest investigations will hopefully be unveiled soon. Stay tuned!
