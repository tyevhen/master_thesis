Inspired by Carrie's comments...
Carrie had wondered why her doc never put her on an antidepressant. She wrote: "God knows most days I wonder why not. LOL "
I replied: "It's because of the 'LOL'. If you couldn't LOL then maybe he would. Of course, if you were ROFLYAO, then he'd probably reach for the lithium."

This exchange got me thinking... hmm... how would a psychiatrist manage someone who could only communicate via emoticons? Below are the resulting progress notes...
