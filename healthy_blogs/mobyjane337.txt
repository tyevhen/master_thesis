Dear A.B Curtiss 

I started every day morning doing green frog for 30 minutes and then the belly breathing exercise from the brain switch book. 

It works for me best than any other one in short time. I appreciate the effort you spend for helping us.


Thanks a lot, R_______

Dear R_______

You are most welcome. I'm glad you are doing so well. A. B. Curtiss
