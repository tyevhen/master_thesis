 Yes, it is true.  I made the decision not to go to ASCA15 this year and it was difficult.  In this post, I will share why I made the decision and how I can still stay connected to the conference.


 ASCA14 in Orlando was awesome!  I got to meet up with my tweeps (I will miss seeing them this year), I presented at a preconference workshop, I heard the First Lady speak, I got to be searched by the Secret Service, and most of all, I learned a lot of great information to take back to my school. 

Me at the 2014 Tweet Up!

I made it rain in my presentation...literally.  The roof leaked.
Initially, I had planned to go to ASCA15, but I have the opportunity to attend the Innovative Counseling Strategies National Conference in my hometown of Atlanta.  Since both conferences are during the same time, I had to make a quick decision about which one I wanted to attend.  This year, my hometown won out and I will be staying in the ATL!

However, I realize that I don't have to miss the great information that will be shared at ASCA15!  There are several opportunities to listen to and be part of the action in Phoenix and I want to share them with you in case you cannot attend the conference as well.

Since I can't make the conference...

1.  I can view information about the sessions online or through the ASCA app!
2.  I can register as a virtual attendee.  Although the virtual sessions are $199, you get a lot of "bang" for your buck! Here are the scheduled programs:
