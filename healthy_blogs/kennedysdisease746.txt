Living with Kennedy's Disease, or any progressive disorder, is challenging. It is also a learning experience. It is easy to become caught up in the 'feeling sorry for yourself" mode. But, all that does is make life for you and your loved ones miserable.



Many years ago I came across this poem, "The Man in the Glass," by Peter Dale Wimbrow, Sr.

When you get what you want in your struggle for self
and the world makes you king for a day.
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself
and see what that man has to say.

For it isn't your father, mother or wife
whose judgement upon you must pass.
The fellow whose verdict counts in your life
is the one staring back from the glass.

He’s the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,
For he’s with you clear to the end,
And you’ve passed your most  difficult test,
If the man in the glass is your friend.

You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,
And get pats on the back as you pass,
But the final reward will be heartache and tears,
If you’ve cheated the man in the glass.

The point of this journey is the journey itself. It can only be successful if you live in a way that allows you to enjoy the life you are given.
