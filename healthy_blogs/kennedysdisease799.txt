The Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, said, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant in life.‚Äù He felt things are always changing, and we need to plan for and be ready for it when it happens.

My wife goes crazy this time of year decorating the house. And, I love it. She is so creative. The house comes alive with the Spirit that is Christmas. Interestingly, she is never quite satisfied with what she does. Often, in a day or two, things are moved or rearranged in such a way that it is new again.

This year, she has gone over-the-top. There will be nineteen of us here for Christmas. I know the last few days will be stressful for her as she prepares the meal, but right now, she is still rearranging things.  üòá

It draws an analogy to what happens to those of us living with Kennedy‚Äôs Disease. We find ourselves constantly changing how we do things to accommodate our current capabilities. And, since KD is a slowly progressing disorder, we never seem to run out of opportunities for change. What worked last year, no longer accomplishes the task. What currently works, might not work in a year or two, so we had better be looking for ways to adapt.

There are some blessings to be derived from this. We cannot afford to become lazy or complacent. We must constantly explore opportunities and find other ways to accomplish things. In some ways, it is the gift that keeps on giving.

From one early adapter to another, I wish you a‚Ä¶

SAFE, HEALTHY & HAPPY HOLIDAYS
