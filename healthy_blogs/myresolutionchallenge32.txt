If you scroll down any social media feed you will find an abundance of memes with a variety of quotes – some are inspirational, some humorous, and some are very thought provoking.

I share quite a few of these on my Resolution Challenge Facebook page. Not because it fits my personal needs – although, some days these affirmations have been spot on! – I share them in the hope that they’ll help someone else.

When I ran my holistic health business, my clients were always at the forefront of my mind. If I read an inspiring article, I would save it as I knew it might resonate with one of my ladies. When I heard about a new meditation class or spiritual workshop, I would forward the details to the people I knew would enjoy these events.


Social media is the perfect platform to share good intentions far and wide as you just don’t know who you might help along the way.

Today I’m sharing my ten favourite memes taken from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and I hope one, or all of them, resonate with you. Enjoy x
