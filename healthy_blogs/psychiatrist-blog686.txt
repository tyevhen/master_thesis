I periodically check Amazon.com to see if anyone has written any new reviews on our Shrink Rap book.  I've noticed over time that the price of the paperback varies.  It started at $12.96, then one day it was $14.96, and today it's $10.97.    Why not $10.96? or $10.99?  Well, today if you'd like to buy our book, you can get it for $10.97 on Amazon.  I guess I'll have to see what it's going for on Barnes & Noble.....
