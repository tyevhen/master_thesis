Brian Clark wrote on Copyblogger back in 2006 about "10 Sure-Fire Headlines That Work." This is a classic article on how to write headlines that make people want to read the article or click on the link.  I came across it just as Dinah was reminding us that Shrink Rap's 3-year anniversary is coming up on April 22, and this post here is our 984th post.

"Wouldn't it be cool if our 1000th post was on our 3rd anniversary?"

So, I came up with the idea that our final posts should have "Sure-Fire Headlines That Work."  So, stay tuned for our final posts in our triennial millenium.
