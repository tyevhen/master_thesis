I planned on only having quarterly reviews of my dutasteride experience. In the last two months, however, I received several emails asking how it was going. For that reason, I felt others might be interested in an update.
 
Two Month Update
Exercise: I averaged 90-95 minutes every other day with 15-20 minutes on the alternate days.

Strength: My neck, arm and leg strength has been the best in over a year … every day.

Highs & Lows: None! I has been ‘steady as you go’ every day. That, in itself, is wonderful.

Side Effects: Nothing negative that I can determine.

Overall: I find it hard to believe how good I feel every day. The best word I can use is ‘amazing’.
  Fourteen Months and Counting
Is has been fourteen months since I started taking dutasteride. The day I started I also began a journal to record my experiences. The journal has been helpful in evaluating how dutasteride works for me.

These last two months have been actually better than my first three months … and those days were very good.
