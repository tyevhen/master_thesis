A prior post regarding the Paxil/Seroxat for adolescent depression debacle focused on an academic who seemed to have acted as a huckster for GlaxoSmithKline. He could have been naïve or he could have been on the take or some combination thereof. In any case, his behavior does not reflect well on the academic research community.
However, I want to take this opportunity to publicly give praise where it is due. Dr. David Healy was also interviewed on Panorama and I will provide two quotes (according to my transcription of the episode), the nature of which few in academia have the guts to say publicly.
If you heard the experts talk, they all said the drug was extremely safe and very effctive. We were all hoodwinked, misled, duped. They use these clinical trials which appear to be evidence and they aren’t – they’re adverts.
[Later in the broadcast]
…people who are ill generally have been deeply betrayed by the whole process, deeply betrayed by the pharmaceutical companies and by all the experts that have been willing to actually lend their names to the process.
I give Healy oodles of credit for making the above statements. Making much softer statements than those above ended up costing him a lucrative academic job in the past. It is a sad state of affairs when people such as myself feel the need to write anonymously when questioning the interface between marketing, academia, and science. This makes the public statements by Healy all the more commendable.
