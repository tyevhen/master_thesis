Today I received a letter from Dr. Robert Young about Vitamin D research (I think it refers to Vitamin D-3) and I just want to share a few lines: "Low vitamin D status is linked to a number of different conditions," said James C. Fleet, Ph.D. professor in the department of foods and nutrition at Purdue University. "These include certain cancers, muscle weakness and types I and II diabetes--possibly even schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis."
What most interested me was the mention of schizophrenia. In my studies, there is some indication that bipolar disorder and some schizophrenia's have responded well to fish oil (The Omega 3 Connection by Dr. Andrew Stoll). Also, there is some research indicating that candida can contribute to both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
Dr. Carl C. Pfieffer, a psychiatrist in the field of nutritional research, and author of the book,"Nutrition and Mental Illness," treated more than 25,000 mentally ill patients successfully with nutrition. Blood tests were taken to determine deficiencies in the patient.
Wouldn't it be awesome if a combination of fish oil, vitamin D-3, proper nutrition and getting rid of candida could help reverse schizophrenia and other mental health symptoms? Research indicates that many patients with dementia have inadequate nutrition and some have too much aluminum in their body (some from taking antacids). How I wish that people didn't have to deal with the trauma and pain of mental illness and the side effects of some medication.
There is so much more that needs to be researched in the field of mental health and nutrition.
Please do not misunderstand me. I do not recommend that people with mental health problems go off their medication. My greatest nightmare as a therapist is when patients who are bipolar or schizophrenic decide to go off their meds. Don't go off medication unless your physician recommends it and guides you through the process.
