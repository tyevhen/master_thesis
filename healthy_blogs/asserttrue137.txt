Correction 4/15/2015: Text stands corrected. Graph unchanged.

April 15 is tax-filing deadline day in the U.S., so I thought it might be a good time to show this graph from Citizens for Tax Justice. It should be helpful for, say, presidential candidates who need to debate whether the tax situation in the U.S. is "fair."


The bottom 20% of earners make 3.2% of the income and pay 2% of the nation's taxes, while the top 1% make 22.2% of all income while accounting for 23.8% of taxes. Note that the "taxes" tallied here include all taxes, not just income tax.

Candidates: please discuss.
