A Canadian woman lost her disability benefits because her insurer found her smiling, and vacationing, face up on her Facebook page. See details Here.

The article notes:
"In the moment I'm happy, but before and after I have the same problems" as before, she said.
B--- said that on her doctor's advice, she tried to have fun, including nights out at her local bar with friends and short getaways to sun destinations, as a way to forget her problems.
She also doesnâ€™t understand how Manulife accessed her photos because her Facebook profile is locked and only people she approves can look at what she posts.
It kind of reminds me of Roy's post: Wipe that smile off your face. Thanks to Meg for the link!
