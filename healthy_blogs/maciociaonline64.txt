To European practitioners and public: please sign this petition from the Alliance for Natural Health to save herbal medicine in Europe. Bring the battle to your elected representatives: they, not the so-called regulatory agencies, are ultimately responsible to reverse this gross infringement of our freedoms.

An EU directive has banned many herbal medicines, denying us safe remedies and feeding the profits of big pharma. Let's raise a massive outcry to push the Commission to reverse the Directive. Let's get to 1 million voices to save herbal medicine. Add your name here:
