It has been several weeks since David returned from India, where he visited six cities. The last was Mumbai,and yes, he stayed in the elegant Taj Mahal Hotel where a beautiful beaded water fountain flowed from a pool in the foyer to the roof top.
Fortunately he came home before the terroist attack inside the hotel, but our heart goes out to those who lost their lives or were injured. Tis the season of "Peace on Earth, Good will to men," and we pray that it may be so.
Sometimes we can have so little to do with what is going on in the world, but we can and do have peace in our home, and in our neighbrohoods and perhaps that is where it can begin with each of us.
