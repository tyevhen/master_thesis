In the October Journal of Clinical Psychiatry appears a “sponsored editorial.” Last time I checked, editorials often reflected the informed opinions of the editorial board or perhaps a knowledgeable guest. But, no, this editorial reflects the opinion of AstraZeneca, maker of Seroquel.
You can see what it looks like to the right. How far do we want to blur the line between marketing and science? If the claims made in this advertorial are true, then perhaps someone should write them up in more detail and submit an article on the topic, rather than giving the hint that the editorial board approves of this non peer-reviewed message. Maybe the editors of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry no longer have standards or maybe it was an oversight. In any case, it is well beyond the standards of acceptable scientific journal editing to allow an advertisement to be labeled as an editorial.
