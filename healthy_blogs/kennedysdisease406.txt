I am getting a pencil neck. The atrophy in the neck region is now evident. I didn’t notice it a couple of years ago, but it has become more prominent within the last nine months. And, with the atrophy I noticed that many evenings and occasionally even in the afternoon my neck muscles just do not want to hold up my head. Sometimes I have cramping or pain, but most of the time it is just weakness that I experience.

I have seen this condition in several others with Kennedy’s Disease and my brother has experienced the problem for the last ten years or so. For some reason I thought I was immune. I continue to perform neck exercises every day and they seem to help, but something has happened recently that I cannot explain.

I attribute some of the problem to working too many hours on the computer. I know that several days this winter I spent more than four hours at the PC without any breaks. A few days I probably spent close to eight hours working at the PC. I found if I spend less time at the computer and schedule more breaks, the neck fatigue is not evident or not quite as bad. This last week I spent an hour or so mid-afternoon in my recliner using a neck pillow (dog-bone). It seemed to help.

My questions for you are:
1. Are you having any neck weakness issues?
2. If so, is there anything that you have found that helps?

I look forward to hearing from you.
