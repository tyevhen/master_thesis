Living with Kennedy's Disease provides its own set of challenges.  I have also found that the older I get, the more I need to keep moving. If I don’t, I stiffen up real quick. Once that happens, it becomes even more difficult to move.

For some reason my wheelchair causes me the most problems. If I sit for more than a couple of hours in my chair, I find it difficult to move when I first stand. Road trips really cause me problems because I am sitting behind the wheel for a few hours and then sitting some more in the chair.

Because of this, I make it a point to move every two hours. The movement might be as simple as just standing next to a counter and walking in place. Or, if I can ‘safely’ stand and reach for something, I do it.

The best thing I ever did was install a grab bar in the bathroom by the commode. Besides using it to help me stand up, it is where I do my standing exercises every morning. And, whenever I go to the bathroom each day, I use the bar to perform 18 steps in place.

Because of these routines, I end up doing several simple and quick exercises throughout the day. It has made all the difference in the world in regards to feeling better and stronger.

I encourage you to develop your own routines to help keep:
You more mobile
Your joints and muscles more flexible
Your blood pumping and your heart stronger
Your lungs functioning at a higher capacity
Feeling better and more engaged.
As always, before beginning any exercise program, please consult with your doctor.
