Hi,

I've been a fan of your blog for awhile, after stumbling upon it a few months ago. Thanks for the great content! We here at Onlinecollege.org take good content seriously, and we recently published an article “10 Professions With the Highest Levels of Depression” that you may be interested in sharing with your readers. For your convenience, here's the link: (http://www.onlinecollege.org/2010/08/02/10-professions-with-the-highest-levels-of-depression/) if you'd like, you can also find the story on our blog home page.  

I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for your time and take care!
