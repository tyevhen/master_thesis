This is Part II of this series of exercises to improve the quality of your life as Kennedy’s Disease progresses causing lifestyle changes. Consider adding at least two-or-three of these exercises that you are comfortable with and practice them daily. As always, consult with your doctor before beginning any exercise program.

Throat and Tongue Muscles

Swallowing issues are something that many of us experience later in life. The thought of not being able to comfortably eat the foods I love bothers me.

And, choking is always a concern for me and my wife. For that reason I practice the following exercises daily … and they seem to really make a difference in my life.

Bite your Tongue: Bite down lightly on your tongue to hold it in position. Swallow ten times (or more) while holding the tongue between the teeth. Perform this exercise every day.
Pucker your Lips: Make the sound “OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO” as you pucker you lips. You should be able to feel your throat muscles vibrate (stretch). Continue until you have to take a breath. Perform ten of these each day.
Stick Out your Tongue: Stick out your tongue as far as it will go. Pull it back inside your mouth fast. Repeat as many times as you can and as quickly as you can.
Vibrate the Throat: Say “MAH-MAH-MAH-MAH” as quickly as you can. Be sure there is an M and an AH each time. Then say “LAH-LAH-LAH-LAH” as quickly and accurately as you can. Perform this routine five times alternating between the sounds. [Strengthens throat muscles]
Clear the Throat: Clear the throat (um-hum) several times a day by exaggerating the process and sound.
