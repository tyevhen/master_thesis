You can't expect to become a good writer without reading good writing. Below, I present what I feel is one of the finest short essays written by a 20th-century American: "Corporal," by Richard Brautigan. I present it in exactly the form I found it online, which is to say, as an image (rather than a text file), at Google Books, here.

It's short, it's simple, it's honest.
