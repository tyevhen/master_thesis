Answer :
I am sorry for what you are going through but you must realize that you are the one making the choices that are keeping you in this position. For one thing you have chosen to stay with this man for 18 years and have two daughters by him.

What can you do? You have to get more strength in yourself and have more self esteem. Then you must decide whether you want to live like this for the rest of your life AND bring your children up in such an environment.

What would happen if he turned you in to social security. Why is that a threat to you?

The only thing you can do to improve your life is to get on with it, without him. He will threaten you in all different ways, just to keep you under his control. Change your thinking! Start thinking for yourself and doing what YOU want not always what he wants. You have proved that you can provide for yourself by paying the rent and the bills for the household.

He is with you because of what you can provide him. If he wasn t with you he would have to do something else besides sitting around. It will be no good you turning around and threatening him because it will do no good. You have to take your children and leave him to himself. Let him pay the rent and the bills on his own.

If you want a better life and a happier one, you have to detach yourself from him. You can always plan it out and leave without him knowing anything about it. You can go when he is out "running around" as you call it. Find a relative or a friend, or even Social Services and move out of that town and go somewhere where he will not find you. You can do it and you have your two girls to think of. You can go to the department that you get ssd from, and ask them to help you. There are many, many ways you can do it and if you want to change your life that is what you have to do.

Why am I telling you all this? Because I left my first husband with five young children all under the age of 10. I left with only $30 in my pocket, got on a bus and went a 1,000 miles away and never looked back.
Since then I have remarried had a sixth child. I have now been married 33 years, happily with a wonderful husband.

This can happen to you as well, if you make the right choices for yourself.
