A night of Comedy and Music for Social Workers, Colleagues, relatives and friends.
Jim McGrath and Debstar
Debstar is an experienced Aussie Social Worker who combines stand-up comedy with song, loose facts, stereotype and ever-so-slight exaggeration to tackle issues such as structural oppression, office politics and presents her version of "what is the greatest risk to social work today?" She will do this in a less than lady-like way that should bring a much needed smile to your face but absolutely won't compromise her or you Social Care Registration.
"My jaws were hurting from laughing.... brilliant!" "Very funny, clever stuff" "What a great night out- our team is still talking about it"
