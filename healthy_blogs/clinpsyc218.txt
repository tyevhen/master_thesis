Seroxat Secrets has a dynamite post on "consensus statements," in which a group of "expert" academics put a stamp of approval on how a disorder should be treated. For example, there is now a "crisis" of adult ADHD in the United Kingdom (just as there is here, though we're sometimes confused about the borderline between ADHD and bipolar disorder). And this crisis requires action. What kind of action? The kind that is mentioned in the consensus statement, of course.

I can tell you that the consensus statement has a great note at the end where it mentions that more ADHD treatment will reduce crime, smoking, and unemployment. No word yet on if hunger in Africa would also be alleviated.

Which brings me to the birth of the consensus statement. Hint: There are some conflicts of interest and perhaps stealth marketing involved... Please read the whole story at the excellent Seroxat Secrets.

It sure was nice of several drug companies who manufacture ADHD medications to sponsor the aforementioned consensus statement. And to think that the kindhearted folks at these companies would just give their money away to these dispassionate academics who make perfectly reasonable claims (like more ADHD treatment will lower unemployment). A heart-warming tale, indeed.
