Herpes virus, Genital herpes and the use of Aloe vera as natural way to control the virus and possibly eliminate it.

The herpes virus is a viral infection that is transmitted sexually; which is known as a sexually transmitted disease. This virus enters through the microscopic openings in the walls of the genitals of both, male and female. When infection occurs, the virus travels to the nerve root which is near the spinal cord and can remain dormant there for years without any symptoms or what so ever. This virus, stays there permanently, in other words, there is no known medical cure for herpes virus, but if the immune system is strong enough, it can suppress it and cause no symptoms and such person can go ahead with his normal life. Just like measles and chicken pox which stay up in the body but will not cause any damage at all to the body system.
In USA, 1 in 5 women have genital herpes while 1 in 9 men have genital herpes. These show that more women are more diagnosed and more likely to have the herpes virus than men.
Other researches shows that over 49 million people are affected with the virus and over 60% of people who are sexually active (adolescents and young adults) have the virus.
The herpes virus is caused by two main viruses which are
i.                     Herpes simplex Virus Type 1. Characterized by flu and ulceration of the infected area and it is quiet infectious and symptoms do occur after 2 or 4days after being exposed. It is less dangerous.
ii.                   Type 2 simplex Herpes virus: which is the cause of most genital herpes, herpes infection and signs and symptoms on most individuals is little to none. Symptoms are common with the type one herpes simplex virus.
Other causes of herpes virus but not so common are
a.       Varicella-zoster virus
b.      Cytomegalovirus
c.       Human herpes virus 6
d.      Human herpes virus 7
e.      Human herpes virus 8: mostly causes skin cancer also. This skin cancer is also common with those with full blow AIDS.

Symptoms of genital herpes:
Symptoms are largely not noticeable but a sign can show up after being exposed to the virus within a week and 2 weeks and it is seen as a sore like infection and would heal on its own within a short period of time. However, when a person is exposed, there is an incubation period in which such person may not transmit the virus at that particular time. Symptoms of herpes virus are similar in both men and women.
-          In women, a little blister appears around the vaginal opening.
-          In men , it could be just beside the testicles and could be at times painful
-          There is inflammation of the cervix
-          Women may experience pain during urination
-          Redness, itching of the skin
-          Fever
-          Swollen glands
-          A skin condition that could look like an insect bite.
Some of the symptoms above may occur five times or more within a year especially redness and skin itching, the insect bite condition, this is also called reoccurrence and could largely make the body uncomfortable. Even after uses of anti-retroviral medicines (because of wide resistance to the medicine by the virus)
Seek your medical doctor for advice if you have the following symptoms mentioned above.

How is genital herpes diagnosed?
When you have discussed the symptoms above with your doctor, then he would begin to suspect that you may have herpes. But to make confirmation, the doctor will collect fluid from the sore like area and send it to the laboratory for test or culturing, to determine if it is a virus or bacteria. But sometimes, the laboratory test is not 100% accurate.
Blood test is also done, which is to detect the presence of anti-bodies specifically for type 1 and type 2 simplex herpes virus. This is not also 100 per cent accurate, but much more effective than the laboratory own.
How to prevent genital herpes
i.                     Being faithful to your partner.
ii.                   You must be sure of your partnerâ€™s sexual health, and only test will show that your partner is free from STDs.
iii.                  Abstaining from sex
iv.                 Uses of condoms. But this is not 100 per cent effective. Researchers made us to understand that female condoms are more protective than male condoms.

Treatment for herpes virus | Genital herpes

Anti-retroviral medicines are used to keep the virus at bay and keep it dormant for a long time. But, the virus is now resisting most of the anti-viral medicines in market and additionally, the long term use of anti-retroviral drugs can have adverse effect on the body. And also, because the virus is now building resistance to most of these medicines, this make the infection to be more aggressive and reoccurring for a long time without a way out anymore.
Now, researchers are developing new drugs with the help of herbal medicines to work against the virus, and aloe vera is one of the A list of herbal produces under study to make new herpes anti-retroviral drugs.
