All right. I confess. I made this syndrome up. Every mom I have talked to that has children with RAD has mentioned the days of feeling tired, worn out, old and mean. The sweats and sweatshirts come out. Fixing the hair and applying make up stop. It happens to all of us when we feel defeated. Don't believe this about yourself. Give yourself the things you need to feel better. Don't buy into the RAD lies about who you are. You are smart. You are going to make great decisions about your child's treatment. You are strong. You are worth the time and effort. The things your child with RAD are saying about you and to you are because he is sick. They are not true.
Never put off your life until things get better. Your living your life now!
