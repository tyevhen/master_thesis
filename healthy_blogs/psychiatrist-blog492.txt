I've written about a number of scenarios where doctors are negatively reviewed on-line, both on rating sites where the doctor knows the identity of the reviewer, and where the reviewer is anonymous.  Recently, we've been hearing about a number of scenarios where doctors get edgy after reading about themselves on line-- on blogs, listservs, rating sites.  I'm planning to write a blog post about my thoughts about these scenarios, but first, I wanted to takes some votes and get reader opinions.  By all means, feel free to add your thoughts in the comment section.
