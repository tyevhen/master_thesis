Today is World Mental Health Day. World Mental Health Day is focused on creating public awareness about mental health issues around the world. The theme this year is "Investing in Mental Health".

According to the World Health Organization, many poor countries spend less than 2% on mental health. This includes war torn countries where people are severely traumatized so that people who need help badly are without resources.
