Today we are going to explore the different Eating Disorders according to the DSM-IV-TR. Here we go...

Anorexia Nervosa
-Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height: Weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight <85% of that expected or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected.
-Fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though under weight.
-Disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape are experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
-Amenorrhea (at least three consecutive cycles) in postmenarchal girls and women. Amenorrhea is defined as periods occurring only following hormone (e.g., estrogen) administration.
Subtype- Restricting type-During the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has not regularly engaged in binge-eating or purging behavior (self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
               Binge-eatingâ€“purging type- During the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in binge-eating or purging behavior (self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).

Bulimia Nervosa
-Recurrent episodes of binge eating characterized by both:
                 * Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances
                 *A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode, defined by a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating.
-Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain: Self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications, fasting, excessive exercise.
-The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior both occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months.
-Self evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
-The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.
Subtype-Purging type- During the current episode of bulimia nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.
               Nonpurging type- During the current episode of bulimia nervosa, the person has used inappropriate compensatory behavior but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or misused laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.

Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)
Eating disorder not otherwise specified includes disorders of eating that do not meet the criteria for any specific eating disorder. For instance, maintaing normal weight despite meeting criteria for Anorexia, or repeatedly chewing and spitting out, but not swallowing, large amounts of food.

Finally, both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are more commonly seen in girls and women. Estimates of female-to-male ratio range from 6 : 1 to 10 : 1.
