Nexito plus is a combination of escitalopram 5mg and 0.5mg clonazepam in a single tablet. It is effective against anxiety disorders and in depression with poor sleep. This combination is effective against panic disorder, where the patientâ€™s anxiety symptoms usually get worse initially with SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

In addition, this medication can be given to people who have sleep problems. It is because escitalopram alone will reduce sleep and clonazepam increases sleep. So the combination can balance out. However, side effects of both compounds occur with this medication.


Problems with Nexito plus

Since this medication has fixed combination, it is impossible to change a single medication. Therefore, during early treatment phase, this medication is not recommended. It is better to have both types of medications given as single tablets, so they can be changed individually.

In addition, some mental health professionals do not agree about continuing benzodiazepines for long time. It is due to habit forming potential of benzodiazepines (clonazepam in Nexito plus).
Escitalopram alone is usually prescribed for long duration. Therefore, this medication is not recommended for longer duration. In such patients pure Nexito will be the choice.

Advantages of Nexito plus

This medication has the advantage of having less SSRI side effects such as insomnia, tremors and agitation. It is especially useful for patients who are sensitive for such side effects. In addition, this combination simplifies medication schedule so people will have less tablets to swallow.
