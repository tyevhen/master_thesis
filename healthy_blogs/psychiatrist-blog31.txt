The third time scheduled was a charm and we had a wonderful time going in to Washington to be on Diane Rehm's talk show.  Okay, so the car wouldn't start at first, and I missed a turn, but we got there without event.  The show included our friend, Pete Earley, and two people who had experienced involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations, Lily and Jaime -- they both did a great job of talking about their experiences.  Pete, the author of Crazy: A Father's Search Through America's Mental Health Madness and more recently co-author of the novel Treason,  added a lot of life to the issue by talking about how hard it was to get his son care during a psychotic state years ago.  The nice thing: Pete's son is doing great, as are the two women who called in.

And Pete Earley wrote more about the show, including some of the Facebook Q&A after, on his blog.
As far as the photo goes, we took a vote and Diane Rehm definitely looks the best.  What a great host and what a privilege to be on this marvelous radio show before she retires.
