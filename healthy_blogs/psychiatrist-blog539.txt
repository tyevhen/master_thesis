Usually ClinkShrink posts about shooters.  It's really not my area of expertise, but lately I've been struck by how many shootings there have been.  I'm wondering if this is a more common occurrence lately, if it's more publicized, or if I'm just paying more attention.

In the last few weeks, it feels like there is a constant flow of tragedies in the news:
There was the teenager who killed 3 students and wounded two others at a school in Ohio.
A Florida teacher killed the head of his ex-school after being fired .
A gunman walked into a psychiatric hospital in Pittsburgh and killed one person and wounded 6 others.
A U.S. soldier in Afghanistan killed 16 civilians in their homes, including young children.

I suppose the story of the teacher is different in that it was a murder-suicide where the shooter knew the victim and had a motive-- such tragedies do happen often and their news coverage is often limited to local news-- while the other shootings sound to have random, multiple victims, and no obvious motive.  I've actually never heard of a mass shooting in a psychiatric hospital. 

Any thoughts?  Maybe ClinkShrink has some insights.
