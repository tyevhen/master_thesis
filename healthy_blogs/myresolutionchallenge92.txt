Friends come in all kinds of shapes and sizes.  Some are small and perfectly formed; some are tall and can help you pop the star on top of your Christmas tree.  Other friends are a collage of pixels crammed into a postage stamp sized photograph – yes, I’m talking about our online friends.  Tweeters, bloggers and our Facebook friends are just as important as our face to face contacts.

This blog will celebrate its second birthday on the 1st January 2015, and its success is thanks to a mixture of people.  My holistic health spa clients who enjoy my ramblings, my family who gets to find out what I’ve been up to and my friends who support me in everything I do.  Then there are my fellow bloggers; the army of online buddies I have made along my journey.  A ‘like’ here, a ‘comment’ there, a re-blog, a Facebook share and a tweet.  The blogging community is one of the most supportive groups I have ever had the privilege to be a part of.  If you were contemplating starting a blog as a New Year Resolution – don’t think, just do!

Over the past two years, I have watched my fellow bloggers closely.  I have read their posts and commented, I’ve shared their links and words of wisdom.  In return, they have reciprocated and taught me how to improve my content and marketing.

In 2013, this blog was home to my crazy year of challenges.  Twelve New Year Resolutions completed over twelve months.  From fighting flab to zip wiring through Sherwood Forest.  It was a whirlwind of blogging content and became the basis of my debut non-fiction book, How I Changed My Life in a Year.

In 2014, my challenges were over but I was having so much fun blogging that I didn’t want it to end.  I spent a year sharing my interests and writing accomplishments.  It was fun but lacked direction and in recent weeks I have been pondering!  I didn’t even know I could ponder and yet here I was pondering!  What was next for Resolution Challenge?

I turned once more to my online friends.  My ‘favourite blog’ list is quite varied; I follow many authors and writing blogs, and I enjoy personal development and inspirational blogs.  I have also been known to frequent the occasional beauty blog.  One thing they all have in common – they know where they belong, and they offer their readers a perfected product.

My blog has bobbed along quite happily throughout 2014; I have shared many stories that received positive feedback and some posts that were a total brain dump.  What I didn’t have was a clearly defined direction.

In 2015, I shall be taking yet another leaf out of my fellow bloggers book (I do love a good cliché).  I’m finding my path and I’m excited about the future of my blog.  I hope it will be able to help many people over the coming years.

Running my holistic health spa and teaching my motivational workshops puts me in the ideal position to share my work.  We all need a helping hand occasionally - that may be learning how to manage our time or to set our goals, creating a vision board or discovering a new skill.  These personal development topics are needed all year round – not just in time for our New Year Resolution list (oh but I do love a good list!)

·         Fear busting

·         Inspirational reads/blogs

·         Slow living

·         Learning to laugh more

·         Turning your life around

·         Journaling

·         Me-time

·         Meditation

·         De-stress techniques

These are just some of the topics I will be covering in 2015.  I do hope you will join me for this journey of discovery. 

Over to you – What would you like to see here on the Resolution Challenge blog?  Do you have a topic in self-help or personal development that you would like to know more about?  Maybe I’ve covered something in the past that interested you, and you’d like to know more?  Let me know in the comments below, and we can make 2015 our best year yet.

Thank you to all my readers for staying with me over the last two years, I look forward to sharing more with you in the future and getting to know one another better.  You can also interact on the Resolution Challenge Facebook Page.  Shelley x
