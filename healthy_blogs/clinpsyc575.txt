My pals over at Corcept continue to lose money. You may recall Corcept as the company that is trying desperately to get mifepristone (RU-486) approved to treat depression. The main problem has been that trial results have yielded little hope. The oft-cited (both on this site and in the psychiatric literature) Charles Nemeroff has a conflict of interest related to Corcept that you can read about here. Here's the latest on Corcept:

"(RTTNews) - Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (CORT | charts | news | PowerRating) reported a third quarter net loss of $6.4 million or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.2 million or $0.23 per share in the same quarter of last year.
