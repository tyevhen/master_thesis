Pretend there is an alternate universe where your perfect double exists. This "other you" has perfect health and has whatever in life that you are wanting for yourself. Now imagine yourself sitting in a chair just as you are, relax and feel your lack completely, now visualize this perfect you materializing into this universe. Then bring the perfect you from the alternate universe and superimpose it on the you sitting in the chair, and imagine you are healing until all  the differences are  resolved. You are now as perfect as the perfect double.
