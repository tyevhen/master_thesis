Today, I'm just going to point out some links by others who are talking about the same types of things we've been talking about here on Shrink Rap.

Regarding everyone's favorite topic, involuntary treatment, Dr. Greg Smith talks about his experiences committing people at Are You Ready to Commit? 

On the Huffington Post, Erin Hawkes writes Medicate Me Even When I Refuse.

And Pete Earley talks about the safety of tasers in Tasers: Friend of Foe. 

On the topic of privacy, PsychPractice wrote a post for me defining HIPAA.  See What, Exactly is HIPAA? 

And while Rob has talked about how he does not like it when chronic mental illness is compared to chronic medical illness because we don't know the exact physiology, PsychPractice has a blog up about the politics of defining Type II diabetes, which is surprisingly similar to that of determining the criteria for psychiatric disorders.  See Learning from Diabetes.
