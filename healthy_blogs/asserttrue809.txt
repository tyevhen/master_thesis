I found a great article at IBM's developerWorks site called Speed up your Web pages, by Marco Kotrotsos. It contains 20 very clueful tips for making a site seem snappier. They all have to do with making pages load faster. I thought I'd seen and heard most of the standard tips, tools, and techniques for this, but Marco manages to come up with a few surprises. I recommend the article.
