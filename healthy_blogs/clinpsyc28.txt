"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live." The words of a Merck employee regarding people who dared to criticize its bestkilling, er, bestselling painkiller/heart attack inducer Vioxx.

According to The Australian , Merck
...made a hit list of doctors who had to be "neutralised" or discredited because they criticised the anti-arthritis drug the pharmaceutical giant produced. Staff at US company Merck & Co emailed each other about the list of doctors - mainly researchers and academics - who had been negative about the drug Vioxx or Merck and a recommended course of action.
The email, which came out in the Federal Court in Melbourne yesterday as part of a class action against the drug company, included the words "neutralise", "neutralised" or "discredit" against some of the doctors' names.
