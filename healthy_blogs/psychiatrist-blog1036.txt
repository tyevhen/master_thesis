I moved today! My new office is wonderful. Roy made fun of me because I went to 4 paint stores and 'test drove' 8 different shades of tan, finally settling on Shabby Chic (tan). It's perfect and it goes nicely with the "mushroom" colored carpeting that was being installed at 4 pm yesterday.

So I'm excited. Same furniture. Same Dinah. Mostly the same pics on the wall. Somehow, though, I feel like I got something big out of the way.
