Today is one of those days where I have several short topics that need to be discussed.

Reminder - Get your Flu Shots – It is that time of year again. Do not forget to get your flu shot this fall. Supposedly, the H1N1 vaccine is included in this year's shot. Also, check with your doctor on whether it is time to get the pneumonia booster shot.

KDA Fall Newsletter – The fall newsletter is now available. You can download the PDF document by clicking on this link. Or, visit the KDA website and you can find the link in the right hand column under NEWS. Note: The revised issue was published this morning. The original had some formatting problems.

KDA Conference and Education Symposium – The conference is coming up this November. Over a dozen researchers have registered for the conference including Doctors Fischbeck, La Spada, Taylor, Beitel and Merry. There are also several past KDA grant recipients attending. The hotel has rooms blocked for the conference, but the rooms will be released by October 10. The agenda has been finalized.

The KDA Forum is an excellent resource – If you have not visited the KDA Forum recently, I would recommend that you drop by. It has several new topics posted ... including a few on current research. It is also an excellent way to interact with others who are living with Kennedy's Disease.
