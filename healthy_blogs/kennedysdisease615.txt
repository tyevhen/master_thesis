 
The trial to determine if exercise has any beneficial or harmful effect for those of us with Kennedy’s Disease was published in Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology.

Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of a home-based functional exercise program in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).

Kenneth Fischbeck, MD, Christopher Grunseich, MD, and Angela Kokkinis, BSN, RN of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) added the following comments to the report:

“The trial did not show a statistically significant change in the primary outcome measure, the AMAT, overall.  However, a subgroup analysis done after the study did indicate that low-functioning men with SBMA may respond better to functional exercise. We also found that functional exercise is safe and well tolerated.”
