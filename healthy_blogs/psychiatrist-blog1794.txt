Results are in. We put up a poll all month (March 2007) to see who visits our blog. PollDaddy was used, and duplicate votes were mimized via use of cookies.

> 20% physicians (incl 13% psychiatrists & 7% other docs)
> 9% nurses
> 7% psychologists
> 7% social workers and counselors

> A total of 43% of voters were (mostly mental) health care professionals.
> 29% were patients
> 29% were "others"

Just wanted to share these results with you all. Thank you for your interest in our inspired ramblings.
