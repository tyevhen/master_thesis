I have written about this proposed bill several times over the past year. We were able to help push it through the House and now it is in the Senate's hands. I urge you to take 3-5 minutes to show your support for this CuresNOW bill.  Thank you.

We Need #CuresNow for  Rare Diseases!
Today, June 7, join rare disease advocates around the country and tell your Senators to support the Senate Cures Legislation. This month is the last chance for Senate Cures to pass before the Senate is out of session until after the November election.

Senate Cures (also called the Senate Innovation Act for Healthier Americans) is the companion legislation to the 21st Century Cures Act, which passed in the House last year.

This vital package includes billions of dollars to help the rare disease community, including new funding for critical research at the NIH and to accelerate drug approval at the FDA, and several other provisions.  

NORD is proud to work with other advocates across the country to unite and make sure the Senate gets our message loud and clear!

Background: What is 21st Century Cures?
NORD worked with its Member Organizations and other patient advocates to help ensure the 21st Century Cures Act was passed in the House last year. As background information, here is some of the work that we accomplished together:
Sent a letter to the House Energy & Commerce Commitee from NORD and Member Organizations
Comments to the House Energy & Commerce Committee
Urged Advocates to call Congresspeople to tell them to support 21st Century Cures Act

Alone we are rare. Together we are strongÂ®.
