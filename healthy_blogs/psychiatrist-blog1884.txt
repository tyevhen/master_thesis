Today's podcast was recorded at the same time as #3 (Wii Three Bobo Dolls), and is much more rambling than usual (though we actually did have a list of topics, many of which were related to other bloggers' recent posts).
I edited out Dinah's recording of the Red Sox' 2004 victory, but I'll put it in the next one if folks want to hear it (it's on her keychain).
