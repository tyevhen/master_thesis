The Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC) recently posted that people with schizophrenia are 10 times more likely to be violent as compared to persons not suffering from schizophrenia. I quickly said "WHA?" That seemed so far detached from reality that I didn't even know where to start. So Marissa Miller had a nice analysis of their figures that pointed out a number of flaws in the analysis. Nice job, Marissa.

Then John Grohol stepped in and (BAM) slapped the TAC analysis silly. Absolutely senselessly silly. I won't even try to steal his thunder. Just go to Psych Central and you'll come away saying, "Those *@!@ at TAC!" Nice job slicing and dicing, Dr. Grohol! I'm always proud when a fellow psychologist throws the BS flag when needed.
