On the American Medical News site, here's an interesting article about a recent study about social media use by physicians. According to a survey by QuantiaMD, nearly 90% of physicians use social media, much more than the general public. Most social media use---about 67%---is for personal reasons. A third of physicians reported getting at least one Facebook friend request from a patient, but most of these requests are turned down. For me the most interesting thing was that only 8% of physicians reported using a blog for professional reasons. That seemed low to me.

Not too much more to add, just thought I'd put up a link to the article.
