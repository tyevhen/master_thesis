ForeWord Magazine announced its list of 2011 Book of the Year Awards, and "Living with Depression" was named a finalist in the Psychology category. I'm so thrilled.


ForeWord's Book of the Year Awards program was designed for booksellers and librarians to share in the process of discovering distinctive books across a number of genres with judgments based on their own authority and on patron interests. After months of winnowing down the award finalists' list, the editors at ForeWord are confident in their selections, and our judges agree, saying this year's titles are the best they've seen. Winners will be announced in June 2012.
