Maria Pennuto, PhD,Assistant Professor, University of Trento in Italy sent the following PDF summary report on the SBMA conference at the ENMC International Workshop:

210th ENMC International Workshop: Research and clinical management of patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy,27â€“29 March, 2015, Naarden, The Netherlands

There were several items of interest in the report. Many topics are over my head, but some were still interesting. Dr. Fischbeck provided an overview of SBMA and also gave a report on the Exercise Trial. There was some discussion on others opportunities in the exercise area. A SBMA registry of patients was discussed.

It would be helpful to have Ed Meyertholen, a KDA board member, provide a summary of key topics and findings that may be of interest to those of us living with Kennedy's Disease.
