Dear Ms Curtiss

I decided to think of the " Inside the box" when I feel that i am in depression and in order to get out I have to think "out side the box" 

This helps me a lot in identifying my self.  Regards, R

What a great idea. I might use that myself. It's something that we shouldn't forget, our SELF. Our SELF is never depressed, only the subcortex-driven primal mind is depressed.
