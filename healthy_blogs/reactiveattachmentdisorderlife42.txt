It is time to think of something our kids did right this week! I generally think of my kids oldest to youngest so today I'm going youngest to oldest!


Youngest (RAD but recovering) - I love that he is such a reader. He is reading this summer like he just can't get enough of books. I can't even tell you how many he read this week.


Next son -(RAD) - He is supposed to use lotion for his occupational therapy. He cannot stand things touching him. She put some lotion on him in OT and he was horrified. He has actually put it on without being told a couple of times this week.


Next son - Is driving with a permit. He will be 16 at the end of next month. His driving is coming along well. He drove to a town an hour a way and back last night and did well.


Youngest daughter - Working a full time job and started a very part time job this week! She is such a hard worker and so sweet.


Oldest daughter - Called just to talk and we talked about some important things in her life. I'm glad she will share with me.


Your turn moms!!
