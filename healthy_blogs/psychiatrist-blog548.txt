Roy talks the top 25 search phrases that lead people to our Shrink Rap blog. 
They include, "Statistics of talking too much on a date,"  "World's largest zucchini,"  "Does Angry Birds make you depressed?"


We talk about when should a psychiatrist call in sick?  How sick is too sick?  How distracted is too distracted?  Are psychiatrists good at self-monitoring?


Roy discusses an article called Professionalism in Psychiatry.
