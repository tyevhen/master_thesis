I stole this video from Thought Broadcast.  We are, after all, the Shrink Rappers.  I'm not sure who Steve Balt thinks he is posting this without us. 


Here's a plug for a new psychiatry blog started by a medical student across the pond, called the Manchester Psychiatric Society.


Over on our Clinical Psychiatry News website, ClinkShrink is talking about whether or not the criminally insane ever get released-- a timely topic as John Hinckley Jr.'s hearing for release continues. 


Apparently, my post called No One Likes Me was not quite accurate.  There was technical issue over with KevinMD's Facebook counter, but it was fun writing the post anyway. 


So like when is Clink putting up our next Podcast???  Do feel free to nag her.
