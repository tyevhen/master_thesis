If you follow my blog, you know I am a proponent of the flu shot. I believe it has helped me through the years along with the pneumonia vaccine. The flu can take a toll on anyone and especially so for the young, elderly, and those living with a progressive neurolomuscular disorder.

Well, the manufacturers let me down this year. When I had the shot this October, I felt somewhat safe. As October moved into November, reports surfaced that the current vaccine was only 43% effective. November rolls into December and now numbers in the 20s began to surface. This week, 10% was thrown out there. Health officials mentioned the current flu is mutating and that is why people are coming down with it more than once.

For the last couple of weeks I have been slowly recovering from the crud—whatever you want to call it. Every time I believe I am 90 or 95% recovered, I have a setback. Today, I feel close to 100%. The best part about it is my leg strength has been pretty good to good these last few days.

I tend to become concerned after a period of weakness. However, I have also found that if I continue to exercise as best as I can and not give up hope, I seem to bounce back pretty well. And, boy does it feel good when ‘I’m back’.

During the flu season, I rely upon what my mother always told me. “Wash your hands often and keep your hands away from your eyes.” I know the advice isn’t perfect, but it will go a long way in helping to keep you healthy.

We have several months left in the current flu season. So, be smart, be careful, and wash your hands. J It won’t be long before I again remind you to get your flu shot for 2018. Let’s just hope they do a better job this next time.
