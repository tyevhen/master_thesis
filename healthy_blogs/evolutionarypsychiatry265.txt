One of my favorite Copland pieces is the second movement from Rodeo - the Corral Nocturne (right click in new tab to play).  It's on most of my lullaby playlists, and is modern and sweet without being precious.  It is also quite brief at a little over three and a half minutes, so lean back, close your eyes, and sit a spell, if you do that sort of thing.  I find many people can't unwind, can't unfold.  Corral Nocturne might help if you are in that predicament.  Orchestral music may not be terribly old, but it sure does speak to something within us. 

Here's a picture we took on the last evening of 2010, looking forward to 2011.
