This is a terrific video about how humans are soft-wired for sociability and a need to belong. Indeed, Time Magazine chose Mark Zuckerman as its person of the year for 2010 and explains how Facebook's success is in large part due to our sociability. So empathy is the killer app, ironically speaking. By the way, I found the Time Magazine article much more sympathetic toward Zuckerman than a piece The New Yorker ran back in September.
