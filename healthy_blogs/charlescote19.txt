 
I just read a provocative interview at Salon with the author of Spousonomics, Paula Szuchman, an editor at The Wall Street Journal.

The book is co-authored by New York Times reporter Jenny Anderson.

Here's their "logic" about marriage, some of which that turns common beliefs about marriage on their head:

1. You don't need to explore "feelings" to get at the basic motivations that result in conflictual situations in marriage.

2. Sometimes it makes more sense to go to bed angry since exhaustion usually leads to escalated, and irrational conversations especially since people hate to lose and will keep at it despite diminishing returns. Well-rested people are more clear-headed.

3. Schedule sex and don't back out of it, meaning it's important to plan for it, especially at times when you're not exhausted. Don't wait for it to be "romantic." In other words, lower the cost of sex and increase the demand.

4. Be transparent with one another rather than mind readers. You don't expect your business colleagues to read your mind.
