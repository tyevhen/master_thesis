From The Huffington Post, here is an article on people with PDA addictions. I can relate. Only I can relate pro-actively. I knew the first time I saw email that it would ruin my life. I kept it in my office, but I found myself wanting to go to work to check my email. Eventually, I surrendered and brought it home. It ruined my life.

I don't have internet access on my cell phone or PDA. Why? Because I check it all the time. I check it in traffic. I check it when I'm on line at the grocery store. I check it after I check it. Repeatedly. What am I looking for? Does it matter? It's bad enough that I'm glued to my laptop at home.

I don't have internet access in my office. No, I'm not kidding. I'm there to be at work, and I'm supposed to be with my patients. If I had a computer, I'd be peeking at email, waiting for time between patients to check, to blog, to plug in.

We realize that this is a widespread malady. Consider these stats:
In 2009, the average American watched more than 151 hours of TV a month -- an all-time high
84% of people check their PDAs just before bed and as soon as they wake up -- and an astounding 85% peek at their PDAs in the middle of the night!
One survey found that over a third of smartphone users would pick their BlackBerry over their significant other if they had to choose one to live without!

If all this sounds like addiction, well, it probably is. In a new study, college students who went 24 hours without using any media -- no cell phone, iPod, TV, etc. -- then blogged about their experience, using terms of addiction to describe their feelings: in withdrawal, frantically craving, miserable, jittery, crazy.
I can relate.
