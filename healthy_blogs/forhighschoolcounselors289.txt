Welcome to my blog!


After searching the internet for resources, I wanted to create a space for high school counselors to share ideas, stories, resources, and tools for survival.  One of my special pages will include sharing stories about student issues and how to survive those times where we often lack knowledge, resources, or training.  I have been a high school counselor for 12 years and just when I think I have seen it all...I get a new surprise! 

I hope fellow high school counselors will add their experience and expertise to this blog!
