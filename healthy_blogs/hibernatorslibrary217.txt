Favorite picture of the month

This has been an incredibly busy month for me. I started my second class of the semester (now I'm taking Abnormal Psychology and an EMT certification class). These, together with my full time job in a nursing home and my volunteer work at a crisis hotline, keep me feeling pretty darned overwhelmed. 

My EMT class is a lot of information. As of yet, I'm not keeping up  with the reading in the 2000 page text at all, but I'm bumbling along in the class regardless. I am now CPR/AED certified for infants/children/adults. That's a nice feeling. I think everyone should know how to save a life in this way. 

In Abnormal Psychology I have taken my first test and got a fantastic score. I give my blogging complete credit for that score. Writing blog posts about my psychology class is the best studying I've ever done in my life. If only I could do the same thing with my EMT text without boring you all silly. This month's Abnormal Psychology posts are:

The Definition of Abnormal
A History of Abnormal Psychology
Abnormal Psychology in Contemporary Society
Contemporary Viewpoints on Treating Mental Illness - Biology
Contemporary Viewpoints on Treating Mental Illness - Psychology
Frontline: New Asylums
Brave New Films: This is Crazy

My book reviews are:

The Epic of Gilgamesh - Historical Background
Game of Thrones, by George R. R. Martin
