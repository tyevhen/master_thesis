In a Bloomberg report, it was noted that:
Johnson & Johnson cut costs as it faces generic competition to its best-selling prescription drug, the antipsychotic Risperdal, which generated $4.2 billion last year.
Phew, it's a good thing that Invega (Son of Risperdal) is on the market to save the day for J & J. And there is some preliminary (read: probably bogus) research suggesting that it works better than Seroquel in treating schizophrenia. See my recent post to understand my skepticism regarding the latest results. Invega is entering a crowded market (Abilify, Seroquel, Zyprexa, generic risperidone, Geodon, etc.) and I don't think it is going to fare particularly well unless there is some pretty darned impressive marketing. Which is not entirely out of the question. I humbly suggest taking a piece from Pfizer's Geodon campaign.
