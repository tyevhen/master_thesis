Little House in the Big Woods
by Laura Ingalls Wilder
This is the first story of Larua as a 4-year old in a log cabin in the woods of Wisconsin. I've never read any of these books before, and honestly I can't even say whether I ever watched the TV show. So I didn't know quite what to expect. Whatever I expected, this wasn't it. This book is written with a slice-of-life narrative with no plot and very little dialog - it was kind of a passive story...or perhaps a string of memories/anecdotes that are connected in approximate chronological order. 

Not that I'm saying I disliked it. It was really cute and a really quick read. I'm definitely going to continue with the rest of them. I'm also not entirely sure why this is considered a Christmas book. Yes, Christmas was included in the time-line, but it was about an entire year living in the little log cabin in the woods. I think the cutest part of the book was when Laura and her mother went out to milk the cow at night and mistook a bear for the cow. :) Laura's corn-cob doll was also pretty adorable. 

I think it's interesting how many people care about whether this story was truly factual. I mean, of course it's not fully factual - apparently Laura was younger when she lived on the Prairie than when she lived in the woods in Wisconsin, but she switched the timeline around. I'm sure some of the memories she mentions are also not fully factual, but that's how family anecdotes are - they change with time and audience. This isn't an autobiography, this is a string of anecdotes for children.
