We talk about ducks here on Shrink Rap, but in my 'real' life, I like giraffes. I was very excited when today's American Journal of Psychiatry arrived in the mail and there were two giraffes on the cover! And if that wasn't wonderful enough, Henry put the cover up on my Facebook page with the cover of Shrink Rap in the background and mama giraffe saying to baby giraffe, " Because I'm your mother, no playtime until you finish reading!" How'd he do that? Well, I liked it, so I thought I would share it with you.

If you didn't catch it, our book was reviewed in The Johns Hopkins Magazine by Kristen Intlekopher. Three authors couldn't ask for a better review, so please do read it! You'll need to scroll past oysters, cell phone radiation, and political order, but this review made my day.

Someone asked if I would friend Jesus if he were on Facebook. I can't imagine I would ask to be his friend and I'm not sure what I would do if Jesus sent me a Friend request. Who thinks of these questions?
