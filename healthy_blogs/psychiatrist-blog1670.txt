The history of the vote: Roy wanted to know who reads Shrink Rap and he put up a poll. This was a while ago. In a month, there were 198 votes. I wondered who all the "other" votes were and, 8 days ago, resurrected the poll with multi-vote and write-in options, . Roy, who likes statistics and keeping track of things, wonders why there are already 104 votes. He wants us to place bets on how many Shrink Rap readers will vote in a month. The guesses:

Roy: 246
Clink: 186
Dinah: 275

We haven't discussed what the prize will be, though presumably the winner needs to be the closet vote that hasn't gone over. Or maybe just the closest? We're not much for rules here at Shrink Rap. No obscenities, that's about it. Lots of Ducks. Maybe the losers could prepare duck for me with my favorite sauce? Note my optimism!

Okay, so Vote on our sidebar, let us know who you are. Help me win Roy's challenge!

FYI, ClinkShrink is apparently patient with me. This from someone who videotaped my dog yawning this weekend. And I can't resist:
