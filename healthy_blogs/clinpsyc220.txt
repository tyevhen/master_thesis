During my semi-hiatus, which has been far from recreational, I have mostly kept up with my reading (but obviously not writing). Of particular note to psychiatry, marketing, and pseudoscience, check out a couple great posts from Dr. Daniel Carlat.

One is about an incredibly bogus "survey" that turns up favorable results for Abilify. Oh, how I LOVE that the "science" is stacking up behind Abilify these days.

The other is regarding the alleged (and fake) hidden epidemic of ADHD among depression patients.There are many other good posts that I've not the time to cover now.
