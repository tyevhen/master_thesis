A large scale study across numerous countries has revealed genetic material on chromosome nine was linked to Borderline Personality Disorder . BPD is characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image and behavior, and can lead to suicidal behavior, substance abuse and failed relationships, among other things.

According to researchers, "The highest linkage peak was found on chromosome 9p at marker D9S286 with a logarithm of odds score of 3.548 (empirical P=0.0001). "

Yeah, I don't know what that means either, but it implies that genetic origins continue to underscore mental illness as a real thing. So take that, nonbelievers!
