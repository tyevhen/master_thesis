This is my first ASCA conference and I am really excited to meet all the counselors who have inspired me over the last two years.  Unfortunately, many counselors cannot attend the ASCA conference for various reasons (i.e. economic, transportation, life issues, etc.) so ASCA has made it possible for non attendees to live stream certain conference sessions. In fact, ASCA will allow non attendees to access the recordings even when the conference is over!!  

Here are the two options:

$199-View all three and a half days of conference sessions.

$99-View one day of conference sessions.
