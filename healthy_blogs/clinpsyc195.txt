Decision Resources has now reported that Zyprexa is no longer the market leader in schizophrenia. In March, I noted that the same company proclaimed boldly that Zyprexa was the "gold standard" in treating schizophrenia and would remain so until 2015. So in a matter of months, the same company has gone from labeling Zyprexa as the gold standard for treating schizophrenia to indicating that Zyprexa is an also-ran. The rather quick about-face of Decision Resources makes me wonder about the credibility of its reports.

According to the latest report, concerns about side effects have hurt Zyprexa's market share. Nah, really?
