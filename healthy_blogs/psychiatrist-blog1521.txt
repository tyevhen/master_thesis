As our podcast pallor slowly waxes, we plan to record another one on Sunday... this one with our colleague, Chris Kraft PhD.  You may recall Chris from Podcast #21, Chris Kraft on Gender Issues (okay, it originally had a more sensational title, but Dinah's cooler head prevailed...listen to the podcast to get it), where he talked about intersex disorders.

He's back this weekend to talk about, well, we'll decide when we get there (you think we actually plan this stuff?).  Actually, if there are some topics you'd like to hear about, Post a Comment to this post to let us know, and we might actually pick it up (no complaints if we don't, please).
