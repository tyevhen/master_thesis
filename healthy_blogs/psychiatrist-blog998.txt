For today's podcast we have guest psychiatrist Dr. Pat Barta talking about telepsychiatry, telemedicine and all things neuroimaging. We ponder how licensure works for telepsychiatry, whether or not you can get reimbursed for it, what the difference is between a face-to-face evaluation versus a telephone interview and why we don't yet h
ave an iPhone app to diagnose schizophrenia. All of these topics (and more) can be found on Dr. Barta's blog Adventures in Telepsychiatry.


We talk about Pauline Chen's article in the New York Times: "Are Doctors Ready for Virtual Visits?"



Roy, Dinah, Pat and Clink discuss electronic health records and who should have the rights to our personal health information. I'm including a link to the Speak Flower web site, an organization dedicated to promoting patient-controlled health information systems.

We also hear from Dinah's new dog. Please go to iTunes and write a review.
