And now what was that all about? So boring, I could barely stay awake. My husband is now watching the end of The Sopranos for the third time, convinced we missed something. Meadow is now trying to parallel park for the twenty-third time. Onion rings get ingested over and over again. A neighbor called, frantic, twice, concerned that her TV had gone dead.

Nothing happened.

My husband keeps muttering, "It's coming back, they're going to make more episodes. It's a set up for a movie." He just can't face the fact that this was it: the final episode of The Sopranos was the lamest ever.

Nothing happened.

I'm off to grieve, I don't have it in me to find a picture to upload. Our podcast was better.
