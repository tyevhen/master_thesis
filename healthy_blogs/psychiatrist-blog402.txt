 
In 2013, the CPT codes that psychiatrists use will be changing.  The new ones are said to better reflect what we do.  What does that mean?  Hmmm, I don't know, I thought I'd ask you.  The code for pharmacologic management, the so-called "med check" with no time requirements, is going away, and psychotherapy codes will be for 30, 45, and 60 minutes.  I'm not sure what happens to the 50 minute hour.  I'm going to try to figure this stuff out over the next month and write about it here or on Clinical Psychiatry News.  But first, let me ask you a few questions (these are for mental health professionals only, but everyone else,  hang on, I'll have other questions.  

Do you use CPT codes now?
Are you worried about the changes that are coming?
Do you think this will increase reimbursement to you?
Do you think it will increase reimbursement to your patients?
How do you plan to learn the new codes?
Oh, I'm going to set up a poll, but do feel free to write in on the comment section!
