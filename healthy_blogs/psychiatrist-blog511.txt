I'm setting this space up a few days in advance as I finish up my slides for our APA presentations.  


If you come to hear any of speak, please visit here and let us know what you liked and what you didn't.  


For a list of when and where we will be talking, please go HERE.



Please note that not all of the sessions involve all of the Shrink Rappers.


Please let us know which session you attended, and feel free to tell us if there are topics you'd like to hear us speak on next year.

Slides from our seminar are here: http://mythreeshrinks.com/apa12
