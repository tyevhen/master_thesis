I was very honored to be asked to be interviewed on the Healthy Skeptic Podcast by the amazing Chris Kresser - here's the link:

Healthy Skeptic Podcast, Episode 13

There's also a new paper claiming that eating fat increases appetite by modulating the endocannabinoid system - when I checked earlier the paper wasn't up on pubmed yet but I will track it down and see if it passes the sniff test.

In the meantime, enjoy the podcast!
