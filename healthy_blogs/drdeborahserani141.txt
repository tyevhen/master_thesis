Massage is one of the oldest healing arts.

Chinese records dating back 3,000 years document its use - the ancient Hindus, Persians and Egyptians applied forms of massage for many ailments - and Hippocrates wrote papers recommending the use of rubbing and friction for joint and circulatory problems.

Today, the benefits of massage are varied and far-reaching. Massage Therapy does not only ease the stress and tension of everyday life. It has been shown to be beneficial for many chronic conditions, including low back pain, arthritis, bursitis, fatigue, high blood pressure, pregnancy, diabetes, immunity suppression, infertility, and more.

Massage Therapy is also excellent for individuals with anxiety or depression, and for anyone recovering from trauma. I often recommend Massage Therapy when I work with patients.

Massage Therapy, involves applications of various techniques to the muscular structure and soft tissues of the human body.

Massage Therapy can be obtained through spa services, medical offices, and privately through a licensed masseuse. And, uh, please make sure your Massage Therapist is a licensed one, so no hanky-panky goes on!

And if you can't get to a professional Massage Therapist, ask someone you love to get their hands on you!

Touch is so healing.
