Yesterday before work I asked Taz to fix my lunch because I was running out of time. This morning I came out from getting ready and he said "Mom I fixed your lunch. It is on the counter." Then he took off on his bike. I tooka peek inside to see what I had and found a note "Mom, I love you. I hope you have a good day."

NEVER NEVER NEVER QUIT!  Healing from RAD is possible. It doesn't just happen from good parenting. It happens through education, training and then implementing those things into your child's life.  These are kids who suffered sever trauma. Prayer changes things. God will guide you into finding the right thing for your child and He will guide you in changes you need to make to stay healthy yourself.

Have a healing day!
