I remember 9/11 very well—almost like it was yesterday.  I believe most of us remember where we were when it happened.

My wife and I were watching ABC News that morning when the first report was aired along with the video. We were stunned. It was unbelievable that a plane could fly into the tower. Minutes later, when the second plane did its damage, we were both speechless. This couldn’t be happening—not here. Throughout the rest of the day we watched the ongoing reports of the events unfolding including a third plane and a fourth. For days afterward, it was the only conversation. We grieved—together. Everything else seemed so inconsequential.

We came together as a nation then, just as we did after Pearl Harbor. Why does it take something of that magnitude to make us all realize “united we stand—divided we fall”?


When politicians try to separate us into groups making us feel one is better than the other, they do more harm than good. It is easy to segregate us by focusing on the differences. By doing so, they try to fortify their own ranks to gain a following and votes. These people who want to be our country’s leaders seem to forget that first, and foremost, we are Americans. Many of our ancestors, as well as many who arrive today, came to this country because they were different or not accepted in their homelands. They came because they saw something in America that wasn’t available where they previously lived. 
Yes, we are not a perfect nation. There is no such thing.
And, yes, we are an evolving nation. We are only 240 years old and still have a long way to go.  

But, we will never become better as long as we focus on our differences. Strength comes through unity.


And, no matter what, I believe we are ONE nation under GOD.
