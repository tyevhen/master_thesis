Below is another story of a family living with Kennedy's Disease and their efforts to help find a cure for this condition. The non-profit they formed is in Great Britain. 

Starting up a non-profit is never easy. Susanne and Terry Waite started the Kennedy's Disease Association (KDA) fifteen years ago. They sacrificed a lot to make it happen and even more to grow the KDA into what it is today. 

I applaud the efforts of Ms. Hopps and her team and wish them the best as they move forward with KD-UK. Their website is: http://kennedysdiseaseuk.com/

Kennedy's Disease (KD) is described as an inherited motor neuron disease that affects men. There is no cure for the disease and no current treatment. 

Kate said: “It's very scary when you're told that your husband has this disease because so few people know about it.”
