One wonders why a hug from mom kind of relaxes us? Well, it raises levels of oxytocin. But it turns out that even a phone call from mom raises those levels. Leslie Seltzer from the University of Wisconsin Child Emotion Lab did the study. He noted that the mother’s voice had the same effect as a hug. (Scientific American. May 11, 2010. “A Phone Call from Mom Reduces Stress as Well As a Hug.”) This chemical is so important in social bonding. Again, if we are going to measure progress in psychotherapy we need to take into account biochemicals such as this. My belief about therapy is that it should ultimately help us love and be loved. Oxytocin is one key measure.

There are those who disagree with this goal; who believe that success, on the job, in school is most important. But when there is no one to share the success with it is a hollow victory. Unfortunately, many cognitive/insight therapies implicitly apotheosize success when they try to steer patients into trying harder and gaining the success ladder. That value fits in so well with the current zeitgeist of success "uber alles" where the therapist tries to produce an "uber menchen". (spelling?)

Of course, there are many other measures, as well. For example, when a baby smiles and coos the parts of the mother’s brain that signal reward (the dopamine system) light up. We might say that dopamine is an agent of love, too, and that would not be wrong. The sight of a happy baby urges the mother to cuddle and love him. So we might say that maternal behavior is based partly in the reward areas of the brain. All roads lead to Rome; love is made up of so many facets but they all signal health for the baby. We call ourselves social animals, and it is literally true when we note that just the presence of others can cause normalization some of our biochemicals. We do need people.
