A few months ago, I challenged people to read some or all of the "6 books to Understand Trump's Win" from the New York Times article. We will read the first book of this series, The Unwinding by George Packer, in January and February. It's not necessary, but it would be fun if you'd comment below to let me know if you're reading the book so I can be sure to follow your blog! 

The Unwinding is separated into 3 parts, and I will have discussion questions for each part. You do not have to read at the same pace as me. But if you're interested, you can make a blog post of your thoughts, or just write your thoughts in my comments section for each discussion post. 

Part 1 Discussion Post: January 23rd

Part 2 Discussion Post: February 6th

Part 3 Discussion Post: February 27th

Would people be interested in starting a Google Doc discussion as well? If so, I can set that up.
