Last week, I posted lists of the Top 25 popular posts of 2011 and also of All Time, in addition to a list of the most interesting/funny/bizarre search phrases on Shrink Rap for 2011.

This is my last "Top 10" list from the year of 2011. I sorted the entire list of 257 posts from 2011 by the number of comments received, the highest being 119 comments during the Sherry/Lindeman epoch [winking at Duane and Rob]. Enjoy.
