My poor flowers! I've been so busy with freelance work that I completely forgot to water them. It's been maybe three days tops? The weather has been so hot outside, my plant just baked. Drat. I didn't get a chance to draw them yet.
ADHD & me always seem to do this to my plants. I have the best intentions, too.
