That's a great title for a post, isn't it?
Unfortunately, this isn't going to be about anything all that juicy.  I'm giving a talk on Access to Care next week to 60 or so psychiatry residents in training.  I thought I would ask our readers: What should young psychiatrists know about finding a psychiatrist?  Are there things that make it harder or easier to find someone?  What should they know about health insurance participation?
Write something I hadn't thought of  and I'll read it at my presentation!
Thank you for your help.
