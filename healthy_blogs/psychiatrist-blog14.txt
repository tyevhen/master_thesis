Ah, so first visit Pete Earley's blog.  His last two post talk about the upcoming elections for NAMI's Board of Directors.  Big Tents, Small Tents,  a letter from the President of the Board, he's got the issues outlined.

I throw in my two cents over on Psychology Today's website: This discussion of who NAMI should serve-- those with severe mental illnesses and their families, or those will all mental illnesses?--is really about forced psychiatric care. Read my thoughts HERE and I'd love to hear what you think.
