Everyone who tries to become better informed about the science behind psychiatric medications sooner or later has to deal with a rather large and frustrating problem, which is that the published scientific literature on commercial drugs is spotty in quality and of dubious reliability. I've mentioned before the excellent 2005 paper on PLoS called "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False," by Dr. John P. A. Ioannidis. Interested readers will also want to consult a 2010 Atlantic article called "Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science," and this recent (and extensive) British analysis of bias in the scientific literature. These works mostly deal with publication bias (selective publication of studies and results), but the problems with medical research go much deeper than that. Some of the problems have to do with things like study design, but there are also deep ethical issues around ghostwriting and guest authorship, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and other issues that generally aren't issues in other realms of science, such as (say) theoretical physics.

It helps, when reading papers, to have degrees in science (which I do), but even then it can be tricky to tell a reliable paper from a not-so-reliable paper. Which is why I'm glad I stumbled across Gartlehner G, et al., (2011) "Second-Generation Antidepressants in the Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Depression: An Update of the 2007 Comparative Effectiveness Review," Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2011 Dec. (Comparative Effectiveness Reviews, No. 46.) In Appendix D of this 954-page book there's a detailed listing, prepared by the report's 13 authors on behalf of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, of 77 scientific papers (all having to do with second-generation antidepressants) that were found to be of "poor quality." I've reproduced that listing here. Full references are given further below. Item [1] in the list of references is a paper on how "poor quality" is determined. Papers [2] through [78] are the actual 77 scientific papers that were found to be of poor quality.

I decided to reproduce the list here as a kind of note-to-self that I can refer back to later, when I'm reading some of the papers, but also as a reminder to myself and others that the literature surrounding many of the latest drugs for the treatment of depression is basically not to be taken at face value. All scientific literature (in all fields) needs to be viewed critically. That's not the issue. The issue is that the scientific literature surrounding psychiatric drugs is particularly treacherous.

Which drugs do the 77 papers talk about? They all refer to one or more of the medications shown in this table:

Generic Name
U.S. Trade Name
Bupropion
Wellbutrin®;
Wellbutrin SR®;
Wellbutrin XL®
Citalopram
Celexa®
Desvenlafaxine
Pristiq®
Duloxetine
Cymbalta®
Escitalopram
Lexapro®
Fluoxetine
Prozac®;
Prozac Weekly®
Fluvoxamine
Luvox®
Mirtazapine
Remeron®
Remeron Sol tab®
Nefazodone
Serzone®
Paroxetine
Paxil®;
Paxil CR®
Sertraline
Zoloft®
Trazodone
Desyrel®
Venlafaxine
Effexor®;
Effexor XR®

These drugs represent some of the most popular medications in America today. All of these drugs are approved for use in treatment of depression except for Luvox, which is widely prescribed off-label for depression. (The only approved use of Luvox is for OCD.)

In the table immediately below, ITT refers to "intention to treat" analysis; LTF refers to loss to followup bias; RCT means randomized controlled trial. Numbers in brackets refer to the citations given further below.
