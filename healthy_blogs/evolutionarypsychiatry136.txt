Just a quick reminder that I will be speaking to the Harvard Law School Food Law Society at Noon on Monday, October 31, 2001.  Further details about the event are here:  http://hlsfoodsociety.weebly.com/events.html

I am told it is open to the public.

I've been deluged at work, but have managed to pull a few interesting papers today, so cross fingers that I will get a moment to blog about them later tonight or tomorrow.
