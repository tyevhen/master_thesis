It's summertime....YAY!!  Although I am working with our virtual summer school program, I have scheduled time for self care and staff development.  During the summer, it is my time to take care of my mental health and to take back new ideas to my school.  Mental health time is very important to rejuvenate yourself and I have scheduled that time as a nonnegotiable in my summer.  I hope you will take care of yourself this summer, but consider some summer staff development opportunities.

Here is a peek at my summer schedule:
