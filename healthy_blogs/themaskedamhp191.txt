People often ask me if I run The Masked AMHP Blog all on my own. Well, blogs don’t maintain themselves. As well as having to write the actual posts, there are all sorts of things that have to be undertaken behind the scenes in order to keep the blog running smoothly, and it wouldn’t be possible without my dedicated staff, all of whom are too modest to want a name check on the blog.

So, as a special treat, here are just a few glimpses behind the scenes at the Blog.

Installing awards on the blog takes more work than you may imagine. Here’s a snap of two of my staff erecting the recent award from Mental Nurse.

The recent inclement weather hasn’t helped, and it has often taken valiant efforts to keep all the links open to the different posts.

Well, that's all for now. A Happy New Year. Normal service will be resumed next post.
