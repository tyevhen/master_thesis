Hubby and I are back from our night away. We went to a nice dinner at Olive Garden, had massages at a spa and went to Sherlock Holmes. Just the ticket for some post holiday destressing. Today Dancer and I are going out for her 21st birthday which is actually tomorrow. She is very artistic and all of the little art studios are closed tomorrow. So today we are going to go paint pottery after lunch at a nice phoo phooish restaurant.

Focusing on the hubby and on relationships with the emotionally healthy children is vital to your personal emotional health. It is vital to family health.
