Women's Classic Literature Event
Hosted by the Classics Club

Ok. I've broken down and decided to join the Women's Classic Literature Event with the Classics Club. "Why do you say 'broken down'" You ask? Because I'm trying to only join events that will supplement my personal reading goals or introduce me to bloggers with common interests. After thinking about it, I've decided that this challenge fits those needs. I'm starting today. 

I hate making lists of books to read, because I will not stick to it - in fact, writing my Classics Club list was stressful enough. But here are the books (8 of 54 - oh sad, sad day; I'm embarrassed) on my Classics Club list that are by female authors - I will try to focus on them this year as much as feasible. 

Persuasion, Jane Austen
The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath
The Collected Poems of Sylvia Plath
Ten Days in a Mad-House, Nellie Bly
North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell
Middlemarch, George Elliot
Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte
Cotillion, Georgette Heyer
Furthermore, Ali @heavenali is maybe hosting a Woolf-a-long through 2016, though its structure is still a little up in the air. I told her that the books by Woolf that I am interested in reading are: Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, The Waves, and Between the Acts.
