The National Alliance on Mental Illness is dedicated to improving the lives of individuals and families affected by mental illness, by grassroots advocacy for public health policy and funding that supports awareness, education, and advocacy for mental illness.

So I just realized that the annual NAMI Walks fundraising event in Baltimore is tomorrow morning. While the other shrinkrappers are still having fun and sun in Hawaii, I'll be leading the Shrink Rap team here at home tomorrow morning. Please support NAMI by sponsoring my walk. You'll be supporting a good cause, will feel great after doing it, and maybe even lose weight vicariously! (It's also tax-deductible.) NOTE: you can donate even after the event is over.

Click on the logo above to sponsor, or go to http://www.nami.org/namiwalks11/BAL/drdaviss. I'll be happy to mention your name and/or link if you like in a follow-up thank you post next week (just include your info in the Message To Me window after making your donation). Even $5 will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
~Roy
