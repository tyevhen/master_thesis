Chuck Klosterman, in One Slice With Extra Meaning, talks about how he accidently dumped an entire canister of red pepper onto his pizza slice. "...I suppose I just could have ordered another slice.... Instead, I acted as if I had done this on purpose." In front of the other pizzaria patrons, he painfully injests the peppered pizza and goes on to say, "Very often, I don't know why I do the things that I do: it is my assumption that many people feel this way pretty much all the time. But whenever you do something especially idiotic, and if your reaction to such an event is especially unreasonable, you're forced to question (a) the motivations that drive your behavior and (b) whether such motives even make sense."
