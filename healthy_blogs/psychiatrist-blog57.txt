Mental Illness and Violence: Dispelling the Myths and Managing the Risks
Washington, D.C. – In the aftermath of highly publicized cases of violence, there is a big disconnect about mental illness and its connection to violence. Research shows that people with mental illness are more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of violence. On Thursday, May 26, the global research institute RTI International will host a policy forum “Mental Illness and Violent Events: Identifying, Managing and Reducing Risks,” where expert researchers working on these issues will clarify the scope of mental illness in relation to violent events, including suicide, gun violence, and victimization.
  Often policymakers develop mental health policies as a response – and solution – to incidents of gun violence instead of an investment in needed mental health services, systems, and supports. Panelists will discuss the nuances these policies fail to take into account, and recommend steps for managing and reducing the risk of violence through evidence-based interventions, trainings, and services.
