Dear Aetna,
I would contact you directly, but believe me, I've tried. 

Perhaps you could help me.  I am a psychiatrist is Baltimore and somehow my name is on Aetna's provider panel.  I never filled out an application or request with Aetna and I have no desire to be on their panel.  Over the last couple of years, I had gotten a few calls from prospective patients, clarified that I am not an Aetna provider, at least not willingly, and left it at that. Recently, the calls have escalated to as many as 5 a week.

I have called Aetna repeatedly, and I can't seem to find a voicemail option that allows me to speak with a human.  I received a call (left as voicemail) from Aetna the other day saying I must refund a patient because I charged more than the allowable rates for an Aetna-cover patient, and the  patient told them I was not in network, and a number was left for me to call. When I dialed that number, the automated answer machine knew who I was (I suppose by my phone number?) but then none of the prompts led to an option to discuss network participation or to speak with a human.  I have also gone to their website, where there is a place to report network issues, and I reported there that I am not in network and never heard anything.  I googled the Chief Medical Officer and tried to call him, without success.  This is a lot of time and effort to dis-enroll from a company I had never enrolled with!  Even your contact page is a fiasco.
  Network inadequacy is an enormous problem for patients and Aetna makes it extremely difficult to address.
