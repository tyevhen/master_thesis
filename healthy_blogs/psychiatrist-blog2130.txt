No, I'm not talking about a new pill. The rumor mills are stirring about Apple coming out with an Ulta-Mobile PC (UMPC)... a tablet PC in a small device, with that special Apple panache that I've grown to love since I switched 2 years ago (and haven't looked back).

I've been holding out on getting a laptop, hoping an Apple tablet would come along. Hopefully, if true, it will be an Einstein to its doomed predecessor, the Newton.
