I love my peer helpers; however, I don't think that I always give them the recognition they deserve.  This year, I am going to change this by giving them their own week of recognition.  If you have a peer helper program, you have an opportunity to show off your program as well!!   The National Association of Peer Program Professionals has designated the week of March 23-27 as National Peer Helper Week!!

National Peer Helper Week

To help with your week's activities, NAPPP has created a kit that you can download on their website.  Here are some of the items included in the kit: 
Sample proclamation
National Peer Helper Week logo
Sample media posts
Suggested activities including: create/wear a peer helper t-shirt, develop a video about your program, hold a ceremony, throw a party, or host special event
Sample ceremony script
After your event, NAPPP asks that schools post their pictures to their face book page to show your spirit!!
