I remember this even when RAD was rampant in our home. We arrived home from Thanksgiving on Saturday. The boys immediately relaxed. There was an unusual quietness in our home. There was relief on their faces. I love those times because it shows they feel safe in our home. If you get those after holiday sweet times, I know you enjoy them too. Make sure you enjoy their significance as well. Sweet safety.
