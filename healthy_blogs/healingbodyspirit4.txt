Today I went to the Riverton Family History Library & found five names of children from Holland who needed to be sealed to their parents. They all died before they were 6 years-old. My heart ached for their parents. I felt them so so close to me. As I thanked the good brother who reads Dutch and helps me each week on Dutch records from Wie Was Wie said to me, "As missionaries we go out and knock on doors and are lucky if we find one or two people a week to teach. Here, we sit in the library for several hours and find from three to 8 people who need their temple work done and who need to hear the gospel on the other side."
If you want to feel "the Spirit," seek to find your ancestors.
