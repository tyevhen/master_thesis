Shrinks don't join Facebook so much.  Why is that?  Today,  I will speculate about that on our Shrink Rap News blog over on the Clinical Psychiatry News website.  Please do check it out, the post is called Friend Me? Psychiatrists and Social Media.  I also give some suggestions to those who may want to try it out.  Roy will tell you that Facebook is a thing of the soon-to-be-past and Google+ is where it's at, but you have to start somewhere.


Of course, do "friend" us at

Do we have a Shrink Rap profile at Google+ yet?  Now there's a project for Roy!
