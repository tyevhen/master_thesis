Dear A. B.

I have a question reading your book, you say that depression is a cycle and that all episodes don't last anyway - but brainswitching can shorten it. Does this mean that depression does heal itself naturally? The chemical imbalance does correct itself?

Thank you ever so much for your time you've spent on writing to me. I'm so grateful. Y_____

Dear Y________

No the chemical balance does not correct itself permanently. The reason depression is cyclical, and episodes end and start up again, is that the brain works by learned association. Even if the brain is on a dedicated neural track of depression, some maverick learned association could temporarily interrupt the track and the brain could get going in another direction away from depression.

Remember, the brain always follows the direction of its most current dominant thought. Interruption of the depressive cycle can happen naturally and accidentally due to learned association, but it could take a long time. Brainswitch interrupts the depressive pattern on purpose rather than accidentally. A. B. Curtiss
