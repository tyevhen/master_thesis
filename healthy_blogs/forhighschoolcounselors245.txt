My husband says that I am obsessed with finding resources to use with my students (he's right!).  I have a habit of looking for resources while I am riding in the car, waiting in line at the grocery store, waiting in the lobby of the doctor's office...well, you get the picture.  When I found the tech tool, LiveBinders, I was thrilled!

It is that time of the year for being thankful and sharing with others. I would like to share all the High School Counseling LiveBinder resources that I have located. I hope you will find these resources helpful for you and your students. If you have not created your own High School Counseling LiveBinders Shelf,  please consider and then feel share it with me!
