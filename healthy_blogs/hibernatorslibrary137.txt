Happy New Year everyone!

Well, the new year has rung in and I'm eager to get out here and get all my challenges complete. This week went well - no glitches at work, hung out with some laid back friends for New Year's Eve, that kind of stuff. And I don't work today! YAY! (I work the weekend, but having a holiday in the middle is wonderful.)

Studies: I finished the first two chapters of my EMT book in anticipation of January being a very full month for me. If you're interested in checking out my short notes.
