I am taking the day off from writing.  It has been good to just get away from the computer.

Our children bring us a lot of joy.  And, they never really grow up in our mind’s eye.  They will always be our little girl or boy even though they are adults.  It is our privilege and right as a parent to want to hug them and protect them, no matter what their age.

To all you ‘fathers’ out there,
have a great day.
