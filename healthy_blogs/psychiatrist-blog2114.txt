Steve's been helping us figure out how to set up Blogger to more clearly indicate who posts what, since there are three psychiatrists who post here. [Sounds like a joke; "So, these three psychiatrists walk into a blog..."]

If I haven't totally broken the template here, you should start to notice that our individual blogs will have some differences in formatting (font, color, stuff like that), which makes it easier to tell when we switch. This post is, in fact, my test to see if it works (should be different font style).

Hopefully, these changes will allow us to stay more grounded, while maintaining a more integrated appearance.
