On occasion, lawsuits bring great good to the people. PharmedOut is one such example. At this new site, you can see such jewels as:
The Zyprexa drug rep video.
Links to abstracts and articles on how the drug industry influences prescribing practices.
A nice list of links to excellent websites covering said topics
Justice Alert: This program was funded as part of the settlement between Warner-Lambert (a division of Pfizer) and the attorneys general of all states and Washington DC. What settlement? The one regarding the blatantly misleading advertising for Neurontin.

If you are a blogger or journalist, please see if you can give PharmedOut a spot of coverage.
