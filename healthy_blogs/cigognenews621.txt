There are some lines in Shakespeare’s Rape of Lucretia that goes like this: “This earthly saint adored by this devil, little suspecteth the false worshipper; for unstain’d thoughts do seldom dream on evil. “

I was curious about why it is that so many of us fall prey to politicians underhanded schemes and false promises. So much so that systematically many of us go to the polls and vote against ourselves. I think it is because the average woman and man is not deceptive nor full of guile and so believes what others say; their unstain’d thoughts cannot imagine the chicanery of psychopaths who deceive and manipulate. Theirs is a kind of naivete. The bottom line is that they do want to do good. It is just that leaders dictate to them what that “good” is. And so they vote against health care. It is “socialist,” they insist. They learn that socialist is bad and they don’t want to do bad. That phrase obfuscates the reality and they go on lacking medical care. It is the same as in a research study the doctor gives a placebo ( a neutral medication) to a patient , saying it is a powerful painkiller, and she no longer feels the pain of the dental drill. Words become more powerful that experience.

Let me say that again: words and beliefs supplant reality and force us to live in a parallel universe, one that has no feelings. The domain of the cynic is a stained mind who does see evil lurking everywhere. And who, it is presumed, has the kind of mind that can also concoct evil. You know “it takes one to know one.” The honest person has learned obedience and not to challenge authority—the good child. It turns out that politicians do know best; for what is in their interest. Not for us. But their placebo, offering nothing in return, is adopted and guides our lives. Because we do not want to be “bad.”
