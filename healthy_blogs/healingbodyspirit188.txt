Candida is a major player in Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia. Jacob Teitlebaum, M.D., author of From Fatigued To Fantastic, writes, “I feel most people who have irritable bowel syndrome, or ‘spastic colon’, have yeast overgrowth or parasites.” He goes on to say, “The best marker I have found for recurrent yeast overgrowth (candida) is a return of bowel symptoms, with gas, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.” He recommends the book, The Yeast Connection, by Dr. William G. Crook., for more information on the subject.
