I'll be working today on catching up with all the fabulous comments my readers have left over the past two weeks. If you just follow this blog through the RSS feed I recommend you click through to the articles. Even if you don't feel like leaving a comment yourself I can promise you that you won't be wasting your time.

In the meantime, I'll have a new article up by tomorrow for you to look forward to. I'm also playing with the idea of focusing on The Secret for September. I've been accused of being "the Secret guy" and am curious about what my personal philosophy towards coping with disabilities has in common with that pop psychology. I see myself more as a "Learned Optimism" or "Mind over Mood" sort of guy. More pragmatic, less New Age.
