Some bloggers announce their anniversaries. We'll do that, too, I've no doubt.

Since April, we've been posting, podcasting, meeting, texting, emailing, dining at Roys (of the restaurant chain), photographing our feet (how nuts is that?), blogging about jails, inmates, psychotherapy, drugs, neurotransmitters, patients, doctors, both, neither, brain anatomy, floor boards, sleepless nights, ducks, our fellow blog-o-land friends, Iowa, The New York Times, The Ravens, movies, TV shows, anything anyhow that we could make sound in any way Shrinky or not.

This is our 300th Post!
