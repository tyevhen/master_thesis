Within the last few months, I've been publishing an online daily newspaper called Psychotherapy Daily News with various stories, including articles from this psychotherapy blog, other newsworthy mental health articles written by other mental health experts in the field, as well as important articles about health, science, the environment, education and leisure.

The Psychotherapy Daily News is free and you can get your free subscription each day by clicking on the link below and subscribing:

I hope you'll enjoy it and send me your comments.
