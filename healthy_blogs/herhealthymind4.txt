I've always thought that Mother's Day should be celebrated by ALL women!
For all who haven't had children-- whether by choice or circumstances-- this one's for you:

"Even if she has never birthed a child,
Even if she never comes to do so
Every woman is a mother!
First, of her dolls; then, of her little siblings;
Getting married, she's her husband's mother
before mothering their children.

If childless, she will become an adoptive mother and will give someone else's spawn all her love: nieces and nephews, children of friends, students, animals, a good cause.

How many women weren't chosen to mother
their own children but ended up mothering their own mothers? Or fathers? Grandparents?

Motherhood cannot be suppressed.
Just like a water flow that gets blocked by a stone, it will surely find its way out.

During war, they care for the injured,
even if they wave a different flag
or wear a different uniform.

Motherhood has no borders, colors or preferences.
It's one of those few things that are
sufficient in themselves.

Every woman is a mother!"
