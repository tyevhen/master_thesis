In case you're having any trouble finding us:


Over on Shrink Rap News, ClinkShrink is talking about the unpredictability of patient violence.  It is not at all clear to me why the patients she described were in a YouTube video.


Over on Shrink Rap Today, Roy is talking about his favorite palindrome.  Madam I'm Xanax?


Over on the Johns Hopkins Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences website,  I'm pleased to report that Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work is the featured faculty book!  : ~ )


And finally, over on MovieDoc's blog,  he has a post up about the Shrink Rap movie.  Sadly, the movie has absolutely nothing to do with us, but I do like the name and Roy watched it and attended a Twitter event held by MovieDoc.
