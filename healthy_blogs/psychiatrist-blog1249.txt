I think I have ESP. Last week, I was thinking about a patient I hadn't seen in a couple of months, and he called, just as I was thinking about him. It's happened before with this patient. Today, I was walking to my car (where I'd left my cell phone, unsubmergered), and I started to think about a patient I haven't seen or thought about in some time. I've been treating her for over ten years, and issues of age and health have made it hard for her to get in to see me. It's been a year, maybe more, but every once in a while, she surfaces. So I'm thinking about her, wondering how she is, and I get to my car and there's a voicemail from her. Sort of eerie. I have ESP.

What I don't understand is the whole ShrinkRap with Bacon thing on our sidebar. I guess Roy did this. Why does anyone want bacon with our blog? It's just sort of weird. He couldn't have put ducks up?

And for a final thought: my husband is leaving on a jet plane. He texted to say there is a comfort dog in the next row. I can't wait to hear how the flight goes.

Thanks to everyone who's commented on our pre-draft of a chapter. I like the diversity of opinions. And to anyone who thinks their middle schooler might get something out of it, that would be wonderful!

I'll get a photo in later: let me know if you have any special requests....
