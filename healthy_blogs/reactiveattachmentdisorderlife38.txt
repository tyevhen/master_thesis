I read a blog yesterday where the mom went outside and lay and looked at the clouds and felt the sun. I thought "That sounds so nice. I remember doing that as a child." Why don't I do it now? My life seems to get so hectic. I have 5 major projects plus regular homework due in my 2 classes over the next 2 weeks. Parent teacher conferences are this week. I get calls from the boy's teachers about missing work. I've cleaned out my lazy susans in my cupboard to repaint the shelves. Today I need to put it all back. I want to defrost the deep freeze.......Relaxation. I do think it is an important aspect of life. In America it is not necessarily valued. Go go going is valued. Multitasking. I've decided I am going to purposefully smell the roses this week. Each day I am going to schedule a leisurely stroll, a walk through an antique store or just lay down and listen to a favorite CD. It is good for the body, mind and spirit. God rested on the 7th day of creation as an example to us all of the importance. Did God need a nap? I don't think so. I think it was a lesson for us. Today.....the antique store is calling me.
