One of the concerns I have about funneling our resources into programs for involuntary treatment is that I believe it's difficult for those who want help to get it.  Some assume that those who don't recognize their need for help are society's sickest patients, and that resources should go to them first.  So I want to hear your stories of looking for a psychiatrist.

So let me ask you, how hard is to find a psychiatrist here in the United States?  If you found one easily --- say a morning's worth of phone calls and appointment within a reasonable time -- just say "Easy" and please tell me what part of the country you live in and if you live in an urban/suburban/rural area.  If you had a longer story, I'd love to hear that as well, with the same demographics.

Thanks so much!
