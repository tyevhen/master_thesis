As I mentioned in a few recent articles, neck weakness has paid a visit. Since I never experienced anything like this before, it is another unusual event in my journey.

While considering an article, the word COMPENSATE came to mind. One of the definitions of compensate is “make up for (something unwelcome or unpleasant) by exerting an opposite force or effect.” 

All of us living with Kennedy’s Disease have become familiar with this action. Early on in the progression, it wasn’t difficult to hide the onset of certain symptoms. As time marched on, however, it became more difficult to compensate for the eroding muscle strength and errant firing of the motor neurons. 

At some point, we started using a cane or walking stick. As fatigue increased and the danger of falls became more evident, we slowed down and walked/hiked less. Later on, we began using a wheelchair. As the arms, shoulders, hands and fingers weakened, we found tools to help, or utilized exaggerated movements to help perform often simple tasks. For every action (progressive weakening), we found exert an opposite force to make up for the weakness.

It is said, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” Through the years, those of us living with Kennedy’s Disease have invented things to help compensate for the loss of the use of our muscles. I am amazed at all the ‘tools’ that have been repurposed so that we can continue to live a productive life.

Then, there came a time where we had to ask for help. And, by asking, we again compensated for the loss of our ability to perform a certain function. Fortunately, there are a lot of good people in this world who are willing to help “if we just will ask.”


My comment for today is “Leave your pride at the door because everyone needs help at some time.”

Stay upright and stay safe.
