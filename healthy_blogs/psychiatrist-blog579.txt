Ah, we're back to an old topic, involuntary hospitalization.  Some people say they'd rather die than live through a week in a hospital again.  I actually have not ever heard anyone say that about jail.  I thought I'd ask if everyone feels that way.  If you are very much against the idea, but have not been involuntarily hospitalized yourself, please-please-please, don't take my poll.  
 


Thank you and Go Ravens!
