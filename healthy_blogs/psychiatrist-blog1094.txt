This is for Meg who has an eye for Shrinkrappable stuff, and who is being our test reader for Off the Couch.

You read it hear first-- from next Sunday's New York Times Magazine in the October 4th magazine, Robin Marantz Henig will write ( or so my crystal ball says...) in "Understanding the Anxious Mind" about the work of psychologist Jeremy Kagan:


They have also shown that while temperament persists, the behavior associated with it doesn’t always. Kagan often talks about the three ways to identify an emotion: the physiological brain state, the way an individual describes the feeling and the behavior the feeling leads to. Not every brain state sparks the same subjective experience; one person might describe a hyperaroused brain in a negative way, as feeling anxious or tense, while another might enjoy the sensation and instead uses a positive word like “alert.” Nor does every brain state spark the same behavior: some might repress the bad feelings and act normally; others might withdraw. But while the behavior and the subjective experience associated with an emotion like anxiety might be in a person’s conscious control, physiology usually is not. This is what Kagan calls “the long shadow of temperament.”
