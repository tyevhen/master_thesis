According to research in the latest journal Appetite, looking at pictures of mouth watering food can actually help improve self-control.

Hmmm.

Let me get this straight. Gazing at the above photo is supposed to satisfy my desire for chocolate cake? I'm not sure that it's working for me. See, all I keep thinking about right now is the Pepperidge Farm cake I keep in the freezer for pop-in company.

The data analysis for this study reveals only 54 subjects were tested, so the generalization for this conclusion may not have sturdy reliability. But I'll give it a try. I wonder if my family will thumbs-up or thumbs-down the scads of pictures of chocolate and juicy cheeseburgers that'll be up.

What about you? Would looking at pictures of your favorite foods help or hurt?
