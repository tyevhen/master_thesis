Well, at least the best article on cursing. While I've somehow received a G-rating for this site, I think the politics of cursing are fascinating. Look at how much time and emotion we put into the idea of cursing. No, you can't say that word -- that'll get you a parental advisory warning. If you said that word in class, you could get fired. Et cetera. I'm not advocating for a cuss like a gangsta rapper society or for prudishness. What I am advocating is that y'all read an incredibly interesting article on cursing by Dr. Stephen Pinker, available the New Republic's website.
