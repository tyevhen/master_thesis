In prior posts, I've explored basic meditation and Safe Place meditation as well as how to use your senses to deepen your sense of relaxation.

But what are the benefits of meditation?

Research studies have shown that meditation can help most people to:

*relax and de-stress
*improve memory
*improve concentration
*lower blood pressure
*deal more effectively with anger management issues
*reduce anxiety
*lift your mood
*improve your intuition

As part of an overall wellness program, there are many advantages to developing a daily meditation practice.
