In 2005, the Association for Conflict Resolution created a special day to promote conflict resolution in organizations. Conflict Resolution Day occurs the third Thursday of October and its purpose is to:
promote peaceful means to settle conflict.
promote the use of conflict resolution in schools, businesses, organizations, and communities.
recognize the contributions of conflict resolvers.
Conflict Resolution Day is a great way to promote your school's conflict resolution program to students, staff, and the community.  If you have a peer mediation program, consider holding the following activities:
1.  Demonstrate a mock mediation during lunch to show students its benefits.
2. Organize a Peace Caf√© based on a topic like bullying. I use the film Odd Girl Out to discuss the topic of cyber bullying and how students can make a difference in their school.
3.  Offer to hold workshops for classes in conflict resolution activities like conflict styles, perception & bias, communication styles, and non-verbal communication.
