I have your book DEPRESSION IS A CHOICE and had some old printouts that are not clear from you older website that were exercises; 10 don't etc. I want to share them with a friend who was physically abused as a child and she is on lots of drugs and is the mother of two toddlers, who have some physical and emotional issues I believe may be related to all the drugs she has taken over the years.

RESPONSE:

You can still print out that information from my new website www.abcurtiss.com. Just click on DEPRESSION at the top and scroll down to depressionisachoice.com
