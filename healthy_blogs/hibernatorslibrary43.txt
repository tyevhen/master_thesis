So Polar Vortex 2017 has hit Minnesota. And on top of that Winter Storm Decima is coming! We're supposed to be pelted with ice and snow tonight and then have temperatures down to -23 degree Fahrenheit tomorrow. Mmmm. I look forward to going to work at 4:30am. At least I don't have to drive far! 


My New Year Resolution is to start exercising more often. So in January I'm hoping I'll have a lot more time to listen to audiobooks while I'm slaving away in the gym. I do better when I have a goal in mind, so I've decided to train for the Itascatur. It's a 100 mile bike ride around Lake Itasca State Park (that's where the headwaters to the Mississippi are). It's in September, so that gives me plenty of time to get rid of the extra chubbiness and figure out how to train for the hills. Distance I can do. It's the hills that kill me. I wish I had someone to accompany me on the ride, though!
