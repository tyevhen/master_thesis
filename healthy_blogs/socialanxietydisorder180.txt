Commonly question about M.U.S.E. Lite
Question :
I need some alcohol prices!!! -a 5th of jgermeister - a case of bud lite- 6 pck of smirnoff and ne thng cheap
if u have n e other ideas about anything that s cheap but tastes good and if ur wondering y its cuz I m in charge of throwing a party this weekend with a low budget
Answer :
being that i am a fraternity brother and a crazy sob i would go with the everclear and make some jungle juice like suggested. natural light is a cheap beer and you can get a case for 12 bucks. also for the ladies flavored cheap vodka with cheap soft drinks and fruit punch. then buy yourself something good and share with the good friends (those are the ones that will still be there to clean up) good luck.

Answer :
Holy cow. Did you text this whole thing out on your phone or something? I skimmed it... which was hard enough. Anyways, move on. Some females are vicious bi**hes. Life s too short to spend waitin around and trying to gain the attraction of one chick.
