It's been a little quiet here at Shrink Rap this week, in between the earthquake and the upcoming hurricane. Please bear with us. If we have power this weekend (and if Dinah has her network back up) we may try our first-ever videoconference podcast.

In the meantime, best wishes to all our readers and listeners in the path of the storm. Please heed precautions and take care of yourselves!

See you on the other side.

In the meantime, you might be interested in reading a followup comment on my Clinical Psychiatry News post about the psychological autopsy done on the alleged anthrax mailer, Dr. Bruce Ivins. Not surprisingly, the expert behavioral analysis panel (EBAP) disagrees with me. They feel they did the right thing by publishing and selling his medical data. Read the EBAP response.
