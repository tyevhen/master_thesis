I write about all sorts of BS that relates to mental health treatment. Mostly about marketing infiltrating science. But hey, it's a freakin' election year. And when I see good political comedy, I have to post it. Yes, I'm sure there are also duplicitous Democrats. But matching the like of Dick "Apron Strings" Morris and Karl "Thriving Metropolis of Wasilla" Rove is probably going to be a tough task.




I would also like to go on the record as saying that I am totally against banning books from libraries, which might make me a poor candidate for higher office.
