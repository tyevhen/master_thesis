The holiday season is not just a time for traditional festivities, merry making, good will and celebrating with loved ones. For some, it's the loneliest time of the year. For others, sadness of missing a loved one or recovering from a life-changing trauma tinges the season. Many fall into despair as self-reflection takes hold, measuring the year's past accomplishment and failures. And then there are those who begin a downward spiral into the depths of a clinical depression.

My award-winning book "Living with Depression" offers tips and recommendations, as well as my own dual perspective of being a professional who specializes in depression and also being a person who lives successfully with this mental illness.

You can pick up the new paperback edition of "Living with Depression" online and in retail bookstores. Remember, depression is a serious, but treatable illness.
