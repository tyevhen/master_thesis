Note:  This is a special post.  My regular article titled "Taking Charge of your Health" was posted earlier today and can be found by following this link: http://kennedysdisease.blogspot.com/2011/07/taking-charge-of-your-health.html)

Times are difficult and everyone is trying to save their ‘pet programs’ from federal budget cuts.  The Kennedy’s Disease Association is a member of the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).  It is an organization whose goals include increasing awareness and to provide greater research funding for rare disorders including Kennedy’s Disease.

The following email was sent to the KDA this week.  NORD is sponsoring this program and asking for everyone’s involvement.  I would ask that you consider sending an email to our President and Congressional Leaders.  It took less than a two minutes to send my email of support asking to save this program. 
  Send A Message to President Obama
and Congress Through NORD's Website
Federal budget cuts have been proposed to Medicare reimbursement for drugs and biologics as part of a compromise to raise the debt ceiling.  One proposal under consideration is to move orphan products from Medicare Part B coverage to Part D.  This shift from a 20% co-pay to co-insurance that could go as high as 33% will place a devastating financial burden on some patients and their families who are dependent on lifesaving orphan drugs and biologics.
 
NORD urges our members to join us in opposing cuts to Medicare reimbursement that reclassify orphan drugs from Part B to Part D.  A letter from NORD President and CEO Peter L. Saltonstall has been submitted to all members of the U.S. Congress.
 
You can personalize this letter with your own message and submit it to President Obama and all members of Congress through the NORD website.  It takes just a few minutes, and we encourage all our members to do this.

Thank you for your consideration.
