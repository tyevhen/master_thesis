Most of you may claim to read this blog for my scathing movie reviews, nitpicking analysis of pop culture, or anecdotes about my bumbling, incompetent life, but I know that you're all really here for up-to-the-minute updates about my fledging writing career.

You, every time you check this website.

Well, hold on, mostly-fictional fans, because I've got some good news to announce!

You, right now.

I've had a second article accepted by Cracked.com, the gigantic humour website that you've probably got open in another tab right now because you're procrastinating on a paper. 



It'll be another two or three months before the article is actually posted to the website, but you should probably start frantically refreshing the page now, just in case.
