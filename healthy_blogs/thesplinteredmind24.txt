The Monthly Mind is something I’ve been wanting to do for some time, but always procrastinated. Now with my book coming out, I want to have a monthly newsletter for people who discovered me through my book who don’t do Twitter, Facebook, or blogs.
You can subscribe with the form below. I don’t sell addresses, and I won’t spam you. This will be an extra blog post, if you will, that I’ll send out each month with tips and suggestions for dealing with ADHD, depression, suicide, and anxiety. Hopefully, I’ll be able to keep my cheekiness intact. Don’t want to go and take myself too seriously now, do I?
Unfortunately, the service I use now does include ads in the mailing. It’s not optimal, I admit. In fact, I wasn’t aware there were ads, so my apologies for those who have been receiving the blog updates through Feedblitz since 2007. I’ll be either paying Feedblitz to remove the ads, or I’ll be using a new service. Regurgitating my RSS feed is not actually what I want to be doing for The Monthly Mind, so I’m thinking a new service is on my near horizon. I’ll transfer your address there when that happens, so no worries about having extra work around the corner.
Signing up for the newsletter is easy. Just submit your email address below and you’ll receive a verification email with more information:
  Via FeedBlitz
(This page’s content will change as the newsletter becomes more finalized.)
