Over at Furious Seasons, you’ll find an excellent post about the clinical trial mania (pardon the bad pun) regarding Seroquel. Basically, Philip Dawdy went to the government’s clinical trials site and saw what was happening with Seroquel trials. The drug industry always talks about how much money it spends on research and development, yet if this is what counts as R & D, it is no wonder many people are not swayed by the industry that R & D consistently yields great new medications. Why develop new meds when you can just market existing drugs ad nauseum. Here are some of the trials that he found…

"Quetiapine (Seroquel) Maintenance Treatment in Early Onset Bipolar Spectrum Disorders" in 12 to 20 year olds
Quetiapine Fumarate (SEROQUEL) Compared to Placebo in the Treatment of Children & Adolescents With Bipolar I Mania" in 10 to 17 year olds
Quetiapine for Mania In Preschool Children 4 to 6 Years of Age With Bipolar Disorder" from the fine folks at Harvard Medical School
"Safety & Efficacy Study of Quetiapine Fumarate (SEROQUEL®) vs. Placebo in Generalized Anxiety Disorder"
"Quetiapine Augmentation for Treatment-Resistant PTSD"
I’d write more, but I’m not one to steal Dawdy’s well-deserved thunder on this one. Please read his full post. You’ll be glad you did. Since we’re talking about Seroquel, anyone want a sponsored editorial with that?
