 
ECT is artificial induction of fits (seizure) by sending an electric current through the brain. It is useful therapy for psychiatric disorders such as major depression, bipolar mania, bipolar depression and psychosis associated with child birth. In addition, it is used in patients with schizophrenia who have strong suicidal or homicidal ideas and psychotic patients who are not taking meals/water.

The main advantage of ECT over medications is its ability to give a quick response. Medications usually take at least two weeks to act. Therefore ECT would be one of the options when quick response is needed.

Problems and side effects associated with ECT


1. Problems of general anesthesia: - ECT is given under general anesthesia. Therefore, all the problems associated with general anesthesia can occur. They include allergic reactions, difficulty in getting up from anesthesia, post anesthesia muscle pain and stuff in the stomach going into the lungs (aspiration).

2. Memory loss: - ECT is associated with memory loss for certain events. This memory loss is usually irreversible. Level of memory loss is directly proportionate to the amount of electric current or the dose.

3. Possibility of aggravating problems inside the head: - If the patient has a defect in blood vessels inside the brain, there is a possibility of that being ruptured.

4. Possibility of getting uncontrollable fits or status epilepticus: - If the patient has a past history of epilepsy then there is a chance of getting a seizure that cannot be controlled. However, since the patient is anesthetized and an anesthetist is around this problem can usually be sought out. But the patient can get secondary seizure when he was in the ward.
