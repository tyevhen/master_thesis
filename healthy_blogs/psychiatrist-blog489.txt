We get a number of unsolicited emails every week from people offering to write guest posts for us.  They would like us to put their tag line on their posts, often links to websites having to do with getting online degrees or dental equipment or what have you.  The same sources often query us repeatedly.

This is just to make our policy on guests posts known: Shrink Rap does not accept guests posts from unsolicited sources.  Our guest posts are either written by people we have asked to contribute, or we've seen something that has been written for another venue and we ask for permission to reprint it here.
