I have been tagged for a Thinking Blogger Award by two sites in the recent past. Thanks to both Junkfood Science and ShrinkRap for the kind nominations.
When one is nominated, it is apparently one’s duty to pass along five sites that make one think. Um, ONLY five? That’s tough, since I draw inspiration from many sources, which is a credit to the many excellent mental health and scientific misconduct-related blogs. So, in alphabetical order, I offer the following, with no insult intended for the many other great sites I visit regularly that did not make the list… [Update: Links to sites below now functional]
Furious Seasons
Health Care Renewal
PharmaGossip
Scientific Misconduct Blog
The Last Psychiatrist
Again, I feel bad limiting the list to only five, but rules are rules! If you have been nominated and want to play the game, then you must do the following:
1. If, and only if, you get tagged, write a post with links to five (no more, no less!) blogs that make you think,
2. Link to this post so that people can easily find the exact origin of this blog-love thread,
3. Optional: Proudly display the 'Thinking Blogger Award' with a link to the post that you wrote (here is an alternative silver version if gold doesn't fit your blog).
