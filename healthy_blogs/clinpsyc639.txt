Aubrey Blumsohn has a very interesting new post about his saga over on his site. If you want a great case study of entanglement between academics and the pharmaceutical industry, you should really take a look at a good overview article of Blumsohn's predicament here. Then check out his latest post here. When you're done, feel free to scroll through his site, though it has quite a bit of info, so I suggest bringing your favorite beverage and a salty snack.
