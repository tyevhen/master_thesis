It seems hard to believe that it has been almost three months since my last
dutasteride update. This last quarter has been interesting … and everything continues to be positive.

Exercise Program:
My long exercise program has averaged 93 minutes this last quarter.
My short exercise program has averaged 18 minutes.
I have not missed one day of exercises in three years.
The exercises seem almost too easy now (especially leg exercises) and I am considering adding more weights and increased reps.
Neck Weakness:
I have experienced no neck weakness or pain since changing my neck routine (added two new exercises) and changing the angle of my PC monitor.
Last fall I was very concerned and for the last six months it has not been an issue.
General Comments:
I have not experienced any up and down days … everything has been steady and quite comfortable.
I have not experienced any pain.
Lung capacity continues to be strong.
Choking or swallowing issues are almost non-existent.
I have lost a little weight in the abdomen and hip area … probably a couple of pounds.
After almost sixteen months, I continue to feel stronger and healthier than a year ago. I have not seen a decline in strength … and, if anything, I have seen a slight improvement. Needless to say I am a ‘happy camper’.
