Perhaps this is more of a question for a philosopher, and not one for a psychiatrist.  But people talk about the same thing in psychotherapy:  everyone focuses on the things that give their lives meaning, whether they talk about it head on -- for example, by talking about occupational strivings or relationships gone awry -- or less directly, perhaps by discussing things other people do that they don't approve of, or a book or movie that resonated for them.  It's clear to me that people find meaning in a variety of things.  

Me?  I like being busy, feeling useful and having a purpose-driven goal.  Being a blogger has been meaningful to me.  At the same time, I feel best if I can sleep late, linger over coffee, talk with friends, win at Words With Friends, eat good food, and start my day slowly -- all things that go at cross-purposes with being busy and purpose-driven.  The simple answer is that family, work, and friends give my life meaning, but the more complex answer is ....well, that it's more complex.

Okay, so I thought I would ask: What gives your life meaning?  Do tell....
