There's lots of talk about Electronic Health Records and where the information goes and who has access to it, with the assumption that easy communication is mostly a good thing.  EHR's, cloud storage, and all there is to argue about aside, let's put a question out there: What's in a psychiatrist's note, anyway?  For the sake of our hypothetical discussion here, let's skip the evaluation note, and just talk about progress notes.  Oh, if you'd like to know what's in a psychiatric evaluation, buy our book, we go on and on (and on) about what happens and what gets written.


The progress note is a different story, especially when the treatment includes psychotherapy.  Some psychiatrists write a lot, some write a little, and I wrote all about it over on our Shrink Rap News blog, so please do surf over to read "You Don't Say: Psychiatrists and Their Notes."  


If you're a psychiatrist, what do put in your progress notes?  If you're a patient, what do you imagine (or know) is in your chart?  If anyone worries about such things, please do tell us what your concerns are.
