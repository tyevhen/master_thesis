Two upcoming stories will both titillate and enrage.

1) How a certain company hid risks of a medication. And I have the documentation to prove it. Of course, "independent" academics make a special appearance.
2) A researcher with an impressive record. It is unlikely that any researcher has given sexually transmitted diseases to more patients than this person. Holding patients captive? Yes. Running clinical trial sites that provide strange data? Yes. And more.

All coming, hopefully soon, from your humble correspondent. Readers, please continue to send tips.

In the meantime, several blogs have been absolutely ablaze lately, including the following. Do yourself a favor and check them out.
