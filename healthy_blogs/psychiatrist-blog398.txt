You hate to read.  Or you hate to read books, blog posts are fine.  You haven't read our book Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Discuss Their Work because, ugh, it's reading a book.  
We have good news.  Our book is now available as an Audiobook.  You can listen.  Nope, we're not reading it, it's narrated by Colleen Patrick, a professional.   Our book editor says "It's emphatic, not droning."  So glad it's not droning.  
 Here is the Shrink Rap Audio Site.
So you can download the audiobook from Audible.com, or you can download it from Amazon or you can download it from iTunes.
 Ten hours and 27 minutes of psychiatry  What better way to spend a day?
