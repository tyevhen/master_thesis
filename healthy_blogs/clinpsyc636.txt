According to John Mack at the ever-thoughtful Pharma Marketing Blog:
“2005 marks the second consecutive year of decreased growth in commercial support of continuing medical education (CME) by the pharmaceutical industry, according to the 2005 annual report of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), which collects this data from accredited CME providers.”
Why would these big supporters of infomercials, er, "education" do such a thing? John thought:
“This could be in reaction to calls from the medical community that medical schools stop accepting "free gifts" from pharmaceutical companies and that grants for CME from pharma be contributed to a general fund rather than to individual physicians. We could be witnessing payback by the pharma industry.”
There’s more on his site, which I encourage you to check out here. Go directly to his post on CME here.
Links to articles and abstracts that justify my skepticism toward the accuracy of medical education provided by Big Pharma can be found here, here, and here.
