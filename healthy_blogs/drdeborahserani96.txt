It starts with fatigue. You feel tired and overwhelmed, and you struggle to get things done. Soon negative thoughts come into play - and your cynicism leads you to feel helpless. Before you know it, you're in a state of Burnout.

Whether it is work, school or family, sometimes Burnout gets the better of us. Here are 5 tips to help bring balance back in your life.


1. Re-adjust your priorities. Cast aside things that don't need your immediate attention.

2. Delegate more. Call in the cavalry to help get things done. Consider saying "NO" more and "Yes" less.

3. Invite sensory and calming experiences like music, touch and rest into your day.

4. Bring color and beauty into your world. Buy flowers, look at art, experience nature.

5. Exercise. Get your body moving and breathe, breathe, breathe.
