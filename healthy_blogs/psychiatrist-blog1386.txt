Okay, this is official, folks. Dinah, Clinkshrink and I will be hosting Grand Rounds next week. It's been over a year since we first hosted. If you don't know, of course, GR is the weekly compendium of all blogs medical and noteworthy.

Last year we had the Amazing Clicky Brain.  This year, the eye candy will be even more spectacular.  

AND, we have a theme.  In some way, no matter how twisted the logic, please tell us how your submitted post is (or is not) connected with the upcoming release on July 11 of Apple's new iPhone 3G.  If you can't find a connection (or non-connection), we will still do our best to fit your post in.

To submit your blog post, please send your submission to:


They must be received by Sunday, June 22, 2008, at Noon (Eastern Time) for them to be considered.  Stragglers will be summarily ignored (or not, depending on where we are in the process of putting it all together).

EDIT: Also, like last year, we will be doing a special podcast on the GR submissions.  If you have a brief (~20 sec) audio file you'd like to email us for consideration on our podcast, please feel free.  I can handle any format.
