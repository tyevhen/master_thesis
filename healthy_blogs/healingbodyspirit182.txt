Kites rise highest against the wind. Like Phoenix rising from the ashes, I've had to pick myself up and go on. As a child I was sexually abused and lived with alcoholism and poverty.Later in life I battled chronic fatigue and liver cancer and at age 33 the loss of my husband to cancer. We were expecting our fourth child. I gained strength from walking against the wind and went on to finish my master's degree in Ed. Psych, and a Ph.D. in Holistic Nutrition. Now I want to help others recover from chronic fatigue and depression. http:healingbodyspirit.blogspot.com
