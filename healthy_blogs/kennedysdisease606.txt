Below is a link to a short video update given by Dr. Fischbeck of the National Institutes of Health on Phase 2 of the clinical trial using a Novartis drug called BVS857. The trial is being held in several locations in the United States and Europe. Dr. Fischbeck uses the terms 'encouraging' and 'promising' in his comments on this study.

That is encouraging for me. :-)


"In this exclusive interview, Kenneth Fischbeck, MD, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) talks about the recent studies being conducted at the NINDS, in collaboration with Novartis, to understand, and find a treatment for, Kennedy's disease (spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy)."
