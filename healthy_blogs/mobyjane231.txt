Hi,

I'm depressant and I find it a chance now to contact you because I'm in normal mood now .
When I'm tired I can't contact you or correctly I can't think well .

Can I take out the idea of suicide from my mind ??


Thanks in advance , X

Dear X,
 No one can exist alone, without support and help. You must seek out some help for yourself now, while you feel up to it. Find a mental health group or organization near you. Even an AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) group is helpful for associating with people who are wanting to improve their lives. While you feel normal decide that suicide is not an option and make a contract with yourself that you will not consider suicide as an option even when you feel bad. You can always access the National Suicide hotline for direction as to your next move. A. B. Curtiss
