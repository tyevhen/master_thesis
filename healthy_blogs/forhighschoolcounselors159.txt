As I am sitting in my chair, daddy is snuggled on the couch, brother is rocking out on his guitar, and sister is watching a Christmas movie, I wanted to take the time to give my school counselor friends a small gift.  This gift is a list of some of the best school counseling websites and blogs (in my opinion) for high school counselors. Remember, the holidays are a time for people of all backgrounds to come together in peace and give their best.  Thanks to all the school counselors and educators who have dedicated time and talents to give us their best gifts.
