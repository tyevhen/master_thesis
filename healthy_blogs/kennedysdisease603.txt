Up until a few years ago, my wife and I loved “getting lost.” It is our term for a road trip where we
don’t know where we are going and when we’ll be home. These adventures provided plenty of opportunities to expand our world, try different cuisine, and learn more about our country and its history.

Unfortunately, ‘getting lost’ is a thing of the past for us. Trips, nowadays, have to be researched and planned ahead of time. The joy of spontaneity is now missing. 

The CostCo Connection magazine this month has a good article called, “Going Mobile – Making Travel More Accessible for Everyone.” 

I found it interesting that people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices spend $20 billion a year on travel. Another interesting number is that 24% of the U.S. population is projected to have some kind of disability by 2030. 

Cruises have become popular for those of us disabled because cruise lines have embraced this market. Currently, 14% of the disabled population has taken a cruise. The percent is much higher than the general population.

Unfortunately, a large sector of the hotel industry doesn't have the message yet. More than 10 million people with mobility challenges stay in hotels each year. The number of rooms available and services offered are still behind the times. One problem mentioned is that each traveler has different needs.

Below are some links that will be of help to you should you be planning a cruise or trip. The first one is one of the best I have found.
