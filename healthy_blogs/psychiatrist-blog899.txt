When you work in any setting, your view of it becomes distorted. Your vision becomes tunneled, and the world looks small. My husband came home one day upset because a client had burst into tears while they were talking. "Why does that bother you?" I asked. Apparently it's not something that happens a few times a day for him. And when I was a medical student on an oncology ward, one of the doctors came in for rounds late---on her to way to work she'd seen a young man get knocked off his bicycle by a automobile. She'd stopped to help, and her first question to the young man was, "Are you a smoker?" She quickly realized that it was not a particularly relevant question in that setting.

So do people in the real world have questions about psychiatry? What are they? What a time to ask: just as our book goes for it's final draft. I should have asked before-- What do you want to know? Maybe we're wrong about what we thought people want to know. Maybe we need to write a second book.

The good news is that after several requests, the jacket designer has agreed to add a duck. Bless our editor for asking--- no clue how she explained that one.

Why do I feel like we've been working on this book forever? Clink will tell you, "because we have."

So what questions do you think the general public has about psychiatry? Go for it.
