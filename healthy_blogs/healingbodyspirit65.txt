Histamine: Allergies, Brain & Gut Health
If you think that high histamine is only an issue during allergy season, think again. Most people are completely unaware that histamine facilitates a central role in:
•Brain & neurotransmitter function
...
•Digestion
•Food allergies & intolerances
•Mental & behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, bi-polar, OCD and ADHD
Histamine is released by basophil immune cells during allergy season. Histamine release causes those nasty symptoms of nasal drainage, sinus congestion, sneezing and itchy, watery eyes.
FACT: Histamine is a neurotransmiter, and directly influences brain function and behavior.
Back in the 1970’s, Dr. Carl C. Pfeiffer found a direct correlation between high and low histamine and certain mental illnesses. He postulated that problems in a biochemical process known as methylation was a major factor in mental illness. This is because the process of methylation directly affects the formation and breakdown of several of the brain’s key neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and histamine. Because methylation reactions break down our histamine, Dr. Pfeiffer realized he could identify a person’s methylation activity by monitoring the histamine in their blood. Dr. Pfeiffer’s successful treatment of mental health patients was based largely on this. Dr. William Walsh has trained physicians on the use of whole blood histamine as a way to understand methylation activity among mental health patients.
According to Dr’s Pfeiffer and Walsh’s research:
“High histamine types” are typically those suffering from:
•Depression
•OCD
•Suicidal tendencies
•Phobias
“Low histamine types” are typically those suffering from:
•Anxiety disorders
•Panic tendencies
•Paranoia
•Paranoid schizophrenia
FACT: Histamine is essential for digestion, through the control of stomach acid secretion. Histamine can also be produced in response to certain food allergies and intolerances.
