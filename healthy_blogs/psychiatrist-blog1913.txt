So we finally did our first podcast after talking about it for a month. It's about 25 minutes long and can be found here [this link didn't work using Firefox...I'm working on it fixed]. We couldn't use Shrink Rap for the name, as DrDave is already using it for his psychology interview-type podcast, ShrinkRapRadio. So we came up with this title, My Three Shrinks, with surprisingly little discussion. (Wife prefers the name, Shrinky Dinks, but that makes me feel a bit emasculated. Don't go there.)
Yes, the theme is ripped from the 1960's TV sitcom, My Three Sons, even down to the re-done logo and theme song (Clink wanted us to do Put Down the Duckie, but it just didn't seem to fit in well... maybe in a later one.)

Can you figure out which shrink is which?

So, here are the show notes for the podcast:

Also a nod goes to Dr Dave Van Nuys at shrinkrapradio.com, who kindly pointed out he was doing a Psychology podcast of the same name way before us. Check it out, it's very well done
Dr Anonymous is not mentioned even once in this podcast
