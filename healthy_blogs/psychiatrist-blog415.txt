Here are the topics we discuss on this fine evening at Roy's house:

What does "Shrink Rap" mean (reader request)?
Roy talks about an "amazing" conference he went to called Partnership with Patients.  This conference was started by Regina Holliday, patient-advocate-extraordinaire. Here are some links for things that caught his attention:
HealthCamp: http://HealthCa.mp/kansascity
http://partnershipwithpatients.com/
Donate to Patient Pod at Medstartr at http://bit.ly/patientpod where Pat Mastors is trying to raise $4200 by Oct Nov 20 (oops, we missed that deadline) (the date was extended... please help fund the project. ~Roy).
 Clink talks about a Massachusetts legal case regarding gender reassignment of prisoners
And finally, we talk about a reader's question about how and why patients test their therapists/psychiatrists.
