My novel, Double Billing, is now available as a Kindle e-book for $2.99.  The paperback version will be out in a couple of weeks.
A little less psychiatry than Home Inspection, which is also available as both an e-book and a paperback on Amazon.
Cover art by Natalie Adachi.

As always, if you read my books, I encourage you to put a review on Amazon.

Coming Soon --  Mitch & Wendy: Lost in Adventure Land.
