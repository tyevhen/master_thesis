Each month I will showcase a technology tool that I am using to share information with students, staff, and other professionals. This month's tool is Prezi.

Prezi is a zooming canvas that presents information in a creative, attractive and interesting format; a great alternative to Power Point!  Although Prezi has been around for a while, I am surprised how little Prezi is used among educators in my school.  I think of Prezi as the Wonder Woman of the Justice League Super Heroes. She is beautiful, versatile, and capable of much; however, she is the not the first superhero to be called on when there is a need. 

It is time to change that mindset!
Prezi is like Wonder Woman-
beautiful, but not the first to be chosen!

My Prezi--Don't judge!

I created this Prezi for my students as an orientation to their Peer Helper Course.  This was one of my first Prezi creations.  I am still practicing!
