Did you know that the human iris pattern is more unique than fingerprints?


Though your retina can change with age, your iris remains intact. And no two iris blueprints are mathematically alike, even between identical twins and triplets.


Iris Scan technology has been growing for several decades. Many secured registered-traveler programs in the US and Canada incorporate iris scanning as part of their standards - allowing registered travelers to breeze through airport security. In the UK the "Iris Recognition Immigration System" is a fast and secure way to clear immigration. And in Amsterdam, you can fly passport free with iris scan recognition.


Many schools are implementing iris scanning to help with security, law enforcement uses this biometric technology to track prisoners, identify missing or lost children and senior citizens. Banking establishments and governmental agencies use the technology to prevent fraud, identity theft and terrorism.


But did you know that your iris can now detect your personality?


According to a recent Swedish study, people who are warm, loving, and trusting are more likely to have a greater number of crypts or pits on their iris. People with more furrows, or lines around the outside of the iris are more neurotic and prone to impulsiveness. The Pax6 gene, which is linked with tissue growth both in the iris and the brain, is also involved with the development of positive emotion and self-control.
Identification technology AND a personality profile?


The EYES really do have it!
