This is a story from a friend of ClinkShrink. I hope she doesn't mind that I stole it for the blog, but her friend suggested it.

ClinkShrink gets home and there is nothing to eat in the house (hmm...ClinkShrink can't make microwave popcorn). So she orders take out sushi to eat with her friend who runs out to get the food. She orders from this place a lot and she usually orders the same thing, so they know what she wants when they hear the name 'ClinkShrink.' The friend goes in to get the order for Clink and the woman behind the register says,
"Oh, take out for Clink?"
"Yes, thanks."
"Are you a forensic psychiatrist, too?" the woman at the counter asks.
The friend is a little surprised and replies, "No, actually, but ClinkShrink is." Then the woman smiles and says, "Oh yeah, she cut up the bodies like on TV." and as she says this, this pretty, demure woman makes a few zorro-like swishing sword motions over the cash register. Clink's friend considered saying, "Actually, she has a clinic in the prison," but realized this wouldn't be as 'sexy' as cutting up the bodies and just laughed and said, "Yes."
