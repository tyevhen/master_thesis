There are remarkable similarities between birth and death.
Elder Bruce R. McConkie (LDS Church leader) said:
"We know that this ...great plan of progression
called for birth which would provide a mortal
tabernacle for our eternal spirits, and for a death
which would free those spirits from the frailties,
diseases and weaknesses of mortality."
The words birth and death both describe movement.
Birth describes our movement from the spirit world to
mortality. Death describes our movement from mortality
to the spirit world. With each movement we terminate our
existence in one place and initiate our existence in another.
When God sends forth a tiny soul
To learn the ways of earth,
A mother’s love is waiting here—
We call this wonder— birth.
When God calls home a tired soul
And stills a fleeting breath,
A Father’s love is waiting there
This too is birth— not death
