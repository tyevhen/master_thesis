People choose psychotherapy for a myriad of reasons. "Symptoms" often propel people to contact their primary care physician first to obtain a professional opinion as to the nature or cause of the symptoms. However, in addition to physicians and other appropriate health care providers, licensed professional counselors can also diagnose and treat behavioral health conditions, with the exception of prescribing medications.

Behavioral health diagnoses are treatable just like other medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease. Physicians often prescribe medications for behavioral health conditions, but their time is generally limited and may not be enough to provide all the necessary supports to improve and manage symptoms such as depression, mood swings, anxiety, attention problems, confusion, fatigue, co-occurring disorders, and other possible manifestations of behavioral health conditions. Many times, this is the time when a doctor or other helping professionals will recommend psychotherapy, with or without the concurrent treatment of a condition with medication.

Generally speaking, if you are experiencing symptoms that have caused you enough concern to discuss them with a medical professional, your pastor or minister, or in close confidence with a family member or close friend; or, have been significant enough for you to wonder if you need therapy, you may be a candidate.
