The New York Times has issued a play by play account of what has happened with those now famous Zyprexa documents. How the documents got released and by whom are contained therein.

In a manner more eloquent that I put it earlier...

On his TortsProf blog (snipurl.com/Torts), William G. Childs, an assistant professor at Western New England School of Law in Springfield, Mass., put it this way in a headline: “Judge Tries to Unring Bell Hanging Around Neck of Horse Already Out of Barn Being Carried on Ship That Has Sailed.”

Yeah, good point. Another ruling on access to said Zyprexa docs is expected on January 16th.
