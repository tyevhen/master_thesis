NPR did a broadcast in September (I think) about conflicts of interest in medicine. It's worth a listen, though I don't give it my absolute highest recommendation. Panelists include Jerome Kassirer, Ezekiel Emanuel, Sanford Friedman, and Thomas Stossel. Link here. There are a group of physicians who are outspoken about conflicts of interest being a sign of mega-progress in research who view drug reps as good teachers and conflicted interests as a means of benefiting patients. Stossel is in that camp. The irony is that he talked a few times about there being no evidence indicating that conflicts of interest create problems. He must have somehow missed such evidence as this, this, this, this, and this.
