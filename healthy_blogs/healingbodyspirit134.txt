Life is what happens while you are having a pity party. Eagles soar, tulips bloom, rainbows radiate colors, babes are born, birds hatch eggs. couples become engaged, women window shop, doctors save lives, miracles happen, people sing in church, children pray, choirs praise our Lord, mother's wipe tears, a toddler's first steps, the poor are fed, hearts are filled with love, mother nature kisses the earth, streams ripple over rocks, and ocean waves glide across white sands. With so much going on, is there really time to have a pity party?
