I had another article for todayâ€™s post, but this is a last minute replacement. 

We dodged a bullet!

At around 8:30 PM last night our little community was hit by a tornado.  Many buildings and homes all over the area are destroyed or badly damaged.  There are several deaths reported and many injuries, but fire and rescue teams are still searching homes and buildings for survivors.

The tornado came right over the mountain to our west and swooped down into the valley below us.  About 300 yards from our house, the tornado turned north and left a path of destruction and death for several miles. 



The Aftermath

Today, thousands of homes are without power or drinking water.  Communications are limited.  The public is being asked to stay home because of downed power lines and trees, road debris, and continued rescue efforts. 

We know of a few neighbors who worked through the night trying to locate survivors.  My wife and several other neighbors are helping to clean up some of the fallen trees and other damage in the area.  The death toll and injuries continue to mount as teams work their way through destroyed homes and buildings.

Things like this always seem so terrible when you watch them on television.  Living though it is something far worse.  We are thankful that the tornado missed us, but also grieving for neighbors, friends, and others in the community that are still having to come to terms with this destruction.

The whole thing just does not seem real!
