Red Queen, by Victoria Aveyard
Mare Barrow struggles for survival in a world where there is a ruling class, the Silvers, who proudly proudly display their superpowers in order to make the powerless Reds feel belittled. The Reds are forced into poverty and are slaves to the Silvers' war. All Reds who don't have any special skills (like sewing, fishing, etc.) by the age of 18 are forced to fight and die in the war. Mare is approaching the age of 18 and is becoming increasingly disobedient to the laws of the Silvers. But she has a few lessons to learn. 

This is one of the better teen dystopias I've read in a while. The world-building is unique and the characters are engaging. It's unlike many of the dystopias lately in that it gives you the opportunity to see how the bad guys aren't all bad. But it does also has some typical aspects of teen dystopias with female main characters. I'd like to see more teen fantasy/sci-fi with male characters these days, as I find them more to the point and less about messed up romance. 

Overall, if you like teen dystopia, you'll like this book. If you don't, you won't.
