Dear AB, 

Thank you very much for your continued encouragements! 

Yes, I saw the entry and your experience with the "out/in the box" concept -- I agree it's excellent to use imagery to seperate depression from the self.  I ve been told before that if your mind brings up a negative experience from the past - frame it like it's a photograph and then burn that picture to take away the negative energy, which I find has worked for me at times.  

Thank you again for your good wishes, I will prevail no matter what! 

Kindest regards,Y______

Dear Y______

I agree that visualization is a great tool. I will add the "burn the picture" one to my kit bag of mind tricks. Thanks, A. B.
