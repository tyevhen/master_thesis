Here are the Top 25 posts for 2006, counting down from #25 to #1 (by page views, per Google Analytics). Of course, the older articles are more likely to make it to this list, as well as those which were well-linked (like #1, which has a link on Wikipedia). For what it's worth, the main blog page had 27,809 page views, with 9991 "absolute unique visitors" (I'm sure we had at least 9 more prior to installing Analytics, so I'm callin' it 10,000).
