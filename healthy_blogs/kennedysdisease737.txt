I came across this link for the Tek-RMD on the KD-UK Facebook page. http://www.matiarobotics.com/tek-rmd.html

The device has some interesting features. What interested me most was the one video where the man was able to sit down in an ordinary chair. It has been a couple of years since I gave that up. I do miss the recliners and watching television from an easy chair. They are definitely more comfortable. It would be great in the kitchen, especially with the higher cupboards. I liked the remote control option. You can park it somewhere else after you have transferred to a bed or chair. I am also curious how stable it is. And, could you comfortably sit back in the seat strap?

Potential Issues:
The small wheels might not work well on carpets or safely drive over small ridges/bumps
Throw rugs might bunch up when turning
It is currently designed for a paraplegic
Hand and arm strength is required for self-mounting (how much arm strength)
What kind of pressure does this place on your leg joints?


I will definitely bookmark this webpage and continue to follow the evolution of the device.
