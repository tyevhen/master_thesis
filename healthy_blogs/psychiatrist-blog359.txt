So our psychiatric society now has a separate listserv just for CPT code issues (not my idea) and the CPT posts on both listservs are flying in.  What codes to use, what codes insurers are denying, what rates insurers are paying.  I'm not sure anything has caused such confusion and angst in recent years.

How's it going for you?

My CPT YouTube Tutorials are still up if you'd like to watch, but with so much speculation going on among the professionals, I don't think anyone has any idea what we are supposed to be doing.  

For one patient back in December, I requested pre-authorization for psychotherapy with med management (the old 90807), I was sent authorization to see the patient for 20 visits for 99211 -- 5 minute visits (and they said that).  I re-submitted a Uniform Treatment Plan asking for authorization for more reasonable codes, but just the idea!  

So it's been just about a month: If you're a patient, are you getting reimbursed?  If you're a shrink: are you getting paid?  I'll ask again in a few weeks, but I'm assuming I'll be filling out many repeat statements for patients to submit.

Tell me your stories!
