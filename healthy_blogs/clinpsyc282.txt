A CEO switch and a 15% cut in workforce, for starters. Things are not swinging so well at Cyberonics, manufacturer of the vagus nerve stimulator, used to treat severe depression. Concern regarding its efficacy has made VNS use quite infrequent. Cyberonics made my sights due to some clever (and ethically dubious) marketing on behalf of one of its associated academics, Charles Nemeroff. Background here and here.

I've had readers provide numerous comments and send emails on VNS. Suffice to say, it is pretty controversial and there are some who swear by VNS and some who swear at it. The efficacy trials do not paint a generally favorable picture.

Hat Tip: Pharmalot.
