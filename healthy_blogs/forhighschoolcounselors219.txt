National Prevention Week is held each year before summer events like graduation parties, proms, weddings, sporting events, and outdoor activities. Since National Prevention Week is in the middle of May, it allows schools to take part in a prevention-themed event before the summer break. From May to July, there is an increase in the percentages of youth who use marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol.
