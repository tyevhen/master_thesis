In a report that slams the FDA for lax oversight on clinical trials is tucked a gem regarding a psychiatrist named Dr. David Linden.
Last November, the Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision suspended Dr. Lindenâ€™s license for three months because he had sex with two patients and gave them genital herpes infections, according to board records. Dr. Linden, who also owns a psychiatric center in Las Vegas, did not return repeated telephone messages.
WOW! He's also run into trouble from the FDA for poor conduct of trials -- giving herpes to patients was just icing on the cake. The whole story is at the New York Times. On that note, have a good weekend. In fact, I now officially proclaim the upcoming weekend as No Sex With Patients Weekend.

I hope this is not too tabloid-like for this site. I don't care about people's personal misgivings -- we all have our flaws. It's when these errors in judgment start impacting patients that they really bother me. I've not seen the records indicating that Dr. Linden engaged in such behavior, but I'm willing to trust the reporting of Gardiner Harris on this story.
