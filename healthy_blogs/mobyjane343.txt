Dear A. B. Curtiss

I truly stand behind each word you have written and thank you for all  the inspiring resources on your website. This kind of information should be taught in schools, along with yoga, meditation and information about nutrition and relationships...this is the kind of knowledge which would save people so many  wasted hours...hopefully, the next generations will be able to benefit ;  )

Thank you, C___________
