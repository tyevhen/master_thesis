For whatever reason, it bothers me when media says that psychiatrists don't do psychotherapy, and lately, it happens a lot.  What am I, chopped liver?
They quote a study by Mojtabai and Olfson in the Archives of General Psychiatry, and say, "Only 10.8% of psychiatrists see all of their patients for psychotherapy."  Is that really true?  Is it really relevant?  I tried to read the article and I wanted to understand how the study was done so I could think about it myself, but I didn't understand how the research was done-- Roy thought it was based on CPT codes, then he said it wasn't.  So why not go to the source?  I asked Dr. Mojtabai if he would have lunch with me and tell me how the study was conducted.

If that got you curious, please read about it on over on Shrink Rap News!  You're welcome to comment there if you're physician, or to surf back here and tell us what you think.  Ramin says he's interested in what people think, and he's been very kind about humoring me, both over lunch and in the many subsequent emails over the details.
