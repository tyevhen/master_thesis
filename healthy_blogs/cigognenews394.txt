Here below is  an example of today's psychotherapy. Look at her honors; a consensus of dunces, a complicity  of intellectual fools bereft of feelings who know  nothing of neurology or any understanding of what is going on in the brain.    And she has inveigled top ranking shrinks and neurologists into her scheme. The  is Booga-booga brought to its asymptote.  She is approved by a body  representing all psychiatrists  in America.  It is all about "taking   control of your life," that is distracting your mind away from reality.  Yes she does genuflect before old memories but then she uses that only to identify what is below current complaints. But if the memory is too powerful or too early or nonverbal, then what?  I have written a very long piece on this in my blog (in 4 parts, here is the first part.  Look it up.   art janov

Ask an Expert About E.M.D.R.
By TOBY BILANOW


The psychological therapy known as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or E.M.D.R., has gained increasing attention in recent years as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder among returning war veterans and others suffering from the results of serious trauma. The integrative approach uses rapid eye movements and other procedures to access and process disturbing memories.

“Recent research has demonstrated that certain kinds of everyday life experiences can cause symptoms of P.T.S.D. as well,” says Francine Shapiro, the originator of E.M.D.R. “Many people feel that something is holding them back in life, causing them to think, feel and behave in ways that don’t serve them. E.M.D.R. therapy is used to identify and process the encoded memories of life experiences that underlie people’s clinical complaints.”
The therapy has been recognized as effective by numerous organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association and the Department of Defense, but controversy exists as to how it works.
This week, Dr. Shapiro joins the Consults blog to answer readers’ questions about E.M.D.R. She is a senior research fellow at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., director of the EMDR Institute, and founder of the nonprofit EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Programs, which provides pro bono training and treatment to underserved populations worldwide. Her latest book is “Getting Past Your Past: Take Control of Your Life with Self-Help Techniques from EMDR Therapy” (Rodale, 2012).
