I've had it. Fat Doctor, this is your piece to blog about. Why can a legislator even propose a bill that would forbid restaurants to serve obese people? (I know, I know, you don't eat them anyway, unless they're served with dijon mustard). Even if it is Mississippi, what is this guy thinking? Substitute Native Americans, black people, Jews, Irish Nuns, Homosexuals, Cat Lovers, and he'd be tossed out of office. Why is it okay to target and torment the obese?


Mississippi Pols Seek To Ban Fats
New bill would make it illegal for restaurants to serve the obese
FEBRUARY 1--Mississippi legislators this week introduced a bill that would make it illegal for state-licensed restaurants to serve obese patrons. Bill No. 282, a copy of which you'll find below, is the brainchild of three members of the state's House of Representatives, Republicans W. T. Mayhall, Jr. and John Read, and Democrat Bobby Shows. The bill, which is likely dead on arrival, proposes that the state's Department of Health establish weight criteria after consultation with Mississippi's Council on Obesity. It does not detail what penalties an eatery would face if its grub was served to someone with an excessive body mass index. (2 pages)
