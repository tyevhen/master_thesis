thanks!

I believe they can sell pretty quickly, but it might still be there tomorrow. I think it will likely sell within the next 2-3 days, though.
I think refurbished items are pretty often replaced on the site, though, so I wouldn t worry too much.
Question :
Tips on making a SUCCESSFUL Craft Blog / Site?
Most of my life I ve had a hobby in crafting, but lately I have turned my hobby into a profitable business. I currently have accounts set up on both eBay and Etsy, but I wish I could go one step further . . . creating a blog or a website (for free for the time being).

I want to be able to not only display my products, but to be able to write blogs, tutorials, and perhaps even sell smaller items which I don t list on eBay or Etsy.

I m also not really sure what site is appropriate for this sort of thing. I visit lots of craft blogs, but a lot of them have, at this point, paid for their service, so I can t tell where they started at before buying a domain. I would like a place where I would be able to easily get things done, and be able to customize things quickly and easily. I have a few years of website creation (for small things here and there that eventually died out) so I don t have to have a service that is for complete newbies.

Finally, what are any tips that anyone can give me? I have a bad track record for making sites become and stay successful and active. I really want to make something that is successful and perhaps even popular some day, but feel like I don t know where or how to start.

Thanks for any help; oh and if you are a person who has a craft blog, I d be happy to view it if you linked it!
Answer :
I craft and turned my hobby into a business. I m also in the process of testing out blogs.

Blogger is free and worth a try. Many crafter use this option.

If you re familiar with hosting you can install wordpress or sign up for free

The hosting only costs a few dollars per month or you can sign up for free

It seems to me that if you give away good free stuff via your blog it attract visitors, also people are drawn to really good craft tutorials about pro-markers, unusual techniques etc
