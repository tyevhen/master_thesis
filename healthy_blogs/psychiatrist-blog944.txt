So usually we figure this stuff out by 'evidence-based' research...you know, the whole double-blind, placebo-controlled study using only those perfect research subjects who don't have other problems like substance abuse, pregnancy, childhood, or co-occurring disorders.

This month, Consumer Reports gives their own breakdown of what works for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Here's the Link to their overview. Buy a car, buy a dishwasher, get a shrink...same idea.

Dinah, Roy, ClinkShrink:

The July issue of Consumer Reports includes a survey of more than 1,500 readers about the therapies and drugs that helped their depression, anxiety or both (all those surveyed had sought professional help).

The report provides insight into mental health treatment as it's practiced in the real world, as opposed to the carefully controlled environment of clinical trials. A few of the findings:

- Of readers who sought help for a mental-health difficulty, 58 percent had experienced anxiety, up from 41 percent in our previous mental-health survey, in 2004.

- Rates of reported side effects among people taking antidepressants were higher than those reported in studies funded by drug companies.

- Psychologists (Ph.D.s), social workers (M.S.W.s), and licensed professional counselors (L.P.C.s) received equal helpfulness ratings from those who had talk therapy.

- Respondents to our survey who stuck with talk therapy for just a little while—at least seven sessions—reported as much improvement as those who only took medication (though people who did both fared even better).


I hope you will take a few minutes to read through the results and share the information with your readers.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Hmmmmm, so how come they didn't ask if therapy with a psychiatrist works better?
