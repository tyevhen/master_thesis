  Comments:
  i've been discharged to a safe house
I was released with the drugs
It's been 5 months since my hospitalization and I still haven't been able to meet with a case manager. It took 2 months for them to call me and they have rescheduled twice at the last minute.
price of prescriptions almost $400
Due to holidays and no case worker I didn't see anyone until about 6 weeks after discharge.
The meds were so costly, my entire prescription benefit for the year was used up for ONE month's handout, plus I had a $200 copay when I was told it was free (I told the discharge nurse these brand name antipsychotics were too costly, and she said no copay, but I was billed $200 later, and had to pay it)
The diagnosis was inconsistent with diagnosis of therapist and was based on false information from abusive spouse
they didn't set up where I was going of medication changes my regular out patient providers did
that made me worse than before I went in
I was very over medicated, against my instincts, and those instincts were correct once I got a second opinion. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar because I went manic on copious amounts of energy drinks- not because of a biological disorder. The drugs brought me down, but time/sleep during treatment would have done the same!
I only obtained a proper plan after a subsequent episode
I left when my own doc was appalled the treatment
Voluntary, private hospital, late 80s ( was 16), doubt I would have the same positive experience now.
I was already taking meds at the time.
Follow-up plan was poorly devised and seemed just to check boxes.
got out - tapered myself off all drugs - it took some time
One follow up told them was suicidal last I heard of them. Last attempt may of been successful. Hopefully yes but only time will tell and not going to the doctor to find out if I'm dying.
The Psychiatrist changed my perscirptions with disarterious results.
I was order to take oral and injection meds
I was asked to do an exit review but felt it would not be wise to honestly comment as i was worried i would be re-admitted at some point and they would have more ammunition against me.
Became an antipsychaitry activist
so my answer is irrelevant
Like whatever. Fix the damn system tired of losing friends to suicide. I love Billy btw. Loved your book too.
No one explained diagnosis.
I had no choice or options. I was violated.
They actually had me sign papers saying I was safe to leave the hospital when I told them I was no different if not worse ( signed papers with statement that I didn't agree but that I had seen the paper)
the drugs tranquilized for 14 hours straight when taken as prescribed; no information about tapering safely to a lower dose that I could function at was provided
followup prescribed inconsistent with their own diagnosis
