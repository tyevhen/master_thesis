Some statistics show that 1% of American women have anorexia nervosa, many people don't have idea on how dangerous this disorder is. Thousands of teenagers die each year due to anorexia and eating disorders. Society plays an important role to help solve this growing problem and make adolescents aware of the dangers.
If we want to see the anorexia nervosa impact on society, its enough to see the death statistics and emotional problems that they have to understand how severe it is. There are groups of people especially online that support anorexia nervosa as a lifestyle and they give tips and advice to them to hide their problem from their family and keep a rigorous diet.
I think we need to change the way society values people, there are testimonies of teenagers that were very happy, but when they started dieting due to an emotional problem they had caused by a critique of their weight, their life became miserable. Adolescents want to be loved and accepted in society, so when people critiques their body or physical appearance, sometimes the frustration is so big, that they do anything to be accepted be liked.
The consequence is that adolescents start dieting and exercising with obsession, to the point that they starve themselves and hurt their body. They also see all the celebrities in tv as perfect and they want to be like them, very thin.
Anorexia is an emotional problem and cannot be solved just with medications, the person needs to understand that what she is doing is wrong and is damaging her self. She needs to feel loved and accepted by her family to recover from this disorder, she needs to change her self image.
Society is causing a negative impact on teenagers, they are acquiring the wrong values from the media and take celebrities as their role model of success. Parents have to make their child aware of this problem and its consequences.

Commonly question about Anorexia Nervosa Impact On Society
Question :
Help please...thank you!?
I m doing a research project on Eating Disorder- Anorexia Nervosa...I cannot think of a thesis to prove about Anorexia nervosa. My teacher says to do it on something that impact the society or something like that.
Answer :
Anorexia Nervosa is an awful mental disorder that effects many people in our society particularly young women. I had a cousin with it, and she eventually passed away after being in and out of hospital for years. I think you will be able to find lots of statistics about this online and in medical journals. People with anorexia believe that they are fat and that people are staring at them because they are overweight. Over time they slowly ruin their internal organs and health. While they are anorexic they think illogically and are often agressive to those that care about them. This has wide implications for their families and society.
The incidence of anorexia has recently increased in African nations where they are having increased access to popular media, and the notions of what constitutes beauty are changing.
Just recently some companies in Italy are banning models with very low BMIs in the hope that it will lead to a more healthy body image for society.
Hope this helps

Body Image Obsession
Todays society is heavily focused on the physical aspect of our bodies. It is hard not to pay attention to the way we look. In the United States the value of being thin has been the predominant stereotype for women. The problem is that some women go the wrong way about obtaining that image and even go to the extent of hurting themselves to reach the ideal look. Cultural and media reinforce the belief that women should be more concerned with their appearance.
Society plays a massive role in influencing our lives and our judgments. In western society the idea of having a perfect body type has become an obsession. Never in history has body image standards had so much impact on society. The solution to ending Americas obsession with thinness is a change in cultural attitudes. In every society, people use their appearance as a way to express their social relationships. American culture portrays certain morals and ideas that women feel they must live up to.
The media plays a significant role in our cultural impressions about our bodies, most of our body insecurities are set on us by the media. Everything on it focuses on appearance. Women are under constant pressure to fit a certain idea of beauty. Seeing images of flawless, thin females makes it hard for us to feel good about our bodies. Teens compare themselves with images of models featured in magazines, and that may lead to negative feeling about their bodies. The negative effects about media advertisements not only include the pursuit of cosmetic surgery but it also includes a whole range of disordered eating habits.
Eating disorders include extreme attitudes, emotions, and behaviors surrounding weight and food issues; they can be experienced by both men and women. Starvation diets, pill, juice drinks, and other rapid weight loss techniques are usually the starting point to eating disorders. The two most common types of eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes an eating disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent purging. The most common form practice of people with bulimia is self induced vomiting and the use of laxatives. Some factors that can contribute to eating disorders are low self-esteem, lack of control in life, depression, anxiety and strong need to please others. People with eating disorders see something entirely different when they look in the mirror. Eating disorders are most successfully treated when diagnosed early. People with eating disorder most of the time do not recognize or admit that they are ill; as a result they resist to getting or staying in treatment.
Todays society is heavily focused on the physical aspect of our bodies. There is no such thing as an ideal or perfect body. Trying to achieve the perfect female body image seen on TV and magazines is leading an increasing number of teens to develop eating disorders. Because of our society description of beauty, we are lead to thinks we are not pretty or sufficiently handsome. Women need to stop allowing themselves to feed into what society considers an acceptable appearance and start becoming what they were meant to look like.
