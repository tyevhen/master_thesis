I just finished my 110 minute workout this morning and felt it was time to update everyone on my little experiment.  It is hard to believe, but the end of this week will be six months since I started taking dutasteride.


In reviewing my journal this morning, I noticed the last month has been a great month for me.  Almost every day I used words such as “good workout”, “easy workout”, “feeling extra strong today”,  “I have great energy today”, etc.  In fact, there was only one workout during the entire month of July where I used the term “a decent workout” meaning okay or fine.  Not once did I mention any decline in my energy or that I was experiencing any pain.

I averaged 110 minutes of exercises every other day in July and August (month-to-date).  Every day but one in July and all five exercise days in August I commented that the reps were easy or I felt strong that day.  Another term I used quite often was “good energy”.

What does this mean?  No, I am not cured.  But, it does mean that I feel I am far better off than a year ago in regards to strength, energy, pain management and confidence.  Hindsight being 20-20, I wish I would have started taking dutasteride a couple of years ago.  (Isn’t that always the way it is)
