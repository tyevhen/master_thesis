Uses of Ridal 
This medication is primarily used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In addition, it is used to manage behavioural problems associated with dementia. It is also used for severe behavioural problems associated with childhood mental health disorders.

How Ridal works?

Since this drug is an atypical antipsychotic, side effects are less than the typical antipsychotics such as largactil. It is because older typical antipsychotics usually block only the dopamine receptors and this causes more side effects. Ridal blocks both dopamine and serotonin receptors. It seems that the additional serotonin block counteracts the dopamine side effects.

What are the common side effects of Ridal?

Drowsiness is the commonest side effect. Gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea and vomiting are also common. In addition, some patients may get abnormal movements with this medication and akathesia (inability to keep the feet in one place) is another troublesome side effect that can occur with Ridal. Drug induced Parkinsonâ€™s disease is another side effect.

Headache is another common side effect. Some patients can get blurred vision. In addition, women may complain abnormal milk production from their breasts. Sometimes this medication can cause sexual dysfunction (impotence) in both men and women.
