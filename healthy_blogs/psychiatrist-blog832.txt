Happy New Year to all our readers. Can you believe it's 2011? I remember being a kid and thinking how long it would be until 2000 and thinking I'd never actually be that old.

I almost saw out the Old Year with Roy. We went out to a local pub for the best of Baltimore's crab cakes, and Clink didn't join us, but she did text in that there was a Duck in her Jacuzzi at what ever wonderful vacation spot she's in. A duck in
the Jacuzzi and we didn't even get a picture? This from the woman who texts me photos of every mushroom she runs across? We parted around 10, and for the first time in years, I was awake at midnight, drinking champagne and eating chocolate by the fire with family and friends (non-Shrink Rappers)...who came over to see the year out with us.

Shrink Rap will turn five in April. This is our zillionth post (well, not quite, but we're somewhere over 1,300 posts). Our book will be coming out around the same time, if you'd like a preview, it's up on Amazon, but not yet available. We're scheduled to talk at APA in Honolulu this year, but our talk, The Public Face of Psychiatry, has been scheduled at 7 AM on the last day of the conference. Will anyone come? 7 AM???

Finally, this past week, we were mentioned on The Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Blog as one of the Top 50 Psychiatry Blogs (I didn't know there were 50 Psychiatry Blogs!)-- do check it out-- and we had a guest post up on Kevin MD, a revised version of our post on How to Find a Shrink.
