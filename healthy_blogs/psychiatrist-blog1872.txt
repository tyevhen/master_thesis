I was at a shrink meeting the other night, and was handed the usual pile of papers. One of them included a letter from a psychiatrist named Michael Blumenfield at New York Medical College. I happened to notice that his signature included, "podcast: www.shrinkpod.com" --seems we're not the only podcasting shrinks, and Dr. Blumenfield does more of an Interview with the Experts thing, definitely worth checking out: Shrink Pod .

And another link: Journal Watch, Medicine that Matters, the depression/anxiety page at: http://www.jwatch.org/cgi/collection/depression-anxiety

Any psychopharm updates, Roy???
