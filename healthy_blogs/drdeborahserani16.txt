Sometimes it's a challenge to stay positive during the holiday season. 

Want to keep hub-bub and the hum-bug to a minimum? Try to stick to these simple rules:

1. Avoid over-scheduling yourself. Use a calendar to keep track of your holiday commitments so you can physically see what you're committing to. Give yourself room to say "No" to things that aren't important this holiday season and learn to delegate so you can get things done with help. 

2. Lower your expectations. Don’t strive for perfection, and learn that good enough is okay. Don’t expect family and friends to be on their best behaviors either. People who are toxic year round rarely take time off for the holiday. 

3. Make a budget and stick to it. Beware of the joy-to-stuff myth ratio: that more stuff equals more joy. It doesn't. Instead, work within a budget and use lists to keep track of presents. 

4. Spread your socializing in the months after the holidays. Don’t try to pack a year’s worth of socializing into a few weeks. Start a new tradition with friends or family to connect in the New Year if you can't get to see them during the holidays.

5. Get as much rest as you can. Schedule some pajama days for yourself or for the whole family during the holiday season. Stay home, rest and enjoy some time together without rushing about. Holidays are for celebrating what is truly important: being with loved ones.
