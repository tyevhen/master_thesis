For those of you who are interested in my children's books I am doing booksignings for the San Diego Zoo March 27 to April 3 at the Panda Shop. I will be signing the following books, Time of the Wild, Legend of the Giant Panda, In the Company of Bears, A Train you Never Saw, Hallelujah, a Cat Comes Back, and Dragons Guard the Zoo. You can read all the children's books in their entirety (except for Dragons Guard the Zoo which is 320 pages) on my website, http://www.abcurtiss.com. And I will be signing my book The Little Chapel that Stood in Manhattan, New York City, November 26 to December 5 and May 26 to June 7.
