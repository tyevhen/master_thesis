[7] . . . [8] . . . [9] . . . [All]

This podcast is a continuation from our #7 podcast, in front of Dinah's fireside studio (complete with the sound of an actual fire popping). I decided to leave those sounds in, but I did edit out Click's occasional cough (she's all better now).

January 30, 2007:
Topics include:
Lost. 8 more days (good collection of media snippets at LostHatch.com).
NYT: Optimism. "You Are What You Expect" by Jim Holt in the Jan 21 issue. The NYT Magazine also ran a story on Jan 7 about positive psychology (the link is actually to The Huffington Post's post about this), and talks about one of the field's founders, Marty Seligman, who runs the Positive Psychology Center at UPenn (you can also participate in some quick online research there). Link to My Thought Coach on iTunes. "Expect more of yourself, and less of others."
AAPL: Lies and Coercion: Why psychiatrists should not participate in police and intelligence interrogations, by Jeffrey S. Janofsky. History and ethics of psychiatrist involvement in police interrogations.
Book: Maconochie's Experiment, by John Clay. Clink: "This is the fellow who invented our modern parole system."
Shrink Stalker Jailed 9 Years. Woman stalked psychiatrist, attempted to blow up his houseboat.
Book: I Know You Really Love Me: A Psychiatrist's Account of Stalking and Obsessive Love, by Doreen Orion. Clink: "Psychotic killers are easier to treat than non-psychotic killers." Qu'est que c'est?
Next week: Biochemical effects of chocolate on mood.
The musical snippet used in last week's podcast came from the Boomtown Rats' "House on Fire", from their 1994 album, Great Songs of Indifference.
