Again it is Wensday and I am looking at the sands of the hourglass piling up against me. My shift starts in a few hours, so of course this was a perfect time to get distracted researching whether "Terra Nova" was renewed for another season or not. I was depressed; I needed the distraction. Right?

I've been working on a review of Apple iOS 5's Reminder program. I've run the app through its paces and come up with a list of strengths and weaknesses. Unfortunately, I've been swamped with life, work, &c. and found myself missing that self-imposed Wensday deadline every week. When was the last time I wrote here anyway? 1998? I can't recall.

So, obviously I'm not writing. What have I been doing?
