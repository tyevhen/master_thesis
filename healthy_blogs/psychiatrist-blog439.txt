I've stumbled upon two Shrink Blogs I'd like to share.  While there are plenty of medical blogs, there still are not all that many are about psychiatry.  A handful, but they come and go, and given the number of psychiatrists, it still seems small to me.

Dr. Greg Smith blogs here: http://gregsmithmd.com/
He also has a twitter feed.
I'll let you check it out.

Dr. Jordan Smoller has a blog over on Psychology Today .  I stumbled across his blog today and thought, wait, I know him.  Dr. Smoller's blog is called "The Other Side of Normal" which is the same name as a book he wrote.  Funny how that works.  In one of his posts, he starts by talking about his first real job as a research assistant in 1983.  That lab had another research assistant: me.  So Jordan is stuck in my mind as we were as back then.  He introduced me to rap, a form of music I had never heard of.  Jordan would walk around our shared office mumbling something about a blind dog and a seeing eyed man.   Anyway, I suppose we all grow up, and in some strange bid for universal balance, I eventually had a child who spent years walking around my house rapping, and I became the Shrink Rapper while he became the "normal" guy.  Go figure. 

Check out their blogs and tell me what you think.
