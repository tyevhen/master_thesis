I was able to score one of the coveted invites to the beta site www.seesmic.com and started playing around with it today. I can't tell you yet if it is a fancy distraction or a useful communication tool. The best way to describe it is Twitter with video. It's not YouTube, however. Conversations are done entirely with video. Imagine hundreds of people using their webcams to reply to deep, philosophical questions while hanging out in their bathrobes. Isn't technology wonderful?

I look like something the Irish Setter dragged in, but I was willing to give it a go. (Cat's are much smaller and couldn't drag me anywhere. It's all that good food I ate and apparently tucked away like a treasured keepsake onto my waistline over the holidays.)
