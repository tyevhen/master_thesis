There's an article in yesterday's Hopkins Gazette about Dr. Meg Chisolm and how she's using social media to educate the medical students and psychiatry residents at Hopkins.  Greg Rienzi writes:


Chisolm, an assistant professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, said that she is one of a growing number of medical professionals who, despite the present-day climate of strict patient privacy regulations and oversight, see the benefits of using social media to supplement their work and interact with colleagues, patients and the general public.
Chisolm connects with others through her Twitter accounts “whole_patients,” intended to demystify psychiatry and psychotherapy for patients and doctors, and “psychpearls,” which is targeted to learners interested in “clinical pearls” about psychiatry.

To help expose future medical professionals to the benefits and potential pitfalls of social media use, Chisolm and Tabor Flickinger, a clinical education fellow, have set forth on the design of a social media curriculum for students at the School of Medicine. Ultimately, the two plan to design, pilot, study and implement a curriculum that uses social media to promote medical humanism and professionalism.

Ah, we wrote about Dr. Chisolm once before after she gave Grand Rounds at Hopkins on "Prescribing Psychotherapy."    And, by all means, follow her on Twitter!  (Yes, I'll be tweeting this).
