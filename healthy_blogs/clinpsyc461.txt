PharmaGossip has a great link to a video, purportedly of a Lilly drug rep discussing how he sold Zyprexa to docs. You should check out the full video, but I’ll provide two rough quotes from the video below:
1. Just drink a glass of water before a meal and another glass after the meal. That will counteract the weight gain with Zyprexa.
2. Statistics are like prisoners – torture them long enough and they’ll tell you whatever you want to hear.
