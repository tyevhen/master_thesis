I can hardly believe it has been a year since I started taking dutasteride. I reviewed my dutasteride journal this week and summarized my findings by quarter.
1st Quarter
I was flying high because there was an immediate improvement in strength.
Improvement in leg strength was the most noticeable.
I felt stronger and had very little pain.
Many of my muscles felt alive again … tightness after exercising.
Exercised seven days a week.
Continued to add exercises and weight until my longer program was two hours long.
No apparent side effects.
2nd Quarter
Stabilized at the new stronger level.
Didn’t notice quite the same level of high (strength) that I experienced in the first quarter.
For a week in May I had a significant amount of neck pain.
Continued to exercise for 120 minutes every other day and 15-20 minutes on the off days.
No apparent side effects.
3rd Quarter
Exercised for 115-120 minutes every other day and 15-20 minutes on the off days.
No apparent change in strength. Continue to feel I am stronger than I was six months ago.
No apparent side effects.
4th Quarter
I felt that I was over-training and was no longer enjoying my long exercise program.
I reduced my long program to 90-95 minutes and it seemed to help.
I began to experience neck weakness and cramping, often severe.
In the 11th month I noticed a slight weakness in the arms.
In the 12th month my right arm was weaker
No apparent side effects.
Final Thoughts:
This has been an interesting twelve month ride. I believe that dutasteride helped initially and that I ended up being stronger than I would have been without it. Over the last three months I have experienced neck pain as well as arm and neck weakness that I had not experienced earlier. What these means for my future only time will tell.
Conclusion:
I am glad I tried dutasteride and will continue to take it for the foreseeable future.
