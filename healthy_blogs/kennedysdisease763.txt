I wrote about Chris Symonds sailing in the Para World Sailing Championships earlier this week. Chris lives with Kennedy's Disease, but that doesn't slow him down much.

Great news!
Chris won the Silver Medal. 
Below is a portion of the article from World Sailing announcing the medalists.


"Poland's Cichocki dominated the Men's Hansa 303 and three final day race wins handed him his second Para World Sailing title in as many years, having won gold in the SKUD18 at the 2016 Para World Sailing Championships.

Australia's Christopher Symonds fended off a late charge from Germany's Jens Kroker to seal silver. The German settled for bronze."

What a super accomplishment.
