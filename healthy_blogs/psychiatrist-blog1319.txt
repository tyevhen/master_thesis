I saw a patient where the session seemed to drag. He was ready to go, but the session was little more than half over; I commented that we still had some time and I asked a few more questions. It felt like time was going slowly, really slowly. At some point, I finally realized that time had literally stopped-- the clock had not moved for some time. I glanced at my cell phone, only to realize that it was now 5 after the hour: our 50 minute session had gone on for 65 minutes. My clock battery had died, the clock had stopped, and I'm still wondering how it took me 25 minutes to figure this out. Hoping my patient didn't think I was holding him hostage.

Somehow seems appropriate for Election Day for the never-ending campaign. I am so glad it's finally over.
