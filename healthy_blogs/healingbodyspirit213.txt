University studies have shown that using your smile muscles, even by saying "Cheese," can raise the endorphins in you brain and body and make you less depressed. In my book, "Defeating Depression & Beating the Blues," I list 50 instantaneous activities or ideas to help you overcome depression. Listen to uplifting music, keep a gratitude journal, sing happy songs, dance, walk, exercise, help someone else, change your stinking-thinking by using positive affirmation such as "I enjoy having a sense of humor", practice laughing, are just a few of the fifty.

This is a review of the book:

By Anita Coleman (Nevada)
I have been in therapy for nearly a year and I think this book has helped me understand depression better than the counseling sessions. I liked the author's personalization, because I also was so depressed, I felt like I was in the belly of the whale. It's rare to find a therapist who understands what you are going through when you are depressed. I was at rock-bottom when I bought this book. It gave me hope. After reading her nutritional section, I found out that I had hypoglycemia and candida. As the candida clears up, and the diet improves (no sugar, white flour), I find that I am feeling so much better. I also walk around saying, "Cheese," and I believe it does change my endorphins. I recommend it. Maybe it's a five star.
