A new study concluded that the combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) worked better than either treatment alone for children with anxiety disorders. There was even a nonsignificant trend for Zoloft to outperform CBT, which was quite surprising to me. But that's not really the point of this post. The study can be read at the New England Journal of Medicine website.

I'd like to commend the researchers on doing something that is exceedingly rare in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy trials -- they gave a detailed report of adverse events. And we find that a greater percentage of kids showed suicidal ideation on... CBT. It was not a statistically significant difference, but it was nonetheless surprising. Zoloft, however, was related to significantly more disinhibition, irritability, restlessness, and poor concentration than CBT. This may have been a fluke, but two participants on Zoloft had "homicidal ideation" compared to none on CBT. I have bitched several times about missing/mysterious data on adverse events in psychiatric drug trials, and some have also complained that psychotherapy trials do a poor job of tabulating adverse event data. Again, kudos to the study authors for reporting adverse events; imagine if reporting safety data in such a manner was commonly practiced.
