Today was a busy day but I didn't want to neglect my readers so here is a shorty but a goody.

The classic saying "you have nothing to fear, but fear itself" may not just be a cliche and may actually hold scientific water. I came across an article New York Magazine blog about fear and anxiety their correlation. Over the weekend if you have literally 3 minutes take a look at this article. It is a quick read and interesting. There is a chance that the topic of fear and anxiety will come up next week in the blog so this would be a good precursor to that. Copy and paste the link.

Have a great day and rested weekend!
YES
PS-If any of you are a bit more tech savvy then me and you could help me correct as to why when I copy and paste a link, it doesn't show it on the blog as a link but just a website address that would be most helpful to me and the other readers!
