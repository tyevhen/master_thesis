I had my annual checkup this last week. My doctor commented he would never get rich off me because I only see him once a year.
The Good News:
I am as healthy as a horse
The Bad News:
I just can’t run like one
CPK is good:
My CPK is up slightly this year (230), but is still much better than the days where it ran 800-1,000. This is positive news since I increased the number of reps and length of my exercise program last year. It appears it is not doing any harm.

I had a complete blood workup.  Everything looks good including my HDL, LDL and cholesterol as well as my blood pressure and pulse. We discussed my neuropathy in my lower legs and feet. My doctor commented that when I was ready, we could discuss possible treatments that might help.
 
Dutasteride:
And, based upon the results over the last eleven months, I will
continue taking dutasteride this year. In reviewing my current condition versus last year, it appears I am the same or better except for the occasional neck weakness I have encountered this year.

Not bad for a guy 65 ‘39’ years old who is going to be a great grandpa any day now.
