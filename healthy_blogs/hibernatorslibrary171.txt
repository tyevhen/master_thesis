Reading the Bible As Literature Event
Hosted by Roof Beam Reader

Number 14 on my Classics Club list is the Holy Bible, so imagine my delight when I heard that Roof Beam Reader is hosting a Reading the Bible as Literature Event next year. Despite repeated promises to myself that I will not sign up for any more year-long blogging events (I already have 3 and that's probably more than I can handle), I need to participate in this event. I have been watching for such an opportunity for a few years now, but whenever I find one, it is generally a very conservative or charismatic group - which I wouldn't fit into - or it's half-way done. Or, people are just crazy mean to each other. I have high hopes for this one.

This will be a literary reading of the Bible, which is exactly what I'm looking for. I have three four Bibles that I will be working from, since I think a serious study requires different translations and perspectives. My three four Bibles are: 

NRSV

ESV

And for help in concentration while reading the ESV...

ESV
NABRE

Unfortunately, delving into the Bible as I would like to this year will mean that my other non-fiction goals will be put on hold (other than the Little House Readalong). But I think it's worth it. Here's the reading plan that Roof Beam Reader has outlined: 

The Reading Plan

January: Genesis 1 through Exodus 40

February: Leviticus 1 through Deuteronomy 4

March: Deuteronomy 5 through 1 Samuel 17

April: 1 Samuel 18 through 1 Chronicles 2

May: 1 Chronicles 3 through Esther 10

June: Job 1 through Psalms 89

July: Psalms 90 through Isaiah 17

August: Isaiah 18 through Ezekiel 8

September: Ezekiel 9 through Zechariah 14

October: Malachi 1 through Luke 18

November: Luke 19 through 1 Corinthians 8


December: 1 Corinthians 9 through Revelations 22
I'm really excited about this, and hopefully I have the time to delve into it as I would wish without totally throwing off all my other reading plans.
