OK, I'm not one to care about celebrity gossip and that's not the point of this post. I just saw this on CNN and it just struck me how far we still have to go about educating the general public about psychiatric issues. It would help if the media at least would get it right.

Here's a quote from the CNN coverage of Anna Nicole Smith's autopsy findings:
His death was ruled an accidental overdose of three antidepressant medications: methadone, Lexapro and Zoloft, according to forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, who performed a private autopsy at the request of his mother.
Ouch. When did methadone become an antidepressant? And how will P4P reimburse for that?
