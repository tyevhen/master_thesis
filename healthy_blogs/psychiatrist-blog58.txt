APA is in Atlanta this year and I'm not there.  ClinkShrink and Roy are, however, and they are tweeting. With their permission, here's a sampling of what's Twitter-worthy.  I was told not to discuss the zombie game.

APA President-elect Dr Maria Oquendo discusses the year ahead & some key priorities youtu.be/ptP7uZTceC0 @PsychiatricNews #APAAM16

Bennett: “In rural Illinois, the price of gas dictates whether patients show up.” The value of #telepsychiatry. #APAAM16 

In sum, ClinkShrink is thinking about physician assisted suicide (thumbs down for patients with psychiatric disorders) and Roy is thinking about telepsychiatry.
The Zombies are on their own.
