I have created a second blog that is more concerned with the technical issues of how to produce clinically and educationally useful graphics and the associated issues.  The new blog is at: http://gdpsychtech.blogspot.com/2012/03/why-this-blog.html

 Please send me your ideas and graphics if you like so that I can present them here.  My general plan is to:

1.  Post the graphics and how they were produced as well as commentaries on the learning curve to use the relevant software.

2.  Discuss issues relevant to using copyright material including slides that are now common in electronic journals.

I am sure that more issues will crop up along the way.
