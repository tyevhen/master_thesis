Seven is a lucky number.

Today, Shrink Rap is seven years old -- that's a happy thing, right?  I still love Shrink Rap, I still love having somewhere to chat with people about psychiatry, to vent about the paperwork things that annoy me, to share the aspects of my work I love.  I still love talking about ducks and psychiatry with ClinkShrink and Roy.

Thank you so much for being the best of readers and commenters, and thank you for sharing your ideas with us and enriching our lives!
