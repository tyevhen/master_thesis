Over at Furious Seasons, there is a great post about the possibility that for some, Seroquel might be addictive. Apparently, prison inmates are crushing and snorting Seroquel, or "Quell" as it's known in the clink. Ironic, given that Seroquel is being investigated as a treatment for addiction.

There have been a couple of documented cases of significant problems resulting from Seroquel withdrawal. Of note, there is very little research on any symptoms that may emerge as a result of discontinuing antipsychotic medication, especially for atypical antipsychotics. If nobody bothers to study the topic, then how would we ever know if "Quell" and perhaps some of its brethren cause nasty withdrawal effects? Of course, there's no money to be made by studying something as unsexy as withdrawal effects, so it probably won't be done.

There's much more over at Furious Seasons.
