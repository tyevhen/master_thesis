Remind, a free messaging service, is usually thought of as a tool just for teachers, but it can be a helpful tool for high school counselors.  Although I use email, Twitter, and our website to send messages, I believe I missed a large number of my students by ignoring text messaging. Recently, I began sending Remind messages to my students and parents regarding events, meetings, registration, class information, and so much more. 

If you haven't used Remind, here is a great tutorial to help you use this great tool.
