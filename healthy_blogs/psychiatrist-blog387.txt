We will be speaking next Thursday, December 6th, at the New York Public Library and we'd love to meet you!  We're under a program called The Thought Gallery, which sounds good for a psychiatric thing, right?  

Details are HERE.  The time is 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm.
The Mid-Manhattan Library is located on the southeast corner of 5th Avenue and 40th Street.  It is diagonally across the street from the Research Library (the Library with the lions).  We will be on the 6th floor.
