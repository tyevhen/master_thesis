The firms Science and Public Relations will officially merge today. As Science has exponentially increased its contracts with Public Relations over the past 30 years, this comes as little surprise to investors. It is rumored that Universities will soon end their "independence" to create a megaconglomerate: Science-PR-University Inc.

Billy Tauzin, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, expressed optimism, saying, "Hey, when Science, PR, and Universities team up on a project, the results can be incredible. When the three firms aligned for the Paxil in Kids campaign, that was amazing. There was obvious synergy that was able to take what was, frankly, a mediocre product, and really slap some lipstick on that pig."

Of what do I speak? In the parallel universe known as reality, Aubrey Blumsohn has detailed what seems to be a rather odious merger of science and public relations. It involves a an "independent" academic researcher, Procter & Gamble, and much more. His post is well worth reading.
