As an EMDR therapist, I receive many calls from clients who are seeking EMDR treatment for a variety of traumatic issues. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is an effective treatment for trauma, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other emotional problems. It is often much faster than regular talk therapy in resolving trauma. It is one of the most researched forms of psychotherapy, and it is currently being used by the Veterans Administration and other organizations, like local Bureaus of Child Welfare, to deal with trauma.

Although many people know about EMDR, they are often not familiar with EMDR HAP (Humanitarian Assistance Program). The EMDR HAP is a 501(3)c nonprofit organization. On their web site (http://www.emdrhap.org), they describe themselves as "the equivalent of Doctors Without Borders: a global network of clinicians who travel anywhere there is a need to stop suffering and prevent the after-effects of trauma and violence." EMDR HAP was on the scene in the Gulf Coast after hurricane Katrina. EMDR HAP volunteer clinicians are also in the Middle East and many other parts of the world where there are wars and natural disasters.
