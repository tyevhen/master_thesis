If You Really don't Prevent Diabetes Now, You'll certainly Hate Yourself Later



Type 2 diabetes is a very common kind of diabetes. Many Americans seem to have been told they have type 2 diabetes,and much more are unaware they may be at high risk. Some groups have a relatively higher risk for developing diabetes type 2 than others.

Type 2 diabetes is more common in African Americans, Latinos, Indigenous Americans, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians
as well as other Pacific Islanders, along with the aged population.

In type 2 diabetes, either our body won't produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Insulin is needed for your
body to use glucose for energy. When you eat food, our body reduces all the sugars and starches into glucose,that is certainly the essential fuel for any cells in your body. Insulin takes the sugar from the blood into your cells. When glucose accumulates in your blood instead of going into cells, it can lead to diabetes complications.

You have the capability to increase and protect your overall health. With proper nutrition and workout and also making good way of life
choices (like not smoking), you can feel better, stronger, and healthier, and will lower your risk of diseases like cancer,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.

Maintaining a healthy diet and staying active are even more important when you've got diabetes.

Well-balanced meals might help keep your glucose (sugar) level as near to normal as possible.

Being active also helps you lower your blood glucose. In case you increase your level of physical activity, you may be able to

take less insulin or diabetes pills. If you're very inactive, have heart disease or perhaps history of foot ulcers, talk to your doctor about safe exercise for yourself.

Check your blood glucose before exercising. If it's under 100 mg/dl, eat some fruit, crackers or have a glass of milk or juice.

Check it again after exercising to learn how your blood glucose reacts to physical exercise. Bring a snack if you'll be active for a couple hour.
