I mentioned not long ago the server outages that ensued when Windows 7 beta downloads became available. This is not supposed to happen in the world of cloud computing, of course. You're not supposed to be able to bring down "the cloud."

But there've been a number of high-profile cloud failures. Just in the past 90 days:
Salesforce.com Crashes
Black Friday Traffic Surge Overloads Amazon's Surge-Proof Servers
Cloud Computing Reality Check: Gmail Goes Down For A Day
Question: Where are you supposed to stand when the sky is falling?
