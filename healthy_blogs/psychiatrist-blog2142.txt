My blog is now going on its third day.

I'm pleased to report that I now have two Co-Bloggers: Roy (under deep cover) and Clinkshrink.

I've learned to embed links in text (thanks, Steve!) and I've inserted pictures into the Reflections of a Katrina Psychiatrist post.

Roy, Clinkshrink, and I welcome posts from other psychiatrists.
