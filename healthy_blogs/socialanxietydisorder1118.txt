Eating disorders are a very serious problem, and those suffering from them need to get the proper treatment in order to be able to resume leading normal, healthy lives. Depending on where you live and the severity of the eating disorder, there are various options available for treatment. Those suffering from severe anorexia or bulimia will most likely find an inpatient treatment most beneficial. For those living in British Columbia, one of the well known programs for treating eating disorders such as these is St Paul's Eating Disorder Clinic.
This clinic only accepts physician referrals, so if you are interested in getting treatment here you will need to go to your doctor and get your doctor to refer you to the program and send on all the necessary paperwork required by the program. This clinic only treats a few patients at a time in each of its programs in order to ensure the best treatment. This means you might have to wait a short while in order to be admitted to the St Paul's clinic's programs.
There are a few different programs available, and depending on the needs of the patient the professionals at the clinic will decide which is the most appropriate treatment program and place them in that program. Patients are not allowed to self refer into the program of their choice.
For those with very severe eating disorders that make it so that they need to be hospitalized, there is the Extra Care Program, which consists of a three week hospitalization to stabilize a patient and begin treatment with supported meals and individual and group counseling.

Question :
What justice is there in making marijuana illegal?
Washington, DC: Police arrested 847,864 persons for marijuana violations in 2008.Marijuana arrests now comprised one-half (49.8 percent) of all drug arrests reported in the United States.
Of those charged with marijuana violations, approximately 89 percent, 754,224 Americans were charged with possession only.The remaining 93,640 individuals were charged with sale/manufacture, a category that includes all cultivation offenses, even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use.

Commenting on the 2008 figures, NORML Director Allen St. Pierre said: Federal statistics released just last week indicate that larger percentages of Americans are using cannabis at the same time that police are arresting a near-record number of Americans for pot-related offenses. Present enforcement policies are costing American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and having no impact on marijuana availability or marijuana use in this country. It is time to end this failed policy and replace prohibition with a policy of marijuana regulation, taxation, and education.

NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano added, According to a just-released Rasmussen poll, a majority of American adults believe, correctly, that marijuana is less harmful than booze. The public has it right; the law has it wrong.


Myth:
Marijuana Can Cause Permanent Mental Illness.

*Fact:
There is no convincing scientific evidence that marijuana causes psychological damage or mental illness in either teenagers or adults. Some marijuana users experience psychological distress following marijuana ingestion, which may include feelings of panic, anxiety, and paranoia. Such experiences can be frightening, but the effects are temporary. With very large doses, marijuana can cause temporary toxic psychosis. This occurs rarely, and almost always when marijuana is eaten rather than smoked. Marijuana does not cause profound changes in people s behavior.


Myth:
Marijuana is Highly Addictive.

*Fact:
Most people who smoke marijuana smoke it only occasionally. A small minority of Americans - less than 1 percent - smoke marijuana on a daily basis. An even smaller minority develop a dependence on marijuana. Some people who smoke marijuana heavily and frequently stop without difficulty.


Myth:
Marijuana is More Damaging to the Lungs Than Tobacco.

*Fact:
Moderate smoking of marijuana appears to pose minimal danger to the lungs. Like tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke contains a number of irritants and carcinogens. But marijuana users typically smoke much less often than tobacco smokers, and over time, inhale much less smoke. As a result, the risk of serious lung damage should be lower in marijuana smokers. There have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana.

Myth:
Marijuana Has No Medicinal Value.

*Fact: Marijuana has been shown to be effective in reducing the nausea induced by cancer chemotherapy, stimulating appetite in AIDS patients, and reducing intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma. There is also appreciable evidence that marijuana reduces muscle spasticity in patients with neurological disorders.

Myth:
Marijuana is a Gateway Drug.

*Fact:
Marijuana does not cause people to use hard drugs. What the gateway theory presents as a causal explanation is a statistic association between common and uncommon drugs, an association that changes over time as different drugs increase and decrease in prevalence. Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in the United States today. Therefore, people who have used less popular drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD, are likely to have also used marijuana. Most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug. Indeed, for the large majority of people, marijuana is a terminus rather than a gateway drug.

Myth:
Marijuana Kills Brain Cells.

*Fact:
None of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana, even from long term high-dose use. An early study reported brain damage in rhesus monkeys after six months exposure to high concentrations of marijuana smoke. In a recent, more carefully conducted study, researchers found no evidence of brain abnormality in monkeys that were forced to inhale the equivalent of four to five marijuana cigarettes every day for a year. The claim that marijuana kills brain cells is based on a speculative report dating back a quarter of a century that has never been supported by any scientific study.

Myth:
Marijuana Use During Pregnancy Damages the Fetus.

*Fact:
Studies of newborns, infants, and children show no consistent physical, developmental, or cognitive deficits related to prenatal marijuana exposure. Marijuana had no reliable impact on birth size, length of gestation, neurological development, or the occurrence of physical abnormalities.

Now tell me what justice is in making marijuana illegal.
Answer :
I don t understand why it s illegal either. It s no more harmful than any legal drugs out there. But the fact of the matter is, marijuana is going to stay illegal unless enough people are willing to make a stand to change it. In general, people are unwilling to do this, because if they stand up for legalization, they are viewed by the rest of society as being a "pot head" or "druggie", regardless of whether or not this is actually the case.
