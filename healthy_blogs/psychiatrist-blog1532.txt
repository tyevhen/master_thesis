Okay, this is my last Top 10 list. We served up over half a terabyte (!) of podcasts last year, producing just under 40 podcasts on My Three Shrinks. We had over 30,000 unique visitors, nearly 200,000 visits, and served up over 100,000 podcast downloads!

Here are the Top 10 downloaded podcasts in 2007:
