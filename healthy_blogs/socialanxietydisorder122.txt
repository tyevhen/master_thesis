How many servings of fruits and vegetables should a child consume each day? How about glasses of water? Learning ZoneXpresss new Countdown to Health educational-product line, based on the easy-to-remember numerical slogan 54321 + 8, makes it simple for kids to remember the basics of healthy living.
The numbers refer to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, 4 glasses of water, 3 good laughs, no more than 2 hours of screen time, 1 hour of physical activity, and 8 hours (or more) of sleep.
The new 54321 +8 countdown is available in a 23 x 35 laminated poster($ 16.95), a package of 100 two-sided bookmarks ($ 6.95) and a set of 10 magnets ($ 9.95). Visit http://www.learningzonexpress.com to order or for more details.
We all need sound bites of information that we easily carry around in our heads, says Melanie Nelson, CEO of Learning ZoneXpress. And what can be easier to remember than a countdown? And according to memory experts, the +8 twist makes it and what it stands for even more memorable.
The six features of the countdown are critical aspects of physical, social, and emotional wellness, says Nelson. And if kids learn them in school, theyll bring them home to the whole family.
They may even literally bring them home. We have a poster for classrooms, libraries, offices, and lunchrooms, but we also have bookmarks and magnets that schools and community groups can give away, notes Nelson.
