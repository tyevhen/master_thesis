The 2011 Kennedy’s Disease annual conference and educational symposium was held this month.  Over twenty researchers were involved in the conference and many gave updates on their current research.

Jack Durning recorded some of the presentations and released them to YouTube this week. 

Presentations Available

Ed Meyertholen, the KDA’s guru in explaining Kennedy’s Disease, was one of the presenters.  From the attendees after-conference survey, most everyone rated Ed’s discussion as one of the most interesting.  Ed’s presentation is five 15 minute videos and one six minute video.  Ed explains Kennedy’s Disease, DNA, bindings, folding, the ‘wood-chipper’, cytoplasm, clinical trials, placebos and much more.

Ed, unfortunately, did not use a mike.  There were many times he was not facing the recorder’s mike so he is more difficult to hear.
