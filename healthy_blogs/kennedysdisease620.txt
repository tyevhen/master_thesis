Back in May I asked you to show your support for the National Institutes of Health by contacting your representatives. I felt this was important for any of us living with a neuromuscular disease or any other rare disorder including Kennedy's Disease (SBMA).



Good news!  The funding bill passed; Below is the message sent out from the MDA today. Thanks to all of you who took the time to show your support for the 21st Century Cures Act.

21st Century Cures Act Passes with Overwhelming Support

Today the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act by a vote of 344-77. The Act includes important provisions aimed to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of treatments and cures, including increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Increased support for NIH is critical, as funding levels have failed to keep up with the rising costs of medical research. This has resulted in a 22% decrease in the purchasing power of the NIH and in fewer research grants being funded. The 21st Century Cures Act makes important strides to remedy this by authorizing increased NIH funding levels and creating a NIH Innovation Fund that provides an additional $8.75 billion to the NIH over the next five years.
