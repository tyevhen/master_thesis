Dear A. B.

In fact , I found a job meeting customers, but I am not willing to go ahead and work. All this because meeting people will causes me lots of stress and then imbalance brain chemistry. I do not know what to do in this case. Please advise me. Should I start work or should I wait more time till I feel very good and then start working? R_________
Dear R_____________

You should start working and use your courage to meet people. When you feel nervous, say to yourself, "I am doing the best I can at the moment, even though I shake and stumble around. I must have courage and continue and accept the fact that I am a beginner and here I am beginning." Each time meeting a customer will be easier. You will begin to see each customer as a gift to help you learn social skills.

Allow yourself some failures. Say to yourself I may mess up with a customer and that is all right. It is like baseball. You will hit some outs but you will also hit some home runs. You might even confide to some customer that you have difficulty in meeting people and you will see how kind people are to help you out of your difficulty. If you accept the challenge, then the stress factor will be less because you will be using up the stress chemicals in meeting the challenge. And anyway, if your chemistry gets unbalanced, you can always brainswitch and restore the balance. A. B. Curtiss
