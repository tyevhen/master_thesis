So this is something different. A novel... by a psychiatrist... released 140 characters at a time via Twitter (@goosenovel). If you try to read it via Twitter, you have to start at the beginning, so it is easier to catch up by going to his novel site, for the twitter-impaired. It is written by Doug Bremner MD at Emory, who has already written a book about drug safety.

I thought the idea of a twitter novel was interesting (and surely Dinah will have something to say about this).
