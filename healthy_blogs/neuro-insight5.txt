We see miracles happen. Follow Sonia, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer. Due to her illness, she became less joyfull in life and had to take lots of medications. She had 20 NeurOptimal sessions so far, and, she has brightened up so much! Yes, we see miracles happen every day. Being a NeurOptimal practitioner allows you (me) to whitness these miracles almost every day. Thank you Sonia and her son Craig Walker for making this video available.
