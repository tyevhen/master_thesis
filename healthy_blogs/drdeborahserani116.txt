Science Daily reports that an international team of scientists believe a new class of depression and anxiety drugs might be right under our noses.


For thousands of years, burning incense has been touted as being good for the mind, body and soul. Now, biologists have learned that IT TRULY IS good for our mind! The burning of incense has been shown to be psychoactive - stimulating specific areas of the brain to alleviate anxiety or depression.


I burn incense often. Blue Champa and Lavender are my favorites. And I do find that when I use them, my mood lifts. Or I become calmer. So perhaps there's more to it than the uplifting smell of it all. Maybe it helps to shift my brain chemistry.

Do you use scents in your daily life?
