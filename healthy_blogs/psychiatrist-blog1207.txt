To those who wrote in telling me how to get to the right click:
THANK YOU!!!


Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. First I blog about In Treatment, now the New York Times has to write about it. I couldn't read it all, too many plot spoilers.

I'm going to give it a try, if I like doing it, I'll keep it up. ClinkShrink wants to stuff me in a closet somewhere. I'm trying to teach her to delete things unread.

Oh, and these people I blog with, they talked me into this MacBook thing. I finally figured out how to copy and paste. How do I save a graphic I see on the internet??? I miss my right-click mouse button so much.
