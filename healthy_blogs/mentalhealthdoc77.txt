According to the Atkinson and Hilgard's  Introduction to psychology Human memory can be divided into sensory store, short term store and long term store. To memorize things you need to optimize the long term memory store. Short term store or working memory is used primarily to maintain attention and concentration. Sensory store is a large repository of crude data and it cannot be used to improve memory.







TIP 1
Understand the items you are trying to memorize. Understanding the stuff automatically create meaningful connections (Automatic backlinks ). These connections can help us to retrieve stuff.
TIP 2
Organize stuff into categories before memorizing. Most common cause for memory failure is retrieval failure or we forget the retrieval cues. By categorizing stuff before memorizing it will be easier for us to get retrieval cues.

TIP 3
If you cannot remember what you have memorize. Then try to go mentally to the place you have memorize that fact. For an example if you want to remember a friends name in your high school then go mentally to your high school or try to remember buildings, teachers, events you have attended in your high school then you will remember his/her name.
