From the APA: "This is a special alert to watch CBS's "48 Hours" investigative news program this Saturday, Oct. 28, 2006, at 10 p.m. (ET). This edition of the show features an investigation into the Church of Scientology, and begins by recounting the tragic death of Scientologist Elli Perkins. Perkins was killed in 2003 by her son, who was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia but was mostly treated in accordance with Scientology protocols. The program asks the question Did A Mother's Faith Contribute To Her Murder? and then delves into broader issues, including Scientology's opposition to psychiatry."

[Edit]=====After the show=====
Dr Roy [it's a different Dr Roy]: "Tom Cruise and his 'religion' are more dangerous than I thought."

Dr RW: "Just got through watching the documentary..."

Leigh from Thoughtprints: "What's scary is that there are 10 million members worldwide. How can that many people allow themselves to be brainwashed by crap like that?! If any of you 10 million are reading this, I bet you're really pissed, huh. Whatever."

KFAN Rube Chat: 'The thing that really annoys me is that they use a cross as the symbol outside of their "churches". If you're such an enlightened religion, spoken to by aliens, wouldn't you have a more creative, or original symbol than the cross?
