A recent article in the Costco Connection was interesting. It explained that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued new warnings on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The new language used by the FDA is for prescription products, but they are also looking into over-the-counter products as well. Currently over-the-counter products warn about the risk of heart attack or stroke with increase dose and duration of use.

The new warnings for these products are:

The risk of heart attack or stroke can occur as early as the first weeks of using NSAIDs. The risk may increase with longer use of the product.
NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with or without heart disease or risk factors associated with heart disease.

The article summarized the warnings in this way. “In order to balance the benefits versus the risks, the short answer offered by most medical professionals is: Take as small a dose of medicine as is appropriate and/or prescribed, and take it for only as long as you need it or are directed to take it.”

As always, talk to your health care professional or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns.
