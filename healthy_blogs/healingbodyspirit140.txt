Dr. Susan E. Brown, author of "Better Bones, Better Body" lists six signs and symmptoms of bone loss.

1.Receding gums. Receding gums are quite common and can be attributed to a variety of factors, one of which is bone loss. Our teeth are connected to the jaw bone and if the jaw is losing bone, gums can recede. Vitamin D 3 can help reverse bone loss.
2. Decreased grip strength. This can be improved. Check out her article on exercise and bone health on the "Woman to Woman" site.

3.Weak and brittle fingernails.
4.Cramps, muscle aches, and bone pain.Cramps can be caused by a number of things. but leg and foot cramps that occur at night are often a signal that your calcium, magnesium, and/or potassium blood levels have dropped too low during the night. If this situation were to persist over time, excessive bone loss could occur. At the Center for Better Bones, I recommend that women experiencing nocturnal calf and foot cramps take their calcium–magnesium supplements closer to bedtime.

5.Height loss.
6.Low overall fitness. Osteoporosis has been linked to overall decline in physical fitness, as measured by aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and even balance. If your general fitness declines, it is likely that bone mass will also decline. Instead of feeling scared or worried by these changes, take the opportunity to put more attention on your personal health and longevity by taking care your bones. Even women who have been sedentary their whole lives can make significant gains, including better physical coordination, when they undertake a moderate, self-paced exercise program designed for their needs. And even people in their 80’s and 90’s have the ability to adapt and respond to both endurance and strength training. For ideas, read her article on exercise and bone health.

Strong bones are your fountain of youth
