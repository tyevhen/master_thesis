You Are Mystery



You are a natural problem solver. You like figuring out the best way to do something.

You are very intuitive. You are good at picking up on people's moods and predicting the future.

You can't help but being a bit of a detective and a snoop. You always want to know what's going on.

And while you may have the scoop on everyone you know, you're not a gossip. You're a pro at keeping secrets.
