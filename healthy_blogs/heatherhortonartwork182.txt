February 2005
2005
Oil On Canvas
48"x36"

I figured that the first post in this blog should be about one of the most important paintings I have ever done...if not the most important.

"February 2005" was created in the month of my mother suffering a major stroke. It was devastating to say the least and, despite the utmost upheaval in my family's life, I needed to continue to create paintings....to prove to myself that this is what I am meant to do with my life and not merely a hobby.

Therefore the painting is a visual representation of how I felt during that month, and subsequent months while my mother was in the hospital.

I wanted an uncomplicated composition, but one with impact. I wanted to depict a visual paradox....being claustrophobic within a spacious environment. My body language reflects an almost fetal position while the air around me, normally refreshing, feels oppressive.

Every time I look at this painting I remember that month.
