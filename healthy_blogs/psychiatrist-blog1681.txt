Google has established an Advisory Council for health-related googling. There are 20-something people on the Council, but no nurses and no psychiatrists (as far as I can tell... at least, no one is clearly representing these constituencies).

Of course, you cannot put together such a group without others complaining that they didn't get a seat at the table. Make the table too big, and it is hard to get things done.

But, given the fact that one of the main medical areas that folks do searches about is psychiatry and mental health, they need a web-savvy shrink (I'll volunteer ;-). And nurses are the infrastructure that supports today's health care system. The U.S. system does need fixing, but would completely collapse without nurses. They need a seat, too.
