I am adding two more to Sir Isaac Newton’s Laws:

10 pounds feels much heavier when it is held 6’2” in the air
It takes more effort to lift 10 pounds when leaning over



The last twenty days have been interesting. I mentioned in an earlier post that I was experiencing neck weakness and some discomfort in that area. This week, the situation is more severe and appears earlier in the day. I still haven’t been able to find a way to correct, or at least lessen, the weakness. I have:

Added a couple of more exercises that are meant to help strengthen the upper back.
 Changed some routines that placed more stress on the neck muscles

But, neither appears to be helping. I am now considering consulting with my neurologist as to possible ways to help mitigate the issue.

For those readers who are living with Kennedy's Disease or something similar and experienced this problem, have you discovered anything that has helped the issue?
