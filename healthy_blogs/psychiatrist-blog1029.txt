"The Reasons" is a website devoted to celebrating the decision to choose life rather than suicide.  They are looking for people to tell their stories... of tragic loss... of despair turned to hope...
...about The Reasons to go on Living Project, based at St. Josephâ€™s Healthcare Hamilton (ON, Canada):  We are collecting the stories of people who have attempted or seriously contemplated suicide but now want to go on living. The project will study and share these anonymous stories for research, education and inspiration. 
I'll add a link to it in the sidebar to make it easier to find later.
