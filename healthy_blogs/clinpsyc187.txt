As reported on Bloomberg, Pharmalot and Furious Seasons, an FDA official has overruled FDA reviewers to put Zyprexa on track for approval for treating adolescent schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Lilly claims it has no plans for a major marketing campaign. Yet given the glut of atypical antipsychotics, their frequent use among kids already, and the concerns associated with Zyprexa's side effects, Lilly will have to market aggressively in order to win scripts. Bloomberg also reported that Abilify and Seroquel may win FDA approval for the youth market before long and with Risperdal going generic soon, Lilly will either have to market their drug like hell (i.e., Operation Restore Confidence Part Two?) or accept a minor piece of the market. But perhaps they don't care - maybe the studies were just an attempt to generate good publicity and to extend the patent for six months, which was estimated to be worth a billion dollars in itself.
