This is Blog for psychiatrists to talk about issues pertaining to the practice of psychiatry. Somewhere to talk about ideas, controversies, clinical issues, whatever pushes your buttons.

It's fine to vent here, but if you're talking about a patient issue, please disguise the patient's identity completely, and if you're talking about a patient with unique symptoms, change those as well-- keep the flavor of the problem, but don't risk breaching confidentiality.

What this isn't: a resource for patients, though I will include some links to other mental health sites. This is a resource for docs.

I'm still trying to find a voice for this; it's my first blog and I'm not sure what I can do with it, so bear with me while I work on getting the kinks out!
