To quote from a report in the Edmonton Journal [all emphases added]…
Ninety-four per cent of 176 child psychiatrists in Canada surveyed are prescribing powerful drugs known as atypical antipsychotics for a variety of disorders and symptoms, including anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and "poor frustration tolerance."
While most prescriptions were for children 13 and older, a "surprising" number were for the very young: 12 per cent of all prescriptions were for children aged eight or under, including three-year-olds.
None of the drugs has been officially approved for use in children. Risperidone (brand name Respirdal) was the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic to children, followed by olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiapine (Seroquel).
Later, the reporter writes (providing no supportive evidence)
Atypical anti-psychotics are considered a significant improvement over older antipsychotics that were used in both adults and children.
Apparently the reporter never heard of CATIE, CuTLASS, or some of the other trials to recently compare newer and older antipsychotic meds. Oh, and if a kid has “poor frustration tolerance,” I suppose that means he/she is bipolar? Better ask Joe Biederman.
