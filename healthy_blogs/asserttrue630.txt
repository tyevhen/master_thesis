Hadoop World: Enabling ad-hoc Analytics at Web Scale


What I found interesting about this presentation is:
the existence of a (not-so-)secret IBM Emerging Technology Project called M2, which IBM calls an insight engine for enabling ad-hoc business insights for business users, at Web scale
the emergence of a new class of business application that might be called Big Data Analytics
Under "Big Data Business Patterns," IBM counts:
Computational Journalism
Business Fraud Detection
Evidence Based Medicine
IT Systems Management
as just a few examples.

And the chief enabling technology? None other than Hadoop.
