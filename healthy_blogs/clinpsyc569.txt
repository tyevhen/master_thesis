Wow, does Pharma Marketing Blog have a great post today! PhRMA and related industry groups have been complaining that the UK doesn't approve drugs fast enough, which is of course causing untold suffering and death.

You have to see Pharma Marketing's post here to appreciate the negative correlation between a nation's frequency of using new drugs and its average lifespan. I am fully aware that correlation does not imply causation, but the post really does indicate that Big Pharma's claim that delays in approving drugs is likely not a serious problem at all.
