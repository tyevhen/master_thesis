I like the book, :Chronic Pain Solution," your personal path to pain relief, by Dr Dillard. There are many other books you can find on line.
I think it is also important to try some form of exercise when you have an injury. Consult your physician of physical therapist. Inactivty builds up lactic acid in the body and will cause more pain. If you can't afford massage, have a relative give you a massage. Check out Dr. Stephen E. West in his book "The Golden Seven Plus Two." He recommends lymphasizing which involves deep breathing. Dr. West says most pain is lack of oxygen. He states that when you sit on a hard chair for a while you realize it stops circulation. Deep breathing helps move the blood around and it becomes more oxygenated.
