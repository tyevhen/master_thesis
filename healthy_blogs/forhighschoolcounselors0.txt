It is hard to believe that this is my fifth year anniversary for my blog!!!  Since its inception, my blog has been just a method for sharing my reflections, experiences, and thoughts with other high school counselors.  Maybe this will be the year for some expansion and graphic changes...who knows???  So to celebrate my anniversary, I decided to give a shout out to the other blogs that I regularly frequent and read.  I love each of these blogs for many different reasons, but they all have one thread in common...committed authors who love sharing with other school counselors.  I hope you will visit each blog and find some great resources, ideas, or even products to use in your practice.
