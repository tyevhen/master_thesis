Okay, so I've been complaining about the hassles with Medicare since I changed my address. So this morning, Monday at 9:23 AM I decided to call the Highmark Medicare Enrollment Helpline. I went through the assorted menus --- with several stops at : Please visit the website. So finally I get to the juncture where I can press O to speak with a live person. Oh, but the message I get is: "We are currently experiencing high call volumes and can not take your call." They suggest I call back later, and specifically suggest that the best time to call is 8AM-9AM on Mondays. Next week, perhaps? Oy.
