The intention of this blog is to share my experience of being an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) (what used to be called an Approved Social Worker, or ASW), practicing under the Mental Health Act 1983 (as recently amended). As and when I conduct an assessment under the Mental Health Act, I intend to summarise it on this blog (anonymously of course). From time to time I may recount selected Mental Health Act Assessments from my past experience, and explore some of the ins and outs and pitfalls of working within the legal framework of the Mental Health Act. I hope this will be informative, entertaining, and at times amusing. (Although you might have to be an AMHP to appreciate the full nuances.)

Bear with me -- it'll be better than that sounds -- wait till I examine the process of identifying the Nearest Relative for the purposes of the Act!
