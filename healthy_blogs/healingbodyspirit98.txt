Modified citrus pectin

This review is from: EcoNugenics PectaSol-C Modified Citrus Pectin, Powder/454g, 1 lb (Health and Beauty) I have worked with my naturalpath to develop a safe and effective protocal to support a healthy recovery after cancer surgery and the removal of a tumor. Since chemotherapy is not an option for me, I want a combination of least risk and highest potential benefit. This product by Econugenics was recommended by my naturalpath. My urologist agrees this is not likely to be harmful and may be beneficial. . One 454g container lasts 30 days and it is easily mixed with water. Compared to chemo this is nothing. I feel like I am doing something proactive to increase my chances of recovery.


The difference between modified citrus pectin and regular fruit pectin is the difference between night and day. For starters, fruit pectin only remains in the GI tract and cannot absorb any toxins in the blood stream. MODIFIED CP has been reduced in size so it can penatrate through the intestines and go into the blood stream, removing toxins throughout the body.

I take pectasol-c daily in order to prevent further metastasis from breast cancer. I have had this product recommended by 2 ND's. In response the the reviewer who said it is of no use for with a liquid. If mixing with water, it's best to let it sit for at least 5 mintues in order for it to dispurse/disolve a bit (then stir completely). BUT.. the quickest/best way to take it is to add enough juice (grape, apple, orange, pom, etc.) in order to cover the pectasol (get it wet). Might end up being 1/3 cup of juice or so. Let it sit for a little less than a mintue and stir. Works like a charm :)
