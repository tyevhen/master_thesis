I started writing a story last year about a person who is handicapped that goes shopping at a warehouse club.  I tried to incorporate some of my experiences and also included my thoughts on what it is like navigating through these monster warehouses pushing a cart.

I gave up walking through these clubs a few years ago.  The concrete wears me down too quickly.  Using the club’s scooters are okay, but they are not fast enough.  I might die of old age before getting from the entrance to the frozen food section.  My wheelchair makes the experience more tolerable. 

I just finished the rewrite yesterday.  For my post today I am providing the link to this story if you are interested.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing about the experience.  If it gave you a few chuckles, let me know.
