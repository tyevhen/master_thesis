For those of you who did not receive the announcement yesterday, the KDA launched their new website.  If you want to take a look, follow this link:  www.kennedysdisease.org .  The reviews from site visitors have been great.  It provides just the right amount of motivation to continue tweaking and improving the site.

The last couple of days I have been very involved with the launching and today I am involved in more ‘live’ testing and tweaking.  For that reason, there will not be an article published today.



Come back on Sunday for my next installment on “Living with Kennedy’s Disease.  As always, thanks for reading and commenting on my articles.
