The final report on the investigation of the Virginia Tech tragedy was released in September (see also Washington Post story).

Some of the Recommendations:

11 recommendations by the panel (go to past 2 pages of the pdf), including:
short- and long-term counseling to affected individuals
crisis-management training for colleges
7 recommendations about changing privacy laws (last 3 pages), including:
exempting university clinics from FERPA, so medical treatment info can be released without student's consent;
adding good faith, safe harbor provisions for certain disclosures;
reducing privacy rights for "troubled students";
deeming law enforcement and medical personnel to be "school officials", which permits greater access to students' records;
consider making all commitment hearing results public information
12 recommendations [.pdf] about changes in college mental health services (beg on pg 53), including:
system of linking "troubled students" to counseling services on and off campus;
adequate, culturally-competent community MH services for children and adolescents;
requirements that professors and resident hall staff report all "aberrant" behaviors to the dean;
repeated incidents of aberrant behavior be reported to the counseling center and to parents;
counseling center report all students in court-ordered treatment to the threat assessment team;
expansion of outpatient MH services statewide to meet community needs
14 recommendations [.pdf, same as above link] for changes (pg 60) in Virginia laws, including:
extension of time period for temporary detention on an Emergency Petition (EP); allowing ER docs to do EPs (weird, they can do them in Maryland);
lowering the "imminent danger" standard;
increase the # of crisis stabilization beds to reduce waiting in ERs;
assuring the "independent evaluator" has access to "necessary reports and collateral info" prior to the independent commitment eval;
setting certain standards for the commitment hearings (ones I think Maryland already meets);
reducing privacy rights for anyone going thru commitment proceedings;
tightening up involuntary outpatient commitment procedures;
"the sanction(s) to be imposed on the no-compliant [sic] person who does not pose an imminent danger to himself or others";
requiring providers to report noncompliance with involuntary outpatient orders
