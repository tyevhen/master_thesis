Three excellent posts have hit the blogosphere regarding bipolar disorder in children.
Intueri rips the diagnosis apart with pinpoint logical thinking and by pointing out that the “science” behind this disorder is remarkably thin.
Furious Seasons jumps on board as well, adding on to Intueri’s excellent analysis with some of his own characteristically amusing sarcasm. Nice work.
The Last Psychiatrist is also in the house, chiming in with his comments regarding psychiatry’s double standard, why no psych drugs will be getting pediatric indications, and more.
Nice work, bloggers. Keep it coming. If you like their posts, you may also want to check out my latest post on this very topic.
