Director/screenwriter Anthony Stagliano uses a rare genetic disorder that refuses to let the body shut down as a jumping off point to explore such issues as identity and faithfulness in a world where dreams and reality are indistinguishable. Arthur Dichter (David Connolly) is a devoted husband suffering from a rare genetic disorder known as fatal familial insomnia. A disorder that typically doesn't manifest itself until adulthood, fatal familial insomnia causes the afflicted to suffer insomnia, intense phobias, panic attacks, hallucinations, dementia, and ultimately death. As Arthur slips ever deeper into the grips of fatal familial insomnia, he wanders the city streets in a sleepless bid to keep his body moving. After losing the ability to communicate, Arthur begins to self-mutilate and record his thoughts in a diary that he will not even share with his long-suffering wife, Anna (Sarah Lassez). His doctor begins to speculate that Arthur may be suicidal, but Anna knows that her husband is simply locked in a strange new reality from which the only escape is death. As despair, loneliness, and alienation take hold, Anna refuses to allow her husband to slip away without one last valiant fight. Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Commonly question about USED: Fade
Question :
Tattoo Removal - Has anyone used WreckingBalm tattoo fade system?
I do have two tattoos but I actually like them and don t want them removed. But I saw this add for a tattoo fade system called WreckingBalm.

Has anyone used it and does it work? Just wondering because, I really have my doubts according to what we have all heard on how hard it is to remove tattoos!
Answer :
I have a friend who used it, and it just faded hers out. It definitely did not remove it...but all she wanted to do was fade it so she could get a cover up...

I guess it depends on what you want it for.
Question :
What is the best thing you have ever used to fade freckles or age spots?
Answer :
Retin-A works extremely well at fading spots, and clearing up acne as well. However, you need a prescription for it (from a dermatologist) and it is kind of expensive; on average, around $75.00 for 1 small tube. That tube will last you about two months, and it takes about 2-6 months before you see a difference. The results can be dramatic however.

Good luck to you! :-)
Question :
Has anyone used Porcelana fade cream, how well is it and does it work quick?
I heard about this cream from a previous question i asked and was wondering how good it is and if he works quickly by this i mean a couple of weeks or days NOT YEARS.
Feel free to be as honest as you want on your opinion of this cream
Answer :
Anyway, my mother introduced me to Porcelanas Fade Dark Spots Nighttime Treatment Skin Lightening
Cream. It is just as the name suggests, you use it at night. It is said to fade dark spots so I gave it a shot.

Well, all you have to do is wash your face throughly and apply a small amount of the Porcelana Fade Dark Spots Nighttime Treatment Skin Lightening
Cream to the dark spot on your face for as long as it is needed. I used it for about a month and saw some magnificent results.You need to use it every night (well I did anyway) to see the results quickly! I was very happy to have these one or two random dark spots disappear from my face!

Porcelana Fade Dark Spots Nighttime Treatment Skin Lightening Cream comes in a small 3oz tub and has a nice scent to it so it is pleasant to apply (unlike some other lotions I have encountered before!) and it lasts very long because you only need to apply a very small and thin layer of the cream to the spot that is bugging you only!

On the tub says it can also be used for other skin discolorations such as age spots and liver spots, freckles and pigments in the skin that may occur in pregnancy or from the use of oral contraception. Well I dont know much about the last one frankly but I simply use it for dark pimple spots!

I still keep a bottle of Porcelanas Fade Dark Spots Nighttime Treatment Skin Lightening Cream around for if I ever need it, which I do need at times. I have to admit, on the bottle said it would discolour after a while of being exposed to air all the time which is quite true (it turned from white to a very light maple like brown colour) but is does not reduce the effectiveness of the cream at all!

I have to say that I count my lucky stars that I dont always have to deal with these dark spots caused by pimples (well popping them anyway!) I would definitely recommend Porcelana Fade Dark Spots Nighttime Treatment Skin Lightening Cream to any of my friends!
