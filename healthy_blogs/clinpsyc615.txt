In the latest Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, there is a trial of divalproex (Depakote ER) for mania. These patients were all hospitalized, so we’re talking about a relatively severe group of patients. The 21-day study used the following measures: Mania Rating Scale (MRS), Manic Syndrome Scale (MSS), and Behavior and Ideations Scale (BIS). The authors noted that there was a statistically significant difference found between Depakote and placebo on all three measures.
But wait, how much of an effect are we talking about? Did Depakote outshine placebo by a large margin? One is left wondering about this point, as the authors did not report the effect size of the difference between groups. I calculated the effect sizes (d) and here is what I found for each measure: MRS: .229; MSS: .233; BIS: .235. Remember that the generally used criteria are d = .2 (small), d = .5 (medium), d = .8 (large). According to conventional standards, then, we’re talking small beans here. An advantage for Depakote that was very small in size. Depakote also resulted in a significant increase in body weight (1.8 kg) compared to placebo (.5 kg). 1.8 kg in three weeks? Keep gaining weight at that rate over a year and you’re looking at Zyprexa!
The authors acknowledged no ghostwriters, but considering that four of the authors work for Abbott (the maker of Depakote), I suppose they didn’t need to hire out to find a friendly writer. How else do you explain that there is no discussion of the wimpy gains in comparison to placebo? Ahhhh, when industry and science collide...
