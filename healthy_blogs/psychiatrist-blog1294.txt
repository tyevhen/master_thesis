"Dwayne Mayes was honored Tuesday at the Robin Hood Foundation’s annual Heroes breakfast.
To give you a little background, this Tuesday the Robin Hood Foundation held their annual Heroes breakfast. Each year, Robin Hood honors outstanding New Yorkers for their efforts to improve the community and transform the lives of the city’s underprivileged residents. The four organizations represented by the recipients of the Heroes Awards – Uncommon Schools, Year Up, Community Access and Food Bank for New York City will each receive a grant of $50,000 from Robin Hood.

Mr. Mayes tells his own story about a tortured past, mental illness, addiction, and rising from it all, in a story full of hope and resilience---
