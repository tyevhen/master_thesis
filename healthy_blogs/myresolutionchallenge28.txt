If you follow my blog, then you’ll be aware that I’ve struggled with my health over the past couple of years. I remain undiagnosed and, unfortunately, I still suffer from symptoms and pain.
It’s safe to say that I sulked – for a long time – and still have bouts of the blues over this issue, however, as September arrived, I was filled with an overwhelming desire to feel better – even if it was just a little bit.

As you all know, I do love a challenge and what better way to push myself than to sign up for the 90 Day Shape Shift Sustain plan (yes, 90 DAYS!!) developed by the hottie, Joe Wicks, aka The Body Coach.



To say this training/nutrition regime is hard work would be an understatement. I’m two weeks into the plan, and although I’m still struggling with my energy levels, I’ve just managed to run for ten minutes on the treadmill. It sounds like nothing doesn’t it, but when I think that for the past two years I’ve struggled to walk for more than five minutes without having to rest then it’s a massive achievement.

I must have looked slightly demented at the gym as I was sweating like I'd run a marathon, and yet I couldn’t stop myself from grinning ear to ear.

As my legs were burning, my lungs protesting, and my hair frizzing up under the pressure, all I could think about was getting home and adding this achievement to my ‘Happiness Jar’.

I blogged about embracing a good day and being grateful last year; you can read that post HERE. I’m glad to say, I’ve continued adding everything I've enjoyed/achieved/embraced over the past eight months into my jar, and I can’t wait to open it on New Year’s Eve to remind myself what a fabulous year I’ve had.

It doesn’t matter how big or small our achievements are; they are worth recognising and remembering.

I’ve got 79 days left - wish me luck x
