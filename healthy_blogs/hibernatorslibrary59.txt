This week's Nonfiction November prompt, hosted by Sarah at Sarah's Book Shelves, is to pair a nonfiction book with a fiction book. Here's a couple of thoughts based on books that I'm reading right now: 


Last month I read The Fifth Child, by Doris Lessing. It's about a family that has a violent "monster" of a child and a mother's attempts to love that child. This book was horrifying. I can't imagine what it would be like to have a child who is violent or psychopathic. Thus, I decided to read The Price of Silence, by Liza Long, which is part memoir part criticism of the mental health system in the US. Liza Long wrote the now "famous" article entitled "I am Adam Lanza's Mother" about the difficulties of raising a child with a violent mental illness. I have not read, but would be interested in adding, We Need to Talk About Kevin, by Lionel Shriver, which is an epistolary novel about a mother's sufferings after her son has committed an outrageously violent crime. 


This month I'm reading The Stand, by Stephen King, which is one of his most popular novels. It's about a plague which kills all but a small population of people. I think it would be well-paired by non-fiction books about devastating diseases. I haven't read either of these two books, but have heard they're great. They are The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston, which is about the Ebola virus; and The Great Mortality, by John Kelly, which is about the black plague. My final fiction pairing would be Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis. I LOVED this book when I was a teenager.
