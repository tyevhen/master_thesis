I am always looking for the latest and greatest device to make life more manageable. The other day I received an email from a KDA board member that caught my interest.

The website has several videos showing the device being worn by different people. Keeogo appears to be an 'assisting' device. The ability to maintain your balance is important.

Today's technological capabilities continue to move closer to a true mobility aid for those of us living with a progressive neuromuscular disorder. And, eventually, I hope healthcare providers will recognize the importance of these devices for maintaining quality of life.


Hello all,
I was at a abilities show today and came across  a device that
I am very excited about. It was developed by a Canadian firm 
and seems to be similar to the Honda device that is in 
development. It is currently on the market in Canada selling 
for about $45,000. Hopefully this price will come down 
substantially as these devices are mass produced. I have 
provided a link below for you to view a video of the device.
