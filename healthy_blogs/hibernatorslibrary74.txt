In this timeless story, a little girl named Scout comes of age during a difficult time for her family. Her father, a lawyer, is defending a black man charged with the rape of white woman. Scout learns about racism from both children and adults. 

Part of the charm of this story is that it is all through Scout's eyes, so sometimes you have to infer what's going on in the adult world - sometimes it takes a careful reading. However, Scout is intelligent and she picks up on a lot of stuff, so it's the perfect combination of inference and easy-reading. I loved the ending for a couple of reasons - it was beautiful and touching, and I laughed because I could tell exactly why my mom said "I didn't get it." She's so literal. :)

This book is considered one of the first of the Young Adult/teen genre, though I feel that it's only placed there because of the age of the protagonist. I would highly recommend it to everyone teen and up.
