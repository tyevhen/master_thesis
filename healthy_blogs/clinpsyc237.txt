As reported on Furious Seasons, it looks like Joe Biederman is getting attacked by psychiatrist Lawrence Diller, who goes pretty far in his accusations. I’m glad someone in psychiatry is questioning the child bipolar frenzy, though I don't necessarily agree with Diller entirely.
On a somewhat different note, Daniel Carlat urges caution before jumping on the Biederman Bashing Free-For-All. If Carlat’s writing is always going to contain as much sarcasm as appears in his most recent Biederman post, I’ll be one happy guy. One snippet: “The study [in which Biederman played a key role] was not even funded by industry, which is impressive for a department in which psychiatrists can barely find the water fountain without industry support. [my emphasis]”
Let the games continue…
