The first prompt in Nonfiction November is to relay my year in nonfiction. Well, there it is, above. Those are all the nonfiction books I completed since last Nonfiction November. Of those, my top 3, in no particular order are: Half the Sky, by Sheryl DuWunn; Men We Reaped, by Jesmyn Ward; and Wild Swans by Jung Chang.



Half the Sky is about the world-wide struggles of women for equality. We learn about human trafficking, poor healthcare during childbirth, and inequality in education. The authors educate us on what we can do to help the situation and why such help is needed. 

Men We Reaped is a memoir about several black men in Jesmyn Ward's life (including her brother) who died too young. It describes the difficulties of living as a minority in a lower socioeconomic class and how these difficulties can lead to premature death and destruction of families. 

Wild Swans is a biography / memoir about three generations of women in Jung Chang's family and how they survived the war and uprising of Communism in China. 

Interestingly, all three of my favorite books are on social awareness topics. I'm learning something about myself as I type this. :) The two topics that I wish I had read more of last year are politics and medicine. 

What are your favorite nonfiction books of last year?
