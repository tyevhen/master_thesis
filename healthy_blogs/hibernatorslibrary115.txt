The Reluctant Romantic
Hosted by Doing Dewey

This is the first weekly check in for the The Reluctant Romantic challenge. 

What genre are you reading this month?

This month I am reading modernist literature. Before this month, I knew very little about modernist philosophy / literature, and as far as I know I've only read one book in the genre - The Trial, by Franz Kafka. And I read that years ago before I was able to understand the philosophy (though the book was awesome!). 

Why do you want to give this genre a chance?

Originally, I was thinking of romance, mystery, or law / political thriller genres because I don't read very much of those. But as I looked at those tags in LibraryThing, I realized that I'd read more than I thought I had in each of those genres. Then I realized that I already planned on reading at least one Virginia Wolf book this month for the #WoolfAlong. I looked at the modernist tag under LibraryThing and discovered a complete lack of modernist literature under my belt. How convenient! I guess I've always been hesitant to read it because I'm so unfamiliar with the philosophy.

Have you read any books in this genre yet this month?

I have already reviewed Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf. Currently, I'm working on The Reivers, by William Faulkner, since it is one of his Pulitzer Prize winners. I have also listened to the first lectures of two Teaching Company Courses, one on literary modernism, and one on Nietzsche (whose philosophy strongly influenced modernist thinking). I wrote summaries of both lectures: 

Literary Modernism Lecture 1

The Will to Power Lecture 1

Are you enjoying your new genre so far?

Well, as you can tell by my review of Mrs. Dalloway, I had to read a description of the plot on Wikipedia in order to figure out what was going on. But once I'd done that, the listening went much more smoothly. I enjoyed my first book, but I'm not going to judge the whole genre based on one book.
