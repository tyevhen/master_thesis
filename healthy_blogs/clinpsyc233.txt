Danny Carlat has issued a nomination for the "Doctors for Dollars" Award. He discusses how a medical education communication company hired by a drug company got academic "key opinion leaders" to place their names on a piece of advertising that passes off as education for physicians. You'll be shocked to read that Joe Biederman is one of the nominees.
I'd strongly suggest reading Carlat's post and providing suggestions as to how the Docs for Dollars Award can be integrated with the Golden Goblet award (1, 2) and the Krusty the Klown award in a truly outstanding awards ceremony later this year.
