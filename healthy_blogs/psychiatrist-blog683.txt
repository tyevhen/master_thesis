Just thought I'd put up a quick post to plug a program that looks useful for my patients. The Prison Book Program sends books to prisoners who request them from many states. I appreciate this because one of the frequent questions I get in my clinic (after "Can I have some of that coffee?") is "Got anything to read?" Boredom is the common denominator of most prisoners, and having something positive or useful to read is a good thing. Check out the YouTube video about the program too.
