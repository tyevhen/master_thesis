According to Pharmalot, AstraZeneca's antipsychotic (and, perhaps, anti-everything else) Seroquel may be moving towards being astroturfed, via the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
NAMI's press release on the topic states
The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) will significantly expand its support group program for people with mental illnesses to all 50 states and Puerto Rico by 2009, thanks to an exclusive multi-year partnership with AstraZeneca, LP.
Hey, maybe AZ is just doling out goodwill money, but I tend to think this is the following
a) Great PR for AZ
b) A chance to get more people introduced to the wonders of Seroquel

I suppose we'll find out. More on astroturfing here.
