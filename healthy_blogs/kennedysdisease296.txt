Today, let’s focus on the neck, shoulders and upper back.  Too many of us with Kennedy’s Disease develop weakness in the neck and shoulders.  For this reason, it is important to continue to work these muscles … stretching and strengthening them.

Note:  These are taken from the Therapy Skill Builders Guide.

I need to post my “Reminder” … just in case you did not read the previous article: 
All exercises should be done slowly … do not jerk or force the motion … for maximum effectiveness. 
Listen to your body … do not overdo. 
As the exercises become easier, add more reps and/or pressure.

A.  Neck Rotation – Look left then right

Hold the position for a count of five.
Turn your head slowly to the right as far as comfortable.
Hold the position for a count of five.
Return your head to the front and relax.
Perform ten reps (or as many as comfortable).
Note:  If this is too easy, have someone place the palm of their hand on your cheek to create more resistance. 


B.  Lateral Flexion – Touch your shoulders
Sit in a chair, keeping your neck, shoulders, and trunk straight.
