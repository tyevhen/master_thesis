Several years ago I read an article about how motor neurons and muscles in athletes develop some type of coordinated synergy so the actual physical movements involved in running, playing tennis or football, for example, are almost automatic (instinctual) … not requiring any forethought. I have known that feeling and it was a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, I haven’t experienced that sensation for over twenty-five years and I miss it.
Today, I have no self-confidence in my muscles being able to support me or react in time to prevent a fall. When the leg muscles are fatigued, for example, they might give out at any time and I could drop to the floor without having a chance to catch myself. Today, I have to focus on locking the knees while standing or pushing off with the leg and arm muscles when trying to stand up from a seated position. It is now a coordinated effort between the brain and the muscles. Any deviation from focusing on the current activity could result in a fall. I can no longer be walking and have other thoughts running through my mind distracting me. If that happens, I am an accident waiting to happen. I believe the statement about being able to 'walk and chew gum at the same time' is appropriate.
