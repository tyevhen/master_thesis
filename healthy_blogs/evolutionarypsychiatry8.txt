Hey there...I know.

Here's a great song: Left Hand Free

The first new post over at Psychology Today is about the big, recently released study shedding some real insight as to how schizophrenia is inherited and what might cause the diseases. It's a game-changer (the findings, not the blog post, though the post was picked as a Psych Today "Essential Read" and "Top Post" for the week).

New Insights Into the Genetics of Schizophrenia

The second new post is about a paper I pulled a while back but never got around to writing up:

Is Gluten Causing Your Depression?

The short answer is...it's possible, but it's probably not causing your irritable bowel symptoms. That's pretty much the FODMAPs if you respond well to a gluten-free diet.

I'm spending a lot of my free time working on a couple of science fiction manuscripts in a far future after most of the population has been wiped out by gluten (kidding! They are wiped out by something else, but I'll have to publish the book for you to find out, probably).

In the mean time, there's a lot of action about gearing up for next year's conferences. I kept a relatively low profile this year, but I've put in a proposal for the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting in Toronto, I'm considering PaleoFx in Austin 2015...and I've also been invited to AHS New Zealand, and can't wait to go.
