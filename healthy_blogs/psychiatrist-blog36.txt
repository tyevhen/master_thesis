As I mentioned in the last post, we were scheduled to be on the Diane Rehm NPR radio talk show this morning to discuss our new book: Committed: The Battle Over Involuntary Psychiatric Care.  
And then came the Presidential Election where the predicted winner lost, and the world is asking why, and what will it mean to have Donald Trump as our president.  Today, no one is thinking very much about forced psychiatric care and the NPR producer asked if we would reschedule to later in the month as they felt it was important to continue with election coverage.  

Stand by, we will get back to you with a new date soon.
