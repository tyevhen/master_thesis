If you are a regular reader of my blog, you know the “Goodlife Zen” is one of my favorite blogs. Yesterday’s Goodlife Zen article was titled, “How to feel happier in 7 days or less.” It is a quick read and yet the concept Mary Jaksch discusses might just work.

Happiness is defined as:
A state of well-being characterized by emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy
A state of mind typically described as akin to pleasure, joy or enjoyment.
An active state of being, a choice, a state of mind, a goal, the end product of a fulfilling day.
On one level happiness is freedom from want and having the basic necessities of life. On another level, happiness consists of feelings of contentment, self-worth and well-being.
I especially like the last two definitions because I believe happiness is a choice. It also stems from a feeling of contentment and self-worth.

As those of us living with Kennedy’s Disease know, at times our self-esteem and self-worth can be challenged. When that happens, it is difficult to be ‘happy’ or ‘content’. So, I am always looking for ways to move beyond those feelings. In the blog article mentioned above, Mary asks you to do the following exercise for seven days.
Try completing this sentence each morning for seven days.

“To bring 5% more happiness to my life …”
What you write down is up to you.
Write what comes into your mind; don’t edit your thoughts. Don’t worry if you contradict yourself.
Write down at least six completions (answers) each time you use the technique.
I tried the exercise this morning and the results were interesting. I can see some benefits of using this exercise whenever you are feeling a little down or uncertain about what’s ahead. I like the ‘5%’ because you are not trying to change your world only trying to make it a little better. It causes you to focus on what would help change your current state of mind (attitude).
