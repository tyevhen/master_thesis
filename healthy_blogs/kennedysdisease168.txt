I thought I had outgrown them. They are something I have not missed at all. Now that it happened, I am concerned that maybe I was wrong and you never really do outgrow them. Perhaps this was just a fluke ... a once in a decade event. Or, maybe I was just blessed with 10+ years without any.

You know what I am talking about; MUSCLE CRAMPS! Yes, those terrible cramps that wake us up in the middle of the night and would often ache for days afterwards.

Tuesday morning I began to have cramps in my right triceps. By Tuesday noon I was in a lot of pain and constantly massaging the ever-intensifying cramps. By late afternoon, my right upper arm was very sore and almost any movement would cause another cramp. By bedtime the right shoulder, wrist and hand were also sore probably because of constantly trying to find ways to relieve the cramping. The strange thing is that it has been so long since my last serious cramp that I had almost forgot how intense they could be. I just assumed that since so many of my muscles had atrophied that the cramps could never be this intense again.

Tuesday night I was concerned what might happen if I have cramping during or after my Wednesday morning full workout session. I took one Ibuprofen tablet that evening and hoped the aching would dissipate. Well, fortunately, it worked. I woke up without any pain and have not had any further cramping. My Wednesday and Friday exercise programs went very well ... without any pains or concerns. My strength seems to be fine also.

I still find it strange that it has been years since I experienced any severe cramping. I need to watch this closely to see if there is any correlation to muscle strength or any other cramping in that area. I am hoping it was just a fluke ... that once in a decade event I mentioned earlier. I sure hope so, because they really are not much fun.

Do any of you older codgers still have muscle cramps? If not, when was the last time that you remember having a severe cramp?
