I received this email this morning from a grandmother of a move-away-mom.
"My son is heart broken. His ex-wife took the kids and moved to another state. When my son phones and tries to talk to his son my grandson says, "I'm lost, I'm lost". It rips my son's heart out."

For a while my son and grandson lived with us. As I walk through my home and see the puzzles, the books, and the toys that Mathew used to play with, I cry. I wonder when and if I will see him again. I miss him and his exuberant energy.

While in the grocery store the other day I was startled to see a little boy who looked like Mathew and I started to cry.
