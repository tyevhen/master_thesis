We were tagged by OmniBrain for this library card meme, but don't worry Dinah and Roy I've got us covered. Here is the library card for our Shrink Rap book, if we had one. (Uh, for those of you younger than X14 in hex code, library books used to be located using a card catalogue---4x6 inch cards with call letters typed on them. Sheesh, I feel old.) Dinah reminds me I forgot to add this: FEED DUCKS???
