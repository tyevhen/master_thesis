Coping with Disaster Stress

1. Stay active. Falling into passivity can worsen psychological and physical disaster reactions.

2. Resume a normal routine as soon as possible.

3. Remind yourself that reactions you're having are considered part of the trauma cycle. It's especially important to teach children that these reactions are "normal".

4. Be aware of numbing the pain with overuse of drugs or alcohol. And avoid caffeine as its effects can amplify anxiety and stress response.

5. Talk about your experience.

6.  It's okay to spend some time by yourself, or on the other hand, feel the need to be with others. 

7. Avoid over-exposure to media images and newscasts.

8. Realize those around you are also under stress and may not react in a manner you'd normally expect.

9. Understand that chaos may be the "new normal" and that a return to stability may be days, week or months away. 

10. Make decisions that will give you the control over your life.
