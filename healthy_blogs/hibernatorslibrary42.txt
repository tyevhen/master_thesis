Despite my minimal-meme policy on my blog, I've decided to participate in Joy's Readers' Workouts meme to help me be held accountable in my workouts. As I said in my update this weekend, I have decided to get healthy again by training for a 100 mile bike ride in September. Part of that choice is just enjoyment in the accomplishment, but part of it is because I want to lose weight. Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and went on medications, I have been gaining weight. I would like to lose that weight again and be back to the person I was. So I will eat healthier, exercise more, and mostly give up diet soda (not altogether - failed attempts in the past have taught me that giving up soda altogether only leads to relapse later). I'm giving up the diet soda because I've heard rumor that it negatively affects one's metabolism so that people gain weight when drinking it. 


In case you're interested, I have no shame: here's a graph of my weight over the past few years: 


Impressive amount of weight gain, eh? The data starts shortly after I went on medications. 

Today I headed over to the fitness center try my first workout (yeah, I made it a whole 15 minutes of cycling - 4 miles) and to ask about a personal trainer. The PT would be a lot of money, which I expected, but I didn't expect the 6 month contract. I'm going to have to think about whether the PT is worth it. But I might need one. We'll see. I'll update you next week!
