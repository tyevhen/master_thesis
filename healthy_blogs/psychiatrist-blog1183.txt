This week's Medical Grand Rounds is over at Amy Tenderich's Diabetes Mine.  She is calling this the Birthday Edition, I think because today is her own birthday (Happy Birthday, Amy!).  But still, this is quite a coincidence since today is also Shrink Rap's birthday -- 3 years old today (see Dinah's post coming out at noon).

Amy notes some other birthdays today or this week -- Alison Finney from Shoot Up or Put Up; Chris Nickson from Life in the Fast Lane; Health Business Blog (Happy 4th!); and the Queen of England (and others).
