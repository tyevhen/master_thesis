The month of October is packed with several student awareness campaigns from the popular Red Ribbon Week to Teaching Tolerance's Mix It Up. Every October, at our school, we are constantly moving from one project to the next hoping to fit in all our plans.  However, one awareness campaign that stands out to most students is Bullying Awareness. 

During the month of October there are several days dedicated to educating students about bullying and its harmful impact on students.  

October 7th-Stomp Out Bullying is sponsoring its fifth year of its Blue Shirt day to stomp out bullying.  
October 9th-The National Bullying Prevention Center is sponsoring Unity Day to show students who are bullied that others care about them. Students and educators are encouraged to wear orange.
