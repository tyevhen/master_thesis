In a somewhat explosive article in the Guardian (of course – as if a US paper would have the nerve to publish such rabblerousing), limited details of meetings between pharmaceutical executives and UK government officials were reported. A quote follows:
“The world's biggest drug company, Pfizer, warned ministers that it could take its business elsewhere. "Pfizer ... noted that there is complacency in some quarters of Whitehall regarding their continued investment in the UK," the minutes of the meeting record." That sounds like blackmail to me. – Aubrey Blumsohn.
Well, I’d have to agree with Dr. Blumsohn. Check out his excellent post here.
