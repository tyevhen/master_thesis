In order to be self-responsible, you first have to come to the intellectual understanding that your behavior is not being done to you, you are doing it. This may seem like it goes without saying but don't toss it out, think about it. What or whom do you blame for behavior which is now causing problems for you? The answer will show you in what direction you are headed. Don't forget, you can always turn around.
