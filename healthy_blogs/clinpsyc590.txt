I'm not particularly technologically inclined, but I did notice that someone using SMiller's account (according to my research, that's Stanford Miller, VP of Business Development) at Neuronetics was giving the site a look tonight. Someone at Neuronetics was previously checking my site out today based upon a Google News alert. Just thought I'd say hello.

Anyone know when Neuronetics' TMS treatment for depression will go before the FDA? It got delayed a couple weeks ago for undisclosed reasons. In any case, I'm flattered that I could get a bigwig like Mr. Stanford to check out the site. Please come back again!
