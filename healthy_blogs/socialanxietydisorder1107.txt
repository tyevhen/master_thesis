Question :
What do you think of this persuasive essay? (We are trying to make the reader feel guilty) I am 13, go easy!?
Ok here is the hypothetical situation: Our principle is worried about the students and their risk of obesity in our school, so he is thinking about requiring students to do physical fitness tests every year (I know we have to do presidential tests already, but as i said this is hypothetical!) However, he is unsure of weather he should do it or not. We are supposed to persuade him to do it or not to do it. I took the side of making him do it. In the opening paragraph, we are supposed to make him feel emotion. In this case, it is guilty. I am 13 so go easy on me. WARNING: It is long =

Dear Principal (insert name here)

Everyday, many parents find out that their children are at risk of becoming obese, and the same could happen to the students of (insert school name here) What can I do about this issue, you ask? You need to require each student to participate in a physical fitness test. By doing this, you can lower the rate of obesity. You can also help teens get their aggression out in a good way and help parents save money. Did you know that the possibility of obesity in (insert school name here) is very high, and it is up to you to stop it? Being overweight could affect much more then physical appearance, you know. It is up to you to protect these kids from becoming obese. It is up to you weather or not students suffer various health conditions. Would you like students to suffer health conditions later in life?
One major reason we should have these physical fitness tests is because obesity is a huge issue. It can cause many problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Being overweight can also affect a persons joints, breathing, sleep, mood, energy levels, and various other health concerns. So, being obese could impact a persons entire quality of life (1). However, when teens start a daily exercise routine, they will be surprised on how much easier exercise gets throughout life, and how physically fit they become. If you require each student in (insert school name here) to do an exercise routine, you could lower the rate of obesity in (insert state here). Think about how many students get taught here in (insert school name here) every year! Imagine how many people could benefit from your physical fitness tests. Did you know that teens are more likely to do more exercise at home when they are required to do exercise at school? Think about how much of an impact you would be making on these students.
Another huge reason these physical fitness tests are a good idea is because teens tend to become very moody and angry, exercise is a healthy way to get their aggression out and cool down. Not only is it a great way to get their aggression out and cool down, but also a great way for them to have fun with their friends and stay out of trouble. For example, did you know teens are using drugs nowadays? Would you rather see students exercising and having a good time or using some rotten drugs?
The final reason these physical fitness tests are a good idea is because it is a great way for parents to save money. If you think that sounds crazy, think about it. How many bills do you think parents pay when their teen decides to stay at home watching television and eating potato chips? The television bill would go way up and so would the food bill. If the students decide to go outside and exercise, parents could easily savor money and spend it on things that could benefit the school. For example, with all that extra money, parents might be able to give a donation to the school or buy school supplies for their teen.
If you care about your students health, you will require each student to take a physical fitness test. You will be impacting students lives today, and their future lives as well. Remember, obesity affects their health very much. It can harm joints, breathing, heart, and more. Would you rather have students playing in the field or have them on the couch eating potato chips and watching some l horrible television show? The students health for their three years at (insert school name here) is up to you.


Sincerely,
