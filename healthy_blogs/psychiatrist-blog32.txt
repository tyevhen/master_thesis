I've posted twice about how we will be discussing our new book, Committed, on the Diane Rehm Show on National Public Radio.  Well, national politics have gotten in the way, and we've been rescheduled for more time-sensitive issues.  

So I'm excited to tell you that we will be on the Diane Rehm Show this Tuesday, November 29th, during the second hour of the show -- 11 AM if you're listening on WAMU, 88.5 FM.  Only it's gotten better -- while the show was originally supposed to be just the two authors, the programming has changed: Pete Earley, who wrote the foreword, will be joining us in the studio, and two people who have been hospitalized involuntarily will be participating by phone, including one of the wonderful women we traced through the book -- Lily.  

Diane Rehm makes a point of saying: 
 One of her guests is always you 
So do feel free to call in or email questions, and we will be staying for a little while after the show for a continued discussion on Facebook.

While we hope you can listen live, we'll publish a link to the show after it airs. 

While I'm here, please let me mention that Committed was listed on Scientific American's Books to Read in December!
