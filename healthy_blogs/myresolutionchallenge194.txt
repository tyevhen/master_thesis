Yes, I'm going for the big one first, the challenge of all challenges, the resolution that is top of 90% of people's list - Weight Loss!
I am very fortunate to be 5ft 10inches in height and therefore can hide my muffin top and saggy bits under long tunics and baggy jumpers, many people tell me I don't need to lose weight when the truth is I can't hide it any more. My jeans don't fit, I have had to invest in larger work trousers to accommodate my expanding waistline, I have four boobs instead of two as my bra is too tight and I hate to admit it but - I have back fat!!!

My 'Resolution' for January is to start a


healthy eating programme and begin to correct my terrible diet, hopefully to lose a few pounds along the way and to feel less lethargic and more energetic.
What am I going to do first? Well that one's easy, I have joined Weight Watchers. My first meeting is on Wednesday 2nd January when I will strip down to my bra and pants (clothes weigh!!) and step upon the scales!
January is only 31 days long - I'm not going to think beyond that and take it a month at time. It takes 21 days to break a habit so I'm hoping by January 21st I will be able to look a bag of crisps in the eye and say quite confidently "not today thank you."
