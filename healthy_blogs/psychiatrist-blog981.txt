For this podcast I brought some homemade vegan gingerbread cookies that I baked using a recipe from the Steph Davis blog. I'm also looking for a good sugar cookie recipe that doesn't use refined sugar or all-purpose flour. If you've got one, send it along.

We discuss my post Is it malpractice to lie? which involves a surgeon sued for malpractice for allegedly lying to a patient regarding his professional background. We wonder how much, if any, information physicians may some day be obliged to disclose to their patients prior to treatment.

There is a new type of research being done, called "in silica" research, in which people write computer programs to model behavior. We talked about computer models of suicide and how this can replicate suicide epidemics in real life. Roy is inspired to talk about a computer program that models how guys choose urinals in public restrooms, and how people stand in elevators.

We never got to the FAA policy discussion or the cell phones in therapy topic. That was saved for our next podcast.

Last but not least, Dinah takes her dog Max to the new office. Who knew that dogs could be terrified of elevators??
