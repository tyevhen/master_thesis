Roy, oh Roy, too many 'roids, it's Roy unleashed....
So Roy wrote these lyrics on the comment section of ClinkShrink's Comet post, and I just can't resist clipping and pasting them. Please, sing loudly, very loudly, to the tune of Walk Like An Egyptian!
All the old inmates in their cells

They do the Haldol dance don't you know

If they move too quick (oh whey oh)

They're gettin' a dose of Inderal


All the bizarre men have a file

They got a gray mouse for a pet

Seroquel smiles (oh whey oh)

They trade their pills for a cigarette


Freudian types with the hookah pipes say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like a psychiatrist


The big COs like to take their keys

They spin around and they cross the floor

They've got your back (oh whey oh)

You're in the clink so they guard the door


All the prisoners like to see the doc

If they do not then they are pissed

When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)

They're walking like a psychiatrist


All the guards in the dining room say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like a psychiatrist


Every day's the same front and back

Noises make you miss the sleep you lack

Life is hard you know (oh whey oh)

So block the lows with your Prozac


If you want to please all the cops

Then stop before work at the donut shop

They sing and dance (oh whey oh)

They're keepin' peace down in the cell block


All the inmates dealin' with their nerves

No overdosin', no cuttin' wrists

And the nurses know (oh whey oh)

They walk the line like psychiatrists


All the cops in the donut shop say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like a psychiatrist

Walk like a psychiatrist!

And the best part? Sanjaya will be performing it on American Idol next week.
