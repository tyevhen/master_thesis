Have you tried to find a psychiatrist lately?  It can be hard.  Of course, there are your insurance panels, if the docs listed aren't dead or listed in error and are taking patients.  And sometimes, people just get lucky and make a call to happen upon a psychiatrist they like a lot.  
It can also be a hassle, and to someone who contacted me recently, "If I didn't have an anxiety disorder when I started looking for a psychiatrists, I'd have one now!"


I can push an icon on my phone (Open Table) and find out in a matter of minutes exactly which restaurants in Baltimore can take a party of 6 at 7:45 tonight, or another icon (Uber) to get a driver to take me to that dinner me in minutes, but there's not an easy way to figure out who can see a patient quickly -- it's hit or miss and often a matter of luck or who you know, even when there may be doctors with time, or perhaps someone who had a bunch of unexpected cancellations one day.

I thought I would try to rectify this situation in Maryland and in less than an hour (~I've had a little practice with these website things), I was able to set up an Access to Care website in Maryland, located at MarylandPsychiatrists.net.  Do check it out, and each week, more and more psychiatrists have registered with openings.  I'm trying to get the word out that the website exists, so if you're a doctor in Maryland, do let folks know.
