I thought I would share the survey responses with you.  The first question was for everyone, the rest of the questions were just for mental health professionals.  I wish I had asked if the clinicians were already using Evaluation & Management codes -- many do not (myself included) and learning to use these and document correctly will be a challenge for the psychiatrists who don't already regularly use them.  They will be required with the changes coming in 2013.  I'll be writing more about CPT coding in the coming weeks.  The good news is that it's still really, really boring.  
Thank you for helping with my survey!
