Ah, technology.  The Scattergood Foundation is having an all day conference on Ethics and Correctional Mental Health today in Philadelphia.  No the conference is not free, but I imagine there will be time to get a cheesesteak (whiz, please) and if you've lived in Philly, you'll understand the reference to Cheese Whiz.  

The Conference is being lived streamed, so you want to learn about ethics and mental health care in our jails and prisons, do consider attending, in your pajamas if you'd like.  

Here is the information:
