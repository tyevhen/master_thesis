I read the following article (Chew Chor Meng's wife: His disease a blessing in disguise) with interest.  In the United States, we do not hear of any celebrities that have Kennedy’s Disease.  Chew Chor Meng is a celebrity in much of Asia and the announcement that he had Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy a few years ago was news that hit most of the major newspapers and magazines over there.  Occasionally, I would see a follow-up article on his life and condition.

This article in AsiaOne Women came at the disease and Chew’s disabilities from the perspective of the caregiver.  When something like this happens, what so often we find out about ourselves is that after the initial shock, life goes on.  It is different, and it will never be the same, but life does go on.  And, just as important, the role of a spouse takes on a new role. 

The caregiver role is a difficult one


Not only must she continue to be the mother and supportive spouse, the caregiver must now wear a dozen more hats. And most of these new responsibilities have no training course or handbook.  It is most often “OJT” (on the job training).  Faith and strength of character become even more important at times like this.

And, believe me when I say that men with Kennedy’s Disease aren’t the easiest people in the world to live with.  Men, if you haven’t done so in the last few minutes, take a moment to thank your spouse or significant other for all that they do and for all that they are.  We are truly blessed and we don’t show our gratitude often enough.
