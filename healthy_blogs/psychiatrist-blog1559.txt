I'm full of turkey. I've seen ClinkShrink & Roy-- I know they are alive and well, and Roy mumbled something about putting up a podcast.

Pecan pie is good for the soul, even if it's not chocolate, of this I am sure.

Until the Sunday New York Times, my best to our Shrink Rap readers and may the holiday find you with lots to be thankful for!
