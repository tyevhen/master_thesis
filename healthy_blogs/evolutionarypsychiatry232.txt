Recently I have been invited to join the regular stable of writers who blog at Psychology Today.  I'm very happy to go forward and represent, to some extent, the paleolithic community with this wider exposure.  I'm also pleased by the intriguing work done by the other bloggers there.  Fortunately, I have complete editorial control over the content of the articles.  I will begin by updating and cross-posting some of my better entries over there, but I may end up putting wholly original material there also.

The blogging over there also pays by the page view.  Seeing as how I just bought a new thyroid textbook, please do me a favor and go have a look!

Welcome to Evolutionary Psychiatry

(Thanks so much to Dr. Kurt Harris for recommending me, and putting me on his blogroll, which is apparently how the editor at PT found my blog.  Didn't mention it at first as I didn't want to spoil his own announcement! However, it does make the opportunity doubly exciting, as the potential to reach the mainstream with PaNu's gift for turn of phrase is just amazing.)
