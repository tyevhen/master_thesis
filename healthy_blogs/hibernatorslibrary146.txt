How to Train Your Dragon, Book 1
by Cressida Cowell
Narrated by David Tennant
Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III isn't what you would call a Viking hero, He's small and scrawny, and prefers scholarly entertainment rather than ruffian ones. However, he is the son of the tribe leader, so he must be a hero. When, in an initiation-to-tribe trial he must find a baby dragon to train, he ends up with the smallest, toothlessest dragon he could imagine. But he must persevere in order to be accepted into his tribe. Little does the tribe know that danger lurks near. 


This was the funniest book I've listened to in a long time. And, of course, it's narrated by David Tennant, which makes it absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a story for 5th graders, anybody can enjoy it. But don't expect it to be anything at all like the movie. 

How to be a Pirate
by Cressida Cowell
Narrated by David Tennant
In order to learn to be pirates, Hiccup and his friend Fishlegs learn to sail ships and sword fight. But while sailing, they find, floating in the ocean, a coffin labeled "do not open." Of course they open it, and when the dead rise, unlikely adventure ensues. I'm really enjoying this series so far. 

How to Speak Dragonese
by Cressida Cowell
Narrated by David Tennant

In this installment, Hiccup and Fishlegs must learn to board enemy ships.  But when they accidentally board a Roman ship, they are kidnapped. They must escape before they are killed in a tournament. Again, fantastically funny with wonderful narration. 

How to Cheat a Dragon's Curse
by Cressida Cowell
Narrated by David Tennant
In the fourth installment of How to Train your Dragon, Hiccup find out Fishlegs has been bitten by a tiny poisonous dragon. Hiccup must steal the vegetable-that-must-not-be-named from a dangerous nearby tribe in order to save his friend. 

All four were hilarious. I loved Tennant's narrations. I will certainly pick up the rest of the series soon.

5 stars for all of them
