As most of my faithful blog followers already know, I write for Cracked.com.

These guys.

If you've stumbled randomly upon my blog while traversing the abyss of the internet, and my finicky website is currently functioning as intended, you can find my previous two articles somewhere near the top of this page, under "Cracked articles".

My third article will have something to do with touching reunions that went horribly awry. I can't actually tell you what it will be called or when it will be posted until the day it's actually strung up for the world to gaze upon, because I have only slightly more control over that than the janitor who cleans the Cracked offices at night, but you can rest assured that I'll let you know when it's available.

Or you could just keep refreshing the Cracked homepage now. Your choice.
