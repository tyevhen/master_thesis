Samson Motorworks is taking deposits on a new type of roadable aircraft that's part plane, part 3-wheeler motorcycle. Flight tests of the $60K (less engine or avionics) build-it-yourself kit vehicle will supposedly commence later this year near the company's Auburn, California headquarters. Questions? See FAQ here.
