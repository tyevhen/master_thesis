I was a guest on today's Diane Rehm Show on National Public Radio, along with Rachel Garfield from the Kaiser Family Foundation, Pamela Hyde from SAMHSA, and Richard Frank, the Harvard health economist.

The topic was about the Accountable Care Act (ACA) and its potential impact on mental health and addiction services.

They already have the recording up, as well as a transcript.
