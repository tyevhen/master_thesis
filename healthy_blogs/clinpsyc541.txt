In an earlier post, I mentioned that it appears that antipsychotic use among kids has risen drastically in the past few years. Well, another study (here and here) indicated that AP use among kids increased 500% from the two year period of 1993-1995 compared to 2002. Yeah, you read that correctly. Five Hundred Percent. Five-Fold. No, I'm not kidding. And their use continues to rise.

This is not based on much evidence that these meds are more effective than older meds, like lithium or older antipsychotics. Nor is the safety data particularly compelling.
