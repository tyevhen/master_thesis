Dr Dave from Shrink Rap Radio interviewed us last week and posted it to his interview site, Shrink Rap Radio.  He asks us lots of questions, and we (characteristically) wander off topic.  There may even be a shocker in his podcast (no, just kidding).  [EDIT: Susan Argyelan has graciously transcribed the podcast for all to read (a pdf).]

Check out his extensive list of interviews, with many giants in the field (yes, that is a play on "shrinks").  We plan to have him on as a guest soon.  (And, yes, I am FINALLY getting our own podcast #46 to you today!  Sorry for the delay.)
