This afternoon I listened to a thirteen minute TED presentation by Robert Waldinger. His topic: What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness. The findings were not earth-shaking, but they are interesting. For those of us living with a progressive neuromuscular disorder or any other chronic condition, the message is even more important.




“What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.”
