I would like to thank each and every one of you for your kind words that touched me deeply. It is comforting to see Art was able to touch so many lives.


He was indeed an extraordinary man and his development of Primal Therapy is one of the most important discovery in psychology as it is the only treatment that addresses pain from all stages of life, starting at birth, helping and allowing the patients to feel that pain, freeing them forever from its lifelong consequences.

Some of you have expressed curiosity as to what will happen to the blog. Unfortunately it will not go on as Art was the only one to write articles, but it will remain online so that people can go back to the old posts. You may not be aware that Dr. Janov started the blog in 2008 and you may not have read all the posts! We will be bringing older articles back up in the current blog.

 My best, 

Dr. France Janov
