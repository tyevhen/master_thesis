According to some, Neuronetics, manufacturer of transcranial magnetic stimulation devices to treat depression, is looking to boost its sales force. I've previously commented that TMS is in a bit of a bind at FDA currently (the suspense of the impending approval decision must be killing them) and that Neuronetics does a good job of monitoring any posts relevant to their product.
