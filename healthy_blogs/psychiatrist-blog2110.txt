I've spent my life searching for meaning. I realize now (see posts below) that I've been looking in the wrong places-- I should have turned my bucket upside down, found a cozy closet, put a clothespin on my nose, and settled in with a good mentally ill prisoner or two.

Okay, enough on the wonders of correctional psychiatry-- and please do forgive my sarcasm-- teasing ClinkShrink is a lot of fun.

So can I ask, why are we the only blog in America that isn't asking why Chris was voted off American Idol??
