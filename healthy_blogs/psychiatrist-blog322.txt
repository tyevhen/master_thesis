We had an impromptu get together to celebrate our blog's 7th anniversary.

If you like statistics: 1884 posts, 20,153 comments, and  2,065,618 pageviews

There's the My Three Shrinks podcast with 69 episodes, trying for more but our updated computers don't jive with our mixer anymore and there are some issues with the hosting site. 
We have collateral blogs on Clinical Psychiatry News and Psychology Today.

Thank you again for being in our lives, and I am so sorry to report that the cake is all gone.
