KDA Forum

Well, over the last several days I have been spending several hours a day moving data to the new “under construction” KDA website.  Because of this redirection in focus, I have not had time to develop an article for today.
If you are interested in learning more about, or supporting others,  living with Kennedy’s Disease, I would encourage you to visit the KDA Forum.  Some of the questions and comments over the last month have been quite intriguing.  And, your perspective on some of the subjects might be the key to helping someone.

The benefits of this new service include:
No advertising/pop-ups
Email notification (optional) on messages you post - letting you know someone has replied to the message.
Improved ease of use, message handling and storage
Private Messaging - Private messaging is a means for community members to talk to each other outside the realm of the public community. Members never have to know each other's email, so this is a more secure way of having a private conversation within a community. Multiple members can participate in a private message.
Polls - With polls, your community members can vote on a particular question. Comments are also supported on polls.

Upcoming Chat with Dr. Paul Taylor


I mentioned  on September 23 that there was a new research paper published showing some promising findings.  Subsequently, I spoke with Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck about the study and he was also enthused with the findings and the potential benefits of it in moving towards a treatment for Kennedy’s Disease.

Well, I have some great news.  Dr. Taylor will be our guest on the October 16 chat room.  He will review the studies findings and answer your questions on the research.  Mark your calendars, because this could be an excellent chat room discussion.  If you cannot attend, the transcript of the chat will be published within a week or so.

I hope to chat with all of you then …
