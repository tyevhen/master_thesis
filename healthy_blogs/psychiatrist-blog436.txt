My novels are finished!  All three of them are available in both Kindle and paperback formats.  

Next week, I will launch a free Kindle promotion from September 27th through October 1st for the two new ones: Double Billing and Mitch & Wendy: Lost in Adventure Land.  Home Inspection will be available as a free download on September 27th only.

More information is coming soon, and if you'd like to check out my Amazon page, you can go Here.
