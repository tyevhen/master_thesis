I admit it...I love Twitter!  One of the reasons that I love Twitter so much is that I am able to contact to other school counselors across the globe.  How do I contact?  I join a series of monthly chats that involve some great school counselors and school counselor educators.  Below are the four chats that I currently participate in each month.  If you looking for a great professional development opportunity, please consider joining one of these great chats!
