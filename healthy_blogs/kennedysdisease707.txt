Some of us would rather watch a video than read a book or magazine. So, below are several YouTube videos concerning Kennedy’s Disease, KD research, personal stories of people living with KD, and a few other relevant topics. If you are aware of other videos concerning KD, please let me know and I will update this list.

Please note that some videos are not the best quality.
