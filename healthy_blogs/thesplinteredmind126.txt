Just touching base today before I finish up my next article on AD/HD. I haven't forgotten about my novel, even though homeschooling has taken over my life. I am still steadily working on the back story - something that was simply not ready enough to take advantage of NaNoWriMo last November. However, I have finished a children's picture book manuscript about a boy and his cat's secret and am now preparing it for submission. I just received guidelines from my first victim. I'll be sure to post updates.

I have decided that I will immediately select another publisher and prepare a packet for that publisher to mail the very day I receive a rejection. In this way I can prevent my Depression from holding up the submission process should I receive a rejection, which is very likely. (I'm not being negative, folks. Just realistic. I expect to sell the manuscript, but not without effort) I am also working on a second pb ms that is humorous proof that one truly can have too much of a good thing.

My love is the juvenile fiction novel, however. My kids are begging me to write it. When I am ready, I will do no other projects until it is finished. In the meantime, I am trying to figure out what I should do about Cootey's Critters. Distraction, or worthy pursuit?
