I'm not sure what to say. I've never gotten anything quite like this.

In honor of the upcoming holidays, one of our blog readers has donated a flock of ducks to a family in need. Wow! Look how happy that kid looks with all his ducks in a row.

From Heifer.org:


Heifer International is a nonprofit that alleviates hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation through gifts of food and income producing farm animals and training. These animals provide a source of protein, such as eggs and milk, for children and generate income for families through the sale of animal products. Since 1944 Heifer has helped over 4 million families in 125 countries become self-reliant. Each family "passes on the gift" by giving one or more of its animal's offspring to another family in need.
This is very exciting. Clink will be making sauce for all the ducks , family members will have a choice of bing cherry sauce or l'orange. Roy is relieved, these meals will spare a few fish and with those failing fisheries, every poultry meal helps.
So to DrivingMissMolly: Thank You from the Shrink Rappers.
Please note that Fat Doctor has also posted about holiday gifts to the doc. I'm not sure what to send in her honor. Perhaps we could send Midwife with a Knife baby pics of the little ducks?
