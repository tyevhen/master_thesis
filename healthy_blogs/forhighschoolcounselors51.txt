Mental Health Awareness Month


This year's theme is "Life With a Mental Illness". Encourage your students suffering with mental health issues to visit the Mental Health America website for resources and support. 

National Anxiety and Depression Awareness Week 

Anxiety is the most common mental health issue among teens, but it is under diagnosed.  Left untreated, it can severely diminish productivity and a person's lifestyle.  Educating students and parents about anxiety is a great way to get students and parents thinking about the difference between normal and overwhelming anxiety.  Also, I have included resources for school counselors as we need to be able to identify when students are exhibiting fears that are impacting his or her ability to function in school.
