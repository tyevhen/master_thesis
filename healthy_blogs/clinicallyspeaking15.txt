I am sorry that there have been no new posts in the last two weeks as life got hectic(which is always good in my opinion). I have been doing some research on how to improve the blog and add new features.

In the next few weeks, there will be more blog posts, more posts done by guest bloggers, and vlog(video post). To give you a tease a certain topics that are on the horizon, here is what's in store.

-Premature babies may end up having mental illness
-Which comes first mental illness or STD's?
-Impulse or Instinct-Is there a difference?
-Guest Bloggers talking about Domestic Violence, Substance abuse, and more!
-Vlog post-Class will be back in session as we go through the DSM.

As always if you would like more or less of something leave a comment here!
