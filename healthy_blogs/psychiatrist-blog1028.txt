I've moved. You know that. The new office is terrific, shabby chic walls and all.
So I'm working on the whole change-of-address thing. I've notified the post office, the bank, sent a zillion notices out. I've notified my malpractice insurance agent so many times that he called to tell me he changed my address weeks ago and I keep notifying him. I called the Controlled Dangerous Substance folks in my state. It costs $50 to notify them of a change of address. What gives with that. And the DEA...no forms, I tried emailing, I guess I'll send a real letter. The hospital gave me a local number, but it's out of service.
And Medicare: have I mentioned the 221 downloadable forms and how to change your address you have to fill out the 27 page enrollment form? I did? I guess I did.
Did I mention that I'm a non-participating Medicare provider? I don't want to 'enroll.' I finally tackled the form, figuring it would have a box at the end where I could check off that I'm not a participating provider....since I have not 'opted out' ...I'm actually participating by not participating. Try explaining this all to a distressed patient.

I surrender. Tomorrow, I'll try calling. I will no longer be blogging. I anticipate the next year of my life will be on hold.

If you have any answers, by all means....
