There is no such thing, I just made that phrase up. But it seems inevitable. The really ancient concept of futures (from concurrent programming languages) has interesting pointcuts in AJAX development, so I'm forced to give renewed attention to things like Narrative JavaScript, jwacs, and Chris Double's admirable forays into JavaScript future and promise support. All really awesome stuff. It's always interesting to see the JS community outrunning Eich and ECMA on occasion.

If you're still scratching your head, I recommend spending some time with Alice.
