Happy holidays to everyone! Personally, I celebrate Christmas as my seasonal holiday, and it happens to be Christmas, so Merry Christmas to all! 

I had a pretty average week here leading up to Christmas. Nothing exciting to report except that I went to dinner with my parents and boyfriend last night (steak!) and then he and I went to Rogue One. Which was awesome. And later today I will be headed out to celebrate Christmas with my boyfriend's family. But first Christmas Mass with my parents. 

It's a freezing drizzly Christmas here, with wind and rain all day long, followed by snow on Monday. Lovely driving weather for me, my sister, and my nephew who are planning on going up north to a lodge tomorrow to celebrate her 40th birthday. Hopefully everything will work out as planned! 

Currently Reading: Same books as last week. But I'm nearing the end of two of them. :) 


Completed: It's been an uneventful week for reading, so I haven't actually completed ANYTHING to report this week. 

Acquired: I haven't opened all my presents yet, so this isn't my complete Christmas haul. I managed to get free copies of Trevor Noah's Born a Crime and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man from Audible. And a friend on LibraryThing sent me two books I hadn't heard of before: The Hakawati, by Rabith Alameddine and Binti, by Nnedi Okorafor. I'll report the rest of my Christmas Haul next week. :)
