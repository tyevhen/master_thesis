Dear A. B.

Thank you very much for your replies.

It's true that I don't have much of a life that contents me at the moment, or I'm not sure if it's the depression that makes it seem like that, as I’ve suffered from this for so long. I feel that I've been quite a depressive and very insecure, and never had a lot of interest in things, though I’ve kept myself quite busy, active and social -- even when I haven't had serious bouts of depression.

And I've always had an unease with people, a strong sense of inferiority, though I've always faked being cheery and social. But your book and these correspondences have given me a lot of strengths.

What's been challenging at the moment is to focus on anything outside my head. I'm watching TV and trying to focus on the content but my mind keeps wandering to depressive thoughts, despite the attempts at mind switching.

I'm already doing better than a few days ago so I'll keep telling myself that I'm getting better and better; mind switching is getting easier and easier!

Warmest regards, Y______

You are new at this. IT WILL GET EASIER. Your brain needs to make new neurons that are more positive. Now you have too many negative neurons and not enough positive one in your brain so the negative neurons are always popping up. When you have more positive neurons they will start popping up instead of the negative ones and you will be able to have more positive trains of thinking happening. Also as you get going and making a life for yourself, more neural pathways will be formed. This is the process of neuroplasticity of the brain. It changes with new thinking and new experiences. When you say it changes, what you mean is that more neural patterns develop A. B. Curtiss
