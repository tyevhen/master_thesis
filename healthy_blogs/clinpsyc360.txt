I think that complaining about the Blogger switch cued me to other complaints. Like this one...

I was at Bruegger's Bagels the other day. I was asked if I'd like my bagel sliced. I responded in the affirmative. Looking at my receipt, I noted that it cost 25 cents to have it sliced. It took about five seconds to slice.

That is $3 per minute and $180 per hour. To slice a damn bagel.

Mind you, I was not told it would cost me a red cent -- she put it to me as if it were a favor. With adorable little doe eyes, she asked, "Would you like your bagel sliced?" What was I going to do, say no?
