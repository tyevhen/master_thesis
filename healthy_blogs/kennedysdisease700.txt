It is time to let our lawmakers know the importance of complex rehab technologies for wheelchairs.. Please consider contacting your senators and representatives by using this easy MDA program.

As available technologies improve, I can see devices in the near future that will make life easier and keep us independent longer. Thank you for your consideration.


Help Ensure Access to CRT

Last year, we asked for your support in preserving access to complex rehab technologies (CRT) by 
urging Congress to stop the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from applying competitive bidding pricing to complex rehab wheelchair accessories.  CRT and related companion parts or accessories are needed by many people living with muscular dystrophy, ALS, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and related neuromuscular diseases to live healthy and independent lives. The collective efforts were successful in securing a one-year delay prohibiting CMS from applying the cuts to power wheelchairs through December 31, 2016.  With that date fast approaching, we need your help again.  Take action below to let your members of Congress know that access to CRT is critical, and urge them to support and bring H.R. 3229/S. 2196 to a vote.
