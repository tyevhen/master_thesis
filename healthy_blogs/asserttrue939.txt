AJAX-the-acronym has been around only since 2005, but (as many observers have pointed out) the underlying techniques have been around much longer.

It turns out Oracle has been publishing its own best-practices advice on "Partial Page Rendering" since 2002.

For the very latest Oracle thoughts on AJAX, I suggest reading the comments in their ADF Javascript code.
