Worries are a common occurrence of us all and especially of people with depression.  Learning to overcome worries is skill all depressed people must acquire in order to learn how to deal with depression, end depression or deal with and end other distressing emotion. 

Worries can surrender one helpless.  We become so focused on our thoughts when we are worried that we are paralyzed to move.  You must learn to move in order to learn how to deal with your depression.

Use the Serenity Prayer daily as a way to combat worries and ultimately another tool you use to learn how to deal with depression.  Read it daily, and remember that there is no use in worrying about things you cannot change and great benefit in acting to change the things you can.    

Even if youâ€™re not a religious person, just simply recite the first part on a daily basis to remind yourself to let go of those things you cannot control and to act on those worries you can control.   Click here to download, print and use the prayer as needed. 

The Serenity Prayer

God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change;
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time;
Enjoying one moment at a time;
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it;
Trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will;
That I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
Forever in the next.

Amen.
