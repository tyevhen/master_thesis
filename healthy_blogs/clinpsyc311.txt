Jim Edwards of Brandweek NRX called it. Peter Rost has talked about it for years. Pfizer pushed their human growth hormone product, Genotropin off-label, and has now settled a lawsuit for the sum of about $35 million. Big props to Rost for his excellent whistleblowing on this issue. I expect he'll have celebratory T-shirts and coffee mugs released by the end of the week!
