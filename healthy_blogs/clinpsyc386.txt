Furious Seasons is starting to write on the Zyprexa documents posted on his site. He details that Lilly planned to give a huge grant to NAMI to "help educate physicians and patients on the inherent risks of diabetes -- regardless of the antipsychotic" -- in other words, to help deflect the attention being given to Zyprexa. This seems a strange positon for a patient advocacy group such as NAMI to find itself in.

There is more posted on the site about the relationships between NAMI and Lilly. The memo also noted that Michael Fumento was taking a positive position about Zyprexa in his writings. What is unknown is whether Fumento received any Lilly funding.

Lilly's attempt to combat Zyprexa's crumbling reputation was apparently called "Operation Restore Confidence." Is your confidence restored?
