If you missed last month's High School Counselor Chat (like I did...sigh), you can check out the transcript here compliments of Amber Shepherd.  In case this is your first time hearing about High School Chat, you can join the discussion every 2nd Monday of the month @ 8 pm EST.  Each month, the chat is either hosted by Amber, a high school counselor from St. Petersburg, Florida, or another fabulous school counselor!  Maybe you have a topic you would like to host?  If so, message Amber (+Amber Shepherd-Thompson) on Twitter! 

December topic was Efficiency and Effectiveness for a New Year. 

The next High School Counselor Chat (#HSCChat) will be January 11th hosted by Amber Shepherd and Nicole DiSilvestro .  Hope to see you there!!
