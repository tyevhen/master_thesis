Looking for a great conference to network and connect with other peer helping professionals?  Are you interested in becoming a trainer of peer helpers? Boy, do I have a great one to share with you that I attend almost every year.

Oh, you want me to come outside of the curtain with my skills?
The National Peer Helper Conference is a yearly conference sponsored by the Jennifer Clair Moore Foundation and the National Association of Peer Program Professionals outside of Orange Beach, Alabama.  This year's conference is called "Lights, Camera, Action-Backstage Pass" and provides a forum for adult leaders of peer helpers to help take their students from behind the curtain and let them take center stage in the school!

This year's conference offers training, education, best practices, ideas, resources, and networking. Some topics will include: depression, cutting, prescription drug addiction, positive campaigns to impact bullying, and much more.

When: Wednesday, January 21st - Friday, January 23rd, 2015
Where: Grand Marriott, Point Clear, Alabama.


Oh, one more thing! The conference sponsors are looking for calls for proposal.  If you have information to share, please think about becoming a presenter!!
