Zyprexa Weighs In (Pun Intended): I posted recently about the "science" of treating "bipolar disorder" in kids. Here's an example of what passes for evidence in the child bipolar treatment world.
An open label (i.e., not placebo-controlled) study indicated that olanzapine (Zyprexa) was “efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in youths with bipolar disorder.” By definition, it’s pretty tough to show that your treatment works in the absence of a control group (see research methods 101), so how can it be said that the treatment was efficacious? And as for being “well-tolerated,” keep in mind that the average participant gained five kilograms in eight weeks. That’s not so healthy. If this is what passes for solid evidence, then I suppose bipolar in kids as young as two years old is widely underdiagnosed, and that Zyprexa is a godsend for these poor undertreated children.
