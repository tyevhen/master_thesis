Severe renal failure

Lithosun is excreted from the kidneys. So in renal (kidney) failure, Lithosun accumulates inside the body. So it can lead to Lithosun toxicity. However Lithosun can be given very cautiously in mild to moderate renal impairment. In addition Lithosun can itself cause renal impairment, so renal functions should be checked during Lithosun treatment.
