We've decided we could use an umbrella organization to explain what we do in a more official capacity. What do you think? And yes, the podcast will be back, we're just trying to keep our heads above water with getting the manuscript done for the book, blogging, and the rest of life!

The Accessible Psychiatry Project
Encouraging dialogue about psychiatry across media.
Mission Statement:
The Accessible Psychiatry Project strives to encourage dialogue about psychiatric disorders and their treatment in order to explore issues of controversy and misunderstanding in our field. Through open dialogue, in both new media and old, we hope to foster awareness about the work psychiatrists do, and to decrease stigma associated with the treatment of mental disorders.
