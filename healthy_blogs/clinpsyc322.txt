AstraZeneca has reported that its trials with quetipaine (Seroquel) for generalized anxiety disorder and depression are going well, to the point that it plans on filing for FDA approval for said conditions in 2008. As you may recall, Seroquel is currently being studied as a remedy for, well, just about every mental condition (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Here's what I'm betting is happening...

You conduct enough studies using a drug that is mildly better than a placebo, making sure to usually enroll a large sample of people. At least two of the studies will turn out to be "statistically significant" and who cares what happens in the other studies -- just don't publicize them or include them in your FDA application! If there are seven or eight studies examining Seroquel in depression currently, then we shouldn't be surprised if two of them yield somewhat better results for Seroquel. Considering that some depression rating scales rate an improved appetite as an improvement in depression, then Seroquel-induced weight gain actually counts in its favor.
