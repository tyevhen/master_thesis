Stem cell research is one of those volatile areas where it seems that about half the population is for this research and half is opposed to it. For many of us living with Kennedy’s Disease, stem cell research is an area of interest that we would like to see explored more thoroughly because of the opportunities it might hold.

A question that also lingers is whether the healthy cells that are introduced will remain healthy, or will they become defective over time?

MDA’s Quest Magazine published an interesting article on the status of current gene and stem cell research in regards to neuromuscular diseases. Click on this link to read more on this subject: Moving Toward Next Generation Gene Therapy .

In my opinion, this appears to be an opportunity for advancing research on rare disorders.
