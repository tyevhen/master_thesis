John Mack at the Pharma Marketing Blog has laid down the smack on Cymbalta. First, he points out that the Depression Hurts campaign sure looks like off-label promotion, since Cymbalta is FDA-approved for depression, not for pain associated with depression. Note that pain is not an official symptom of depression, so it seems quite strange to market a drug for the pain that allegedly occurs in depression, eh? Also note that the data on Cymbalta for pain in depression are not impressive at all.

Now that Cymbalta has been FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder, Mack wonders if some disease mongering is on the way, and he notes that the diagnostic criteria for GAD are fairly vague, which makes it much easier to foist the idea that untold millions of Americans are suffering from GAD. I'd love to see Lilly's sales scripts for the new GAD indication -- if they're anything like the sales tactics for Zyprexa, look for the rate of prescriptions for GAD to skyrocket.
