I'm sure everyone here knows this, but just in case you missed it, May is National Duckling Month.

Back in 1988, the Senator Jesse Helms introduced a bill making May National Duckling Month. The bill, which passed easily, listed the following reasons for this critical piece of legislation:

Whereas the duckling industry in the United States is approximately one hundred years old, and with duck having historically been a delicacy for the Egyptians five thousand years ago and more lately in the Far East, especially for the Chinese in the preparation of the famous Peking duckling;

Whereas duckling is rising in popularity in the United States among all people, and not just ethnic groups;

Whereas demand for duckling has increased at restaurants by 300 to 400 per centum over the last four to five years;

Whereas there is a need to educate the consumer as to the nutritional value of duckling, which is an excellent source of protein as well as being low in sodium and saturated fats;

Whereas the duckling industry in this country produces over one hundred thirty million pounds of duckling annually, generating over $176,000,000 in revenue;

Whereas the duckling industry employs over one thousand United States citizens and contracts with over two hundred fifty family farms;

Whereas the duckling industry uses one hundred fifty thousand tons of feed produced by local farmers;

Whereas breeding has increased the lean meat portion and reduced the fat content of duckling; and
Whereas the United States duckling industry exports thousands of tons of duckling products (including duckling meat, tongues, feathers and liver) to over forty countries--including those of the Far East--thus helping to reduce the national trade deficit.
Unfortunately, as you can see here, this measure did not cut our national trade deficit.


Anyway, it was "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the month of May is designated as `National Duckling Month,' and that the President is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and activities."

Enjoy your celebratory ceremonies and activities during these last duckling-dedicated days. And, maybe, send some duckling tongues overseas. It's good for our economy.
