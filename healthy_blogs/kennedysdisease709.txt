I found this Financial Reporter article (a portion of it is below) interesting. To me it shows some insurance companies are progressing in the recognition of Kennedy's Disease. The Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Limited, along with its subsidiaries, is the largest mutual insurer in the United Kingdom. Let's hope more companies will follow suite.


Royal London updates critical illness cover

Royal London has announced a number of enhancements to its critical illness cover.

The main change is to cancer cover - over 60 early stage cancers are now covered under nine definitions.

Royal London says the changes provide clarity for advisers and customers by removing a long list of specified cancers. ...

... In addition, some definitions have been updated or added. A new Parkinson definition now includes Parkinson plus syndromes that incorporates multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy.

Motor neurone disease definition has also been updated to include Kennedy’s disease, which makes the definition ABI+.

Debbie Kennedy, Head of Protection at Royal London, said: “Medical advances mean that cancer is often being diagnosed and treated earlier. Therefore more people require support at the early stages following a cancer diagnosis. We’ve enhanced our critical illness cover to provide financial support and our Helping Hand provides emotional support whenever the customer needs extra help. Cancer was the top reason for critical illness claims last year and by covering over 60 early stage cancers Royal London is demonstrating its commitment to paying more claims and including conditions that matter and really do add value for our customers.”
