I will be traveling for Christmas again this year and will not be posting any articles for the next few days.

I have much to be thankful for this year including your support over the last three years of this little venture.  This blog has become bigger than I expected.  Your comments have been meaningful and helpful.

May you and yours have a safe,  healthy and happy holiday season
shared with family and friends.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
