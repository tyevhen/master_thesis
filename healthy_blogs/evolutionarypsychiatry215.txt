I have another longer look at sugar, vegetable oils, binge eating, addiction, and the brain coming up (chased down some of the references from the papers I mentioned on Saturday, and they do not disappoint), but for today I have a guest post on Mark's Daily Apple, and another Psychology Today postâ€¦ enjoy!

Your Brain and The Primal Blueprint

Sad Monkeys

And welcome Mark's Daily Apple visitors!  If you think my blog looks interesting, you can start with this post:

Evolutionary Psychiatry, the Key Posts

And if you are looking for something more specific, take a gander at the site Map (has most posts listed by condition (ex. depression or autism,  or nutrient)).

Have fun!
