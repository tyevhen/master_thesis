Due to the complexity of my reading plans next year, I've decided to make categories to organize my thoughts and make sure I read everything: 


Category 1: Group Read of 6 Books to Help Understand Trump's Win


Category 2: However-will-I-get-to-them?


Category 3: The Cover-to-Cover Bible Group Read


Category 4: The Wizard of Oz Read-along
hosted by Lone Star on a Lark


Category 5: Magazines










Category 6: Spontaneity 
Including choices from:
Real Life Book Club
Doing Dewey's Nonfiction Book Club
Entomology of a Bookworm &The Shrinkette's Social Justice Bookclub 


As you might imagine, things might not go as planned next year. But I will diligently read for the two group reads that I'm hosting.
