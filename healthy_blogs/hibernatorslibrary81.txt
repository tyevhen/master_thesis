It won't surprise anyone that knows me that I love cats. Sorry dear boyfriend, bunnies are just ok. And even less ok when they eat through the furniture. My precious little babies haven't destroyed anything yet. Except my bank account. This week I took all three of them to the vet. Boy is that expensive!

Overall the week went well. It was my first week in my new dialysis clinic for work. It was nice meeting all my new patients. I miss the old ones, but I've found some friendly faces in my new work-home. 

This week on my blog I wrote a review of The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm, by Nancy Farmer, some notes on Chapter 1 of How to Read the Bible, by James Kugel, and some notes on Lesson 8 of Stress and Your Body, by Professor Robert Sapolsky.

I'm currently reading: How to Read the Bible, by James Kugel; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J. K. Rowling; and Stiletto, by Daniel O'Malley. 


I have acquired: The Literary Guide to the Bible, by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode. This is a book of essays about each book or section of the Bible, and I will peruse it as I'm reading the Bible next year for my Bible Group Read.
