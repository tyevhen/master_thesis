We all have those days when motherhood wears us down. We have days when we are overwhelmed and need a break.  It doesn't mean you are not a good mama. It means you are tired....Take care of yourself. Get the breaks you need. Have fun with friends and family. Especially go out and have fun with your husband. Do not talk about problems but just laugh. Have a healing mama day!
