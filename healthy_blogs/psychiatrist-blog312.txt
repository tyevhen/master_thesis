Hmm... "Implications of Neuroscience, Neurotechnology and the DSM-5"...

This could have been interesting. Too bad it was cancelled. The thematic articles that might have been discussed are here.

In the same way that we would not have predicted 40 years ago what psychiatry (and even health care, in general) looks like today, it is even harder to predict what these fields will look like in the next few decades. Still, let the prognostication continue.
