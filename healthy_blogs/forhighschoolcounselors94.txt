I want to introduce a new and exciting peer mediation program for high schools!  In 2014, the Association for Conflict Resolution (ACR) Education Section received a two year grant from the JAMS Foundation to create an online peer mediation platform.
The goals of this project includes:
Show how students, ages 10 to 18, can learn online how to become peer mediators. This  feature will be available in 2016.
Show how students can practice their peer mediation skills online with the assistance of qualified mentors. This feature is available now.
Show how students can offer online peer mediation services using their computer, i-pad, smart phone, or other electronic devise. This feature be available in 2016.
Provide anyone who is interested in peer mediation extensive information on this topic; for example, standards, useful links, research on peer mediation effectiveness, policies and laws, resources (e.g. curricula and videos). This feature is available now.
This resource can be extremely helpful to districts with little funding for peer mediation or what to enhance their peer mediation program.  If you are interested in finding out more information, please visit the Online Peer Mediation Project website.
