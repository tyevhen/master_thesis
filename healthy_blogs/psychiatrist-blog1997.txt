[posted by dinah, with guest barkers max, tex, and alfie]

Max has a new buddie, Alfie, a chocolate lab who is currently in foster care with Tex and family while she awaits transport to her permanent home in Georgia. Alfie, in her pink, rhinestone-studded collar, makes quite the statement. My only psychiatric observation is that she plays well with others and, as a group, this gang is not prone to introspection. The biscuits are what it's about and surely, the end justifies the means. Not really psychiatry, but who can resist a new puppy?
