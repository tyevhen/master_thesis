When treating the elderly, we should not over-emphasize Kidney deficiency.

Yes, most elderly people (though not all) will suffer from some form of Kidney deficiency but the most serious diseases of the elderly are caused by Phlegm, Blood stasis and internal Wind. These three pathogenic factors play a role in the pathology of stroke, coronary heart disease, cancer, high cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's.

It follows therefore, that in treating the elderly, we should pay attention to resolving Phlegm, invigorating Blood and extinguishing Wind. These pathologies are also reflected in the pulse of the elderly that is frequently hard, Wiry and Slippery.
