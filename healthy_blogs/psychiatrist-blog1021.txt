I'm working on a chapter for our book. I still like either Off the Couch or Beyond the Couch for a title. Roy wants to name it Set the Couch on Fire. And he's not kidding. What do you think?

Okay, so the current chapter is on real life intrusions-- things that impact care, for better or for worse, in ways we may or may not really understand. So stuff external to the actual treatment. Some examples are--- Money/fees/ not showing up for appointments/ Violence (how does it impact care if you have a suicide attempt? If you threaten or assault your shrink?/ assumptions people make about their patients or shrinks/ drug company influences/ and the media portrayal of psychiatry. A lot of the chapter is about money and insurance companies and fees.

Are we missing anything? The chapter is short---still waiting for Clink to write about violence, still waiting for Roy to chip in. And really, this isn't a real entity in psychiatry, it's something to draw together some unrelated stuff we wanted to talk about and make it cohesive. So is there something you want to know about that might intrude on care?
