Broccoli Salad

5 cups broccoli, cut into small florets
1 cup carrots, grated
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup sunflower seeds (I have used pecans which are also good)

Sauce:
1/2 cup veganaise or similar vegan mayo
1 packet Stevia or 1/8 - 1/4 cup sweetener to taste
2 Tbs lemon juice

Chop and measure all vegetables, seeds, fruits into a bowl.
Mix sauce ingredients briskly until smooth and drizzle over veg mix.
Stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate. It is best when it's had the chance
to marinate for a few hours but you can eat it right away too.
The sauce in this recipe is just enough to lightly coat it, if you like it a
little more drenched, double the sauce recipe.
