Busy around here.  I'm preparing for a podcast with Dr. Su at Carbohydrates Can Kill and a radio show with Leslie Irish Evans at Peeling Mom Off the Ceiling in addition to all the usual day to day.  However, I've found a (new to me) dietary study, and interesting tidbits came though in one of this weeks' American Psychiatric Association emails - just have to get an hour or two to dig up and paw through the papers so I can make sense of the news.  Likely to happen tomorrow!
