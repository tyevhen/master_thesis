I am now a Certified Emotion Code Practitioner and attended the Body Code Seminar for three days in June. I have done more than one hundred sessions, mostly in person, but some over the phone. Of all the things I do to help people heal physically, mentally, and spiritually, I like emotion code the best because it is faster and more effective.
