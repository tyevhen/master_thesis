...for your reporting on the latest news on Abilify. I saw the press release for the study of aripiprazole (Abilify) last week and thought that I should write about it, but the Furious Seasons site beat me to the punch, discussing the sponsor’s rather funny interpretation of the study’s results. I need to track down the actual study and see what more can be said about it, but my guess is that Dawdy has nailed it.
