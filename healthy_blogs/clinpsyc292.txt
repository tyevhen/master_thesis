One blogger (Pharmalyst) has estimated that Lilly's new doggie Prozac could bring in $270 million annually in US sales. Sounds over the top, but maybe it could happen. I looked for the clinical trials, because I really want to know how one measures canine depression, but I couldn't find any information.
