Hi guys,
Don't have too much time today, but I thought I'd post some interesting articles for your weekend(when your sitting out and tanning...supposed to be in the 70's here in the Northeast)

Just click the link and you're on your way!
1) The Science of Swearing
2) Blood Pressure Drug Linked with lower PTSD Symptoms
3) The Psychology of Video Games

May the Fourth be with you on this TGIF!!!
Y
