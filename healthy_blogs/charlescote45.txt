Many Mountains Moving poetry/flash fiction contests this year have been extended; the deadline is now Feb. 13, 2011. Still relatively few people have entered this year though the prizes went up to $500 in each genre. They generally publish many of the poetry finalists as well, and with the entry fee you would get this very great new issue for free. Printable guidelines here:
