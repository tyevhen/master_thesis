Commonly question about Overcoming Shyness - Complete Guide
Question :
I feel like I m not going to get anywhere with my almost anxiety?
I have always been different. I am almost the complete opposite of the typical guy at age 14. I am quiet, humble, smart, like different music, etc. when all the others are outgoing, sporty, and average. I am always worried that nothing will ever do for me and I won t be successful because of my shyness and extreme lack of confidence. I don t think I m the worst looking person in the word, this one girl in particular calls me sexy (I don t think of myself as that) every other day, yet I have no confidence.

I have always felt as if as soon as I hit age 18 or 19 and I m out of high school, like would just automatically be better, when I have no clue what to do with my life. I guess you could call it social anxiety, and it keeps me from being the person I d love to be and want to be. I never imagined myself going into a job interview because I plain out don t like to socialize with people I don t know thinking I m just doing to mess up somehow. Everyone I encounter daily would somehow need to be my friend or be nice enough for me to be able to talk to them with ease.

I sorta have a fear of embarrassment, awkwardness, and denial so I just try to stay out of as much as I can. (I even keep long hair to hide a lot of my face if I get embarrassed. I know, ridiculous.) What I m trying to say is that I feel like I m going to get nowhere becuase of this almost anxiety in me every day. I do talk to people at school, but it s because I know them well enough or I see that they are nice. I do have 2 main best friends and a lot of other friends too, but they aren t people I can trust to explain all my thoughts to them. It s like I someone I can trust to just be there all the time to guide me through life and make jokes when I fail and keep my hopes up when I m denied. People are almost always nice to me with very few exceptions. I feel like I could write a blog about my life just to express my thoughts. I don t know, its just, that feeling nothing is going to work out.

Call me a drama queen or whatever, I just want to know of it is an anxiety problem or just shyness in general and maybe how to overcome it when it is time for job interviews and things I need to face alone.
Answer :
I have the same problems (i have long hair to hide behind too :) ). well i m 18 and i have social anxiety disorder.
a therapist could help, i don t like that though i d too freaked to really go. i meditate and write because those things relax me. so if writing a blog will help you go for it.
college is hard for me because i have to do everything on my own, it s better though because no one bothers you like in high school. going to get job applications was horrifying but i did it and my first interview i threw up three times rinsed my mouth out and went.

what i find helps is actually something i got from a movie "What About Bob" Billy Murray goes around saying "I feel good I feel great I feel wonderful" it sounds dumb but i say it and say it until i do feel better. mind over matter.

i have panic attacks, i puke when i know i have to go places, i can t even talk to people i live with. and yet i somehow make it through the day and into the next. all you can do is live, the people you
re afraid of won t kill you so you have time.

i know this is bad advise and i m sorry i just want you to know you re not alone.
you can email or contact me. maybe since i can relate you can talk to me about stuff and maybe i could help. really feel free.
