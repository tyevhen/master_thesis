Banquet Hall A


I'll be leading a discussion on electronic health records and CCHIT at noon, along with Ji, who will be talking about smart devices feeding patient info back in their health records.

HealthCamp is one of these un-conferences (started as a barcamp by Mark Scrimshire) where a bunch of people get together to talk about a subject matter, but they don't figure out who is going to say what until they get there. The presenters are the audience. These all-day conferences are getting held all over the place, and Maryland's turn is on Friday, June 19, at Stevenson University, just north of Baltimore.

I've not gone to one of these before, but I'm going tomorrow. I'll meet folks in person with whom I've only been emailing or twittering over the past few months. I'm thinking something good can come out of it, as there has been this groundswell of pent-up energy and enthusiasm behind the whole health care reform bandwagon. Yes, even a 'call to action', I guess.

You can still attend in person for about 30 bucks. If you cannot attend but want to join in on the action, you can watch the live twittering going on by monitoring the hashtag, #hcmd09. There will probably also be some live streaming via Ustream and BlogTalkRadio. And I'm sure there'll be Flickr pics posted, too.

If I find more links to these 2.0ish things, I'll post them here. So stay tuned.
