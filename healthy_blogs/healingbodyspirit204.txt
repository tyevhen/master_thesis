My grandson, who just turned two, is adding new words to his vocabualry every day.
Today, as I talked to him on the phone he said to me, "Pickles on the Porch."
I didn't quite understand this message so asked my daughter, "Pickles on the porch?"
She laughed, "He can't say "pumkins" yet, so he calls them pickles."
