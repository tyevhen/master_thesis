Week 5: Sunil - Frances - Jesse - Adele
So last week, I took my kid to the doctor. He knows I'm a psychiatrist and greeted me with "Have you ever watched In Treatment?" Oy. He wanted to talk about Sunil.

Sunil continues to develop as a character. He and Paul have tea. They talk about dignity and passion and living a principled life. Sunil is animated when he talks about Survivor and about his daughter-in-law as she exercises. He's overheard his son having sex with her, he thinks she's having an affair, and we learn that Sunil was secretly in love briefly, before he met his wife in an arranged marriage. Maybe he is jealous of his son, Paul suggests, or maybe he feels the daughter-in-law is betraying Sunil personally.

Who is Sunil? Is he laughing or is he crying? Is he wise or is he insane? There is a mystery to him--- he wants to know exactly what might cause Paul to break his confidence, and as Paul tells him that the circumstances would have to be extreme, that someone would have to be in danger, it's hard not to wonder if someone might be. Sunil is compelling, yet creepy, and one might wonder if he's attracted to his daughter-in-law, or if he's thinking of killing her? Did anyone else wonder this?
