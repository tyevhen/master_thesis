Lemons & limes are alkaline

Acording to Dr. Robert Young, "It is often said that 'acidic' fruits like lemons, limes and grapefruits will acidify the blood and tissues. In fact, the citric, lactic, and other acids in such low sugar fruits - unlike high sugar fruits - exsist primarily in their anionic (basic or electron) form, especially as their Na+ and K+ salts (e.g., potassium citrate). Following absorption, these anions (bases or electrons) are metabolized to sodium bicarbonate. Thus, lemons, limes and grapefruits alkalinize - not acidify - blood and tissues."
