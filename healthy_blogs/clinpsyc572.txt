According to Bloomberg, AstraZeneca is going to do the following: "[CEO] Brennan said he planned to grow sales of top drugs like Seroquel, by expanding its use into generalized anxiety and bipolar disorder, and by introducing a once-a-day version of the pill."

Say what? GAD is one of the more treatable mental illnesses around. It response quite well to psychotherapy (with CBT being the most studied intervention, but other psychotherapeutic interventions also appear efficacious) though residual symptoms are often present. Giving someone a heavy duty medication such as an atypical antipsychotic? I don't think so!

I can see it now. The wheels are in motion. A review in a recent (September) issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry states that "The efficacy of these agents [atypical antipsychotics] in various anxiety conditions needs to be further investigated with large, well-designed comparison studies." This may surprise you, but most of the authors had significant financial ties to AstraZeneca.

The buzz is starting. Follow up with a couple short-term trials showing greater reduction in anxiety than a placebo (though perhaps not by a large margin) and then make sure that the paid speakers discuss it at fancy dinners and that the trials find their way into prescribers' inboxes. Don't worry -- Seroquel won't be compared to an SSRI and certainly not to psychotherapy in an AZ-sponsored trial -- we wouldn't want to compare it to treatments with greater efficacy and/or fewer side effects! It's a rather predictable formula.

Of course tranquilizing medications such as antipsychotics reduce anxiety. It's just that there are much better treatment options available. What a great example of trying to expand the market for an existing drug! Profit over patient welfare.
