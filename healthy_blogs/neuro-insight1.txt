Since March 2017 Neuro-Insight, Zengar Inc. and Govert Viergever, Dutch Olympic rower of TeamNL, have been working together. Viergever has trained his brain for 8 weeks, almost daily and shares his experiences with us. He will continue to train his brain, using our equipment. The experiences so far have been very positive. His concentration improved, and, anxiety and nervousness before and during races decreased. 
NeurOptimal® is an advanced neuro-technology that offers training to the brain, enabling it to function at its best. It’s mathematically designed to communicate directly with your central nervous system and has been called “the most effective bio-hack on this planet”. Note aside however, NeurOptimal® does have a long and verifiable history with over THREE MILLION HOURS of safe and effective usage, and it is celebrating its seventeenth year this year!

Thank you Govert for being so open, and, we wish you lots of succes this rowing season!
