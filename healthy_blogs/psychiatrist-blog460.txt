A couple of years ago, I wrote a post about how patients often ask me if they...or something they are feeling...or something they are doing...is Normal.  I went on to ramble about how Normal is Boring, and why would anyone want to be Normal.  IQ = 100, tuna fish for lunch, you name it.  


People still ask me if they are normal. I've taken to responding: "I have no idea what 'normal' means."  I still have no idea why anyone would want to be normal. 

 In psychiatry, we often ask "Why now?"   Why are you seeking help for your problem today?  You may want to know why I'm blogging about Normal today.  Ah, the answer to that is easy.  My friend Patty put the above cartoon on her Facebook Page and what better graphic for a Shrink Rap post?  Is it normal to blog about Facebook cartoons?
