 Vs.





We bought our daughter a Kindle for her birthday and I'm using it while she finishes her hard copy books.  So far, it has two books on it: Shrink Rap (because my husband bought it for his iPad and it magically appeared on the Kindle, perhaps because they are all linked to my Amazon account) and Slaughterhouse 5-- her summer reading.  So, Billy Pilgrim, Kilgore Trout, Roland Weary and a bunch of Tralfamadorians are taking a walk down memory lane.  It's light, it's easy, it's portable, and I'm addicted to screens.  I'd kind of like to turn the pages with a touch screen, and how do I get the print a little larger for when the lighting is low (oy, I've hit that age)?  So, Kindle versus Nook: if you're done the comparison, do let me know....
