Art, the world is a much better place for your life and MY world is immeasurably better. Bless you!  Keep the wisdom going.

Dear Art,

When I first started therapy ten years ago I sent you a silkscreen-type card. It showed a tiger crouching in a field of bamboo, half hiding from a bright orange sun. It said: tiger waiting. This card back then was a thank you card.
Well that tiger--my deepest self--has come out of hiding. He's no longer waiting. Years of feeling--I've never stopped--have brought him out. I often ask: what would I have done without you, Art. Without your therapy. You've given me a whole new life. Thank you a million times. And bless you for it.

Dear Dr Janov

Happy Birthday Art,
I know it is your birthday today,
I was born in 1974, which is a 4 number, just like You.
Since I've turned 40 this year,
I'm feeling so old, thinking of retirement already,
I can't imagine 90!
I hope you're doing well, and wish you a Happy Birthday,
But please, no birthday cake for M.!
Best Wishes,
If you can't put a face on my name, I'm the one who came to Halloween group 2006 with an inflatable doll


O. T., France
