David Graham is once again stepping up to the plate, saying that the FDA needs to get its act together and actually protect the safety of the public. Crazy idea, eh?

According to Reuters:
FDA scientist Dr. David Graham told a congressional hearing the drugmaker and the agency knew "for a long time" about the risk of weight gain from Zyprexa that could trigger diabetes.
"FDA did its typical dragging its feet on post-marketing safety issues," he told Reuters after the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing.
Graham did not review Zyprexa, but said that, after his 2004 public testimony criticizing the FDA's actions on Merck & Co Inc.'s (MRK.N: Quote, Profile, Research) withdrawn Vioxx painkiller, other agency staffers came to him with concerns.
Graham also said that Congress should investigate the FDA's handling of Zyprexa regarding safety concerns. Why are there so few people at the FDA who seem to care about these issues?
