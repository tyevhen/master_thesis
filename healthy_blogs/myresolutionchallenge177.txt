Clutching a bag of popcorn in her small hand she gazed up at the expanse of painted stars; vibrant shades of yellow, blue, green and pink covered the ceiling.

Can you remember your first trip to the Circus?

On Saturday 20th April it's the 4th World Circus Day.  What are you doing to celebrate?

Hold a 'Mocktail' Party
As my April challenge is all about giving up alcohol I thought it would be fun to include a mocktail party as part of our Circus celebrations.  Following on from my impromptu moment of stardom on stage with 'Patchy the Clown' at Paulos Circus, I asked you to send me your Big Top related mocktails and I have picked my favourites from the many I received.  Thank you to everyone who emailed me with their suggestions.

'Flying Fairbrother' from Tracey Mason

In a shaker half-filled with ice, combine 2oz grapefruit juice, 1oz orange juice, 1oz cranberry juice and 1 tsp of honey.  Shake well.  Strain into a Collins glass almost filled with ice cubes and top with 3oz ginger beer.  Stir well and enjoy.

'Lion Tamer' from Brenda Wilson

Cut 1 small watermelon into chunks and freeze overnight.  When fully frozen, blend with 2 1/2 cups of almond milk in a blender until smooth.  Pour into a glass and garnish with sprigs of mint and enjoy.



'Coco the Clown' from Amanda Thomas

Drizzle some fudge sauce around the rim of a martini glass.  Blend 2oz chocolate ice cream, 1 can of coconut cream and crushed ice for 2 mintues in a blender until smooth.  Pour into the prepared glass and enjoy.
