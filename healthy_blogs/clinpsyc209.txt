Due to people listing addresses of their rivals in recent comments, I have deleted a couple of comments and enabled comment moderation. People have had enough time to exchange unpleasantries. For the sadists in the audience, there are still plenty of mean-spirited, highly sarcastic, and in some cases just plain mean comments posted. At this point, over 340 comments have been made regarding the two posts (1, 2). Time to find a new hobby, everyone. There's very likely nothing new to be added to the discussion. Should you attempt to add a comment to either post, I am very likely not going to allow it. This has become ridiculous.

However, feel free to comment on other posts -- my comment policy remains quite open, but only a certain level of nastiness shall be allowed.
