According to the National Eating Disorder Association, eating disorders are illnesses with a biological basis modified and influenced by emotional and cultural factors. The stigma associated with eating disorders has long kept individuals suffering in silence, inhibited funding for crucial research and created barriers to treatment. Because of insufficient information, the public and professionals fail to recognize the dangerous consequences of eating disorders. While eating disorders are serious, potentially life threatening illnesses, there is help available and recovery is possible.

Eating disorders are not just exclusively experienced by girls and women. Research has shown us that boys and men experience the disorder as well. Look here for more information about the subtypes of eating disorders, cultural and sex differences, resources, statistics and ways to love yourself and your body.

February has been a National Awareness Month for Eating Disorders world-wide. More information reduces stigma. And when stigma is reduced, hope is possible.

Here's to hope and loving yourself no matter what!
