The American Psychiatric Association's 162nd Annual Meeting just ended in San Francisco last week.  These are 5-day long academic smorgasborgs attended by a large proportion of the APA's 35,000-plus members, in addition to other interested people. 

There were about 600 individual talks totaling about 600 hours, not to mention the 800-odd poster presentations.  To see an example of the first two days' worth of talks, skip to the bottom of this post.  

We are thinking about bringing most of the meetings' talks online -- audio, video, slides, and all.  Here's my question: Do these talks have any interest outside of just psychiatrists?  How much would you be willing to pay on a per-talk basis (this is the non-member price)?  These would be streaming talks (not downloads) and payment includes access for 12 months so it can be watched multiple times (update: no CME).
(Please tweet this survey, blog it, email it, circulate widely. Thanks.)
