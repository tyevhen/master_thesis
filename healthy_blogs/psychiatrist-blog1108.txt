In yesterday's New York Times Magazine, Walter Kirn wrote about his own personal, and highly ambivalent relationship with Adderall, a medication he used to help him focus his attention. It wasn't clear from the article if Mr. Kirn actually had Attention Deficit Disorder, if he was simply struggling with a difficult time, or if he wanted an edge.

In A Phamocological Education, Kirn writes:

Adderall, I discovered during the courtship phase of what became our deeply tortured relationship, offers a kind of assistance to the brain that feels just right, at first, for the age of multitasking. The drug might as well have been invented by Microsoft and embedded in the Windows toolbar. It seemed to allow me to do three things at once and not completely fail at two of them. Far more important, however, it helped me do one thing at once and focus on it. If I was toiling at my computer, it sharpened the clicking sensations of the keyboard while lowering the volume of the phone whose ringing might have broken my work trance. It also, for me at least, suppressed emotion, freeing me from the claims of other people (my children primarily, because I work at home) who wanted a piece of my precious, deskbound time.
