The following was observed and documented at the Therapuetic Learning Center of Utah on 586 patients with the use of Elan Light Therapy.

 

220 patients were able to discontinue their antidepressant medications

56 patients experienced acceleration of the healing process of wounds, burns, and skin issues like pustules

148 patients reported 50 to 75% reduction in pain

20 patients that experienced social anxiety reported less isolation to home and increased motivation and ability to engage in family and church activity

18 patients whose lab studies showed decreased Glutathione levels and associated debilitationg fatigue showed 50%  increase in Glutathione and reported 15 to 25% increase in energy

10 patients experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks, refractory to medications were prevented from having hospitalization

6 patients with ADHD and experiencing learning problems reported increased focus, concentration, and memory. They also reported improved grades and relationships. No medications used.

The lights have been shown to increase nitrous oxide in the body. I have found the lights to be very helpful in reducing PTSD, pain, anxiety, insomnia, and very calming and relaxing.
