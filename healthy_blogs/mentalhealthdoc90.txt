Human prefrontal cortex is one of the least understood areas of the brain. Due to lack of understanding of the functions of prefrontal cortex, early surgeons performed one of the disastrous procedure called prefrontal leucotomy or prefrontal lobectomy.

These procedures were performed in the hope of calming down disturbed patients. However now we know that Prefrontal cortex makes the difference between Human and an ape.

Prefrontal cortex is situated in front (Anteriority) to the premotor area of the brain.Basically prefrontal cortex is situated just behind the forehead (see photo of the brain). 

What are the functions of prefrontal area?

Currently understood functions of prefrontal cortex are

1. Initiation and maintaining goal directed behavior. Especially for longer term goals.
2. Balancing our emotions, feelings with the social standards. So we do not behave like animals
3. Considering the circumstances and potential consequences of behavior when someone is planning an action.
4. Maintaining cognitive ï¬‚exibility in problem solving.
5. Achieving optimal levels of arousal (drive) and sustaining/directing attention.
Addition to these function there could be many unidentified functions of this misterious part of the human brain.

What are connections inbetween prefrontal cortex and other brain areas

1. Posterior cotex (responsible for vision)
2. Temporal lobes (responsible for hearing)
3. Limbic and paralimbic structures (responsible for identification of threats and emotional responses)
4. Olfactory system (area responsible for smell)
5. Thalamus (main sensory relay station of the brain)
