It is a dreary January evening and I am stuck on the couch with a bug that I believe I caught from one of the teachers who ventured in my office at the beginning of the week.  The worst part is that I have a cough that will not let me sleep...urgghhh!  Since I can't sleep, I decided to jump on the computer
and work on a post.  


This is me!
Since it is a new year, I am always eager to find the latest resources, blogs. social media, and other types of information that will be beneficial in my practice.  So, I decided to share my latest list of top resources for my high school counseling colleagues. 

 If you have any additional sites, please feel free to share them with me and I will post them to my list.
