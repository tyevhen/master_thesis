One area of the body that becomes particularly troublesome for those of us with Kennedy's Disease is often the most neglected. As the disease progresses, the face and throat muscles also begin to weaken. Many of us begin to experience problems with swallowing, choking, dry-drowning (Laryngospasm), facial muscle wasting, jaw weakness, etc.

In my Smart Exercise Guide there are a few exercises that will help maintain the throat and facial muscles and possibly delay several of the issues mentioned above. Because of its importance, I felt it might be appropriate to include some exercises in this blog. I practice many of these exercises every day (those shown with an asterisk) and they do help â€¦ especially with the chewing and choking issues. If you are having any of the problems mentioned above, try these exercises for a month and see for yourself if they help. One thing nice about these exercises is that you can do them while sitting in your easy chair watching TV. Note: These are just a few of the exercises, more can be found in the Kennedy's Disease Association website and in this PDF.
