The article found at this link (ASC-J9) was originally written in 2007. Some of you might have missed this article, so that is why I have this short post today. The article is well written and provides another ray of hope for those of us living with Kennedy's Disease. Also, if you Google "ASC-J9" you will see dozens of articles on this compound.

ASC-J9 shows a lot of potential. The company that is researching the potential of this compound is currently working with the National Institute of Health (NIH) to perform additional testing on mouse models to help determine the potential and safety of this drug. Once the safety and effectiveness of this compound is confirmed, the NIH will consider sponsoring a clinical trial. This trial could within the next two years if everything goes well.
