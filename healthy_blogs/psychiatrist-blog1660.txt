Dear Provider:

The enclosed claims were received in our mailroom and are being returned because the incorrect claim form was used. Claims must be submitted on the CMS 1500 (08/) version of the CMS 1500 claim form printed with red "dropout" ink for the forms to be scanned into Medicare's computer system.


Newsletter 100-20 CR51 published May 2, 2007 outlines the effective date for submission of the new CMS 1500 claim form as July 2, 2007.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,


Claims Representative
Medicare Part B


And so I'm left to ask:
Anyone want to buy a few hundred CMS 1500 (12/90) forms? And could you lend me just a little "dropout" ink?
