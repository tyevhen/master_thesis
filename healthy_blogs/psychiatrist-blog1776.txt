I noted in today's Northern Star that Dr. Diana Kraft, Northern Illinois University's psychiatrist for 15 years, has retired after being told she must cut back on the amount of time she spends evaluating patients. The side bar in the paper indicates:
"On March 8, Kraft was notified by her supervisor that the time allotted for her to see patients would be reduced from 60 minutes for a new patient to 45 minutes, and 20 minutes for a return patient down to 15 minutes. Incorporating paperwork and dictation, Kraft would only be allotted 30 minutes of face time for a new patient and 10 minutes for a return patient, she said."
I hate it when administrators see patient care as an assembly line which can get speeded up when demand or profits require more efficient widget production. People are not widgets.
