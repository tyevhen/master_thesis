Get out your tuxedos and gowns, the galas are about to begin!
Yes, Shrink Rap is now 10! We are the longest running psychiatry blog and with thousands of posts and years of faithful readers, we couldn't be more excited!

Okay, so no black tie gala.  We had planned a party with chili and beer and a cake with a duck on it, but a family emergency delayed the event -- to be rescheduled soon.

So let me tell you how much I've loved having this blog (a lot) and over the years, there's been a lot of evolution.  I write less than I used to, but I still write.  Clink comes by with updates on conferences and spends more time on Twitter.  Roy is still in it for the food and friendship, but he's moved on to some other endeavors-- perhaps he'll post an update to tell you about them.  We've blogged, we've have 70 episodes of our podcast, My Three Shrinks, there's been our book: Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work, and our columns in Clinical Psychiatry News and Psychology Today, not to mention Twitter and Facebook.  As I've mentioned, our umbrella organization, The Accessible Psychiatry Project, is up for a Scattergood Innovation Award and you are still welcome to add a comment on their website because we'd really like to win!

Now, we're getting for the release of our second book in the fall -- details to follow. Also, Dinah has been working on a website that helps people find psychiatrists quickly in Maryland: http://www.marylandpsychiatrists.net/

So ten years and going strong.  Thank you for being part of our rather unusual psychiatric adventure, and thank you for being part of our lives!

Clink and Roy may have more to add soon.
