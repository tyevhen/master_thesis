One of my Twitter followers recently asked me to blog about what's been happening in the prison neighborhood recently. Basically what's happening is that there is a serial rapist running around central Baltimore. This past week a woman's body was found three blocks from the prison. The police suspect the killing took place during a sexual assault, and they sent police cadets out to scour the public housing complex nearby to look for evidence. (I have to admit, when I saw them my first thought was: "Oh, they'll find lots of evidence. Some of it may even be related to the killing!") Today the local newspaper said that DNA evidence has revealed that the rapes are being committed by two different suspects. One suspect is targeting women who are waiting at bus stops while the other is committing home invasions.
So why am I blogging about this? (I mean, other than because somebody asked me to.) Because periodically somebody asks me if I feel safe working in prison. Well....compared to the streets of Baltimore....need I say more?
