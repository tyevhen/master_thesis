This week's Grand Rounds is at Running a Hospital, a blog written by Paul Levy, the President and CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

Paul's blog is well-known, as he is very open about the challenges of running such an endeavor.  He chose a theme about medical errors and related mistakes, told via the many stories he chose to include in the GR post.

This is a must-read.  Great job, Paul.
