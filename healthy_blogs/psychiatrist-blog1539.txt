Happy New Year!!

Last year at this time, we gave you a Top 25 Posts of 2006 list, so we give you this year's countdown list now. (Yes, I will also do a Roy's Favorite Search Phrases of 2007, like I did last year.)


Last year, our main blog page had 27,809 page views, with 9991 "absolute unique visitors" (we started in April 2006, so last year was not a full year). In 2007, the main page had 70,166 views (173,444 page views for the entire site) and 67,867 absolute unique visitors. Thank you for your interest in Shrink Rap!

Last year our #1 post was Stopping the Scourge of P.E. (my post, as DrivingMissMolly pointed out). This year it is again one of mine, so I am challenging my co-bloggers to out-post me in 2008 (if you can...lol...jk).
