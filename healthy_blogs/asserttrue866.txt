Java 1.4.2 died last week. According to Sun's "End of Service Life" page, Java 1.4.2 went EOSL last Thursday. The only trouble is, it's still moving.

Java 5 (SE) was released in 2004 and Java 6 has been out since 2006. Java 5 will, in fact, also be at EOSL in less than a year. (You might call it the Java "Dead Man Walking" Edition.) And yet, if you do a Google search on any of the following, guess what you get?

java.lang.Object
java.lang.Class
java.lang.Exception
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Runtime
java.awt.Image
java.io.File
java.net.URL
JComponent
JFrame

If you do a Google search on any one of these, the very first hit (in every case) is a link to Sun's Javadoc for the 1.4.2 version of the object in question.

A year from now (when Java 5 hits the dirt) I wonder how many of these 10 searches will still take you to 1.4.2 Javadoc? (Remember, Java 5 has been out for almost 5 years and still doesn't outrank 1.4.2 in Google searches.) I'm guessing half of them. What do you think?
