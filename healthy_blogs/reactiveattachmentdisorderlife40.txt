What is in your tool box? In therapy our therapist talked about the tools we use. In Weight Watchers they talk about tools for weight loss. In class our instructor talked about the tools a therapist uses. Tools are important for real work. Imagine a carpenter with no tools. A parent with no tools is in worse shape because we are talking about tools to help another person who is very sick. Our children are heart sick.

So over the next few days I am going to talk about tools for different situations. If you have some tools I don't mention please share them with us.

I will talk about lying, defiance, physical aggression, stealing and the ever dreaded verbal attack. So be thinking......Tomorrow: lying.

I am going to begin a note book. The thing with RAD is that no one tool works for long periods of time. We have to change up often. I wonder how many tools I have that I have forgotten about. So I'm going to get out the paper and pen and come up with as many things for each behavior that I can remember. I'm going to go back through my blog, other blogs, websites and see what I can gather on each topic. Meet you here tomorrow!
