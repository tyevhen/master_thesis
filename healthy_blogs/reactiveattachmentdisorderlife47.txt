She is 19 tomorrow! Happy Birthday to our youngest daughter. We are proud of the young woman you are becoming! She leaves for college tomorrow. She is going on a mission trip to Houston TX to work with inner city children in an after school program and at a youth center. She is so creative. She is a graphic design major. She made the tree I showed you all a while back....here it is again just because I think it is beautiful.


We love you H.
love, Mom and Dad
