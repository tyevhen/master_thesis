Happy Daylight Saving weekend everyone! Not much happened this week out here in Rachel-land. The weather is beautiful, and I've been able to take some nice long walks around a lake - we have 10,000 of them out here in MN. ;) 

I had another moulage victim gig this week - this time I was a belligerent drunk with a tib-fib fracture and a tension pneumothorax. I got to yell at poor medical interns while they tried to convince their examiner that they knew what they were doing. It was pretty fun. My lines were "I'm going to die if you don't do something!" "I'm going to throw up!" and "I need to sit up so I can breathe!" The rest was all ad lib. I DO wonder if I'd be able to be quite so loud if I really had a tension pneumothorax, though. 

This is my last week of EMT lectures. From now on it's two full weeks of tests. I can't wait. *cringes*
