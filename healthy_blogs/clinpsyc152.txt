I have been intrigued with the Hooked blog from Dr. Howard Brody. I had the good fortune of running across the site a few months ago, but I have been doing a poor job of reading it regularly until recently.

Read this post about "intellectual bias" and flacking for Pharma. Also check out this winner of a post regarding academic physicians trying to "ride the tiger" of Big Pharma while still maintaining strong ethical boundaries.

It is about to be added to my blogroll. Good work, Dr. Brody!
