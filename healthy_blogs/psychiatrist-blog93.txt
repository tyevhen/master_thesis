I'm soliciting wisdom from our readers on how to fill out a HCFA claim form.  I'll start by telling you that my NPI number on the submitted form was in block 33A.  My legacy number was not on the form.  This is the third such notice I've gotten, and clearly, I'm doing something wrong.  Perhaps you can help?
