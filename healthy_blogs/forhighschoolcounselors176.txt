I am so excited to have the opportunity to co-moderate the next high school counselor chat with Amber Shepherd Thompson (AmberShepherd-Thompson.weebly.com) on November 10th.

High School Counselor Chat-November 10th

Joining us will be Emily Lindin, founder of The UnSlut Project.  The UnSlut Project works against sexual bullying and slut shaming in our schools, communities, media, and culture.


History of The UnSlut Project

The UnSlut Project was inspired by Emily's own experience. When she was eleven years old, she was branded a “slut” by her classmates and was bullied at school, after school, and online. During all this, she kept a regular diary. Now a Harvard graduate pursuing her PhD in California, Emily started The UnSlut Project by blogging her own middle school diaries. The project has grown into an online community where people who have experienced slut shaming and sexual bullying can share their stories, and where girls who are currently suffering can find support. Emily has been featured sharing her story and speaking out against slut shaming on ABC with Katie Couric, CNN with Brooke Baldwin, Al Jazeera America, HLN, DNTO radio with Sook-Yin Lee, NPR with Lance Orozco of KCLU, Deutsche Welle radio, Radio Ireland, and in many magazines and blogs including The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, and The Observer.
