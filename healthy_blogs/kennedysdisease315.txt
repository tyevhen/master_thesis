I had another article I was planning on using today, but a friend sent me an email this morning.  As soon as I watched the YouTube video I knew this message has to be shared.

 
If you are a follower of my blog, you know that I am patriotic.  Being a veteran I feel we do not do enough to honor the men and women that serve our country.  This 5½ minute video captures a beautiful and thought-provoking sentiment that needs to be shared.

In this fast-paced, multi-tasking world it is easy to forget about those people that are not a part of our daily lives.  However, the family, friends, and loved ones that have someone they care about serving in our armed forces never forget.  It is a daily struggle to remain strong and hopeful that they will return safely and soon. 
Please, take a few minutes and watch this film called “Remember Me” from Lizzie Palmer .  She is a 15 year old girl that is wise beyond her years.
