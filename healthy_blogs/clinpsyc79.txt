I'll be on hiatus for a while. Too many things to do in too little time. Fortunately, material that is right in the sweet spot for readers of this site can be found at:
Carlat Psychiatry Blog. His takedown of Medscape is much needed, as is further digging into ye olde coverup of industry cash by child psychiatry key opinion leaders.
PsychCentral. Who cares about St. John's Wort for ADHD? JAMA seriously published a small trial of SJW versus placebo. I thought JAMA was for higher importance issues -- and so did John Grohol at Psych Central.
Furious Seasons. Overdiagnosis of ADHD? Not a new complaint, but interesting perspective is provided by a Canadian psychologist who thinks the ADHD label is being passed about unnecessarily in Canada.
I hope to return soon.
