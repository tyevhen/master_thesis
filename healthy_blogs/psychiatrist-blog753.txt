Aloha! Clink and I are still in Hawaii on opposite ends of the same island. Gorgeous here, and oh,how I love vacation! I am having some technical difficulties posting from an iPad, and maybe Roy could add a photo for me.

You're used to hearing us say on our podcast, "Please go to iTunes and write a review!"

Now, I'd like to ask, if you've read our new book, Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work,
Please go to Amazon and write a review!

Thank you so much, and I am going back to my vacation now. See you next week. Roy, hold down the blog-- you're doing a great job.
