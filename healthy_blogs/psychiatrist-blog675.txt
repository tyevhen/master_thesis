Mark Ryan, a Virginia family physician, wrote a blog post for Mayo Clinic Center for Social Media three weeks ago, reviewing the many definitions of "professional behavior" for physicians and how that might apply to our social media interactions.

It is apparent to me that what is considered appropriate or not for physicians using social media (eg, should you friend a patient on Facebook?) is still being tested and figured out. However, Mark's post reminds us that there are certain principles that remain immutable, despite the technology.
