I was always a big fan of Jim Edwards' work at BrandweekNRX. While I also enjoyed Peter Rost's writings at the aforementioned blog, the blogosphere certainly took a hit without Jim's insightful writings. The good news: Jim is back! His blog can be read at: http://jimedwardsnrx.wordpress.com. I was flattered that he picked up my piece on the sexual side effects of SSRIs for one of his first posts upon his return.

While Jim's return is a welcome addition to the world of healthcare blogging, the mysterious disappearance of the funniest pharma parody site of all time, Pharma Giles, is still a mystery...
