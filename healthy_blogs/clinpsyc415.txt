I just completed watching the Panorama investigation that aired yesterday on BBC. I ever so highly recommend it. You can check it out here. This lifts the curtains on the usual sets of lies, and does an excellent job of exposing how allegedly independent researchers served as puppets for GlaxoSmithKline. I will write more about it soon. Nice to see some good investigative journalism.
