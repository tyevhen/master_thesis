So I'm walking with Max and we pass a little office with a little sign, a woman's name, some initials, and below that "Body-Centered Psychotherapy." Huh? What does that mean? It's about the psyche, not the body, unless, I guess it's a treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or maybe something body-related in the delusional realm? Somehow, I don't think so. Seems it googles to it's own flavor of mental healthdom, but no psychiatrists. Max was game.
