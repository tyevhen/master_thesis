Testosterone is an interesting topic because the jury is still out on whether it is harmful, helpful or has no effect on men with Kennedy’s Disease (SBMA). Many researchers familiar with Kennedy’s Disease do not recommend testosterone supplements or injections because it is an unknown factor.

In a 2011 blog article, I discussed testosterone. Little has changed three years later as to knowing its impact on the disease. Yet, it is widely accepted that the binding of testosterone to the defective androgen receptor in a person with Kennedy’s Disease is what brings on many of the symptoms. The following quote is from the KDA website:

“
The androgen receptor is a protein that resides inside the nerve cell. Many cells have the androgen receptor protein, but motor neurons have more than most. The binding of testosterone to an androgen receptor somehow causes the onset of the disease. Men are generally affected by KD because they have much higher levels of testosterone than women.”

Healthline has a good page on the effect of testosterone on the human body. It explains how it affects a male in sixteen areas of the body.

“Testosterone is an important male hormone. A male begins to produce testosterone as early as seven weeks after conception. Testosterone levels rise during puberty, peak during the late teen years, and then level off. After age 30 or so, it’s normal for a man’s testosterone levels to decrease slightly every year.”

“Testosterone levels affect everything in men from the reproductive system and sexuality to muscle mass and bone density. It also plays a role in certain behaviors.”
