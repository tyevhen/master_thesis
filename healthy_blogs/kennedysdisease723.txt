21st Century Cures
After more than two years of bi-partisan effort, a final version of 21st Century Cures legislation (H.R. 34) passed in both the House and the Senate. You will recall that in July 2015, the House passed an earlier version of the bill (H.R. 6) and that multiple individual provisions similar to those in Cures also moved along in the Senate committee over the course of the year. The version of Cures passed by Congress this week represents a larger and more comprehensive bill that evolved over months as the House and Senate worked together. The next step is for the bill to be signed into law, which should happen quickly as President Obama has voiced strong support for the legislation.
21st Century Cures includes many provisions that impact the discovery, development and delivery of treatments and cures for disorders under MDA's umbrella, and that impact access to services including:

Increased biomedical research funding;
Increased support for and modernization of regulatory review and oversight;
Incentives for rare disease drug development;
Advancing targeted therapies (S. 2030);
Increased incorporation of the patient voice in drug development; and
Six-month delay in implementing planned cuts for complex rehabilitative technology.
