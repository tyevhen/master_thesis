I was invited to Caroline's on Easter Day for wine, appetizers, and an egg hunt. It was a lovely event, a bit chilly, but they had an outdoor fireplace going. So I'm talking to Caroline--whom I haven't seen in months (people here kind of hibernate in their caves during the winter)--- and she starts telling another person about Shrink Rap! She was even quoting different posts. Wow! I didn't remember that I'd ever told Caroline about the blog, I found myself vaguely embarrassed, but ultimately quite flattered.

Caroline Reads the Blog!!!
