It's been all over the news that the psychiatrist who allegedly treated the alleged Aurora shooter had been disciplined by her state medical board for an infraction that occurred over a decade ago.  Is that relevant to this case?  I wrote my thoughts about this in an article for Clinical Psychiatry News.  If you're interested, please surf over there and read The Deep Dark Past of Dr. Lynn Fenton.   And while you're there, if you haven't already checked it out, read Clink's thoughts on Why the Mental Health Community Must Show Restraint.

On a cheerier note, I received the proofs yesterday for the paperback edition of Home Inspection.  There are a few issues, but the paperback should be available shortly.  And Double Billing is in the works.  If you've read it, please leave a review on Amazon.  And the Kindle edition is available for $2.99.  I'm taking Roy's advice and going with the cheapest price for now.
