Time flies whether you are having fun or not.  In a couple of days it will have been five months since I started taking dutasteride.  As promised, this is my monthly update.

The best way I can explain the journey so far is …
Months 1-3: 
Flying high and feeling great … better than I have felt in a several years. 
I continued to gain strength and add exercises/reps.  It felt like a miracle.
Energy was very good and level.  No fluctuations.
No side effects.
Months 4-5: 
The high is gone, but the effects are still positive.  I now consider myself mortal again.
No longer able to leap tall buildings with a single bound.
My strength remains good … perhaps a gain of one to two years from where I was in January.
I had to back off slightly on the light-day exercises. 
I believe I just pushed myself too hard and went to far.
After backing off, everything was much better.
My energy is still good and fairly constant.
I do not seem to have the constant high, but it is stable with only an occasional small waiver for a day.
No apparent side effects.
The late May scare when I had overdone is long behind me and I am a little smarter (at least I hope so) and listening to my body again.
