Ever since I switched to the "new and improved" Blogger, my hits have been way down. This seems to be largely because this site no longer appears in results for Google searches nor in Google blog searches that used to garner me plenty of hits.

I even more greatly appreciate the links from various blogs lately, as they have been the only source of traffic for me outside of my regular readers.

Equally as annoying are the blogs that steal my content word for word and then repost it on their sites as if they wrote it. That is called plagiarism and I don't like it. Sarahparkin.com is a great example -- that site shows all of my posts as well as posts ripped from other blogs word for word without any credit being given to the authors. Even worse, sarahparkin.com now shows up in Google searches and my site does not. Figure that out.
