Roy thinks this was a mistake, that I didn't finish the post, but this was all I had to say. It was a contentious and uncomfortable session and by the end, I wanted to go home. Ah, I was at home! These people are not nice, and who would want to pay for this kind of confrontation, unleashed emotion, and discomfort. Paul is a handful, and now we hear his fantasies about a life together with Adele, and that he's watching her building (for an hour after the last session!) and knows she doesn't have any patients after him, so at 6 o'clock at night, she should be happy to extend his session. It's like Jesse, only at least we can excuse Jesse's immaturity as adolescence. And why is everyone in this show a stalker? I did not think that Adele did as a good a job as before: she openly sneared at Paul in the beginning, and she angrily confronted him with his refusal to look at the important things and his rigidity.

Just a hint: name calling makes people defensive. They are more likely to consider your thoughts if you couch them in kind terms or universal phenomena that make them easier to swallow: "it's difficult to look at your own weaknesses"..."there are parts of your style that serve you very well..."

Ok, Roy won, I wrote more.
