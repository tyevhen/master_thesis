It's really late but I just had to put up a quick post about this. You can title this "Judge Rules Inmates Have Right To Bear Arms". A Maryland inmate was recently acquitted of first degree murder after an instruction given as follows:
On Friday, Judge North read a short passage to the jury that included this statement: "A person may arm himself in reasonable anticipation of an attack."
The offense happened in the same facility where an officer was killed last July. Enough said.
