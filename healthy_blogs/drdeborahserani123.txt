There are many reasons why we watch scary movies.

Psychological research finds a strong correlation between the desire to watch suspenseful or scary entertainment and the viewerâ€™s high need for physical arousal or excitement. So some of us watch scary films for the thrill of it. It's safe, so to speak, because we are watching it, not living it. The great master of horror, Alfred Hitchcock said, "People like to be scared when they feel safe."

Others may watch horror movies to root for old-fashioned virtues of morality and justice. Or to problem solve, by figuring out ways to escape terror. Or to revisit a trauma without having to relive it in real time. Then there are those who might watch to release their own aggressive or violent wishes in a more socially approachable way. By just watching it.

Research at King's College in London said that the key to a great scary movie is the balance between suspense and gore. If little is shown on screen it allows one's mind to invent the fright. According to the researchers, JAWS was the perfect scary movie because, "Steven Spielberg reached the optimum level perfectly allowing the viewer to see just enough blood to be scared of the Great White Shark, but not so much that it repulsed us."
Yeah, I agree. "Jaws" is at the top of my scariest movies list - and I haven't been in the ocean since seeing it in 1975.

So in the spirit of Halloween, what is your favorite scary movie?
