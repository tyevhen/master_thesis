Better mental health care and ease of access :
We need to find ways to make life less difficult for people who struggle with mental illness. No one should have to choose between needed medicine and food or shelter. We all deserve to have our basic needs met with respect and acceptance. Mental illness is not the person's fault any more than cancer or heart disease is. This is hard for most of us to understand. What we see of mental illness is just the tip of the iceberg.
Many more people suffer silently. We can't see mental illness, it comes to our attention when it is not treated effectively. Sometimes that makes us uncomfortable, and forces us to look at the results of our personal priorities. Mental health care and suicide prevention should be obvious public health goals. Medicines are getting better and better at keeping depression controlled, but the enjoyment and satisfaction of everyday life is more than just "getting by" emotionally. Suicide means ending your life on purpose. Suicide prevention means making living look better than dying.
Lots of people with depression, and other mental health problems, find new lives with the right mental health care. Others don't have the same opportunities. Suicide looks like the best or only choice for them. We can't stop all of the hardships of their lives, but suicide prevention has to include making better mental health care more available.

Commonly question about Suicide Prevention Through Better Mental Health Care
Question :
What should i do about my clinical depression? im ready to give up...?
what can i do? ive done everything. ive been hospitalized in 2 mental institutes for suicide prevention. taken so many meds i cant even remember the names, been through so much therapy, and i dont feel better than i did since day 1. i dont want to be hospitalized EVER again, and i dont want to live like this any longer... i heard smoking weed helps im about to try that. is there anything i can do? they said its all chemical for me, since i have good self esteem and dont really have social problems or problems at school. im just so tired and so stressed idk why im so suicidal.
please help me :(
Answer :
Alright, I have been in a similar situation with you so I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now. Hospital is a very stressful place but at the same time, it is best to go there because it s going to keep you safe. I can tell that you are very distressed at the moment and I know that suicide seems like it makes so much easier but it s not. Over the past few months I have been in and out of hospital and have taken so many overdoses that it will most likely cause problems in my later years. But I will tell you this, life ******* sucks. It sucks quite a bit, but there is always something to keep things going in life. Something to distract you. Keep holding on to that, I know its hard, its really hard but its worth a lot for you. There *must* be a small voice in your head that knows that suicide isn t the right thing. From experience, my attempts have caused more havoc in my life than it has before. So I beg you not to do it. It s ruined my relationships with people, I have lost friends and nearly my boyfriend over it. So please don t do it, it will only make things worse.

I know you said you don t want to go to hospital but I do have a recommendation for you. You probably don t live in Canada but my psychiatrist recommended this site for me because you can talk to someone online.

www.youthinbc.com (Give it a try, seriously)
Just type in Vancouver for the city. They wont call 911 on you and get them to escort you to the hospital. Give that a try. And smoking weed when you re depressed is going to get you addicted to that stuff! It helps but you ll be hooked.

Good luck :)
Question :
I use an anonymous name on here is that okay?
I just got a very weird reply to a question about a disorder my sister-in-law may have. I am worried someone may have known who I am on this Yahoo as I use "Adamsman" instead of my real name. If I close my Yahoo account will all my Yahoo Questions disappear? I have asked many mental health questions where I don t use my name or anyone else s but they are serious mental health questions about anxiety disorders, mood disorders, alcoholism, suicide prevention, etc... I am worried this person who replied to my question on Borderline Personality Disorder is afraid I am someone I am not but I don;t want to post my real name on here and would rather close the account. So can I erase all 300+ questions I have asked on Yahoo in the past 4 months by closing this email account or do they stay in cyber world forever?
Also, how do I contact the person on Yahoo who wrote back an answer where I wasn t sure if they were describing the disorder I asked about "Borderline Personality Disorder" or if they were the sister-in-law Julia using a fake account? I thought this was a safe place to ask questions since I only use this email for politics and mental health questions and the email address is only used for that as well. I don;t ask the questions out of any anger but just in trying to better understand myself as I am an anxious person who has accidental annoyed others before and as a kid hurt people s feelings through gossip and alienation my mother accidentally did with her anxiety.
Answer :
As you have a screen name different from your real name no one knows your real name and you are effectively anonymous.
