According to a systematic review (Pharmacological Treatment of Insomnia in Alcohol Recovery: A Systematic Review) published in Alcohol and Alcoholism journal, there are several drugs that can be used for insomnia or lack of sleep seen in patients who gave up alcohol. In most patients, these sleep problems can go on for months.

Usually chronic alcohol dependence patients need to be detoxified before stopping alcohol. It is because alcohol changes the person's brain chemistry and sudden alcohol withdrawal can cause severe reaction that can even kill the person. Therefore, doctors give certain drugs to allow the brain to adjust to sudden withdrawal of alcohol. 

However, after taking off these detox drugs (Usually Librium) some patients complain insomnia for a prolonged period and it can cause treatment failure (Returning to take alcohol).

The treatment of insomnia in alcoholic patients has been poorly studied by doctors. In addition, treating sleep problems in alcohol recovery phase is complicated by the fact that some of the most commonly used medications to treat sleep disturbance are thought to have a high abuse potential e.g Ambien, Benzodiazepines (Vallium).

Above study has identified some drugs that can be used for this condition. They are

1. Trazadone (Desyrel)
2. Gabapentine (Neurontin)
3. Lormetazepam (Noctamid)

However, contrary to popular belief Ambien and other Z drugs are not effective in this condition.
