Our thanks to Healthskills who passed along the Kreativ Blogger Award to us!

I've been reading your blog for a while - this is a great post, as is the previous one on DSM v.

I've passed on the Kreative Blogging award to you, as I love to read your site.
Congratulations!

Head to http://healthskills.wordpress.com to see what I wrote - basically you list 6 things you love, then nominate six blogs for the award. It's fun, and creates some great links you might never have made before!

Six things I love? Can I do this for my co-bloggers?
And six blogs? How do I choose? I read Fat Doctor faithfully, sometimes I check on FooFoo5, and often I see what KevinMD is blogging about. I sometime check The Last Psychiatrist but he often annoys me. There's the Well blog over at the NYTimes, but I don't think Tara Parker Pope is looking for awards from me. And I often check out the blogs of some of our commenters, by all means keep leaving links-- I hate to mention one without mentioning them all....

ClinkShrink and Roy, by all means chime in.
