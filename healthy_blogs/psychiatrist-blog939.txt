I'm trying to figure out the details of an organizational Facebook Page. Somehow, I made two from the same account, and so you can be our Friend on Facebook, or you can be our Fan on Facebook. There's a duck. There's some sideline stuff. There's our feet. I'm hoping I can get Roy to feed his tweets to the Facebook page so that our posts will show up there. I haven't got the kinks out, but please do Friend us and Fan us, especially in this heat! If you look for us on Facebook, we're Shrink Rap, the ones with the feets.

Thanks for being our friend!
