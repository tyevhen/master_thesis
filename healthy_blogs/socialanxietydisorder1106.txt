It can be very difficult when living with an alcoholic. You never know what to expect from one moment to the next. If you are married to an alcoholic then you need to set boundaries for your personal self. You NEED to take care of you now. You do not have to allow the alcoholics verbal abuses to take control of your emotions another minute longer!
We've all heard the saying "sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me". Well, this is pretty much what it's like when living with a verbally abusive alcoholic. Learn to not let "the names" hurt you by emotionally detaching. You should never allow the alcoholic behavior control how you will behave because by doing this it shows that you are controlled by alcoholism just as much as the alcoholic is.
Love the Alcoholic But Detach From the Alcoholism
Loving an alcoholic is different then loving the behaviors of alcoholism. For instance, the wife of an alcoholic husband still has duties as his wife, therefore as difficult as it may seem sometimes we still need to cook our husband's dinner, whether they are alcoholic or not. But this does not mean to serve alcohol with dinner or to sit down with and interact with the alcoholic as they start to drink.
Sitting down with and interacting with your loved one as they drink themselves to oblivion is enabling them because it shows him or her that you are accepting their drinking behavior. A husband or wife should never sit down with, argue and fuss with, scream and holler at, or chitchat with a drinking alcoholic. This only confirms in the alcoholic that their drinking and abusive behavior is acceptable.
A wife or husband needs to be discerning and know when to show a support of love to the alcoholic and when they should emotionally detach. To know the difference ask yourself this question:Is there anything that I am doing that would help my husband/wife to drink? TIP: Once your spouse starts drinking for the day, just about anything you do or say can be misconstrued or manipulated by the alcoholic so it is best NOT to interact with them.

Answer :
Seriously? This is crazy!!!! I think that you and your mom should leave, like yesterday! Your mom needs help. You can be taken by family services if they know about the abuse, but you shouldn t have to go into foster care, it s bad. Is there a relative in another state you can go to? Your local department of social services could help you. Breaks my heart.
