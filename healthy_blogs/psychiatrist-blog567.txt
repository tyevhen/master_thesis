I just wrote a post over on Clinical Psychiatry News about the experimental use of ketamine (aka, rave drug "Special K") for instant relief of depression and suicidal ideation.

Please go over there to read it (link above), and feel free to comment there (sorry, registration is required but it's free) or here. I'd like to hear about providers who have used ketamine for their patients and from people who themselves have used it for depression.


Edit: find a list of clinical trials using ketamine for depression on clinicaltrials.gov.
