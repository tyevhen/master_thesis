Those of us living with Kennedy's Disease have to always be careful that we do not associate (blame) every unusual symptom or health issue on the disease. If it is not listed in the common symptoms for Kennedy's Disease, make certain you check with your GP and neurologist. Just because we have Kennedy's Disease does not mean we are immune to all other health disorders. It is better to play it safe and discuss anything unusual with your doctor.

Examples: A man constantly complained about chest pain and related it to Kennedy's Disease, but later found out he had a heart condition. Another man continually had neck pain and related it to Kennedy's Disease. He finally discussed it with his doctor and after some testing found out it was a pinched nerve.

The key is to have a good open relationship with your neurologist and GP. Sharing general health issues and questions with both doctors will ensure that no medical condition is overlooked or misdiagnosed.
