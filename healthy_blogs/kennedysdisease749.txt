A reader wrote and mentioned MedScape updated the information on Kennedy's Disease last June. I just read through the multi-page report. It is more current and fairly easy to understand. This would be a good recommendation for your doctor should he/she not be familiar with the condition. To read the entire report, you will need to register (free).
