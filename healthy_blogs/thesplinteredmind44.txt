My latest blog about being an ADHD dad at ADDitude Magazine went up a few weeks ago. In it I wrote about how much trouble blurting things almost got me into at a school conference. Oh, it's just too embarrassing to write about again. You can read all about the Case of the Sudden Wedding Ring and how eloquent I sound with a foot in my mouth over at the Family Guy.

(Just FYI. I choose titles for my blogs, but the editor always come up with his own titles. So, to avoid an inverse black hole of SEO chicanery, I'll be referring to the blogs over at ADDitude Magazine by my titles. You know, just in case you were confused or something. Clear? No? kthxbye!)
