I received an email today from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). Many times over the years I have heard from people that believe they have Kennedy's Disease, but are afraid to have the genetic test. They are concerned that the results of the test would be made available to their insurance company (or others). For this reason, many families have been left hanging ... wondering whether the father has Kennedy's Disease. The major issue is that their insurance company might raise their premiums or they could not change insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.

If this has been, or still is, a concern for yours, please consider contacting Mary Dunkle today at NORD. We need this issue brought forward and I am pleased to see the NY Times take on this subject. I hope that some good will come from this article.


 



NY Times Looking for Patients to Interview

TO: NORD Member Organizations

Re: New York Times article regarding genetic testing and medical records

The New York Times has contacted NORD for assistance in identifying patients to interview for a story on medical privacy and, specifically, what should be done when patients say they don't want results from genetic tests in their medical records. The AMA says that doctors can keep a separate medical record without such data but, if they send it on to insurers, they will need to note that genetic information has been withheld which, of course, is a red flag.

The Times is looking for patients or family members to interview who have faced these issues. If any of your members would be interested in being interviewed, please have them write to mdunkle@rarediseases.org with a very brief (one or two paragraphs) description of their experience. The story will be written within the next few days so it would be important to reply soon.
