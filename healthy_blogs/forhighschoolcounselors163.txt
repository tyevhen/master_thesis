Tonight was our very first peer helper chat on Twitter. It was my privilege to co-moderate the chat with my colleague Roselind Bogner, a peer educator and trainer with the National Association of Peer Program Professionals.  If you missed the chat, please view the transcript on Storify.  Also, follow us on Twitter at #peerprograms.
