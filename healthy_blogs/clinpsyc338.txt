You may recall the FDA's meeting on SSRI's and suicide. You can now access the presentations of the speakers, including David Healy, Robert Gibbons, Sara Bostock, Vera Sharav, Robert Valuck, and many more.

Transcripts of the meeting (part 1 and part 2) are also available. Kudos to the FDA for their willingness to post all this material online.
