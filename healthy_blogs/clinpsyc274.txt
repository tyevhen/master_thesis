Lawsuits against AstraZeneca regarding its alleged failure to disclose the risks (like diabetes) of its drug quetiapine (Seroquel) are on the rise. Apparently, more than 350 cases were filed in Delaware state court in April. I'm not entirely clear if the latest lawsuits also allege off-label marketing, which is apparently becoming something of a calling card for AZ these days. Off-label marketing has been part of other Seroquel legal actions. No wonder, as it appears that Seroquel is being investigated as a treatment for, well, everything, as I've pointed out previously (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
