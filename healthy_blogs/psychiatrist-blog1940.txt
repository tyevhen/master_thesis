I know it's a crazy (woops) idea, but I have to get it out of my system. What do readers think of a podcast from Dinah, Clink and me? I'm thinking of kinda of a free-wheeling (with some structure, I guess) discussion about, well, some of the same types of things we blog about?

Would anyone listen (I know, why listen to our blather?). What do you all think?
