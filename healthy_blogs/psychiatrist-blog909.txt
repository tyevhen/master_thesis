Here at Shrink Rap, we get a pretty steady flow of email from book publicists, publishers, and other media sources looking to get some attention for their books, blogs, TV programs, conferences, and causes. Suddenly, we're faced with questions from our own publisher about where our book should be promoted, do we have any personal media contacts, where should review copies go? Clink and Roy did their forms, and I've obsessed. If you've hit us up for publicity and your name had CBS, or Simon & Schuster, or some major publication anywhere near your name, you made it to my list. Clink, bless her, listed the name of a forensic psychiatry journal and moved on. I'm thinking Slate, Psychology Today (Roy put that on his list, too), Huffington Post.... so now that I've spent the morning looking up contact information for the alumni magazines at Clink's college and med school (and mine, and Roy's), I thought I'd do what I always do when I want to make sure I didn't miss anything obvious: ask you.

Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work--
Our one-sentence description reads:
Three psychiatrists give a candid and understandable insiders' view of the modern practice of psychiatry.

So where do you think we should suggest the publisher should market our book? And if you happen to be the book editor for the LA Times, would you please send us your contact info?

This has gotta be the weirdest book writing process ever.
