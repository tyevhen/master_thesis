We are still on our search for residential treatment for Teddy since his last threatening behavior. We believe it was serious enough that we cannot feel safe with him here and we don't think the other kids feel safe either.

We are on a waiting list for one place. Right Turn is helping me find resources in our new area. We have been here 1 week. I had no idea how much running around I'd have to do this week to get all the kids, hubby and I registered at all our different "stuff". UGH. Anyway, Right Turn has a call into Magellan for me. they are going to call my cell and discuss what is going on and what needs to happen to have them pay.  Giving up parental rights is not a choice as far as we are concerned. I know at times that is what Nebraska has parents do. I think it is wrong and abusive to not only the kids but to the parents and siblings. For some families it has been the only way they could get their kids help. I will fight that to the top

His anger continues at a far higher level. At 5'10" I can no longer feel safe when he rages.  Our new house set up is helpful as he has a room, bathroom and the family room all downstairs. Is that good for attachment? NO. If he were younger and we were working on that I would not do that. At this point we are focused on this one last year and trying to prepare him for adulthood. I do not know if he will be able to hold down a job as an adult. Right Way is helping us seek services that will help with that as well.

So much.

Never, never, never quit.
