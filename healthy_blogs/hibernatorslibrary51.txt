Doesn't she look pissed?
This was a pretty good week for me, though not so much for my Hero. I spent a fortune getting her fixed on Thursday. She was sent home wearing an Elizabethan collar, which made her look really cute and forlorn in the kennel, but as soon as she was out she started freaking out and running around the room backwards. Then she kept trying to drink some water, but couldn't get at it. Within a half hour of returning home, I took the darned thing off. Now, she and I are sitting on the bed in the spare bedroom, and she's happily purring away. So things have gotten a bit better. 

This week I was a little more active than I've been since the election. I managed to get two reviews published - Chi's Sweet Home and Gods Behaving Badly - as well as the final Nonfiction November post. 

I finished reading this week's issue of The Week, Neurotribes by Steve Silberman, and The Righteous Mind, by Jonathan Haidt. Reviews on their way. 


I acquired Packing for Mars, which I'm listening to as part of a "quirky nonfiction" challenge on LibraryThing. 


I'm currently listening to The Stand, by Stephen King and Packing for Mars by Mary Roach. I'm also listening to a couple lectures a week of Reading Biblical Literature, to help prepare for next year's cover-to-cover Bible reading. The Stand will likely take me a long time since it's so very long! I'm reading In the Woods, by Tana French for my RL bookclub, and North and South on my Serial Reader app.
