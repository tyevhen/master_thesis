Go for it, I know we have many readers who oppose forced treatment.

  In "Opposing View: Forced Care Doesn't Work"  by Joseph A. Rogers in  USA Today discusses the usefulness of forced treatment.  While some would contend that people who are sick may become dangerous, lack insight, or be so sick they can't see themselves as ill, Rogers contends that by forcing people into treatment, they get turned off on the idea of getting care and that a better solution to the problem is to make psychiatric care something patients want to get.    Rogers writes:

Studies have shown that what works is not force but access to effective services. We don't need to change the laws to make it easier to lock people up; existing laws provide for that when warranted. Instead, we need to create and fund effective community-based mental health services that would make it attractive for people to come in and receive care, and that would support them in their recovery.


I don't know if better access to good care is the whole answer, but it's not a bad place to start.
