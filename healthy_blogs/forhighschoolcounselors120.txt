Hello, my name is Cindy and I am a formaholic!  

Whether electronic or traditional, I love forms of all kinds and I use them in various ways. For me forms keep me organized, help me keep accurate records, provide information to parents and students, assist in documenting meetings, and allow me to make referrals.  Because I have been a school counselor since (cough) 2000, I have accumulated and created lots of documents.  If you love forms as much as me, you will LOVE this blog post!!  Below, you will see original forms that I have created and borrowed from other schools and school counselors. In all, there are over 1000 forms available in this post. So, have fun modifying for your own use!
