The fifteenth was the eleventh month anniversary of taking dutasteride. I continue to feel good and am having no known side effects. As I mentioned in an earlier post, my doctor believes I should continue taking the medication.

The biggest change this last month was the reduction in my long exercise routine.  I was no longer enjoying it as much as before (a little bored). This last month I averaged 97 minutes for my long exercises; down from 120 minutes. I have seen no change in strength because of the reduction, but I am enjoying the program much more again. I am looking forward to exercising again and when I finish I feel good about it. My short routine continues to be 15-20 minutes on the in-between days.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I came down with some kind of bug (cough, chills, weakness and loss of appetite). I was over it in about five days, but a slight weakness remained for another week or so. It was especially noticeable in the legs. It felt good to wake up one morning and not notice the weakness.

Results to Date
So, after eleven months, I believe I am no weaker than I was a year ago and maybe even a little stronger. Or, playing the role of the contrarian, if I am weaker, it is not noticeable (and that is fine with me).

After I write my one year anniversary review next month, I plan on only writing quarterly dutasteride reviews or if there are any significant changes.

NIH Exercise Trial
I am also hoping that the NIH clinical trial on exercise is completed this year and they have some positive news on what exercises are the most appropriate and beneficial for anyone living with Kennedyâ€™s Disease. I am not saying I will change my routine, but if there is a significant advantage to making a change I am open to suggestions.
