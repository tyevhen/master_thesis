Welcome to May, Mental Health Awareness month! I am going to have a very ill-advertised blog hop this month, so if you read any books that have a mental illness theme let me know, and I'll point people to your review! At the very least, I hope to get a few books reviewed. 

Last month I totally disappeared off the blogging universe because at first I was studying hard for my EMT certification exam (I passed!), and then I was too burned out to start blogging once I'd stopped. Besides, I've been applying to jobs like crazy lately, and that is a full-time job all by itself! I hope all of you have been well during my absence. I'll be around on your blogs soon. :)
