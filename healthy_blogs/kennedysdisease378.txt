Since I will be traveling Thursday, today’s post will be my Thanksgiving message.

I have so much to be thankful for and I hope most of you will be counting your blessings come Thursday.



I have said it many times, but we live in a great country. Yes, it is not perfect, and, yes, things could always be better, but, in all of my travels, I have found the USA to be the most perfect – “imperfect” country.

On a more personal level, I am very grateful for my family, neighbors, friends and critters. Yes, our three strays are an important part of our lives because they bring us much joy. Also, I am still finding it hard to believe that I am going to be a great-grandfather in two months. Who ever thought that could happen at the ripe old age of 29.

I am thankful for my overall health because things could be far worse than just having to live with Kennedy’s Disease. It seems my evening prayers always have a long line of prayer requests for those less fortunate in regards to their health. I have said it many times, things could always be worse.

And, most importantly, I cannot imagine life without my wonderful wife. She needs to be nominated for sainthood. My wife never envisioned having to share our life with Kennedy’s Disease. This disease has taken a toll on me, on our relationship, on my wife’s freedom and on our retirement plans. Yet, like the Eveready Bunny, she just keeps going and going. She is a true blessing.

I also need to say thanks to all of you who read my articles and put up with the ranting of a mad blogger. The reason I continue to write is because of your support.


Be safe this holiday season and have a
HAPPY THANKSGIVING
