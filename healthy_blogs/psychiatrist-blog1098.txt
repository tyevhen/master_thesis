This is a post for ClinkShrink, but she's so busy lately that I thought I'd stick it up.

So in Maryland, to the best of my knowledge (and I could be wrong) we have this idea that if someone is criminally insane and needs hospitalization, they should probably stay in the hospital. I'm not aware that forensic facilities take people on field trips. Like I said, I could be wrong, I don't treat inpatients and I don't work with designated forensic patients. The piece below caught my attention, it's from The Seattle Times:

On Thursday, Phillip Arnold Paul, who had been committed after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the slaying of an elderly woman, disappeared during a field trip to the Spokane County Interstate Fair with 30 other Eastern State Hospital patients and 11 staff members. The escape prompted an extensive manhunt that ended Sunday when Paul, 47, surrendered to authorities near Goldendale, Klickitat County, about 180 miles from the fair.
It was the second time that Paul had escaped from state custody.

The photo, by the way, is of a cow at the Maryland State Fair, and has nothing to do with the story of the escapee from the state hospital in Spokane. I just like cows.
