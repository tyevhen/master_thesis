So last night, I went to "the movies." Actually, it was to a film with discussion, sponsored by The Baltimore-Washington Psychoanalytic Institute. The movie was a Russian film called The Return, about two teenage boys who venture off with a cold, oppressive father who has returned after a mysterious 12-year absence (--prison camp, maybe?). The movie was horribly depressing and to add to the somber, miserable feel it left, the discussant mentioned that one of the teenage actors died in a boating accident shortly before the release of the film-- my misery couldn't even be contained with "it's just a movie." I woke up still haunted.

Is it time to go back to work yet?
