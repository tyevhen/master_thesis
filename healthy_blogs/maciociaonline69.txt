The draconian European Directive on herbal medicines is coming into force very soon (at the end of April). This will stop the sale of herbal remedies. We must all make our voice heard to stop this infringement of our freedoms that is being pushed by the European Union under the influence of pharmaceutical multinationals. Please support the Alliance for Natural Health, the Benefyt Foundation and the European Herbal Practitioners Alliance. Please watch the video http://www.savenaturalhealth.eu/ and sign the petition.
