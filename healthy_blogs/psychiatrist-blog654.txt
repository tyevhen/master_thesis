Erin Simon had NYC's Marie Nails In Soho paint her nails like a variety of anti-depressants! (Thanks, Heather Sparks!)

I don't think the white pinky nail is for Zoloft.

You know this could be an interesting placebo.  Just suck on the finger that's got the meds you need. Maybe put Viagra on the ring finger.

Seems symbolic since some people chew their nails when anxious or depressed.

Not being able to grow your own long, strong nails and feeling you have to wear fake ones *is* depressing. Symbolic of both cause and remedy.

I think I know why she's obsessed with anti-depressants. With nails that long, she'd have a hard time, uh, making the most of her natural dopamine highs, if you know what I mean. Wink wink, nudge nudge. Ouch.

I think this lady is depressed because of the way her hands look. Chicken, egg?

i suppose this is supposed to be "cute" or "wacky," but i find it highly offensive.  sorry.  there's nothing delightful about having one's quality of life (or some semblance of going through the motions of life, anyway) dependant on those horrible pills.

I don't know.  It takes a quite a few horrible pills to make me into a functioning member of society and I've made earrings out of most of them.  Sometimes it's better to laugh than cry.

You go Jamie Sue.... i don't know why hater's even bother to comment.... it's entertainment... nothing more, nothing less. for anyone to feel "offended" is their issue. Maybe they need to check out the pill selection on her left hand middle finger....... # yaknowhatimean
