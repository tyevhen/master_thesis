Due to a lot of hits on a post from March over the past few days, I am providing a link to it since it is apparently becoming a hot commodity. The post is about Zyprexa, and the email of one Lilly employee in which different ways to suppress the study's results were discussed. Naughty. Very naughty.

And Lilly is painting David Egilman as the bad guy for his role in disseminating the now-infamous Zyprexa documents? Gimme a friggin' break! Oh, and did I mention the aforementioned post is based on one of those documents?
