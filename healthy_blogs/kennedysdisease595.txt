Rules were always frustrating for me when I was young. I usually looked for ways to get around the rules. Sometimes I was successful and other times I failed. But it never stopped me from trying. As I have matured, rules tend to make me ponder something, i.e., consider their meaning when it applies to my life. 

My daughter posted this on her Facebook page yesterday. I’ve read similar ‘words of wisdom’, but this one is short, concise and on target. 



Yes, living with Kennedy’s Disease is a physical phenomenon. It is also a mental and emotional issue. Frustration, guilt, anger, fear and embarrassment are all part of the process leading toward acceptance. And, these ‘rules’ are about living a life filled with peace and happiness. 


Live in the present
Take no thought of what others think
Stop comparing what was to what is
Realize that you are responsible for your own happiness
And, most importantly, living with Kennedy’s Disease is not a death sentence. It is a new and different way of living a fulfilling and happy life.
