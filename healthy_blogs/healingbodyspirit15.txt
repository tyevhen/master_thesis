Fish oil is the number one supplement "The Omega 3 Connection " recommends. I like Barlean's liquid lemon swirl. It tastes like lemon pie. 3 tablespoons a day.

Next, I like probiotics and I also like magnesium.
If you are not on antidepressants you may want to check out Zembrin.
Consult a Naturopath or D.O for natural remedies.
Google the candida questionnaire to see if you have candida. Neem pills help get rid of candida...it is a major player in chronic fatigue and also depression, anxiety and insomnia.

Write down what you are grateful for.
Do things for others.
