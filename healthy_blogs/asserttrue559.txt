I recently tweeted a prediction: In five years, people will surely take NSAIDs daily for cancer prophylaxis, as surely as people take aspirin now for heart-disease prophylaxis.

The evidence is increasingly clear that common over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen inhibit, and/or prevent, cancer growth. 

As K. Wakabayash says in Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2000;1(2):97-113, "There is abundant epidemiological and experimental evidence that NSAIDs can inhibit tumour development in a number of organs and such drugs have given positive results in human intervention studies."

The literature on NSAIDs and cancer is increasingly vast. I won't try to summarize it here. I do recommend you investigate it yourself, and do what I do: take some ibuprofen daily.
