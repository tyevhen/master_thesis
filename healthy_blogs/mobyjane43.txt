What psychology should have been doing all this time is the discipline of depression rather than the illness of depression. By that I mean that we can't insure we won't ever be hit by depression. However, we can insure, by educating ourselves, that when we do get hit, we don't have to become ill with depression. 

We can use methods easily and immediately available to us; to walk away from depression and get on with our day in a more productive way than concentrating on our suffering. Depression grows with your concentration upon it. How do you not concentrate on it? That takes educated discipline. A. B.Curtiss
