Dear Curtiss
I am easily anxious when I hear my baby crying. Easily get distracted and feeling angry. I do not know how I can fix this.

Please help me. F. K.

Dear F. K.

You must remember than all anger is fear turned outward. You are not really angry at your baby. You are projecting your inward fear, your repressed fear upon your baby. You can fix this by getting in touch with your repressed fear and releasing it, letting it finish. Again, read chapter 10 in Depression is a Choice. A. B. Curtiss
