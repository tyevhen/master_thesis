So the first thing that showed up on my Twitter feed this morning was a picture of the winning lottery ticket. No, it wasn't any of our Shrink Rappers and it wasn't anybody I know personally. I can tell you that I would definitely not be tweeting my win to the entire world. Somebody is going to live to regret that.
