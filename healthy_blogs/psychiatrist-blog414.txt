 




Our blogger friend, Steve who writes on Thought Broadcast, was on Talk of the Nation yesterday to discuss trends in psychiatric treatment.  If you didn't get a chance to listen, I'm taking the liberty of embedding the interview here.  Steve did a great job!

Okay, Steve, time to get off Facebook and write another blog post, it's been a while!
