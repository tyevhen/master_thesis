Vistagra is a medication prescribed for male erectile dysfunction. Vistagra does this by inhibiting an enzyme called PGE5 or phosphodiesterase 5. By way of this inhibition it increases the Nitrous oxide level inside the penile vascular smooth muscles. This causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and penile erection. But this all happens when there is a proper emotional background. Therefore, Vistagra cannot erect a penis alone without sexual feelings.
