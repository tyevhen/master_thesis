Don’t Move!!

Stop
Take a Breath. Feel your breath move in and out of your body. Remember to practice your mindful breathing exercises daily! Remember to use deep diaphragmatic/stomach breathing!

Wait! Not Yet.


Observe. What are you thinking? What is going on physically? What are you feeling? What are your Surroundings?
Pull Back and Put in Perspective. Is it out of my control? Is this a fact or just my perception? What would others say or do? What are my automatic negative thoughts or distortions? Is this in my best interest? What is the overall picture?
You’re Ready!




Go With and Practice What Works! Journal, continue with your mindful breathing exercise, get out of bed, go to the store, make that phone call, talk to that person, use your daily thought changing tools, challenge your thoughts etc.
