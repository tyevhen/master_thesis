Somewhere on the Net my article on claustrophobia appeared and generated this comment. The excerpt from my book Depression is a Choice about my "total immersion" in a claustrophobic episode is also on my blog on Sunday, June 20,2010.

Here is the comment:

Oh my goodness! I never guessed that claustrophobic individuals basically follow the same pattern. Being claustrophobic myself, I must get an aisle seat on my air travels otherwise I undergo a journey of torture. On a recent six hour air trip, I painfully stood for over four hours when I couldn't get an aisle seat. I tried resting on the cabin crews seat but was sternly sent off by a cabin crew who thought I was being unruly. Honestly, claustrophobia can be psychologically stressful and lonely. Thank you for these wonderful tips. I would surely use your advised procedure as a first step towards curing my self. Keep up the fantastic work you are doing. Kind regards.
