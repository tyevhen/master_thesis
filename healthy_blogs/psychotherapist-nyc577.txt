Entering the field of clinical social work for new clinical social work graduate students still in school and recent grads can be an exciting experience.  It can also be challenging.  For social workers new to the field, having a mentor to help you develop and evolve as a professional can make all the difference in the world.

The NYS Society of Clinical Social Work Mentor Groups
While I was completing my social work graduate degree in 1995, I was fortunate to be a member of the NYS Society of Clinical Social Work (NYSSCSW) where they have a great mentoring program.

New to Clinical Social Work?  You Could Benefit From Joining the NYSSCSW Mentor Group
Back then, my fellow grad students and I learned a lot about the field from a seasoned professional who provided practical and clinical professional advice.  Also, having the support of other grad students and recent grads made all of the difference for me when I first entered the field.

The NYS Society of Clinical Social Work Mentor Group Can Help You Grow & Evolve in the Field
If you're a social work graduate student or a recent MSW grad living in NYC, I recommend that you look into membership in the mentor groups at the NYS Society of Clinical Social Work.

With the rapidly changing world of clinical social work, you owe it to yourself to get the  latest information and the support of a mentor group that will help you to grow and evolve in the field.
