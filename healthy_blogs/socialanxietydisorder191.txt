Answer :
Get some books from the library to read to understand why you do this...or why someone close to you is doing this to understand.

You can burn your esophagus from constant vomiting and you can get electolyte imbalance from vomiting or not enough food intake. Too much or too little potassium in particular can cause heart irregularities. You can get vitamin deficiency diseases like Beriberi (B1), Pellagra (niacin) , scurvy (vitamin C), blindness (vitamin A), maramus (abdominal edema from not enough protein) or rickets (vitamin D).
Question :
What s the difference between the binge-purge type of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa?
Restricting type is pretty obvious, but bulimia and the binge-purge type of anorexia seem to be pretty much the same. Does it have to do with perceptions or motivation to be thin or something else that can t really be seen? Because the external symptoms seem to be pretty much the same.
Answer :
Anorexia is when you sont eat anything or maybe just eat an apple a day but mostly you are starving yourself.

Bulimia is the scientific name for binging and purging. You intake more calories in one sitting then anyone should be eatting in a day, and before it sets you make your self throw up. Usually the person is also abusing laxitives so they can eat as much as they want but get rid of ot before the calories set in. One physical symptom of bulimia is rotting teeth because the stomach acid (from puking) sits on the persons teeth constantly.
Question :
Some help with understanding anorexia nervosa & bulimia nervosa?
I show symptoms of both.
and im not looking for someone telling me to see a doctor.
i just want an educated guess, on whether or not i have either.
im 13, and i weigh 100 pounds. apparently that is average, but for some reason, it just doesnt seem right to me. i dont eat much from about 10 o clock at night to about 4 the next day. i eat maybe 200 calories through that time. this is my routine for monday through friday.
but when i get home from school, and on weekends, i eat food after food after food. i will grab some food, like.. a granola bar, sit down, and practically inhale it. then go for another. i eat excessive amounts of food, but then i realize that i had just ingested about as much calories as people eat in a day in less than five hours. and so, i dont eat anything until the next day.
and this cycle continues.
i read that with bulimia nervosa, you have repeated episodes of binging and purging. does purging include not eating for long periods of time?
Answer :
um....you don t have either...and i can speak from second hand experience. so yeah. you re perfectly normal. though maybe you should do some more research on anorexia and bulimia before you make an assessment...because anorexia is the denial of being way too skinny and bulimia is eating way too much and throwing it all up...
