OK, people want Valentine's Day posts so hear goes.

While everybody was out buying candy and flowers and cards I celebrated Valentine's Day in a slightly different way---I got recertified in CPR.

Yes I know, how romantic!

But think about it---what better way to show someone you care than to be prepared to save their life? According to what our CPR instructor said, most CPR is done on people we know---family members, friends or co-workers.

And yes, re-training is necessary. I was pretty surprised by what they're teaching now. It's changed quite a bit just in the past year. The Red Cross and the American Heart Association have simplified the resuscitation guidelines quite a bit and it's a lot easier to learn now. All those complicated ratios about compressions-to-rescue breaths for the adult, child and infant have been boiled down to one simple rule: 30 compressions to 2 breaths for all. And no more finger sweeping of throats---if someone is an unconscious choking victim you go right to CPR. Of course, much of the emphasis now is on automatic external defibrillator training. If you've never had a chance to try this you really should---it's kind of a hoot. The little machine talks in its little machine voice and tells you what to do step by step. (My little geeky imagination can't help fantasizing about things you could reprogram that machine to say, but I digress.)

And while we're on the topic of hearts, in honor of WoodburyMomAndPop I'd like to remind everyone that February is Women's Heart Health month. Go the the American Heart Association web site here and check out your numbers---the first step to prevention is to know your risk factors.

And Woodbury, you make a great TV talking head. I may eventually get used to seeing you in makeup.
