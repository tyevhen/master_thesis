We lost a good man this week and he will be missed.


Kennedy’s Disease helped claim the life of a friend Easter Sunday. Ron Wiker chose “quality of life” over a life in an extended care facility where he would be bedridden with a feeding tube.

For several years Ron was a member of the KDA board of directors. He actively participated in our chat rooms and conferences as well as raised funds for Kennedy’s Disease research.

More importantly, Ron was a caring person. He was a friend to many. He was always there to provide whatever support was needed. You could count on Ron to have a positive ‘can do’ attitude.

In telling his story, he, like so many of us, wasn’t too concerned as the Kennedy’s Disease symptoms began to show. He just thought he was getting old. You can read Ron’s story by following this link: Ron Wiker

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Ron’s family.
