Even when controlling for the IQ of the mother, children of moms who took anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer Depakote were turning up mentally retarded at a 24% clip. This was much higher than the other medications to which it was compared. This is based on a presentation at the American Academy of Neurology and I've not seen the actual study design and stats, so I can't say this was a great study or not. The fact that they tested IQ of 2-year-old kids, which is fairly unreliable, is probably a weakness, though the authors say they'll follow these kids for a few more years. In any case, it does seem like this could be big news if it is a consistent finding.
