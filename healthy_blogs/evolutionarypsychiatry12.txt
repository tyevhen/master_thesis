I'm still in the midst of reviewing a ton of literature on psychobiotics in time for the APA Annual Meeting in New York City this year. Our Evolutionary Psychiatry talk has been moved from two to three pm on Monday May 5th, as the Vice President will be speaking at 2pm. (Attendees can watch the VP on close caption so you can run to our room to beat the crowds ;-)

Anyway, I've written a layperson's version of my portion of the talk on the Gut and Brain, probiotics, etc. which I just put up over at Psychology Today. My academic talk will have a lot more details about the immunological effects, cytokines, hormonal regulation, etc.

New Music: Cherub: Doses and Mimosas (not exactly my usual style, but catchy, particularly the chorus.)
