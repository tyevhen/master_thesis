I've made a couple updates to the site template today. I'm trying to catch on to the whole Web 2.0 thing and make it much easier for readers to send my posts to sites like Reddit, Digg, etc. Unfortunately, my skills in this area are obviously limited. If someone wants to help out, feel free to email me -- link in the sidebar. Thanks.

Likewise, if anyone has comments about switching to the new version of Blogger, please email me or feel free to post them. I'm debating if I should make the switch sooner or later.
