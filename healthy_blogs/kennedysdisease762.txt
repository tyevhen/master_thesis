The MDA Advocacy group published the results of their survey on air travel. Below is the email the MDA sent out with a link to the full article. I have also included a link to the DOT’s annual report on disability-related complaints for air travel. It shows a 224% increase in complaints over the last ten years. That's huge, but when you consider the actual number of complaints it is staggering. 

2007 Report =13,766                               2016 Report = 30,830

And, we all know that a vast majority of problems experienced are never formally submitted to the DOT.

“In an effort to understand the scale and scope of challenges faced by the neuromuscular disease community when traveling by air, at the end of 2016 we surveyed the MDA community about their flying experiences. We received more than 2,000 responses, and we thank everyone who took the time to participate in the survey. We hope you'll take a moment to review the results to see how challenges with and access to air travel impact our community.

Over the past two years, MDA has made accessible air travel one of our policy priorities. We're working closely with policy makers, federal agencies, industry and other advocacy and disability rights organizations to help improve access to air travel for MDA families. For more information about traveling with limited mobility, visit MDA's Accessible Air Travel Resource Center.”

A few months ago, I called upon my readers to contact their representatives regarding this important issue. The bill introduced in the Senate recently would go a long way in helping this ongoing issue.

“While there are efforts in place to increase access to air travel, there is still much to be done to improve the rights of passengers with disabilities during air travel. Recently, the U.S. Senate introduced a bill that strengthens the rights of disabled passengers under the Air Carrier Access Act. Included in the bill are provisions to:

1. Strengthen enforcement to include specific protections of the rights of passengers with disabilities and recourse when those rights are violated;

2. Ensure airplanes are designed to accommodate people with disabilities and airlines meet accessibility standards, including safe and effective boarding and deplaning;

3. Provide better stowage options for assistive devices;

4. Improve access to seating accommodations;

5. Close service gaps in air travel for passengers with disabilities; and

6. Require that the U.S. Access board conduct a study to determine the ways in which individuals who use assistive devices can be accommodated through cabin wheelchair restraint systems.”

All of the above would help, but I especially like #6.
