Lilly has agreed to shell out a half billion dollars to settle legal claims brought by those who claimed to be harmed by Zyprexa. There are 1200 more claims that will head to court in April, so the $$ to be paid out will nearly certainly increase. To nobody's surprise, Lilly has described the lawsuits as "baseless." Just like the last batch of "baseless" lawsuits that were settled for $700 million, I'm sure!
