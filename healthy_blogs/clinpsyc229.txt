From a press release from Prescription Access Litigation...
A U.S. District Court judge today issued a decision allowing to go forward a class action lawsuit that alleged that Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY) fraudulently marketed the atypical antipsychotic drug, Zyprexa, for uses not approved by the FDA. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of NY, denied Eli Lillyâ€™s motion for summary judgment, as well as a summary judgment motion filed by the plaintiffs.
The 14-page order highlighted the importance of the Courts in protecting the public in the arena of prescription drugs. The Judge stated:
"Under the present organization of the pharmaceutical industry, the official federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the plaintiffs' bar, the courts are arguably in the strongest position to effectively enforce appropriate standards protecting the public from fraudulent merchandising of drugs." (Opinion, pp. 3-4)
The entirety of the judge's latest ruling can be seen here. This is a potentially big story, but I have little time to discuss it now. Maybe later...
