This is the second year that our school will celebrate College Colors Day. College Color Day is a yearly event where students and staff are encouraged to wear their favorite college team colors to celebrate the college experience. During this year's event, our counseling office will sponsor a college door decoration contest and a tail gate for teachers and our peer helpers.  Teachers are encouraged to share information about their college with students and our peer helpers will sponsor college informational tables in the lunchroom where students can sign up to talk live with a representative via College Week Live.  This is a great event to promote and advocate for higher education among your high school students.
