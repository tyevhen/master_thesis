You know the scene. There were eye appointments after school. I had to leave my internship early and I met the boys there. That works out great as Fish drove them there.  I walked in and Teddy was being checked on one of those machines. He saw me and said "Hi Mom. How was your day?" This is the same Teddy who at home has been brutal as of late toward me in his words.  The optical lady said "Awwww. That is so sweet. I don't think any of my kids have ever asked me that?" First of all I felt bad for her that her kids have never asked. Second, for my kids with RAD kids it is the first words out of their mouths every day. It is what I ask them and I think they honestly don't know what else to say. It has become habit.  Here is where the story changes. In the past I'd feel a little twang inside as I thought about the way I am treated at home and yet I'd smile and say "thanks".  Teddy would usually smile a sweet Eddie Haskal smile that said "I am so sweet aren't I?"  Yesterday was different. He looked at me and I saw sadness that said "No. I am not really too nice to mom when no one is looking."  That was IMPORTANT! That was caring. That was real emotion.  That was another baby step toward healing. Have a healing weekend!
