For years, I've absolutely loved having  Shrink Rap.  I've loved having a place to write, to vent, to share something cool I've learned, and I've learned so very much from readers who have really changed my life.  What a great experience from a thought at the kitchen table that started, "I want a blog.  What's a blog?"  Shrink Rap has inspired me to keep current with psychiatry and to learn about things to write about that I might otherwise just skip.  I love having a place to ask questions, especially when they're about things that make my brain start doing somersaults (--well, not really, I think it's anchored in there okay).   Someplace to talk about things that are really bothering me or to share a funny cartoon or to just be a bit ducky.  

Sometimes, over the years, I've gotten really annoyed.  As much as I like hearing about others peoples' experiences, I don't like when people generalize their interior world to everyone else. And when it's an incessant, it gets wearing.

Lately,  I'm totally consumed with writing our next book.  I'm meeting the most interesting of people, and it's fine with me that some of them are very much in favor of involuntary psychiatric care, for what seem to be caring and reasonable agendas, and some of them are very much against involuntary psychiatric care, for what seem to be caring and reasonable agendas.  But my brain is consumed with this.

And as much as I've loved Shrink Rap, the drum beat of negative comments and the inter-reader bickering, well, it's tiring.  For a short while, I moderated comments.  That's work, one more thing to do when I should probably be making pesto instead. Roy got tired long ago, and Clink chimes in when something really inspires her, so I've been most of the noise for a long time now.

I'm tired.  Just tired.   We'll see. I think I'm taking a little rest for now.
