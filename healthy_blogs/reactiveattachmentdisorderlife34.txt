don't forget your purpose was to drain the swamp." My clinical assessment professor used this as an illustration last night and of course, my mind went straight to RAD. It is easy to get caught up in the lying, stealing, urination, food hoarding, etc. While we cannot ignore those issues, they are not the main thing. The main thing is lack of attachment. So we need to really focus on:empathy, gentle touch, loving words and looks, sweet foods fed from our hands. We have to stop worrying so much about the alligators and drain that swamp!!!! I am talking to myself here friends! I hope it encourages you as well.
