Commonly question about Naturally Mag
Question :
Are there foods besides red meat that will raise testosterone levels naturally? I read in Men s Health mag
that peanut butter would raise testosterone levels.
I eat a mainly vegetarian diet including a lot of soy products, so
1) What foods will raise testosterone levels?, and
2)Will the estrogen in the tofu significantly lower testosterone levels.
Any knowledge you have would be appreciated.
Answer :
Soy s been eaten for thousands of years, actually, but pretty much only in a fermented state. Non-fermented soy is high in phytoestrogens which can definitely mess with hormones in both men and women.

Women s reactions to phytoestrogens range from the benign, e.g. stimulated breast growth, to the malignant, e.g. more troublesome periods and increased incidence of ovarian and breast cancer. As for men, there aren t a lot of studies on the effects of phytoestrogens yet, but early evidence is showing a correlation between decreased sperm count and increased exposure to environmental estrogens.

Basically, unfermented soy is not a suitable food for regular consumption.

Fermented soy products:
natto
miso
tempeh
traditional soy sauce

Non-fermented soy products:
soy milk
tofu
modern soy sauce (which is actually mostly wheat!)
soy oil
additives to thousands of commercial shelf products

Notice that the non-fermented products are modern inventions and only consumed in huge amounts recently. Also, guess who leads the world in soy consumption: The US. Guess which country has the highest incidences of breast cancer and osteoporosis, despite all the fuss over getting calcium from your milk or soy milk: The US. Hmm.

Enlarged breasts and nipple discharge in men has been reported from a diet high in soy. Some soy is fine, but as a vegan/vegetarian, it should not be your main source of protein.

Try getting protein from other sources such as legumes and beans
Question :
Lenses that give you naturally good eyesight by morning?
has anybody heard of a contact lens that you put in at night, sleep in, and they gently change the shape of your cornea?
i just read a story in a chat mag about it and it sounds frickin brilliant!!
Answer :
It s called orthokeratology and has been around for years.
It s not suitable for everyone (max -6 .00 I believe) and it s not a therapy. When you stop using the lenses, your eyesight gets back to its original condition. In addition the lenses are expensive (but you don t change them, at least not often), and at the beginning you need the supervision of an eye doctor to be sure your corneas are not suffering because of the lenses.
