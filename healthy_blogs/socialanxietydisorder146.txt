Commonly question about Psych Facts
Question :
-For Psych people: What do you call objective facts that your brain takes in?
Hi, I have a quick question. Obviously light and temperature and all those factors our body processes are called sensory data. I am doing a paper on decision making and I don t know whether objective facts such as numbers and financial data that we read are another form of sensory data(since we don t objectively process the data we read), or if there is another term for this. Can anyone clarify?
Answer :
Objective facts usually fall under the branch of semantic knowledge (various knowledge about the world around us, not related to personal experience or procedural knowledge)
Question :
Is homosexuality a choice? My debate topic for AP PSYCH. Need your opinions & facts!?
This is a debate topic for my AP PSYCH CLASS. And i m PRO. Not really my real opinion, but i would like to know some real facts out there. and People who can help me support that homosexuality is in fact a choice.
Answer :
I think on a whole, its not a choice. My friend is a Christian homosexual who has tried every option to change his sexuality but is unable to. If it helps you, scientists are starting to think that there is no "gay gene" present in homosexuals
Question :
Is it possible to be placed in the psych ward just purely on the fact you are not functioning?
I ve had the worst couple of months I recently was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I ve had moments where I ve become very suicidal and actually am starting to believe it might be best if I spent some time in the psych ward to get back on my feet figure out the meds maybe be connected with a therapist who can help me reach normal.
Answer :
yep you could do voluntary inpatient therapy--- talk to your therapist/psych about being admitted to an inpatient behavioral center.

They force you to wake up and go to bed at normal times, eat regular meals, do support groups etc... it will help get your natural body functions like sleep routines back on track. Because they are taking care of you, you can focus at what is at the root of your problems like depression or anxiety. They ll also get your meds on track.

If you feel you can t take care of yourself than being admitted is a good option for you. It s not fun, but ultimately will get you functioning and feeling better.
