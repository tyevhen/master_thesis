The Medical College of Wisconsin (in Milwaukee) is currently researching Co-Q10 (Co-enzyme Q10). Allison LaPean, a former member of the NIH team is there. The research is trying to determine the benefits of taking Co-Q10 for neurological patients with ALS, MS, Parkinson's and KD. A newsletter sent to another man with Kennedy's Disease commented that the preliminary results have been "encouraging" thus far. The Parkinson's disease trial was published here. In addition, a 2002 study of 80 Parkinson's disease patients found 1200mg/day reduced the progression by 44%. It is my understanding that no information has been published yet concerning any potential benefits for those of us with Kennedy's Disease.

Dr. Lieberman in our Saturday chat room session commented, "CoQ is likely to have some beneficial effects, though they may be small, since it gets rid of things called free radicals that can damage cell membranes and proteins." Dr. Lieberman also commented, "I don't know if there's really any evidence that free radicals are critical to Kennedy disease, but I don't think there's much of a down side to CoQ, other than cost. BUT, I'm not a neurologist, and you should probably check with your treating physician before starting a program using Co-Q10."

Personally, I have been taking Co-Q10 for several years at the recommendation of my doctor (another it cannot hurt comment). I take 240 mg/day. A third person with Kennedy's Disease mentioned his neurologist recommended Co-Q10 also (300 mg/day). In our cases, it is difficult to say whether it makes a difference because we have been taking it for some time. The study mentioned above should help clarify whether it provides any value.

On a side note, the KDA Discussion Forum continues to amaze me. The forum receives several hundred page-reads a day. The number of published comments and questions, as well as the sharing of information and support, is a blessing for those of us living with this disease. I check the forum about once a week and usually find five or ten new questions and comments on a variety of subjects. Check it out if you have the chance.
