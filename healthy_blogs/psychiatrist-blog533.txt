I bought my first ever lottery ticket today.  Okay, I bought 20.  I wanted a real chance.  The Jackpot is $640 million.  That's a lot of money!  I had to go to two places: the first store was sold out, and the second was a convenience store with a long line and a clerk asking if anyone wanted anything besides lottery tickets.



Okay, when I win, how should I spend my big bucks?
