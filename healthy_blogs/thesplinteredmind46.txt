Today I am sick with the flu. At first it felt as if my stomach was in the clutches of an angry dragon, but soon I just felt blah all over. I'm so glad I got my flu shot last week! Yes, indeed. It may not have worked at all, but at least I got out of the house, got to meet new people, got jabbed in the arm for no reason, and then got the flu anyway. It really couldn't have turned out any better. I also got a pneumonia shot, but it felt like I had been stabbed with a pencil. Then my arm ballooned and turned cherry red. Boy, that was a lot of fun. I bet I'll get pneumonia again, too. It's been a year since it nearly killed me before. If I'm lucky I can get the flu AND pneumonia at the same time again. Then I'll really be living it up.
So while I try to mend my illness with sarcasm, and since I won't be writing the blog I had planned on for today, I wanted to share something with you that I've been experimenting with. I post a lot of mental health links on Twitter, but not everyone has a Twitter account. So I've been playing around with Flipboard this month to make a constantly updating magazine featuring those links. There weren't any mental health resources on Flipbaord, so I thought this would be a worthwhile experiment. Considering how few people Facebook allows to see what I post on my page over there, I can't imagine fewer people will see this magazine.
A Splintered Mind on Flipboard
Although Flipboard was originally an iPad app, and is now available for Android tablets, the creators of Flipboard have made Flipboard magazines available to the general web. Click on the link and let me know what you think. Then bookmark it. I'll be adding new content to it weekly.
