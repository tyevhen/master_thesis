In psychotherapy, Mother's Day is a two week long event. People talk about it the week before and the week after. For mothers in intact families, it gets a brief mention-- there was a nice meal or even some flowers. For those who've lost their mothers, however, it is a rough time, a day when grief re-surfaces, when old wounds get spiced.
In honor of Mother's Day, Shrinkette has posted some cool pics: The Secret Lives of Our Parents


My best to everyone and , of course,
Happy Mother's Day
