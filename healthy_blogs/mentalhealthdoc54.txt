Cytop is a medication is SSRI drug class.SSRI stands for Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Its generic name is citalopram. It is prescribed for clinical depression, Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, Post traumatic stress disorder, Social anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.

However, Citalopram is a racimic mixture of R and S enantiomer . S - enantiomer is the most effective active component. Escitalopram is the pure form of S - Citalopram and it is more effective in treating depression. But the clinical evidence is not so convincing.

Treatment most often reduces or even eliminates symptoms, but not a cure since symptoms can recur after medicine stopped. Once symptoms are gone, this medication should be continued for 1 year for the first episode of depression. For second and subsequent episodes of depression, treatment may need to be indefinite.  Use in anxiety disorders may also need to be indefinite ( Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, Post traumatic stress disorder, Social anxiety disorder ).

Usual dosage is 20â€“60 mg/day. This drug usually is prescribed in the morning to avoid insomnia or sleep disturbances.
