Newer anti-psychotics gave hope for the psychiatry patients due to their low side effects profile. Commonly used newer antipsychotic drugs are Zyprexa, Clozaril, Risperdal and Abilify. They cause fewer extra-pyramidal side effects compared to older typical anti-psychotics. In addition, serious complications such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and tardive dyskinesia are rare in newer anti psychotics (compared to older anti psychotics).

But recent evidence suggest that newer anti psychotics have different very dangerous complications. Newer atypical anti psychotics are known to cause serious blood lipid elevation in certain patients. It can complicate ischemic heart disease treatment in such patients. In addition, atypical/newer anti psychotics increase body weight. Common drugs that are responsible for body weight increase are Zyprexa, Clozaril and Seroquel. Risperdal and Abilify cause less weight gain. In fact Abilify seems to cause weight reduction in certain individuals.

Newer atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa, Clozaril and Risperdal (less) can also cause diabetes mellitus by way of increasing blood glucose level.

Therefore, long term overall benefit of newer anti psychotics remain questionable.
