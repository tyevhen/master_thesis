In an recent interview with Radio Times Magazine , Sir Paul McCartney said that writing music was great therapy but sometimes he sought treatment on the analytical couch - psychoanalysis, that is.

It's great when high profile individuals share their success with psychotherapy. It takes the shame out of going to seek help.

I've adored "The Beatles" my whole life.
And now I love Paul even more.

I don't think my husband will mind.
