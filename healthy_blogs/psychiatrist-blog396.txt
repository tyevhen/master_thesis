In honor of an assortment of storms, Clink is over on Clinical Psychiatry News talking about how we deal with devastation.  What we say to patients to soothe them, how we deal with our own losses.  Clink writes:

There is no easy way to salvage the remains of a past life. One can pick through the wreckage, create a monument to lost memories, or let go of the remnants determined to rebuild in new and better ways. There is no right way to deal with it, no better way, only ways that are less painful than others. The only certainty is that life will not be the same. As psychiatrists, the best we can do is instill faith in recovery. 

She includes a lovely poem by Elizabeth Bishop titled One Art.
