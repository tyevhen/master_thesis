If you haven't take our poll on Why You See A Shrink, then please do! This is just for fun, it's not real science.

So today is Sigmund Freud's birthday. He would be 154 years old.

Today's poll asks How Often Do You See Your Psychiatrist---and I'll ask that you limit your answers to psychiatrists-- M.D.'s or D.O's-- so if you see a non-psychiatrist therapist for therapy, and a psychiatrist for meds--I mean the med check person, and if you're in psychoanalysis with a psychiatrist, I mean the couch person. But I'm not interested in how often you see your social worker/psychologist--- maybe another day.
