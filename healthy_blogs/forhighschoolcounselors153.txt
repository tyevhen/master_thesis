Want to reduce your stress and slow down aging?  If so, practice kindness! Being kind produces serotonin which heals your wounds and makes you feel better.  In fact, kindness boosts serotonin in the giver, the receiver, and those who witness the act.  In addition to serotonin, kindness also produces endorphins or the body's natural ability to kill pain and oxytocin or the chemical that encourages bonding and trust. So kindness has a lot of positive side effects that can have a ripple effect in your school (even high school!).
