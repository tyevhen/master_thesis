The most recent Journal of Clinical Psychiatry has an article about using the active ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms (which is a potent specific serotonin receptor agonist) to treat OCD. I wonder if anyone knows of folks with OCD who have tried LSD or other hallucinogens. The study suggests that, whereas traditional medications for OCD may take 3 months to work, this drug worked same day, and its effects lasted beyond 24 hours.
