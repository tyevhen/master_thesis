Many clients have asked me: What does the term "mind-body psychotherapy" mean?
To give a comprehensive answer to that question would take more than one or two blog postings.

To give a brief explanation: The term mind-body psychotherapy is a general term that includes many different forms of psychotherapy. including EMDR, clinical hypnosis, certain forms of contemporary psychoanalysis, Focusing, psychomotor psychotherapy, somatic experiencing, sensorimotor psychotherapy, Gestalt therapy, mindfulness meditation and so on.

Although they are all different in terms of their particular emphasis and how they are performed, what they all have in common is that they are all holistic approaches that focus on the connection between the mind and the body and how treatment can integrate that connection and bring about healing. There is a recognition that we are more than just our minds and that our minds and bodies interact and affect each other.

Our implicit and symbolic memories are not just stored in our brain--they are also stored in our bodies. So, for instance, in EMDR, when an EMDR therapist asks clients to describe their emotions about a particular memory and where they feel it in their bodies, this tends to deepen the work. As opposed to some other forms of talk therapy, where the emphasis is only on what clients think, the mind-body oriented psychotherapies ask clients to also focus on their thoughts and emotions and where these thoughts and emotions are sensed in the body in a holistic way.

I enjoy integrating the various forms of mind-body psychotherapies in my practice. Since I started working in this way, I have found that clients have a deeper experience of the work and tend to heal faster.
