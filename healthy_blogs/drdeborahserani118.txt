Psynomics , the first company to offer diagnostic testing for mental illness, is causing a stir in the health field. They offer two genetic tests to diagnose Bipolar Disorder on its website, along with descriptions, references and instructions for individuals and doctors.



Once ordered, a "spit kit" arrives at one's home or doctor's office. From there, the procedure is simple. Spit, seal and send. Psynomics will analyze the DNA and forward test results and a report. For more on the process, read here .


There are some limitations, specifically that the genetic test is valid only if you experience the symptoms of Bipolar Disorder and are Caucasian with Northern European ancestry.



Some health experts worry that such genetic tests are built on thin data and may be preying on a person's deepest anxieties. While others feel it is an exciting step into a new world. A world where technology and genetic helps to make diagnosis easier.



I'm excited by the possibilities.



How about you?
