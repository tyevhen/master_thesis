I had my annual checkup yesterday and first indications are that this old body is good for another 30,000 miles.  My doctor likes my attitude of “taking one day at a time.”  He also felt my philosophy of “this too will pass” probably keeps my blood pressure in line.

Like many of you, Christmas is an important occasion for our family.  There should be twenty-plus in Marietta Christmas day if the weather holds up.  We have a new member of the clan (a great niece was born Tuesday) to welcome into the fold and be thankful for.  Our health and happiness is the best gift we are given each year.  Well, that and the “white elephant” gifts we exchange.  :-)

Thank you for reading my blog.  You cannot imagine how nice it is to know that so many have enjoyed and occasionally benefited from my personal stories, helpful hints, research updates, and thoughts about life.   I never thought an old windbag (my wife’s thoughts on my verbosity) like me would ever command such loyalty from my readers.

From our house to yours …



We hope you and yours have a
safe, healthy and happy 2011
