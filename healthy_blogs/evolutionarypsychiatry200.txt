I have some more refurbished posts up on Psychology Today - some are updated, and/or combined posts, and a couple of them have some pretty intense information that deserves a refresher even if you have read it before ;-)

Autism and Ketogenic Diets

ADHD and Mom's Serotonin Deficiency

Sunlight, Sugar, and Serotonin

Also, a big thanks to the lovely people at the British Journal of Psychiatry, who have granted me persmission to use their graph in my Season of Birth and Anorexia Nervosa post from the end of last month. 

As for new stuff, I'll likely have a post on inositol (and its uses for depression) up in the next day or two, followed by some cannabis posts. 

Happy Wednesday!
