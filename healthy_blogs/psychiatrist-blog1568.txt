[37] . . . [38] . . . [39] . . . [All]
Okay, this podcast is a milestone for us. Dinah bought several hundred dollars worth of sound equipment (Alesis MultiMix8 w/Firewire, Behringer C-1 mics),
which took us several hours to properly set up to record so that each of us comes into the MacBook as a separate track, thus letting us have more equal sound volumes (before we all shared the same mic, so our voices were at different levels).

I've set it up so that if you listen to the .m4a version (that's what gets downloaded from iTunes), Clink's more on the left channel, Dinah's more on the right, and I'm in the middle. Let us know how you like it. I'm still figuring out how to use it all to achieve the best sound quality, but I think #38 is the best one we've ever done so far.
