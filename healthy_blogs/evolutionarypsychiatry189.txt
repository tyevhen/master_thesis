It's a lovely Sunday here and I'm actually beginning to sport a bit of a tan (remarkably enough) - we're inside for lunch and naps (the kids, sadly, not mine) and I thought I would take a moment to link to my brand new exclusive Psychology Today article, Brain Food, which tells you what I ate for two meals, and also where I get my vegetables.  Here's today's menu:

Breakfast: Farmer's market bacon, mustard greens, kale (yuck - always seems like a punishment, even chopped fine and sauteed in bacon grease), half a banana

Head to playground, where youngest (who in the morning exhibited remarkable throwing capacity by beaning me in the head with a sippy cup full of milk) manages to nearly fling herself off every piece of playground equipment.  Oldest is afraid of heights and there's no worrying with her, except it would be nice to see her to attempt ladders and monkey bars before youngest does.

Lunch: not hungry - (kids eat leftover fried rice)

While kids nap: 1, er, I mean 2, glasses pinot noir whilst sitting in sun on the back deck.

Dinner: Crockpot beef stew - beef stock (simmered in crockpot for about four hours with beef tendon, radish and turnip greens and green garlic) - remove the stock veggies, add one onion, two peeled potatoes, splash of Worcestershire sauce, chopped green garlic, two pounds grassfed top round.  Crockpot for a couple of hours, then add chopped kale, young turnips, and a baby bok choy.  Crockpot another couple of hours.  Add salt and pepper and Tabasco to taste.  We'll see how it turns out in a few hours. Might need to add soy sauce (my coconut aminos fermented and is no longer palatable - that's some amazing but fragile stuff.  Refrigerate and use quickly) or red wine.  We'll see.

Up next:  A while back Zooko  highlighted some papers about ketones and depression which I hope to cover.  Also, I really want to look more closely at our good friend folate.

All right, back to mom work...
