...a blog with three topics.

Headlines in the News...

1. Read this headline carefully... "Teen accused of fondling girl to get psychiatric evaluation". If this is what it takes to get a psych eval nowadays, then we truly need universal health care ASAP!!

2. "CCHR criticises psychiatry" ... this is "news"?

3. "Iguana's stubborn erection to get the chop" ... this is why we are taught in medical school to avoid trazodone in iguanas.
