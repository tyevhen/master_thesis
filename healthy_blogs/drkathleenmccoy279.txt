My husband recently got a prescription for Viagra and I don't know what to do. I would be happy
having sex once or twice a month. He's ready to pop a pill and go every night. I can't stand it! He wasn't this hopped up even when we were newlyweds! Any advice?


                                                                                         Charlotte S.


One person's hell is another person's heaven.

There are countless couples who regard Viagra as a great blessing.


However, what you're describing happens with a lot of midlife couples. There are many, many Viagra prescriptions that are not refilled because of conflicts over frequency of sex. While there are many women who want more sex than their husbands at this stage of life, men who get a prescription for Viagra sometimes find themselves at odds with spouses who want sex less frequently than they do.

If you find yourself in this situation,  remember that men who have had problems with varying degrees of impotence may also have suffered a loss of confidence in themselves and their sexuality. So Viagra must seem like a miraculous infusion of youth -- and they may try to recapture or even improve on the sexual performances of their youth!

The key to making this work for both of you is to find a suitable compromise -- maybe more sex than you want, a little less than he wants -- that feels right for you as a couple.  When working out your compromise, if you find the prospect of more frequent intercourse a bit daunting, offer him a satisfying alternative with hands or mouth that will make him feel cherished and pampered. Maintaining an active sex life, however you choose to express yourselves, is good for you physically and can also add immeasurably to your happiness as a couple in midlife and beyond!
