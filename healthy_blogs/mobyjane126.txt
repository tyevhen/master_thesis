Hello !


I bought your book at the Del Mar Fair and I am on Chapter 7. Thank you so much!!

I have had many sleepless nights, and I tend to wake up feeling low, or depressed. I loved your book explaining the PASSIVE MIND, and that “we tend to be turned inward in our thinking and are vulnerable to the least bump I the road.” Wow. It all makes so much sense. When I exercise in the morning, or concentrate on things that I would like to get done, I am no longer depressed. Just like you said, we need to have DIRECTIVE thinking and not PASSIVE thinking. I always wondered why I was so sad in the mornings, and felt so good in the evenings, and you helped me understand my brain, thoughts and feelings.

I can’t thank you enough for your research in writing this book. Besides attending Weight Watchers, I also started attending a Singles Group that I tried to do years before unsuccessfully. It has been a very good experience for me! I have met some new people and hope to develop some good, healthy relationships.

Thanks again!
