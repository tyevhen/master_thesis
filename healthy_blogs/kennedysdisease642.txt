Ed Meyerthoen, the KDA's resident expert on Kennedy's Disease posted the following message in the KDA Forum:

The KD group in Japan just published a study on exercises that they found can improve swallowing in KD patients. The paper can be found here. These exercises are quite straightforward and can be done anywhere one can lie down. A pdf of the exercises can be found here. The exercises are done 3 times a day, every day.
Head Lift Exercise Improves Swallowing Dysfunction in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy
The PDF instructions published by Wexner Medical Center of Ohio State are easy to follow. Even though it was only a small study group and only lasted six weeks, the initial results are positive. I plan on trying the exercises and see if they will help me. 

As always is the case, before you try any new exercises, consult with your doctor and physical therapist.
