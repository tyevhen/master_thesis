Welcome to Podcast Number 54: Tell Me! Information and Technology

Here's what we talk about:

Roy talks about the Maryland Health Information Exchange (HIE) called CRISP, which stands for Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients. Note that your health information is accessible to participating health care providers unless you opt out. You can read more at CrispHealth.org. We ramble about the downside of sharing health information electronically. We also complain about how difficult it can be to get medical information now, so there are pros and cons.

Roy talks about career satisfaction of psychiatrists based on a survey done by Epocrates. Roy talks about the increasing job satisfaction of primary care docs -- it's going up! In psychiatry it's also going up, based on data now compared to 3 years ago. Happy shrinks are up to 83% from 70%. Roy encourages med students to join us. Dinah extols the wonders of the diversity of psychiatry. Read the article about the survey Here.

Dinah brings up the age old dilemma of how to write about clinical information in psychiatry without compromising patient confidentially. We talk about how we deal with this problem in Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work. Ah, but it's not just printed matter, but blogging and tweeting and podcasting.

Finally, Roy talks about healthcare providers and social media, referencing an earlier blog post on What To Do When Your Patient Friends You On Facebook.
