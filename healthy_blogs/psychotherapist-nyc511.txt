According to the American Psychological Association (APA), research reveals that psychotherapy is an effective treatment for that helps to reduce not only mental health problems but also improves long term health.  

Yet, despite this research, according to the APA, mental health treatment has decreased over the last 10 years or so as more people attempt to rely on psychotropic medication for their emotional problems (see link below for the APA article).

The article cites the findings of 50 peer-reviewed studies that demonstrate psychotherapy's effectiveness across age and racial groups.

According to the APA article, research has shown that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is effective in treating anxiety and medication.

In my experience as a psychotherapist, I've found that many clients who might think, initially, that they might need to be on medication are often helped with psychotherapy alone combined with exercise or yoga.  Of course, each client is different and what works for one client might not work for another.  But this is also true for psychotropic medication.

The APA article also indicates that research has shown that the positive effects of psychotherapy often last longer than psychotropic medication.

Also, psychotherapy is often effective for teaching clients life skills that the clients benefit from long after they have completed psychotherapy.
