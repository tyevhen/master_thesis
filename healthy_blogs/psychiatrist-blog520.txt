Check out our CPN site where Roy is talking about Stage 2 Meaningful Use, and I've put down my final words (I hope!) on strip searching psych patients.  Do Check It Out if you'd like to see what we have to say, and to all those who helped me with this article, please accept my gratitude!  Roy and I would both love your feedback.


Lately, I feel like a moving obsession...I was preoccupied with medical marijuana legislation for a bit, then with how body searches are conducted of our patients, at the moment I'm reading Kaitlin Bell Barnett's new book Dosed: The Medication Generation Grows Up....my review is forthcoming.  What next?
