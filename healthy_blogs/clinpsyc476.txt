I have several other pressing matters to which I must attend for the next little while. I will likely not be posting until the end of December or perhaps early January. However, I will likely be doing some writing on at least some of the following topics in the interim so that I am ready to hit the ground running upon my return.
Texas Medication Algorithm Project
SSRIs and Suicide
Troubles associated with having children when older
Reply to Herb on VNS
Corcept and mifepristone
