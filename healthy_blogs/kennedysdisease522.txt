The video is a 25 minute tour of the International Space Station given by the departing commander. She was leaving for earth the day this is shot. She shows how they sleep, exercise, use the bathroom, eat, perform experiments, dock, get rid of their trash, arrive and depart, and a whole lot more. Seeing everyone floating around and the commander mimicking Superman was pretty cool.

Watching this video was an incredible experience. This is the best video I have seen and it visually explains what life is like living aboard the space station. If you are claustrophobic, you wouldnâ€™t do well.  But, the idea of not having gravity holding you down is somewhat appealing for those of us living with Kennedy's Disease.

I highly recommend the video. So, sit back and relax and see what life is really like in space.
