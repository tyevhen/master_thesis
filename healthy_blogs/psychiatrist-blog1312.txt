You know I like all the Service Animal stuff the New York Times writes about. In fact, the Emotional Support Duck started off our duck obsession here at Shrink Rap.

From the NYTimes Well blog, Dogs and Autism:

A legal battle in New York City highlights the healing power of dogs for children with autism and Asperger’s syndrome.
Manhattan federal prosecutors have accused the owners of an Upper East Side residence of discriminating against 11-year-old Aaron S by preventing him from having a dog, The New York Daily News reports.
The report goes on to explain:

According to the newspaper, a lawsuit claims the building owners violated the Fair Housing Act by imposing unreasonable demands on Aaron’s parents before allowing a dog. Among the restrictions reportedly imposed by the building: the dog couldn’t be left alone for more than two hours, it would have to be taken in and out of the building on a service elevator, monitoring of dog walkers who might take it for a stroll, and $1 million in liability insurance for any injury or property damage caused by the dog. A company-hired doctor reportedly agreed the dog was medically necessary.

Oh, I'll let you all do the commenting.
