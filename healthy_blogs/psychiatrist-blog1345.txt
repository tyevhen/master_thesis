I have an upcoming talk to give on blogging as a form of advocacy and education in the mental health field. I'd like to know which psychiatry and mental health blogs (aside from ours, which we know you love the best ;-) you all find the most valuable. Please leave us a comment with your choices and what it is, in particular, that makes them valuable to you. I'll make a list later for everyone and find some way to organize the results.
