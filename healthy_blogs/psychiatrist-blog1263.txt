It's an exciting weekend here in Maryland.



President-Elec
t Barack Obama is here speaking before he goes to Washington. I left my youngest person to stand in the cold and watch him (I'm warm at home, happy to watch on TV). I will be taking Tuesday off from shrink life to go to the inauguration in Washington. Crushing crowds, porta-potties, and a day filled with Hope.






If that's not enough, everything here is drenched in purple for the Ravens vs. Steelers AFC championship playoff game.

I'm a fan by marriage, so sure, I'm Wacko for Flacco.
