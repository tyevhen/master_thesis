In today's New York Times, I learned that Roche, the makers of Valium, will soon be closing the doors of their New Jersey plant.  In Valium's Contribution to our New Normal, Robin Marantz Henig writes:

Taking a pill to feel normal, even a pill sanctioned by the medical profession, led to a strange situation: it made people wonder what “normal” really was. What does it mean when people feel more like themselves with the drug than without it? Does the notion of “feeling like themselves” lose its meaning if they need a drug to get them there? 

Ah, we like to question What is Normal here at Shrink Rap.  Okay, time to pop my Xanax.
