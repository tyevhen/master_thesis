Anyone who knows me as a therapist knows that I believe that change is difficult, and that for the most part, people come flawed.  We seem to spend an inordinate amount of time identifying and trying to fix our flaws so that we conform to some standard of how we're supposed to be, and this leads people to feel badly about themselves and have the infamous  Low Self-Esteem.  Or to feel badly that they aren't richer, prettier, smarter, tougher, whatever.  

I think people should come to terms with who they are and say Yup, I suck at this.  And then they should not spend much time thinking about what they are bad at and they should figure out what things they like and how to grow those aspects of themselves and make those characteristics work for them so they can live a more fulfilling life.  

Obviously, there are exceptions, and I don't think people should say, "Yup I'm a sociopath and I kill people, get used to it,"  Nor do I think people should embrace their mental illness without trying to get help.

That said, and with minimal relevance to what I really want to share, I really enjoyed this TED talk by Dan Gilbert on the pursuit of happiness, and I hope you will too.  I wish I could speak like this (maybe with a little bit more air exchange).  And I stole the Seuss cartoon from Kathy's facebook page.  Enjoy.
