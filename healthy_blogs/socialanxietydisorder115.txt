Commonly question about Anxiety, Phobias, and Panic
Question :
What is the best medication for anxiety/panic/phobias?
Need to have something that doesn t cause nausea etc as I have IBS and don t want to aggravate it.
Answer :
i took Diazipan, it calmed me, but now knowing life better i would try councilling or support groups rather than medication. medication to me now is a quick fix, it does not heal you.
Question :
Does biofeedback or hypnosis have any effect on phobias, anxiety, panic, or depression?
The meds just take the endge away, therapy can t penetrate my severely irrational mind... So I ve heard rumors about biofeedback and hypnosis. do these actually help? Are there any other things to help?
Answer :
YES!!! just make sure to eliminate fears
sure there are alternatives....but mental help such as hypnosis etc really is better (& faster if done right)

wanna know what it is? Theta Healing
Question :
Can an acupunturist or narturopathic doctor helps me with anxiety, panic attacks, phobias and depression?
Answer :
You ll do better with some cognitive and physical techniques rather than herbs and such.

Meditation and yoga have been used for centuries to reduce stress and anxiety.

Exercise is mandatory not only for mental health but to maintain optimum physical health. You are body/mind, the mind works best when the body is maintained in good condition.

Do you know the source of your depression? Have you sought counseling for it?
