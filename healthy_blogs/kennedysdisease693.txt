Medical research is important for those of us living with a chronic or progressive disorder. The MDA Advocacy Newsletter included the following piece of positive news regarding funding of research.



Increase Funding for Research

One of MDAâ€™s policy priorities is ensuring that maximum funding is available for biomedical research. To that end, thank you to all MDA Advocates who have taken action to encourage Congress to make increased research funding a priority.


Both chambers of Congress have included increased research funding in their spending proposals for next year by increasing support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Senate plan includes a $2 billion increase while the House calls for a smaller, but still substantial increase of $1.25 billion. While these figures are not final, and no agreement has yet been reached in terms of final funding levels for fiscal year 2017, it is promising to see Congress making research funding a priority, and we are grateful to each member who has made sustained and robust research funding a priority. We will follow up with additional information when Congress resumes the budget process in September.
