She's ready to defend the galaxy
This week was much less eventful and more delightful than last week. I took a furlough from blogging so that I could reduce stress and concentrate on studying for my final exam in Abnormal Psychology. I'm optimistic about my grade in that class. :)


When Fall began, I made some fitness plans - lets re-explore them. Did I give up caffeine? NO! Not even close. Did I exercise? Well, my job is a workout, so I suppose I did. Did I use the happy lamp? Well, yes, but then I went mixed bipolar and my therapist told me to stop using it. :( End result? Didn't lose weight, still addicted to caffeine, and got sicker than I imagined I would. But....Winter is coming! A new season means some new plans. 

Inspired by Ipsofactodotme's #NoSugar challenge, I will start a semester-long #NoCaffeine challenge. I will white-knuckle the caffeine and hope that all of you will cheer me on. I'll give you an update each week on how I'm doing.

This semester, I'm taking an EMT training class (yes, the one I dropped last semester). This class will be less easy to adapt to blog posts, so instead I'll include a bullet point list of anything interesting I've learned. Hopefully that will keep me on my toes.
