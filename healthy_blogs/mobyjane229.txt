After my back injury and while I was finding it difficult to eat with no appetite, I tried to come up with a healthy oatmeal cookie. Everything I tried on the Internet was too sweet or not healthy enough so I started experimenting. After the 5th try I came up with a cookie I really liked. Thought I would pass it on. A. B. Curtiss
