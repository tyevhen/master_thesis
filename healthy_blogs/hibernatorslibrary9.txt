Hey all! Sorry I disappeared from my blog for a while. My dad was having carotid-subclavian bypass surgery and I was helping him out. He's doing great now, so it's back to the grind. Unfortunately I totally missed all discussion of Exodus - which I haven't even started yet. I'll read that at the same time as starting Leviticus, though, so that I stay on schedule. Just need to put a fire under my butt and catch up. I'm supposed to post my questions for The Unwinding Part II on Monday the 6th, I MIGHT be able to get that far by then, but no promises. I might be a couple of days late. But I'll catch up! 


Otherwise, there's not really much to say about the past couple of weeks of absence. I was mostly focusing on dad. I'll also try to catch up on blog comments and visit people's blogs soon, but I'm way behind in life, so give me some time. 

Currently Reading: Because I'm behind, I've narrowed down my currently reading list to The Bible, The Unwinding (nonfiction for my group read), Kindred (audiobook), and Dark Matter (fiction for my real life book club). 


Oh! And I almost forgot to mention that I hope to attend the March for Science in DC on April 22nd. I wish I had the skill to knit this cap. Anyone know how to knit who wants to do one for me? :)
