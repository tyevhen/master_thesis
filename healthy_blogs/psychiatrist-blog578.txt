Monday January 16, 1 - 2 pm: Everything you could know about psychiatry in a 50-minute hour


What is psychotherapy, how does it work? What is psychoanalysis, and why don't all shrinks practice it? Our guest this hour three Baltimore psychiatrists -- answer questions about how they work with patients. Our guests: Dr. Steven Daviss, chairman of psychiatry at Baltimore Washington Medical Center; Dr. Dinah Miller, in private practice; and Dr. Annette Hanson, a forensic psychiatrist with appointments at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Hospital. They write a blog together and are authors of “Shrink Rap: Three Psychiatrists Explain Their Work,” published by Johns Hopkins University Press.

Midday producer Michael Himowitz says of the book: "This is a remarkable book. I was prepared to endure it, but it turned out to be well-written without being glib pop-psychology, informative without being overly laden with jargon, and surprisingly candid about psychiatry’s failings and problems. They should have named it Shrink 101, because it really covers the basics about navigating the disorganized and confusing world of mental health care."
