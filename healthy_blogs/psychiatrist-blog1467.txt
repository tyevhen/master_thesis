Behind me, a teenager is watching a Law & Order episode about a dead psychiatrist who was sleeping with one of his child patients. And his wife was a former teenage patient. Great.

And from today's New York Times, pointed out by one of our readers, Penelope Green writes about psychotherapists' home offices in What's in a Chair?
and with such a topic, we're brought back to HBO's In Treatment. I'm on hiatus, maybe tomorrow.

TWO Sundays ago, Lewis Aron, director of New York University’s postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, organized a salon for his peers. The topic? “In Treatment.” Two hundred analysts showed up. “It went like this,” said Dr. Aron. “Someone would stand up and say, ‘Hi, my name is Judy X and I’m addicted to ‘In Treatment,’ and then everybody would say, ‘Hi, Judy!’ ” For two hours, the analysts discussed the various mistakes Weston makes regarding boundary issues, and one analyst broached the idea that the placement of his office in his home was the cause of his many transgressions.
No, I don't need a self-help group. I'm not sure if the Times article is more interesting in it's mention of the psychiatrist who had nude watercolors of herself in the waiting room, or the doc with the dog, training pads and all, in the office. None of the Shrink Rappers have home offices. Roy, however, does have a 28-inch monitor, and I have monitor envy.
