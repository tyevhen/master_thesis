Five major psychoanalytic groups have unveiled a new manual that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders AND convey a greater understanding of how such illness are experienced [1].

The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies that demonstrate the importance of focusing on the full range, whole-person approach in mental health. It provides a framework for improving comprehensive treatment approaches and understanding both the biological and psychological origins of mental health and illness.

The PDM was created to be used in addition to the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" and the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems". But what is great about this new diagnostic tool is how it will educate professionals about the "texture" and subjective experience of mental health.

The diagnostic framework formulated by the PDM describes:

*Healthy and disordered personality functioning.

*Individual profiles of mental functioning, including patterns of relating, comprehending and expressing feelings, coping with stress and anxiety, observing one's own emotions and behaviors.

*Symptom patterns, including differences in each individual's personal, subjective experience of symptoms.


I am all over this!
