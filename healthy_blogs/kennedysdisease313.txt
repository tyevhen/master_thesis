We all need a laugh occasionally.  This joke hit my chuckle-bone this morning.

An elderly man is stopped by the police around 1:00 a.m. and is asked where he is going at this time of night.
 
The man replies, "I am going to a lecture about alcohol abuse and the effects it has on the human body."
 
The officer doesn’t believe the man and asks, "Really? Who is giving that lecture at this time of night?"
 
The man replies, "That would be my wife."
 
More Ideas Worth Sharing

Several readers commented how much they enjoyed “TED – Ideas Worth Sharing.”  Since the last article I have watched several more presentations.  Below are some of my recent favorites.  They are more entertaining than educational this time.  Enjoy!

Bring Dinosaurs to Life 


Jack Horner: Building a dinosaur from a chicken is an entertaining yet  informative discussion on how make a chicken into a chickenosaurs.  On the serious side he explains how the embryo of a chicken actually has fingers and a long tail.  Then, through the genetics that takes place within the egg it modifies the original genes into what we know as a chicken.

The War Horse 


And for strictly entertainment watch Handspring Puppet Company: The genius puppetry behind War Horse .  This is so interesting because of the concept behind making puppets so real that you believe they are alive.  Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler bring the emotional complexity of animals to the stage with life-size puppets including the latest triumph, “War Horse”, who trots, prances and gallops.  Also, note the ears and tail, as well as the breathing, because it shows how they gave emotions to the horse’s personality.  This is truly amazing!

And, just for fun 


Gel:  Gotta share! is three minutes of improve fun on how far the social network has come.  It takes a serious subject (people who cannot unplug, unhook, or turn off their electronic devices), in my opinion, and has a little fun with it.  Enjoy!
