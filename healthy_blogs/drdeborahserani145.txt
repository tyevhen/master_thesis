In the upcoming December issue of Maxim Magazine, Angus Young, lead guitarist of AC/DC, tops the list of the "25 Greatest Short Dudes of All Time," standing tall at 5 feet 2 inches. Former NBA guard Spud Webb (5 feet 7 inches) is Number 2, followed by Napoleon Bonaparte (5 feet 4 inches), at number 3.
Yoda, at number 6, is the shortest on the list, his height approximated at 2 feet 2 inches tall.

Maxim Magazine claims to be helping women "begin a long overdue fight against their genetically determined shallowness when choosing a partner." Other great short dudes on the list are Martin Scorsese, Jon Stewart, Prince, Kurt Cobain and two of the Hobbits from "The Lord of the Rings" films â€” Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The tallest "short dude" is Pro football player Doug Flutie, at 5 feet 10 inches, who is ranked at Number 24.

Psychologically speaking, I like to think these these men show the world that altitude is a matter of attitude!
