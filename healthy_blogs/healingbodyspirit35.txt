One of the most important things that I want to share with my children and grandchildren is that I was born a "child of God," and so were they. We are children of God on a divinely appointed earthly mission. We can all make a positive difference in the world. We can be as a light on a hill. He will guide us! He loves us and always will. . Angels walk beside us and when we know that, we have no need to fear.
Pray each day to touch the lives of others so that they may live closer to the Lord and do His will.
I love my children and grandchildren and always will.
