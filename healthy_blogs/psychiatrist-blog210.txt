Today's post can be found over on Clinical Psychiatry News where I address a NAMI member's concern's about anosognosia and forced outpatient care.  

You may want to read the article she was responding to first, and do check out the comments on that article:

 and today's post: 

Insight and Involuntary Outpatient Treatment

By all means, return here to tell us your stories about AOT.
