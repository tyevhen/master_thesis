Zyprexa for teen mania is great, except for the Fat Camp Factor -- from the study abstract:
The mean baseline-to-endpoint weight change was significantly greater for patients receiving olanzapine relative to patients receiving placebo (3.7 kg versus 0.3 kg), and the incidence of treatment-emergent weight gain 7% of baseline was higher for olanzapine-treated patients (41.9% versus 1.9%)
The drug did appear to be much more effective than placebo according to the abstract, but I'll have to read the article before I can weigh in on efficacy more confidently. Gaining 7% of your body weight in three weeks? Um, that ain't good. Gimme a D, Gimme an I, Gimme an A (can you see where I'm going here -- diabetes, anyone?)...

Maybe these kids should have been drinking diet soda -- that will save them from weight gain, at least that's what Lilly might tell them. There were 13 "authors" on the study -- apparently being good at recruiting patients counts as authorship, since there is no way that 13 people made a legit contribution to the study outside if recruitment is left out.
