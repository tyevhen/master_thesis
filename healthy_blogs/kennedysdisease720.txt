I did too. I understand there was 104 attendees.

Six of the clinical presentations are posted on the KDA website. I know, it isn't the same as being there and having the presenter explain each slide and answer questions, but it is better than nothing.

Personally, I found the one on Pain and Kennedy's Disease to be enlightening. And, Dr, Jordan's presentation on what causes all these crazy things to happen is challenging a lot of what we were told. I am hoping it leads to breakthroughs.
