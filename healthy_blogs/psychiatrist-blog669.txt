Welcome to Podcast #61. We discussed the following topics:


In the Mid-Atlantic we had an earthquake and a hurricane this week, and Clink talks about her emotional response to the earth shaking. Somehow, we ended up talking about animal reactions.  If you want to read about how the elephants at our local zoo responded, click here.  


Roy talks about continued violations of mental health parity laws by insurers, and about URAC, a group he is associated with and has talked about before.


Finally, we discuss what psychiatrists do when patients commit crimes against them, such as stealing or manipulating prescriptions for controlled substances. Clink discussed the Menedez brothers and notes, "Once there is a threat (against the shrink), there is no confidentiality."
See also, Fully Charged Battery, a post Clink wrote in 2006.
