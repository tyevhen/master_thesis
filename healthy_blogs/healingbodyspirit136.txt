Ovarian cysts and fibroid tumors often involve blood stagnation, according to Paul Pitchford, author of "Healing with Whole Foods." Turmeric in the diet helps dissolve these growths. Since the ovaries and uterus are not a well-circulated area and growths there resist treatment, a concoction of turmeric, licorice root, and cinnamon bark can help speed up the reabsorption of these growths.

Avoid all sugars, red meat, fatty acids and white flour.

Foods and spices which disperse stagnant blood are turmeric, chives, garlic, basil, peach seed, leeks, ginger or ginger tea, Rosemary, nutmeg and aduki beans.
