I've always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. Big dreams - out of shape woman. (In my defense, I used to be in much better shape, but those days are gone.) So instead I'm going to hike it in my mind, as I try to lose weight for my upcoming wedding. Unfortunately, as well as being out of shape, I'm recovering from leftover breathing problems from the flu, so it may take some effort to start really moving.

Daily goals: get up to 1 hour exercise bike, either lift weights or do an ab workout, 88 oz water, 

Weekly goals: 11,500 calories, <6 Diet Mountain Dews

Longer term goal: get to 140lbs by the end of December

Starting weight: 172lbs




What I will do is keep track of how many "miles" I travel on my exercise bike, and log it as if I were hiking the Appalachian Trail. I will start on Springer Mountain in Chattahoochee National Forest (Georgia). I'm at altitude 3771 feet.
