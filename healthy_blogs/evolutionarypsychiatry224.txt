Happy Sunday!  I uploaded/updated another post on Psychology Today.  And here's a song, too, by Nancy Sinatra.

Bang Bang

How Stress Makes You Sick and Sad  (literal titles work well)

Here's one more song, good for a Sunday.  Jeff Buckely Hallelujah.

And one more.  For good luck.  Mad World (the Donnie Darko remix)

Shucks.  Can't really link a Jeff Buckley song without linking his best one ever:  Lover, You Should've Come Over.
