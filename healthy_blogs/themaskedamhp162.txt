Janine Hudson, who is a recent member of The Masked AMHP's Face book Group (see how much fun it is? Join today!) would like your help on a research project she is undertaking into stress and burnout in AMHP's.

Here are the details in her own words:

Fellow AMHPs we need your help:

We’re looking for Approved Mental Health Professionals practising in England to complete a survey about stress and burnout. The survey aims to determine whether there is a difference in experiences of stress and burnout between the professional groups that perform the AMHP role.

The study has been approved by King’s College London Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery Research Ethics Subcommittee (REC reference number PNM/11/12-23). It is the first survey of its kind since the AMHP role was introduced and with your help we hope it will yield some useful and valuable data.

It is important that AMHP’s from all professional backgrounds complete the study. However we would particularly like to encourage those from a non-social work background to take part as they are still relatively small in number. An information sheet containing further details about the study is displayed on the first page of the online questionnaire. If you would like to read more about and or complete the survey please click on the link below:

We would also be grateful if you would forward this link to any AMHP’s you know that might be interested in taking part.

Thank you in advance for your time and support.

I've already taken the survey. It doesn't take too long!
