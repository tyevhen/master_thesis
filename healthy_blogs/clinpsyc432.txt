Fresh from the Archives of Internal Medicine, a study by Richards and colleagues has indicated that daily SSRI usage is associated with an increased risk of falling and lower bone density, among others. Here are the results as stated in the abstract (I’ve not read the full study):
Daily SSRI use was reported by 137 subjects. After adjustment for many potential covariates, daily SSRI use was associated with substantially increased risk of incident clinical fragility fracture (hazard rate, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.4). Daily SSRI use was also associated with increased odds of falling (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.5), lower bone mineral density at the hip, and a trend toward lower bone mineral density at the spine. These effects were dose dependent and were similar for those who reported taking SSRIs at baseline and at 5 years' follow-up.
Significant sexual side effects, suicide (here and here) and now this? It’s not adding up very nicely for SSRIs. If you are at risk for bone problems, may I suggest Actonel? With such strong research backing it, you can’t beat Actonel for your osteoporosis-related needs (as you can see here and here).
