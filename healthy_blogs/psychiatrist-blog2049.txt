Coincidence? I think not.

I came in to work one day this week and the first thing I saw in the lobby was a four foot tall, plush, stuffed duck. My first thought was, "Omigosh they've been reading the blog." I thought it was very nice for a prison to have an emotional support animal. Then I saw the correctional officers standing at a table talking to salesmen about disability insurance.

I had been taken in by the Aflac duck.
