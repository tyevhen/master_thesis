Okay. It's serious. The Swine Flu is creeping about nationally and globally - and we need to be careful. But don't get caught up in overdosing on television and catastrophizing about what could happen.

News is a money making industry. One that doesn't always make it a goal to report the facts accurately. Gone are the days of tuning in to be informed straightforwardly about local and national issues. In truth, watching the news can be a psychologically risky pursuit, which could undermine your mental and physical health.

Fear-based news stories prey on the anxieties we all have and then hold us hostage. Being glued to the television, reading the paper or surfing the Internet increases ratings and market shares - which raises advertising sales and profits therein.

Don't get me wrong. I'm concerned about the possibility of an influenza epidemic. I live close to where many students have come down with the flu. I am following the tips to keep me and my loved ones healthy and will limit lunching or dinnering out. I'll probably spend more time at home instead of traipsing about town.  One thing for sure, though, is that I'll stay away from mainstream news media, getting my information from places like the Center For Disease Control or the World Health Organization.

So, stay informed but don't slide into the fear.
