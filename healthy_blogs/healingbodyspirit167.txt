In the whirlwind of our lives, I sometimes forget what life was like before we found each other. But then I silently watch as you work in the yard, sit at the computer,carry a grandchild on your shoulders, kneel to pray, cook an omlet and feel the spark of fire I felt years earlier. In the sunset of our years, as we walk hand and hand together I treasure our love. I find no fault in you and when I count my blessings, you are at the top of the list.
