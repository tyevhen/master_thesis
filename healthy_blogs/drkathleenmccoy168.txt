We have a winner of the MyMemories.com digital scrapbooking software (see my "Memories to Keep" post from January 26)!

Shelly from La Tejana will win the free software from MyMemories and is choosing the Holiday Memories template.  Her plan is to build an album of family Christmas pictures and memories from her parents' childhoods. Shelly says she has lots of pictures, but that -- up until now -- they've been like pictures a lot of us have: sitting around in boxes without any organization at all.  She plans to give this album to her parents as a very special gift.

If you have similar dreams -- whether it is to have a digital, printable scrapbook of your children, grandchildren, family vacations, family history or sporting victories -- MyMemories.com could be the answer.  Just click on the My Memories icon at the bottom of my blog (the blog itself, not this post) for a $10 discount!

That way, you. too, can be a winner in all ways!

And warm congratulations to Shelly and the best wishes for much fun and many happy memories as she creates this special gift for her parents!
