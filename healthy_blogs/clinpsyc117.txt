According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest:
A chemist in India plagiarized or falsified more than 70 research papers published in 25 research journals over three years, according to documents obtained by his university. An investigation by Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati, India, found that chemistry professor Pattium Chiranjeevi from 2004 to 2007 published scores of papers that plagiarized other researchers’ work and lifted statements from his own previous articles... A spokesperson of Venkateswara University says that Chiranjeevi retains his teaching position but has been barred from research and from holding administrative positions. "The chemistry in most of his papers is illogical—the chemistry itself is wrong,” said the spokesperson. “How did this get past reviewers?"
Gee, peer review might have dropped the ball? No way!
