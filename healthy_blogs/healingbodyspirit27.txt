Once a week for 20 minutes, sit in a hot bath that contains a half cup of Epsom salts, 10 drops of lavender essential oil and a half cup of baking soda. This combo draws out toxins, lowers stress-related hormones and helps balance your pH levels.
Drinking green juices and also lemon juice will help balance pH. Cucumber, spinach, celery and little ginger are a cleansing alkaline drink.
