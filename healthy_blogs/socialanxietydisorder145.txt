Question :
Large, durable quality backpack shopping?
Hi, I m shopping for a new backpack for work. I m a construction worker in the Boston, Ma. area and my current "High Adventure" brand hiking backpack is pretty beat up. I would buy another pack of this brand because it has been very good to me, but I can t seem to find that brand for sale (new).
Please give your opinion on which high quality backpacks would work well for me. There are certain qualities the backpack must have.

1) Large. At least 1 large main compartment that can fit a 17 inch hammer with tool belt, 3 extra shirts, rain gear including boots, personal protection: gloves, glasses, respirator etc. (2 of each) and a small lunch box (fits two 1 liter bottles of water and what ever I can fit between them.

2) Durable. I work demolition and it s as if a bomb went off. Construction debris is every where, sometimes landing on my backpack. It will rest on concrete and sometimes slide a foot or 2, so it has to have a reinforced bottom and tear resistant shell. It must be able to carry about 30 lbs at all times and sometimes up to 50-60 lbs. without sometime tearing or ripping off.

3) Weather proof or resistant. I ride the commuter train and subway then walk to my work locations. Boston gets all sorts of weather. Sometimes I have to work in the rain, snow or hot sun.

4) Comfort. Waist and chest straps and back protection in case I fall backwards and land on it, which has happened.

I realize asking for the backpack to be lightweight is a bit much, but it would be nice. I possible please provide a picture of the product and your personal experience with the product.

Thank You.
Answer :
A Duluth backpack is rugged. Chinook has a portage pack with side pockets for securing a paddle or axe or large hammer. Various portage drypacks would work. You probably need at least a 50 Liter backpack.

Question :
Do you find this poem to have certain predictive qualities to it?
Dinosauria, We
by Charles Bukowski

Born like this
Into this
As the chalk faces smile
As Mrs. Death laughs
As the elevators break
As political landscapes dissolve
As the supermarket bag boy holds a college degree
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
As the sun is masked
We are
Born like this
Into this
Into these carefully mad wars
Into the sight of broken factory windows of emptiness
Into bars where people no longer speak to each other
Into fist fights that end as shootings and knifings
Born into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it s cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charge so much it s cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this
Walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Muted because of this
Castrated
Debauched
Disinherited
Because of this
Fooled by this
Used by this
Pissed on by this
Made crazy and sick by this
Made violent
Made inhuman
By this
The heart is blackened
The fingers reach for the throat
The gun
The knife
The bomb
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive god
The fingers reach for the bottle
The pill
The powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
We are born into a government 60 years in debt
That soon will be unable to even pay the interest on that debt
And the banks will burn
Money will be useless
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs
Land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shake the earth
Radiated robot men will stalk each other
The rich and the chosen will watch from space platforms
Dante s Inferno will be made to look like a children s playground
The sun will not be seen and it will always be night
Trees will die
All vegetation will die
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The sea will be poisoned
The lakes and rivers will vanish
Rain will be the new gold
The rotting bodies of men and animals will stink in the dark wind
The last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases
And the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition
The petering out of supplies
The natural effect of general decay
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that.
The sun still hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter.

Question :
Atheists: Do you feel that religion does have certain cultural unifying and fostering qualities?
Culture is a difficult thing to measure, of course, but if you asked most people, I doubt you d find many who say it s completely and absolutely without importance whatsoever.

So do you feel that at least, religion had an historical value in unifying human groups in more or less coherent societies and, also, foster culture: Michelange, Averroes, Taoist monasteries, etc... Even the lands unified under the Aztec system had advantages to offer, what we call a unified civilization.

And are some religions better than others in that respect?
Answer :
Yes, as an organization it has many positive benefits. I just wish we can have it s benefits without the fairytale.
