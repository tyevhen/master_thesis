As I have mentioned in several earlier posts, laryngospasms are something that many of us living with Kennedy’s Disease experience.  It can be frightening for the person having the spasm as well as anyone watching.

A friend with Kennedy’s Disease found this video on YouTube and shared the link in our KDA Forum.  The video is less than five minutes long, but does a good job of explaining and showing what happens when we have a throat spasm.

“Dr. Robert Bastian of Bastian Voice Institute explains laryngospasm with video of the larynx and a simulated attack.
Laryngospasm is a sudden, often severe attack of difficulty breathing, typically lasting between 30 and 90 seconds. Usually the individual makes a frightening noise while trying to breathe in during the episode, which they often call a "choking attack. You will hear the types of noises often made by the person experiencing laryngospasm, and see what the vocal folds are doing at the same time.”

The simulation spasm clearly shows what we experience as the throat closes and then begins to relax.  The sound that is made reminds me of my gasping for air when a spasm occurs.
