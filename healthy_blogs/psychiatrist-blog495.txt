Remember a few years back when I was posting parts of a novel I was working on?  If you don't, that's fine, it was a long time ago. And then I got side tracked writing Shrink Rap and blogging and pod casting and blogging some more. 


Recently, I've started working on Double Billing again, and I got some feedback from a professional on what would make it more marketable.  I've tried to incorporate those suggestions, and part of this involved re-working the story in third person, rather than as a first person narrative.  


If you enjoy fiction, I'd love to get your thoughts on the first couple of chapters, before I once again think about searching for an agent, or maybe kindle e-publishing this.  Oh, please beware, there's no erotica or sadomasochism, if you're a 50 Shades fan, it may be a bit dry.   If you're up for reading, click HERE.  And Thank You!
