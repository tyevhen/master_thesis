Dr. Deb is wishing everyone a Happy Stigma Free Halloween on her blog.

Here at Shrink Rap, we're all in favor of Halloween. Please do forward us any leftover chocolate. Clink's already been carving-- see above. I'm going to try a giraffe pumpkin this year, late start and all. We'll see if the photo is blog-worthy.
