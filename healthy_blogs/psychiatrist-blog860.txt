Paul rejects Frances yet again. He wouldn't run lines with her last week, and this week he won't accept tickets to her play. He suggests she bring her sick sister or her estranged daughter, but Frances isn't biting.

She talks about how her dying mother came to see her in play; they celebrated with champagne. But the trip was hard on her mother and she feels guilty for having had her mother come at all. She was no good when mom was sick-- "inept" and vomited in the hospital sink. Her sister's illness has revived all these issue around death.

Who is Frances? She puts herself down and she can't accept a compliment. Fame and accolades and she goes home to a dark apartment and soup from a can. She checks her makeup in the mirror before she leaves the session and worries about who might be in the waiting room. She feels like a empty receptacle that can never be filled.
