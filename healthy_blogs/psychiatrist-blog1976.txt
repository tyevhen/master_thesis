from Bye-Bye Blogger, Questions for Lee Siegel in today's New York Times Magazine:


"Everyone seems to be be fleeing from the responsibilites that come from being who you are. I think that is why the blogsphere is thriving. It allows people to develop a fantasy self."

Mr. Siegel was suspended from The New Republic, where he's been a senior editor, for posting anonymous comments on his own blog. How do I get someone to pay me to write a blog???
