Music moves people, it moves mountains.  It brings people together; people from all different walks of life.  It motivates.  It inspires.  And most importantly for our sake, it has been proven to help people deal with depression.

There are mountains of evidence to suggest that music can help people deal with depression and ultimately end their depression.  Depressed people lack pleasure and motivation and at times, have a difficult time concentrating.  Most depressed people are naturally in the low spectrum of mood; they feel down or sad most of the time.  Music can help depressed people boost their mood and increase their ability to concentrate.  Music for depression can also boost intelligence and make us healthier.     

If used daily and in conjunction with other treatments, music may even be able to help you end depression.  In particular, if you are able to combine music with physical activity, you will most assuredly feel happier and less depressed.  As you know, exercise increase serotonin in our brains causing us to feel happier.  Music can be a daily source for you to learn how to deal with depression.
