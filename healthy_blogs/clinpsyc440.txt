A youth correctional facility in Arkansas had some problems in the fairly recent past. What kind of problems?

Well, the private firm that was formerly contracted to run the facility, Cornell Companies, "was fired last year for inappropriately injecting children with antipsychotic medications" according to an AP report.

Nice. Now the State of Arkansas has hired another private firm, G4S Youth Services of Virginia, which will assume control of the facility in a few days. I couldn't find any further information on this, but it certainly jumped out at me.
