Blogging was the last thing on my mind this past week. My wife’s father unexpectedly passed away on Thursday.

With his loss I am once again forced to consider “the fragile nature of life.”

You just never know what will happen next
And, you can never count on anything.
It also reminds me to:
Live for today
Stop harboring resentment
Choose my attitude rather than let it control me
Release any anger that I am holding on to
Count my blessing every day
Stop clinging to unrealistic expectations
Accept who I am with my current capabilities
And, most importantly, I need to always “be there” for my loved ones.


Some might consider this article a little negative, but it is not meant to be. In fact, it is uplifting for me. The loss of a family member and friend is a wakeup call to live more in the moment.
