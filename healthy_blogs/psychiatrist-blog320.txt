Back when I was concerned that Maryland might pass a law requiring mental health professionals to report dangerous patients to the FBI's database, I sent some robo-emails to legislators opposing House Bill 810.  Today, I got the following reply from a state senator (not mine):

Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2013 9:45 AM
To: Jacobs, Nancy Senator
Subject: Opposing House Bill 810

Dear Senator Jacobs,
I am writing to let you know that I strongly oppose the passage of House Bill 810.

Dear Ms. Dinah:

Sincerely,

Legislative Aide to Senator Nancy C. Jacobs
