I suppose I could rant---quite easily now, as a matter of fact---about the cost of re-certification exams. I mean really, what are they spending a $2100 registration fee on? It's a computer test, for heavens sake. No one even needs to score it. I know what programmers get paid so I can tell you that money ain't going to the techies who built the thing. If the project was outsourced to India they could have hired over 200 computer programmers for the cost of one physician's registration fee. I suppose I could be comforted by the fact that I'm supporting 200 Indian families, but somehow that just doesn't cut it right now when I'm mainly concentrating on not failing the test.
