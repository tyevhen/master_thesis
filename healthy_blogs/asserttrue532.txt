First impressions count.

Being a category leader has no meaning if existing products are crap.

Never aspire to be best-in-category. Define a new category.

Never compare yourself to the competition. Your only competition is yourself.

Never borrow someone else's bar and set it higher. Design your own bar.

Refactor your thinking so you don't have to refactor code.

Good ideas are overrated. Good implementations are not.

A pig with lipstick is still a pig.

Excellence cannot be retrofitted.

If you aren't making mistakes, you're not doing it right. 

You can always do better.
