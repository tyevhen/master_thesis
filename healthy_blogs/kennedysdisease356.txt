Ed Meyertholen came across this research paper on Kennedy’s Disease and  the effect of testosterone on the disease.  Previously it was assumed that since testosterone appears to be the instigator of the onset of Kennedy’s Disease as well as the failure of a testosterone trial in 1999, that testosterone injections would be more harmful. 

This research report indicates that there appears to be no harm to mouse models when given additional testosterone.  As Ed indicated in his email to me, however, this testing was done on mice and not on humans. 
Testosterone Treatment Fails to Accelerate Disease in Mouse Models
  Doctors Erica S. Chevalier-Larsen and Diane E. Merry reported in Disease Models & Mechanisms:


Transgenic AR112Q and non-transgenic mice were implanted with timed-release pellets designed to deliver 4-6 ng/ml of testosterone for 90 days. Over the course of the experiment, implantation of testosterone pellets increased circulating testosterone an average of threefold, from 0.40±0.23 ng/ml; this is a significant elevation of testosterone levels in treated animals over those implanted with placebo pellets. Although 90-day testosterone pellets were used, we observed a decline in potency of the pellets by the end of the 90-day period (months three and six).


Implantation of new pellets at the end of 90 days restored circulating testosterone levels. Although circulating testosterone was elevated in treated mice, motor function assays did not reveal
any effect of testosterone treatment on phenotype. Motor function assays were performed monthly for 6 months; results were consistent for all 6 months of treatment. Beginning at 3 months of age (1 month following treatment), AR112Q males showed decreased rotarod performance, regardless of T-treatment, when compared with non-transgenic T-treated males.
