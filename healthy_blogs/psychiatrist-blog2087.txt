In today's New York Times Magazine, The Soprano's Lorraine Bracco is interviewed in The Doctor Is In :

Why, on "The Sopranos," did you choose to play a psychiatrist of the Jungian school in particular?
It's what I wanted to be. I like that psychiatry better. I identify with it better.
What's wrong with Freud?
You know, I don't really know enough about it to discuss it on a bigger level, but I went the Jungian way in the show.

Maybe someone can help me here: what, exactly, is Jungian about Tony Soprano's psychotherapy with Dr. Melfi?
