The UK is currently gripped in the comedic clutches of 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here' mania.  Launched in 2002, the reality show makes for cringe worthy yet compelling viewing.

For those of you who don't know (where have you been?) our national treasures, Ant and Dec, send twelve celebrities deep into the Australian jungle, set them a series of hideous challenges and allow us, the viewers, to vote on their fate - simples!

We can send supermodels over a hundred foot ravine on a tightrope or make a sports hero eat kangaroo testicles - who wouldn't want to watch that?!

As my November challenge is all about my participation in NaNoWriMo I began to look at the similarities between the popular reality show and NaNo.  You may be surprised...




 
    Sleep Deprivation
Camping in the jungle surrounded by spiders, wild animals and inclement weather.
Hunger
If they fail the challenges then the celebs live on rice and beans.
  Challenges
Buried up to your neck in a cockroach pit, eating a crocodile penis, suspended mid-air in a box full of spiders.
     

  Sleep Deprivation
Can’t remember the last time you slept in your bed and not at laptop/kitchen table.
  Hunger
Can’t break off…so close to the end of your word count…the fridge is so far away.
  Challenges
Your main character is buried up to his neck in a cockroach pit, your evil mastermind makes his victims eat crocodile penis and your plot twist involves your heroine being suspended in mid-air in a box full of spiders.
   

I do hope my fellow NaNoers aren't subjected to too many hideous challenges before the finish line.

If you are looking for a plot twist or two it may be worth your while to tune in and watch a couple of episodes...you may just end up wearing a NaNo crown along with the King or Queen of the jungle!

Do you watch the show?  Would you be able to do the challenges?

Are you a NaNoer, what challenges have you set your mc?

9 Days left - Deep breath and dig in...you are so close to that crown.
