Here's a couple items for the curious:

If you've never been inside a prison cell (here's hoping that's most of you), I'm giving you a link to a virtual tour of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Specifically, a single cell inside the control unit prison.

And for readers who would like to send a "goodie package" to their favorite lifer in New York, here's a link to the Prison Store. And before you comment, I can tell you right now that they don't carry shanks, sedatives, tattoo kits or a "lock in a sock". If you thought profiteering in mental health was bad, take a look at this.

If you can't find your favorite lifer, you can try the inmate lost-and-found for state inmates, or the Federal Bureau of Prison inmate locator. (Yes, you can find the Unabomber. If you can spell his name.)
