I just received a call from a friend. He had a triple bypass and a stent implanted a week ago. He now has three weeks of rehab before he can go home. From the sounds of it, he is fortunate to be alive.  

His call reminded me of how we can become caught up in gift giving, decorating, parties, and the far too often stress associated with these events, and forget about what is truly important.

Why does it take something like the above incident happening to a family member, or friend, to force us to take a step back and examine our priorities? Health and happiness, mixed in with a lot of love, has to be the greatest gifts we could ever give and receive.  

From our house to yours,
