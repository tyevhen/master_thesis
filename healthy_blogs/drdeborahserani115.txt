Psychological Science reports that reading motivational words can really help you reach goals. The subtlety of these positive subliminal messages register in the subconscious mind. When absorbed, these motivational cues can help to create positive change.

Make sure the words or phrases you choose are within view- so that you can subconsciously keep your motivation going, even when you may not be on task. Be it sticky notes, motivational pictures, doodles or music, keep the communication upbeat and nurturing.

I am working on a big project, so my inspirational words would be Dream Big. I made the photo above with Flickr Toys , and use it as my screen saver. I have a few Post Its in neon colors around the home and office with the same phrase. And I have an iTunes playlist with dream themes!

So, what would your motivational words be?
