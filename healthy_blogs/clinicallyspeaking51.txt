Whether you are mental health professional or someone who follows our wars, hopefully you have been made aware of the ever increasing problem of our veterans not given the proper mental health care. In the past 5 years, mental health problems increased by 20% due to some sort of traumatic brain injury. President Obama as well as his predecessor had tried to combat(excuse the pun) these problem that veterans are encountering. Obviously they cannot protect our troops while in active duty, but they can implement less bureaucratic steps for when they return home to get proper mental health treatment.

Check out this story written by Lena Groeger, in June 2011 called, Veterans Die Facing Mountains of Red Tape . It isn't a long article, it is just the tip of the iceberg of what these veterans are going through when returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan.
