As I mentioned in my dutasteride update, I upped my exercise routine to 120 minutes every other day this last month. Guess what? I was becoming bored.

  I found myself not enjoying the exercise program as much as I have in the past. I felt it was too long ... versus too much. I also didn’t feel I was gaining any real benefit from the longer routine.

Yesterday I decided to back off a little (less reps) to determine if that would help. I cut back all the upper body exercises by 15%. The exercise program was more pleasant and I did not feel like I was just going through the motions near the end. It took 95 minutes and afterward I felt like I enjoyed the exercise routine again.

It was also nice to have the extra 25 minutes in the morning. So, I’ll try the shorter routine for this next month and not worry about it. If I see the need to step it up, I will.
