An alert reader passed along a job advertisement that blew my mind. It's a fairly standard job description for a faculty position in psychology at Brigham Young University. At the end of the ad is the equal opportunity statement, which reads as follows:
Brigham Young University is an Equal Opportunity Employer sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and requires observance of Church standards. Preference is given to members of the sponsoring Church.
So does this mean that whether you are a white Mormon or a black Mormon, you have equal opportunity, but if you're not Mormon, you're screwed? This does not sound very "equal opportunity" to me. Am I missing something?
