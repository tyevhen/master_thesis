I am very pleased to announce the return of one of my favorite correctional psychiatry bloggers:

FooFoo5 is back after a long abscence. His blog, Turn Your Head And Scoff, has chronicled life in prison (as a psychiatrist) quite vividly and eloquently. We at Shrink Rap welcome him back to the blogosphere.
