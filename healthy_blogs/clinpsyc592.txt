Big congratulations going out to one of my favorite sites of all time -- PharmaGossip. The British Medical Journal very recently featured a brief writeup of his site, which will likely boost the site's already substantial traffic. If you're not following PharmaGossip, you're not in touch with the world of pharmaceuticals.
