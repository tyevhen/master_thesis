I'm about to disappear under the floorboards as I go to housesit Harold the Cat, a place with no Internet access---I truly am a dedicated cat caretaker. Before I go I thought I'd leave with this link from the Washington Post:

From Baltimore Suburbs to a Secret CIA Prison

Apparently one of the CIA detainees being transferred from a secret prison to Gitmo is a former local boy. He is alleged to have planned to blow up underground gasoline storage facilities and to poison water reservoirs. There are a number of reservoirs here in Charm City. Tomorrow, on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, I will be busy feeling happy to be alive and unpoisoned along with my fellow ShrinkRappers. Before today I thought the closest I'd ever come to poisoning was to cook for myself.
