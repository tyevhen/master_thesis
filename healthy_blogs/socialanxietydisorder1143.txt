Commonly question about Addiction
Question :
Addiction??
would u consider something that u crave for night and day an addiction?? what if u loose sleep when u feed the addiction and can t even tell the difference cuz ur just looking foreward to the next "fix"?? how about calling in sick just so u can do this?? If u consider these signs of addiction plz help with ideas of ways to control the addiction or beat it
Answer :
Hello,
It certainly sounds as if this might be an addiction. Only you can decide that, though. If you need help, you should look at addiction resources in your yellow pages. There are many different ways to get support, everything from the traditional Narcotics or Alcoholics Anonymous to Harm Reduction programs (if we are talking about a substance, which it sounds like).
I wish you well!
Just as a tip, please use the spelling check feature on here. I found your message very hard to read. You might also find it difficult to be taken seriously if you spell in slang a lot on here, just as an FYI.

Question :
ADDICTION :(?
i have an issue i get easily addicted :( all my friends think i m a freak because i m like obsessed with michelle pfeiffer
is it normal
why do they think i m a freak just because i ve seen almost all of her movies read her biographies and watched all of her talk show apperences

do you think i m a freak whats wrong with me
Answer :
Nothing is wrong w/you. You happen to like a person & are just learning all you can about her. People study many things, many subjects, & have high esteem for certain people, places & things. There s not a thing wrong w/you. Lots of people have their idols in movie stars, musical groups etc etc. You are no different than they are. Just ignore them & for heavens sake you re "allowed" to like whomever you choose. I ll bet they have their favorites too if they really tho t about it! Do your thing & enjoy what you re doing. It sure could be worse, I can think of MANY worse addictions! Have fun, be free to have fun...:)
