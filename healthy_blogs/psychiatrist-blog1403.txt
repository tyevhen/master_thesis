Psychiatry 101 is a blog about psychiatry by a mom who was once treated for post-partum depression. She has been a welcome commenter on Shrink Rap with some great comments.

So most recently, Psychiatry 101 sent us a link to Tony White's blog. Tony is a therapist in Australia, he has a blog, and his patients and supervisees read it. He writes HERE about what his patients say about his blog.

Several people have suggested to me that my patients read Shrink Rap and don't tell me. I find that perplexing--- why wouldn't a patient just say "Hey, I came across your blog..." ? In real life, I'm not a particularly intimidating person. At least I don't think so.
