(Belated) Happy Blogiversary to Us!
Five Years and Still Blogging

Shrink Rap quietly turned Five on April 21st. We chatter about this while we podcast. We kept it short again and talked about some new medications. Roy mentioned a new antidepressant, Viibryd that's a bit like a combo of an SSRI + buspirone. Dinah talked about a conference she went to on psychopharm update and she read some of the slides that were presented by Dr. Neil Sandson. This led us to talk about some other new medications, including long-acting antipsychotic medications that are administered by injection.

We then talked about Silenor, a sleep medication which is the re-packaging of an older medication, Doxepin, in a lower dose. A phone call to the pharmacy revealed some interesting information about the cost of these medications, but you'll have to listen, or call the pharmacy yourself, if you want the answer.

This all led us to a discussion of the combination medication for the treatment of obesity, Contrave, that did not get FDA approval, and Steve's post on his psychiatry blog, Thought Broadcast, on Contrave compared to Swiffer floor cleaning system. Huh? Oh, listen and maybe we make sense.
