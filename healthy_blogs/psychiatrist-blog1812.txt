This whole British MMC thing is just out of control. If you've been following along on some of the UK blogs in our blogroll (like the Psychiatrist Blog or Trick-cycling or DrCrippen) then you know about how the government has set up this new system, akin to the US "Match", to connect young doctors with training sites. However, they've really botched it, and it seems more like the military, where you go where you are sent. Yesterday, twelve thousand junior doctors marched in protest about this crappy system. It is amazing that this many docs got together to do this. It says a lot about how messed up this is.
"They fear the Government's Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) scheme, designed to speed up the training process to become a consultant, will split families, drive some doctors abroad and force others to leave the profession.
Some 30,000 are competing for 22,000 posts allocated under a computer-based system, plagued by technical problems, that critics say takes scant account of the suitability and experience of candidates.
Concerns about the new system, which was introduced in January, came to a head after The Daily Telegraph gave a voice to angry and dismayed junior and senior doctors."
