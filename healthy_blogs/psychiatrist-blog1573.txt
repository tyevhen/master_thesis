Okay, so we've had 121 votes, our sidebar polls are getting more votes quicker. I'm still having fun. Here are the results... if you scroll down, you'll see something called Zopiclone got a bunch of votes-- I believe this is Lunesta in some other land. Restoril and klonopin can get thrown in with benzodiazepines.
