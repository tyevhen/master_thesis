Open for business for less than a month and the site has now received 500 hits. Yes, I know that big name blogs receive that many or more in a day, but this is a new site and I'm pleased with traffic so far. I'll keep posting and you keep reading, adding your thoughts via comments or email. Thanks for your support!

To celebrate this meaningless number of 500 hits, feel free to subscribe to the site via email on the right.
