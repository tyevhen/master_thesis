On occasion I will have a client with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who has had a lot of counseling, has sought tons of advice and really knows the things they need to do to change. They have read a lot of books and articles on OCD. They have gone through a string of counselors seeking help, but nothing changes.  
At times their OCD...the compulsive behavior...annoys friends, relatives, maybe a spouse and even their therapists.They want to change, so why can't they change?. 

Their  conscious mind knows what to do,  but their subconscious mind doesn't know  or it has not registered. People can reason with them. They can try to  reason with their self, but until it reaches the subconscious mind, It isn't there.  That is why self-hypnosis or hypnosis is good, ...it reaches the subconscious mind and allows change to take place.
