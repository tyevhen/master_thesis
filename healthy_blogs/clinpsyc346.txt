Roy Poses, as usual, has a great take on a story that you just could not have made up, even if you tried your hardest.

Deborah Powell, the Dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School, has taken a board of directors position for PepsiAmericas, which is interesting considering that Pepsi consumption promotes both tooth rot and obesity. Don't get me wrong, there is such a thing as responsible Pepsi consumption, but should a Med School Dean be in the position of helping to maximize Pepsi sales? Perhaps she can also be on the Board of Philip Morris or Coors?

Read the whole story, then roll your eyes and/or bang your head, as you deem appropriate.
