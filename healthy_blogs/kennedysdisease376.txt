The beginning of November had me a little worried. I had a difficult time performing my entire routine on Wednesday, November 2. My leg strength felt okay, but my arm strength was off. I had to back off on the number of reps or used lighter weights in some routines.

Even worse, afterward I felt weak. Normally, after my routine I feel ‘pumped’. Within a few hours I was aching, had chills and developed a cough. I then realized I was coming down with
something. I had a terrible night with little sleep because of the constant coughing. I rested Thursday because I continued to feel weak and achy plus I still had a fever. That Friday I felt a little better so I decided to exercise. I had a good, strong 105 minute exercise, but I still could tell I was not fully recovered. Saturday I was feeling fine again.

Other than that ‘bug’ that I caught it has been another good month where I averaged 111 minutes of exercises every other day and 22 minutes on the light days. I still have not noticed any side effects.

  I am once again considering increasing some of my reps or adding more weights because some exercises have become quite easy. I do not want to overdo it, however, because I remember what happened last spring with my over exuberance. The neck weakness I experienced for about a week in May has not reoccurred (thank you very much).

Life continues to be good and I feel I made the right decision by beginning my own dutasteride trial.
