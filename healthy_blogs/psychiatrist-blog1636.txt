The Girl with the Blue Stethoscope has a post today (Why Is It So?) about how psychiatrists are the most interesting lecturers. She has great tastes, huh?
...I have noticed that psychiatrists as a group tend to give the most interesting and engaging lectures of all. Their voices are very natural and conversational in tone even as they lecture on academic topics, their communication skills are excellent, they look relaxed, and of course, they tend to have fantastic (yet anonymous) anecdotes.

I have noticed that medical students as a group tend to have the most insightful blog posts :-)
