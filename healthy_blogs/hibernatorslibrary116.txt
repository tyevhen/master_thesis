Yay! Friday was my last day of being a manager. I just can't wait to taste the freedom of not having to tell people what to do anymore! And I'm really looking forward to the spare time with which to study. Otherwise this week was uneventful. We had a snowstorm which made the drive home 3 times the length it should have been, and I had to shovel knee-high snow out of my driveway in the morning, but at least it was light snow. Sunday I'm looking forward to the Super Bowl. My nephew really wanted to go to a party, so I hunted one down and we'll have a good time. I'm rooting for the Panthers. Not because I know what I'm talking about, but because I'm a cat-person. And panthers are cool. I don't know who my 12 year old nephew is rooting for yet. 

P. S. I know the Panthers lost. I wrote this on Friday.
