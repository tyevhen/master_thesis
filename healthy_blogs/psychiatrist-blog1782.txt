New Antidepressant: Pristiq. Wyeth, who makes Effexor XR (venlafaxine), received an approvable letter for Pristiq (desvenlafaxine succinate), which is a metabolic derivative of Effexor; both drugs are serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Approvable letters have conditions which must be met before the product can be marketed. The Wyeth facility in Puerto Rico must pass FDA's muster, and the marketing plan must be approved, prior to its release for the Major Depression indication. Wyeth is also going after an indication for Vaso-Motor Symptoms (VMS) related to menopause ("hot flashes" in English).
