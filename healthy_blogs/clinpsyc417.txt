A nice little tidbit from PharmaGossip on the latest in the Paxil (US) / Seroxat (UK) fiasco
This is the story of how Britain's biggest drug company deliberately misled doctors into prescribing Seroxat, which it couldn't prove actually worked for teenagers. Not only that, one of its own clinical trials indicated that they were six times more likely to become suicidal after taking it.
Link here. I've got to get to the link to watch Panorama online. Should be eye-opening.
