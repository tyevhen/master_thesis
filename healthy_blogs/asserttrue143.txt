Ever wonder how normal or abnormal your most bizarre thoughts are? That's more or less what Rachel Pechey and Peter Halligan, of the University of Cardiff, wanted to try to find out in 2011 in their study published in Psychopathology. They asked people to rate 17 statements in terms of how strongly they could identify with the statement. Here are the statements and the percentage response rates:

Have you checked out my free book Mental Health Myths Debunked? Tons of info, tons of live links, lots of straight talk about depression, meds, therapy, psychiatry, mental health trends, statistics, and more. And you know me, I call bullshit on bogus ideas (then give URLs to the actual data). The idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything? Myth. Most people benefit from antidepressants? Myth. Antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials? Largely myth. (Half the trials show separation. Half don't.) Electroshock therapy is safe and effective? Bigtime myth. ECT is dangerous and consent forms lie. But don't take my word for it: Read the science for yourself. It's all laid out (with references) in the book. Download ePub or PDF now at NoiseTrade.
