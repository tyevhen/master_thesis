Since this is a creative exercise, let's pretend it's actually Monday. Then let's pretend this isn't a picture of Earth. Describe the picture in a paragraph or two.

There we were, fifty years strong and finally making headway in terraforming Mars. Even Grandma's Black-eyed Susans could take hold in the brittle Martian soil and spring forth with life without help, though Grandpa said those things could grow anywhere. Then the idiots on Earth decided to "dial down" the sun to stave off Climate Change.

Nobody at the UN would listen to our cries for reason. No, they had a consensus. And so they nuked the sun.

Grandpa says that if the sun doesn't recover soon, all that will be left on Mars will be Grandma's Black-eyed Susans to mark our passing. But he said not to worry. The UN knew just what to do to fix things. They had a consensus.
