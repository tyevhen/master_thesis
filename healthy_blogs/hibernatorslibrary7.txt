Hi all! Did you miss me? I know last year I was sketchy. I had so many big plans, and they all fell through. I went manic for the first 6 months of the year, and then had to pick up the pieces of my life for a while. Then, I found a wonderful man, and am now planning a wedding. Yay!



I have only one reading project this year, and because I now know that Real Life will always get in the way at SOME point, I will not recruit others, but make it a personal project which I can put down and take up at any time. Other than that, I just joined a book club which reads one non-fiction and one fiction book per month.
