Neck?
Several have asked about my neck weakness. It seems to be better, but I have also been more mindful of the time I spend at the computer. I also spend an hour or so every afternoon in the recliner with a bog-bone pillow for my neck. It seems to stretch out the muscles and provide some needed support.

It is still easy to get caught up with KDA stuff and spend too many hours at the computer. I just need to be more mindful and the price I pay when that happens.
 
Contacting old friends
Last week’s article about ‘Regrets’ took an interesting spin yesterday. I received a call last night from someone I was friends with in San Diego in 1969. She said her name and asked if I remembered her. I apologized because the name didn’t ring a bell. Then she explained who she was and WOW ... the memories flashed across my mind.

I was still in the service at the time and we dated for a while. We went out to dinner one night (she dressed to kill). On the way home we heard the grunions were running at one of the local beaches. We looked at each other and said, “Let’s go.” She took off her shoes and peeled off her nylons while I took off my shoes and socks and rolled up my pants. We ran up and down the beach that night picking up the fish and throwing them back into the surf while we laughed so hard it hurt.

She talked about me being such a free-spirit at the time and always doing something or going somewhere. We talked about our families and our lives ... and remembered old times.

I believe this was one of those moments that showed me if she can find an old friend (43 years later); I should take the time to find some other friends from my past.
  Birthday
Today I turned 39 (again). People keep telling me I don’t look my age, but I am not certain that is still a compliment.
