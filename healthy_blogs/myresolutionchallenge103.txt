I'm incredibly excited to introduce a passionate author to my blog today.  I am honoured to host Nonnie on the final day of her blog tour and so without any further delay, over to Nonnie...
      Hello, and welcome to the final day of my BETTER PARENTING, BETTER KIDS Blog Tour!  I'm so happy to be here today with my dear friend, Shelley and all her wonderful guests!  I so appreciate you allowing me to share a bit of me with you!
If you've been following my tour, I have been sharing tidbits of advice to help parents, do this job a little better, if they feel they might be failing.  If this is your first day joining us on the tour, then I'd like to invite you back to visit the other stops.  Here is the line-up.  It is my sincerest goal and mission to ensure that my kids and all kids are brought up in a safer world.  With the behavior of some of the kids we see today, if parenting skills don't change and improve, that may not be soon my reality. 

Today I want to share one of my favorite tips from my book,  "THE GOOD MOMMIES’ GUIDE TO RAISING (ALMOST) PERFECT DAUGHTERS, 100 Tips On Raising Daughters Everyone Can't Help But Love!"  I hope that someone can take something from this message and apply it in the lives of their own daughter:

GOALS AND DREAMS

Tip #39

TEACH THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING GOALS AND FULFILLING DREAMS "BEFORE" LIFE SETS IN.  Now that goals have been set, it's time to reach them.  Go after reaching these goals with gusto!  It's imperative that we impart on our daughters the significance of reaching goals and fulfilling dreams BEFORE life sets in.  Boyfriends, Fiances', Husbands, babies, home purchases and minivans won't be all that appealing until life has been lived to the fullest.  (What, you're not excited about the minivan?) And, when your daughters look around and see all that they have accomplished on their own, that's the time they will say, "OK, now I'm ready for a family of my own." Remember, GOD created for six days and on the seventh, he rested.  Encourage your daughters to create the lives they want for themselves FIRST by working hard, then their family will be their reward and serve as their seventh day.

Make it a great day, people.  The choice is always yours. 
Thanks again, Shelley!
*****
Do the world a favor and pick up your very own copy of  "THE GOOD MOMMIE'S GUIDE TO RAISING ALMOST (PERFECT) DAUGHTERS." If your kids are grown and gone, gift it to them for their kids.  If you don't have kids, gift it to the young mom next door or down the hall who could use the wisdom between the covers of this life-changing little book.  And, if you're just in the mood for a really good read, I can guarantee, this one is a joy!
Thanks so much for stopping by.  LET'S CHANGE THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT AND MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE!

BOOK TRAILER



AUTHOR BIO:



Nonnie Jules is the mother of two beautifully kind daughters, who along with the help of her husband, have turned out to be two of the greatest assets to this world.  THE GOOD MOMMIES’ GUIDE TO RAISING (ALMOST) PERFECT DAUGHTERS is her first published piece of work and two weeks after publication, it hit Amazon’s Top 100 list, where it reached the #7 mark.  With all the violence which is being exhibited by some children today, it is her vision and goal to get THE GOOD MOMMIES’ GUIDE…into the hands of everyone who breathes around a child.  She feels the only way we can make this happen, is if we are all working from a common blueprint.  Ms. Jules strongly believes that every opportunity we are given with a child, should be a teaching one for us and a learning one for them.


So far, Nonnie has authored two other books:  a novel which she released in November of 2013, entitled “DAYDREAM’S DAUGHTER, NIGHTMARE’S FRIEND” and “SUGARCOATIN’ IS FOR CANDY & PACIFYIN’ IS FOR KIDS!” where she shares her no-holds-barred style of teaching us all about support and social media.  Her second parenting guide {THE GOOD MOMMIES’ GUIDE TO BULLY-PROOF KIDS} is due for release the beginning of January, 2015 and the sequel to her debut novel, DAYDREAM’S DAUGHTER, shortly after.  (Both have been delayed due to her extensive workload with RRBC).


She is a fan of the well-written word, and so along with 3 partners, she started 4WillsPublishing Co. in November, 2013 to assist other writers in putting out their best work ever.  By December, 2013, she had founded the RAVE REVIEWS BOOK CLUB where in less than a year, the membership has rapidly grown to well over 500.  If you’re not a member yet, this is your personal invitation to JOIN US!


As you can see, she is an Author on the move and if you’re interested in keeping up with her, here is her contact info (and a good pair of running shoes would help as well):
