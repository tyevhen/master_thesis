I noticed someone was looking under "medicare determination VNS" and stumbled upon my site. I did a little (and I mean very little, sorry) research on the topic. I noticed that Public Citizen recommends (wisely) that vagus nerve stimulation not be covered by Medicare as a depression treatment due to the meager evidence in its support. I suspect that Dr. Charles Nemeroff disagrees.

I could not find any national Medicare policy on VNS, but I found that the state of New York had the following to say: "In 2005, the FDA approved this device for the adjunctive long-term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years of age or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more adequate antidepressant treatments. However, based on review of the available scientific literature and other pertinent sources, this Local Coverage Determination (LCD) finds there is not sufficient evidence or support to pay for VNS therapy as reasonable and necessary treatment for depression."

With this sort of evidence based decision making, I have to say "I [HEART] New York"
