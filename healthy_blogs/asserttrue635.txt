I became aware this morning of a project by the Computer Graphics Lab at Saarland University called XML3D that aims to "add industrial-strength, high-quality, interactive 3D graphics as a built-in, native data type to the Web." Apparently they have done a lot of prototyping in XULRunner. But unfortunately, there are no public downloads yet. Apparently, that'll be coming soon. I can't wait.
