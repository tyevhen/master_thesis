It's the typical shrinky line, so I'm using it to introduce a new website on Mother-Daughter relationships (and all their angsty stuff). Check it out at Motherrr.com ! Ah, the site is run by my sweet Cousin B and her friend, and no, they aren't shrinks.

I'll leave it to Clink to tell you about the Shrink Rapper holiday dinner last night at Mr. Rain's Fun House. Oh, why not: I threw red sea salt at Clink and Roy ate a gourmet dog biscuit that Clink had brought from the Ben & Jerry's store in Vermont. The food was good, too. Purple soup and cotton candy baked alaska, anyone?
