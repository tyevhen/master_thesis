CFIDS and Fibromyalgia are not the same disease, although many people have both CFIDS/FMS. Many of the symptoms are the same such as muscle pain, fatigue, insomnia or sleep problems.
Case definition for CFS (must have at least 4 out of 8 symptoms): Six months of fatigue that reduces function, unexplained by other illness or major psychiatric morbidity, post exertional relapse/malaise, unrefreshing sleep, muscle aches, joint pain, new onset of headaches, attention/concentration and cognitive complaints,sore throat, and tender or painful lymph nodes.
Fibromyalgia Symptoms: Tender points-18 specific spots where the muscles are abnormally tender to touch, chemical or food allergies (also true in CFIDS),dizziness and loss of balance, extreme fatigue, jaw pain, irritable bowel, and headaches.
