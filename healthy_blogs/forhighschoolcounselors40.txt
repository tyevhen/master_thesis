As summer comes to a close, so does the opportunity for preparing for the beginning of the school year.  Summer is a great time to organize your office space, gather forms, purchase books, and buy your counselor swag.  In this post I have provided some suggestions of where you can purchase or find free (yes, free) resources.  Also, I have provided links to books specifically targeting high school counselors.  Hope you enjoy!!
