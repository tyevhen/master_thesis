Happy New Year everyone, I'm back. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, but I'm here. I had a wonderful break, the Fall of 2007 was a very stressful time here, and so I'm hoping for calmer days in 2008. It started out pretty good dancing on the beach at midnight as the year began.

So warm weather zones, while wonderful for the soul, are just not good for frizzly hair. I was at breakfast, a few days after 2008 rang in (I lost track of the days on vacation) and the waiter at breakfast took one look at me and said "Your hair, it stands straight up, it's like a cat that's scared!" Oy. These things bounce off me, humidity, I forgot to pack a brush, I'd slept on it. But then I snuck away after breakfast to check my e-mail (I was good, I only checked it twice) and I see that ClinkShrink and Roy are doing a superb job keeping up the blog, and that Clink has wished me a year of good hair days. Funny, but I felt like maybe this wish, on the heals of the waiter's comment, might not be such a good omen for 2008.
