Whew, after a week I have finally narrowed down my list of 124 counseling and non-counseling pinterest pages that I regularly follow.  Although I follow 931 pages (I know I am obsessed!), these are the pages that pop up the most on my home page with helpful resources. Since it is summer, check out the pages below and I am sure you will find loads of resources for the new school year.  

Oh, by the way, I am always looking for new pages to follow so feel free to message me any pages that you like!!

Happy Pinning!
