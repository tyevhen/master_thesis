A recent study has noted that turning to comfort foods can increase mood and decrease loneliness.

The paper, to be published in the journal Psychological Science, reports that when we eat comfort foods, we reconnect with warm feelings and meaningful associations to others. Jordan Troisi, co-author of the study, noted that even just thinking about the comfort food or writing about it increased emotional well being.

No doubt that the kinds of comfort foods will differ in definition from person to person, but healthy or indulgent, eating your favorite can summon a better mood.

Like the picture above, my favorite comfort food would be soup related. Indulgent would be a chocolate croissant and a cuppa. What's your favorite comfort food?
