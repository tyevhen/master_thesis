My "mother" just ordered your book, Depression is a Choice. So we'll both give it a full read as soon as it arrives. I was able to get the "gist" of your perspective on depression via the Google book review tool. As a result, I must say THANK YOU for the powerful, brave, "jolting" thoughts, Ms. Curtiss!!

For what it's worth, I gave ya some good feedback on my blog...
