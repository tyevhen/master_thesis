It is Thanksgiving in the USA today. A tradition in my family is to take a moment before we eat to give thanks.  Keeping with that tradition â€¦

Thank you ... every one of you ... for your strength, your support, and your perseverance.

Remember ... never lose hope. With faith and hope, all things are possible.
 
Working together we do make a difference.
