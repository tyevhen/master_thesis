This was a pretty good week for me. On Monday I went to a steakhouse with my family to celebrate mine and my mom's birthdays. I'm one of the lucky ones who can say that I love spending time with my family. And on Wednesday, I went out to celebrate again, this time with my boyfriend and my best friend at a woodfire grill. Yum! On Thursday, I saw my nephew play football. This time the teams were more evenly matched, so it was a good game, even if it did start raining at the end.

I got over-eager this week and started signing up for stuff in the blogging world, which I've been trying to cut down on since I know I'll be busy with my Bible group read next year. (Yes, I keep bringing it up, but that's because I'm excited.) I signed up for Dewey's 24hour Readathon. I've participated once before, but have never had an opportunity to go the full 24 hours. I'm going for it this time. I've already borrowed a bunch of graphic novels from the library to read when my head starts getting weary. Here's my reading list below (the readathon isn't until the 22nd, so this is subject to change):


I also signed up for a reading of Men We Reaped, by Jesmyn Ward, with the Social Justice Book Club over at Entomology of a Bookworm. I voted to read Neurotribes for November's edition of Doing Dewey's Nonfiction Book Club. And I joined Litsy. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Litsy, it's like an Instagram for book lovers. As far as I can determine, it's a social network that is available only as an app on  your phone. It's pretty darned amazing. I'm @the_hibernator. 



On my blog, I wrote two posts about How to Read the Bible  (Chapter 4 and Chapter 5), by James Kugel, and a review for To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee.
