Laughter is the best medicine. Did you hear the story about the rich Brazilian who sent his Uncle a rare parrot for Christmas. When the Nephew asked how they liked it they said, "It was delicious."

Outraged that they had eaten the bird, the Nephew said, "He could speak five languages."

To which the Uncle replied, "Why didn't he say something?"
