In My Three Shrinks Podcast #63 (recorded last Sunday, to be out as soon as Clinkshrink completes it), we talked about  reviewed iTunes apps helpful for screening for or tracking depression. I will provide a bit more focus on this topic here.

I recently wrote an article for Clinical Psychiatry News referring to the iPad as the new physician's "black bag." One of those tools might be a depression tracking app, to be used by patients or by providers responsible for treating patients. So, I went to the App Store (sorry Android users, I don't have one of those gizmos yet) and searched for the keyword "depression" and narrowed it down by filtering for apps which met the following criteria: Medical category; a rating of at least 3 stars; and at least 100 ratings.

Five apps came up:


3D brain



9600 ratings
not a rating tool but a nice 3D map of the brain
interactive features







Sad Scale Lite


800 ratings
uses a Zung depression rating scale








DepressionCheck

700 ratings
uses a 27-item validated screen for depression, bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety
displays graph of scores over time
ability to send to your doctor
also has a physician dashboard for reviewing trend of scores for all your patients

















Moody Me

600 ratings
an emoticon-based mood diary
displays a graph of your scores over time











Health through Breathing: Pranayama

300 ratings
not a rating tool, but a highly-rated meditation tool
some graphing functions






















If you have used any of these, please tell us about your experience. If you have others you like, let us know.
