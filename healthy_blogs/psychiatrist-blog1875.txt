Topics include:



New Yorker Magazine (Sep 18, 2006): Mind Games: What Neuroeconomics tells us about money and the brain, by John Cassidy. The neuroanatomy and functional connectivity that lies behind our economic decisions and risk aversion. As measured by functional MRI imaging (fMRI), the constant tug-of-war between the orbitofront al lobe, the amygdala, and the insular cortex mediates everyday economic decisions. Related links include the Neuroscience Marketing blog, New York University's Center for Brain Imaging, Google "neuroeconomics", and the Omnibrain blog (one of our favorites).
Book "Paving Wall Street: Experimental Economics and the Quest for the Perfect Market", by Dinah's brother, Ross.
Dinah refers back to a Shrink Rap post on compulsive blogging and to another one on a combination Wellbutrin (bupropion)/Revia (naltrexone) pill called Contrave for weight loss.
The Interview Room, a novel by forensic psychiatrist Roderick Anscombe, provides insight into how the brain betrays people's lies. His website provides 14 tips on how to spot the liar (very interesting reading).
Washington Post (Oct 30, 2006): Using fMRI machines to detect lies. See also website for No Lie MRI.
Be nice to Dinah, who had a bad day.
