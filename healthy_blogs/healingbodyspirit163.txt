Dear Patty.
I attended your class in October and the next day I went on the alkaline diet. I mixed up salad greens in apple juice and drank those. All the fibromyalgia pain left. I am on my 7th week of eating vegan. I feel so much better. I am grateful for your class thank you so much. I wanted to let you know how well I was doing. Everytime I start hurting I drink a green drink made out of salad greens and water now as the apple juice really cleaned me out. Now, I can put an apple in it and that doesn't give me cramps.
