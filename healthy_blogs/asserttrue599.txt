Skype has made its filing with SEC, ahead of what will no doubt be the biggest IPO of the century. Interesting tidbits from the filing:
Skype's (top-line) run rate is $812 million per year
28 percent of total Internet users have signed up with Skype (506 million people)
40 percent of calls are video-chat
6 percent of users pay
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2010 was $115.7 million, up 54 percent from a year ago
The company has $85 million in cash
Add it all up and what do you get? Nothing less than the dial tone of the 21st century, I'd say.
