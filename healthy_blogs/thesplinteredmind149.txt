Read in the Science Daily the other day that Doctors are more likely to prescribe the medications a patient wants if the patient has seen the ad on TV. So all those annoying ads where you were told to ask your doctor about the purple pill worked. Simply amazing. It is my opinion that most doctors aren't negligent, but they are overwhelmed by the onslaught of new drugs crossing over their desks every day. It doesn't surprise me that they are more likely to respond to patient requests in this manner. Maybe they are even relieved. Would YOU want to keep up with all those melodicly named meds and their lists of cures and longer lists of ills? Most doctors respond to any patients request when the patient seems to know what they want. They are busy people and an informed patient makes their job easier, especially when the HMO has the nurses standing outside the door with a stopwatch.

"You have 90 seconds to cure this man. Go! Go! GO!"

"Hey, doc! I saw this ad on TV that said.."

"Yep, here ya go! Take two of them and call me in the morning. Bye!"

It's a scary world out there, people. I wish I had learned to check and double check side effects and poor drug combinations before taking the cocktail that put my life in a tailspin. Don't take the ads' word for it. Don't just take your doctor's word for it. Have a nice long chat with your pharmacist, too, before popping designer meds you heard about on TV. Somewhere in there you will find out what you need to know to be informed.
