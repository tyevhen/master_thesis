I have discovered a blog (simply titled Atypical Antipsychotics ) that I believe has some serious potential. It has the following things I like in a blog:
Sarcasm
Unwillingness to blindly accept marketing department-generated BS
It disses Invega
Not sure what more anyone could want in a blog, really. Only a few posts so far, but you can bet that I'll be watching it like a hawk. And I invite you to do likewise.
