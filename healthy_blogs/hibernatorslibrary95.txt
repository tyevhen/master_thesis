Back with my old blog, I always wanted to host a Mental Illness month theme read; however, I have a mental illness of my own and always failed to follow through on my big plans. This year, I'm going to do it. Welcome to Mental Illness Month 2016. If anyone wants to join, during the month of May 2016 you can post a book review (or any sort of blog post about mental illness or suicide). Let me know what and when you've posted something, and I'll tell people to stop by and look at your post! This will be really informal, so you can join any time during the month of May, you don't have to sign up in advance. The book (movie) can be fiction or nonfiction. 



Masanobu from All the Pretty Books and I plan on reading 10 Days in a Madhouse, by Nellie Bly. If anyone wants to join in, we can do a group read, and I'll post questions about it the last week of May. 

Comment if interested! If you want to tweet about it, use the hashtag #mentalillnesshop.
