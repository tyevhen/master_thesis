I hope you all enjoyed the posts on addictions, and you get a small taste of what is going on in the world of treatment and different addictions that people are facing in 2012. I must apologize, I had hoped to interview some therapists and substance abuse counselors in the field, but the professionals I had been contacting were unable to be interviewed for the blog. When they do become available I will interview them and post them ASAP.
