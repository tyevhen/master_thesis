The Well of Lost Plots, by Jasper Fforde
narrated by Emily Gray
After Thursday Next's husband is erased from existence (eradicated), she decides to take a break from the real world by vacationing in the Well of Lost Plots. She finds a nice unpublished book to hide in - and in her spare time she begins an apprenticeship with Jurisfiction - the group responsible for policing fictional characters. 

This is the third book of the Thursday Next books, and although not as great as the first, it was quite funny. It has some healthy British humor and is probably one of the weirdest alternate realities I've ever read. Highly recommended. 


Something Rotten, by Jasper Fforde
Narrated by Emily Gray
Now that little Friday Next has been born, Thursday decides her son must meet his father - eradicated or not. Thursday returns to the "real" world and takes her job back in Spec Ops. She keeps herself busy smuggling Danish books out of the country while pretending to hunt them down and burn them, fighting Goliath Corporation for the existence of her husband, and trying to get her town's cricket team to win the championship so that a fictional character won't achieve world domination. 

This fourth book in the Thursday Next series is just as funny as the third. Definitely going to hunt down the next book soon(ish).
