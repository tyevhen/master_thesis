Quit smoking; feel better Never mind conventional wisdom: New research shows people are happier when they quit smoking. (Credit: Mike Cohea/Brown University)
I'm grateful for turning green after smoking too many cigarettes when I was 9 or 10. Smoking always made me queasy. Makes sense that you'd feel better if you stopped smoking, just like you feel better when you exercise regularly and eat a sensible diet. These things are every bit as effective as anti-depressant medication, and, cough, cough, therapy. Hope this post puts me out of business.
