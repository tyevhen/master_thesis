Oh no, the next thing you know, safe sex will be everywhere! A very interesting (and brief) read over at Effect Measure. One quote follows to pique your interest...

"So with condom manufacturers eager to mine a ready market, and with administrators happy to receive free or discounted products that will keep students healthy, condom distribution at many colleges around the country has become as fundamental to freshman orientation as buying textbooks and finding the dining hall."

How about we distribute SSRI's to increase the duration of these frisky college sexual encounters? See my post on that, um, interesting idea here.
