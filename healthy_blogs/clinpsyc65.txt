How did Merck go about training reps to sell Vioxx? Here's part one of three. Thanks to an anonymous reader for sending me along this trilogy. Part 2 is great and part 3 is outrageously funny. Well, I mean except for the part (not included in the videos) where people were dropping dead from taking this newer, "safer" painkiller. Parts 2 and 3 coming soon.
