Lithium is a drug that is used in Bipolar affective disorder and resistant depression. However, it is a rather toxic molecule to the human body. But it is safe within certain dose range.

There are several documented cases of birth defects caused by Lithium in humans. They include Epstein anomaly. It is a heart anomaly that can become a severe problem in later life.

In addition, high doses of lithium can cause several abnormalities in the rat fetus. They include high incidence of cleft palate, growth retardation, brain liquification and pulpy brain, hepatomegaly and digital abnormalities. However, incidence in humans are not available because of the obvious reasons.

But stopping lithium during pregnancy can cause severe relapse of bipolar disorder. Which can result in more damages to the fetus and the mother. So doctors weigh risks and benefits of continuing lithium during pregnancy. Sometimes your doctor may decide to continue lithium with the aforementioned risks. In addition, there are very few safer bipolar maintenance therapy options available to the doctors. Some doctors may change the drug regimen to anti-psychotic medications with mood stabilizing properties such as seroquel/zyprexa.
