Good news! Thanks to many of you who contacted their Congressional Representatives, federal funding for research was increased through FY-2017.

The MDA Advocacy newsletter reported the following:

Congress boosts federal funding for research

This month we thank Congress for including a boost to research funding in the recently passed omnibus spending package that funds the federal government through the end of fiscal year 2017.  The budget package includes a $2 billion (6% increase) for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  MDA appreciates every lawmaker that supports increased funding for biomedical research and thanks to all advocates who urged their members of Congress to help ensure that NIH received this critical funding increase.  As budgeting for fiscal year 2018 moves forward, we will continue to call on Congress to keep up the momentum by committing to robust and consistent funding increases to NIH in this and future budgets.  With four new drug approvals for neuromuscular disorders in the past year and with a robust drug development pipeline, we must continue the push to make NIH funding and biomedical research an ongoing bipartisan Congressional priority.
