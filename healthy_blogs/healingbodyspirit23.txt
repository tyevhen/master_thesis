I have been very concerned about taking calcium supplements since learning
 that calcium can build up in your arteries and cause heart problems or strokes. 

However, I just now read about this and it makes sense to me to take a plant based calcium rather than a mineral calcium. I am not selling or endorsing a product I just wanted you to watch this video in this ad. I stopped taking calcium some months ago, even though I have low bone density, but now think I might buy this.
