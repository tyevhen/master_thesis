National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention: Recommendations for Prevention From the Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force Report--Symposium
 Toronto Convention Centre - South, Level 800, Room 803 A/B, 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM


ABSTRACT:
The stigma around suicide is often associated with whispers or silence, despite the fact that prevention of suicide is a national priority. The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention
convened a national task force of suicide attempt survivors last year, releasing a groundbreaking, federally funded report called The Way Forward. The goal of this report is to provide a framework for national, state, and local stakeholders to use when developing resources and initiatives to prevent suicide as part of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.
This groundbreaking report identified eight Core Values and seven Recommendations that are helping to catalyze major changes in the national approach to suicide prevention and response. The
speakers will discuss ways in which clinicians and others can bring the report's recommendations to life and open channels of communication and awareness around the topic of suicidal thinking.

Chair: Steven Daviss, MD
Discussant: Dinah Miller, MD
