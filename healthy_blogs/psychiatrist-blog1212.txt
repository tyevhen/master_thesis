Last year, I ran continuous blog coverage of the HBO series In Treatment. 35 episodes of psychotherapy sessions with 4 patients over time. The therapists boundaries got blurred. It started out as fun, by the end it was a bit tedious. Readers were writing in, begging me to stop. Roy said our 'hits' went way up.


Apparently, it's coming back. I'm not sure I can do it again. Maybe. What do you think?


Should Shrink Rap follow the new season of In Treatment?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Please, please NO!!!
