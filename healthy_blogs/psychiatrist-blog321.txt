Let me ask you: when someone commits an act of terror -- whether it be a spree shooting or a planting a bomb -- whose fault is it?  Was it a flaw in their childhood?  Poor parenting?  The angry, violent child of angry, violent parents?  Should their parents have known and gotten them help?  What about their psychiatrist?  Should he have known and stopped the criminal?  When things go wrong, we all have theories and we all look for culprits.
