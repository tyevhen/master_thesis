Holiday's are a wonderful way to explore foreign lands or distant parts of your own country.  We love to venture far and wide in search of an escape, but in our quest for adventure we often overlook the simplest destination of all - our own back yard.


By this I don't mean open the patio doors and take in the view of your petunia's, what I do mean is take in the delights of your local area.

During our holiday blog tour for my August challenge I have driven approximately 520 miles (836km), taking in the Cornish coast and the breathtaking beauty of Somerset.  This week I'm staying closer to home and looking at what's available in my local area.

I live 8 miles from Britain's second city, Birmingham.  An amazing city full of rich architecture, museums and famed for its food festivals.

I also live 23 miles (37km) from Stratford-upon-Avon, home of William Shakespeare and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.  A thirty minute drive will take me to Warwick, Royal Leamington Spa and Drayton Manor Park and Zoo.

During the summer months my own home town of Solihull hosts numerous events such as a food festival, craft markets, activities for the kids and music events.

Once you begin to take a closer look at what is available on your doorstep you will be pleasantly surprised.

I attended a writing workshop today, hosted by the fabulous Stan Nicholls, bestselling author of the Orcs series at a venue just 15 minutes from my house.  This is a place I have passed a hundred times, I knew it was there but it never occurred to me to visit with the children. 

This place is Sarehole Mill, a working watermill built in 1750 but a place best known as where JRR Tolkien spent part of his childhood using the surroundings as inspiration for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

Enjoy a 'staycation' and look closer to home for a day out this August, you'll be so glad you did.


Where do you live and do you have an amazing landmark on your doorstep?
