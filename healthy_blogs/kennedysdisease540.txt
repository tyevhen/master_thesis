What it means: If you don't continue to practice or use the ability, you might lose the ability. For example, if a person doesn't exercise his or her physical body, he or she will likely lose strength, endurance, and stamina.



For those of us living with Kennedy’s Disease, even if we use it, we will lose it. However, it might take a little longer to lose it. This is as much about muscle memory as it is motor neuron stimulation. The key for me is that as long as I perform the right exercises, my muscle groups will continue to function better and longer.

It has been four years that I have been exercising every day. In the four years, I have only missed one day. If I didn’t see the benefit, I wouldn’t do it. Or, saying it another way, as long as I see the benefit, I will do it.

Muscle memory helps perform the same functions repetitively. For example, I perform 60-80 steps in place every morning. This particular function improves the muscles in the quads, calves, ankles and feet. It also is a good cardio exercise. When I combine it with side-to-side steps, leg lifts, and calf stretches, I have a good standing program that has my heart pumping..

What do you do to keep the muscles and motor neurons stimulated? Have you noticed any benefit?
