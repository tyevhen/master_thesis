I just returned from my annual wellness physical. This review is an important part of my taking ownership for my health.

A couple of weeks before the physical, I review my Kennedy’s Disease journal for the last year. Important information regarding changes to my health are highlighted and tagged for easy review. I take this information and write a year in review synopsis for my doctor. Changes in strength, capabilities, and other health issues shown including:

What changed, improved, worsened or appeared?
When the situation first appeared or changed?
How long did it last?
What impact it had on my health?

The synopsis is the first thing I discuss with my doctor. It seems to be a good starting point for other health related discussion topics. This morning’s list generated a spirited discussion concerning issues around exercise, swallowing, tongue atrophy, specialty needs in regards to remaining mobile, pneumonia, etc. The best part of these discussions is the catch-ball moments. I explain the situation, he asks follow-up questions, we discuss potential needs and options, and we end up with a course of action and/or understanding. 

The good news from today’s examination; I’ll probably live another day or two. J I am in good health. My diet is good. I am managing my Kennedy’s Disease. I have the support of my doctor should I need any help. 
  For several years I have written about the benefits of maintaining a health and exercise journal. My previous blood workup reports are a part of this journal. At any time I can compare months or years to determine what has changed and why. If you haven’t started your journal yet, please give it a try. It might just change your life and how you live it.
