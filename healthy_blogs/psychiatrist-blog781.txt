I'm making a change in the left top header [update: already changed]. Instead of the star in the orange field, I'm replacing it with Dinah's duck. I've made three design options. Our readers get to pick which one to use.




Update (4/5/2011): Thank you for everyone who voted over the weekend. The middle (yellow) duck won out. We received 132 votes; Google Forms does not provide any mechanism to prevent multiple votes from one IP address, so it is probably less than 132 individuals. Just sayin'.
