My book, "I Recovered from Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia," is now on Kindle and can be checked out from their library.  If you have questions or comments, please let me know. The book is dedicated to all those who struggle with debilitating illness, yet have hope for recovery.
May God hold you in the hollow of his hand and may angels watch over you.
Your body has the intelligence it needs to heal itself.
