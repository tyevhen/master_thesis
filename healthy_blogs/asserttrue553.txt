This is a handy tip for anyone who might be wondering if there's an easy way (a RESTful way) to push hierarchical data into a Java Content Repository, making use of JSON. The good news: There is, indeed, an easy way to accomplish this.

The key is to use the :operation selector (set to a value of "import"), in conjunction with the :contentType selector (set to a value of "json").

Let's take a simple example. Suppose you have a JSON object that looks like:

{ 'jcr:primaryType': 'nt:unstructured',
  'propOne' : 'propOneValue',
  'childOne' : { 'childPropOne' : true }
}

You want this data to show up under /content in the repository tree, with a node of type nt:unstructured. You would simply create a form element in your HTML page and set it up like this:

<form method="POST" action="/content" enctype="multipart/form-data">
   <input type="hidden" name=":operation" value="import" />
   <input type="hidden" name=":contentType" value="json" />
  <input type="hidden" name=":nameHint" value="sample" />
   <input type="text" name=":content"
     value="{ 'jcr:primaryType': 'nt:unstructured', 'propOne' : 'propOneValue', 'childOne' : { 'childPropOne' : true } }" />
   <input type="Submit" />
</form>

Once the user clicks "Submit," the JSON data gets pushed into the repository exaxtly where and how you want it.

If you want to play with this using Adobe's CRX repository (otherwise known as the Experience Server product), you can download a copy of it, along with a free developer license, right here. CRX is the foundational piece of repository infrastructure underlying Adobe CQ and other Adobe enterprise products. It's a JCR-compliant repository (based on Apache Sling) with a lot of great administrative tools and other UIs (including a built-in IDE) included, ready to use. Installation is as simple as double-clicking the (single) downloadable JAR.

Give CRX a try. It's about as straightforward and easy to use as an enterprise-grade content repository gets.
