Many good items have appeared of late and I pass them to you below...
Adverse drug event reports skyrocket. Furious Seasons has the story.
AHRP goes after Lilly's potential blockbuster for schizophrenia. AHRP's take on Dr. Lieberman seems a little harsh, but it's still a good read.
The Last Psychiatrist scores points with a hilarious bit on calculating a commonly used medical statistic (featuring the Flock of Seagulls) and also weighs in on Lilly's hopeful new schizophrenia drug (no Zyprexa pun intended).
How 'bout some antidepressants for babies? Pharmalot has the scoop.
The discredited chemical imbalance theory of depression rears its head again, courtesy of GSK, as reported by Fiddaman.
A long overdue link to the Pharma Girls of Reality TV, courtesy of Cary Byrd.
Coming Attractions: There were many other posts of note, and I hope to get to them later. Also, more WikiScanner goodness to pass along in the next day or two. My take on the latest, greatest antipsychotic from Lilly and the next generation of antidepressants, of which "we can expect therapeutic benefits to appear four to five times more rapidly" than current medications, according to one researcher. I also hope to tackle the SSRI-suicide issue in more depth, but that may take some time. Oh, and an example of why I hate psychotherapy research. All that and more (maybe) to come relatively soon.
