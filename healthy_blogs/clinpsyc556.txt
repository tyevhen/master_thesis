Holy Toldeo! A study published in the BMJ today (Graff et al.) showed a gigantic effect of cognitive-behavioral occupational therapy for mild to moderate dementia patients. I've not seen any type of intervention for any condition yield such a huge effect in quite some time. Essentially, as a result of the intervention caregivers saw themselves as much more competent, and dementia patientsâ€™ functioning levels were much, much higher in the treatment group compared to the control group. The PDF is up on the BMJ site and is worth a read.
