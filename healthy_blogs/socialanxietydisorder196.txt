Pervasive Developmental Disorder, or PDD, is the umbrella term used to cover the whole family of autistic spectrum disorders including autism and Asperger Syndrome. Within this group there is a subgroup called NOS not otherwise specified which covers the conditions which do not quite meet the diagnostic criteria for autism or Asperger Syndrome. Because PDD covers such a wide spectrum, it presents very differently from child to child. Written principally for parents, this is a book which explains what it means for your child to be diagnosed with PDD, NOS, autism or Asperger Syndrome, and where you go from there. The authors describe the symptoms of PDD, what a diagnosis means, how a child fits into the diagnostic terminology and the diagnostic procedures involved. They also review associated disorders such as OCD, and discuss the different treatments and therapies available. The book includes frequently-asked questions, as well as the experiences of other parents.
