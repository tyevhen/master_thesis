This podcast comes out the day after the 1-year anniversary of our blog. Thank you to all of our well-wishers. It's not always easy to keep something like this, and the podcast, going. But having friends like Dinah and Clink make it easy.

Note that next week will be a special podcast, where we will discuss many of the submissions for our May 1 Grand Rounds. Send us your submissions by Saturday, April 28, 2007, at midnight at mythreeshrinksATgmailDOTcom. We'll even include some brief audio comments about your post (attach a 20-30 sec .m3).
