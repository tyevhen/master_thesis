I’d like to thank PsychSplash for the friendly review of my site. At one point, he wrote:
CL Psych writes with raw yet controlled frustration, that borders nicely on sheer disbelief and intellectual curiousity. Do not get me wrong, “Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry: A closer look” is not an open diatribe on drug companies or psychological treatments, rather it is a realistic appraisal of the claims made by companies with vested interests in good results.
Thanks mate! PsychSplash is a site that, among other things, reviews psychology-related sites. For my psychology-oriented readers, it’s a nice gateway to a variety of interesting sites and blogs.
