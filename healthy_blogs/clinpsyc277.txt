If your child is suffering from bipolar disorder, help is available. While I think the linked advertisement is no longer on television (I don't know for sure), Massachusetts General Hospital is nonetheless enrolling patients ages 4-6 with bipolar disorder to participate in a study where they will receive quetiapine (Seroquel) to alleviate their symptoms.

I can only hope that it will be as great of a study as a similar investigation that utilized Zyprexa for adolescents with bipolar disorder. Of course, we know (because someone at Harvard said so) that children with bipolar disorder become suicidal in 75% of cases. Did I mention I have a bridge that I'm looking to sell...

Please read Intueri's post as well as my earlier post to see just how "scientific" the diagnostic process is for kids and adolescents regarding bipolar disorder.
