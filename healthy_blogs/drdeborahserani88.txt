There are many kinds of psychological tests that help us understand the human psyche. Some are standardized, meaning that they have varying degrees of right and wrong answers. While others psychological tests are subjective - having NO wrong answers. These kinds of tests, instead, reveal your perception and inner life as a person.

This is not an actual Rorschach Inkblot (it's unethical to reveal them). But if you're so inclined, share what you see. I'll include my response in the comments so as to not influence yours.
