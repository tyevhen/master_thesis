I've decided to start a series of thought-provoking (I hope) scenarios. These aren't real patients, they're just food for thought. Please chime in.

So how much should one psychiatrist say to his patient about another psychiatrist? Here's the specifics-- a patient wants a referral for her friend. The friend is having difficulties related to his sexual orientation and the patient asks for the name of a gay therapist to give to her friend. She's only asking for a name, nothing about insurance or the specifics of any mental illness. Is it okay for the psychiatrist to give her the name and phone number of a gay psychotherapist to give to her friend? What are the assumptions that are being made here and is this a reasonable thing to do?
