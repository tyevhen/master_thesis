In honor of May as Mental Health Awareness Month, I'll be giving away 2 autographed copies of my award winning book "DEPRESSION AND YOUR CHILD: A GUIDE FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS."

Research shows that children, even babies, experience depression. The clinical term is called Pediatric Depression, and rates are higher now than ever before. In the United States alone, evidence suggests that up to 1% of babies, 4 percent of preschool-aged children, 5 percent of school-aged children, and 11 percent of adolescents meet the criteria for major depression.

Suicide is significantly linked to depression, so early diagnosis and treatment of Pediatric Depression is not just extremely important â€“ it is life-saving. 

Depression is a serious, but treatable condition, but only 38% of adults with diagnosable mental health problems and less than 20% of children and adolescents receive needed treatment.

Learn the signs of pediatric depression and ways to get help. Treatment offers recovery, healing and most of all, hope.
