Wearable walk-assist gets green light for sale in Japan

Cyberdyne's HAL for Medical Use, lower limb type, is designed to help patients with such conditions as ALS and muscular dystrophy.
TOKYO -- Japan's health ministry approved on Wednesday sale of a wearable walk-assist robot for use in medical facilities, underscoring the government's push to promote such products as part of growth strategy.

     The robot could delay the progress of a disorder, or help regain leg function.
     Clinical trials at a national hospital in Niigata Prefecture and elsewhere showed that 24 patients who underwent nine sessions of exercises over a three-month period could walk greater distances than those who did not undergo such exercises.
     "We hope to introduce it initially to eight hospitals including the Niigata hospital," Sankai said. If the treatment qualifies for insurance coverage, the company will work to expand the application to spinal cord conditions, too. ...
