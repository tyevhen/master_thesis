Dear A. B. Curtiss

...Thank you so much for your book Depression Is A Choice which I am finding profound.  (I will try not to be long-winded as you seem to be a busy, productive person.) Your book has helped me immensely and has greatly reinforced some of my own instincts regarding how to deal with my interior thought life.

Here is the reason for today's query. (And thank you so much for taking the time!) 

I have a friend who has suffered from her low moods and reports that  she does not function well in general, and her emotional life is in ruins. That is the long story short.

Though I have tried over and over, I cannot seem to get your philosophy/ideas regarding alleviating depression through to her. So I was hoping against hope you were practicing counseling. 

If you are not doing counseling, perhaps you might still be willing to meet with her for an hour or so. (Or perhaps do a session or more via Skype?) Thank you again, and highest regards P.

Dear P.

I’m so sorry to disappoint you but I don’t do private counseling anymore. You can find a lot of information on my depressionisachoice.com website and many short exercises that might be useful if your friend doesn't want to read a whole book. And if she has any questions about any of them she can email me and I will be glad to answer them. A. B. Curtiss
