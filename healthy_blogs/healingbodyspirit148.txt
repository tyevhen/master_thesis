My grandson has been diagnosed with borderline autism. He is 3 and a-half-years-old and has been struggling with speech and concentration. He would also get very agitated. He has an adopted sister who is nine months younger and she has been communicating and talking in sentences for over a year. Two months ago my daughter put them on a sugar-free, gluten free diet. In addition, she has given them DMG, Ionic trace minerals, and chewable fish oil.
