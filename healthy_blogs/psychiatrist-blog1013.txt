Given the popularity and prevalence of twitter, I put together a list of 50 different doctors on Twitter that you can follow to potentially get some insight on their medical lives. If you wouldnâ€™t mind, could you share my list with your readers?

If you know of any other physicians that you follow on twitter, I'd love to add him/her to the list. Just leave a comment on the blog.

Richard, Richard, Richard, oy~! Where is ShrinkRapRoy on your list? Where is ClinkShrink?
( I don't twitter or go tweet tweet very often so I won't care that I'm not on the list).
