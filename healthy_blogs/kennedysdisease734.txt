It is important to have a good working relationship with your doctor(s). It needs to be a collaboration - a sharing of information and opinions - to be successful.And, as I have discussed in several earlier articles, you must be your own advocate.

Below are excerpts from Dr. Richard Senelick’s article in the CostCo Connection. He offers the following advice to make the most of your next doctor’s visit.
Don’t pretend to understand when you don’t. If the doctor explains something that doesn’t make sense to you, stop him immediately and ask her/him to explain it in terms you can understand.
Be assertive, but friendly. Let the doctor know if you still have questions or concerns.
Tell the doctor what you believe he/she said. This will confirm what you think you heard and will help you remember it for later. Take notes to help remember what was said.
If you feel rushed, ask to schedule another appointment.
If the doctor is busy, ask if there is a nurse or PA who can help answer your questions.
Bring along a relative or friend. Another set of ears is always better.
Ask who you can call if you have additional questions later.
