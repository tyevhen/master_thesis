Pfizer says NO!

"Akzo Nobel NV said its unit Organon and Pfizer Inc agreed to end their collaboration in the further development of antipsychotic drug asenapine, but this will have no effect on the planned stock market flotation of Organon.
Pfizer's decision to discontinue its participation in the asenapine development program 'is an outcome of a commercial analysis of the compound as a part of its overall portfolio,' the companies said."
Organon will continue to develop the product regardless of Pfizer's lack of collaboration. According to www.Clinicaltrials.gov, there are 19 studies that have investigated the drug or are currently recruiting patients. Looks like Organon is swinging for both bipolar and schizophrenia. However, is this compound not late to the game? The atypical market is flooded and I'm going to boldly predict that asenapine will work no better than any existing product. It's going to take a whale of a marketing effort to push this one to importance. For Organon's sake, I hope they can get a better market share with asenapine than they did with mirtazapine (Remeron).
