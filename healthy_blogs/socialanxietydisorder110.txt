Help! Im feeling trapped. My oppressor is a relentless taskmaster, tormenting my waking hours and disturbing my sleep. Whenever I try to settle down this instrument of torture attacks. In the wee hours of the morning (Im usually available around 4:00 a.m. if anyone wants company!) it pounds away at me relentlessly. Until I finally give in and leave my warm, but no longer comfortable bed to do its bidding.
Who is this cruel taskmaster, this architect of anxiety?
It is my To-Do list.
My To-Do list seems to resemble a scene from Disneys Fantasia. No matter how quickly I check off items, they are replaced with even more than I began with. The list overflows like the hapless Mickey Mouses buckets of water.
I tried not making a list but that only made the voices in my head scream louder. To preserve my sanity (and that of those around me) I tried to write everything down. That was list was totally and completely overwhelming (you have a similar list, right?) so I sought advice.
My husband, whose interest in the preservation of my sanity is the strongest, suggest that I dont look at the whole list and just move through each piece slowly and methodically, one at a time. This helped and dinner is still on the table awaiting him every night (although take-out is sounding very tempting).
But the midnight clamoring persisted. Why arent there any offices open at 1 a.m? I have some questions I need answered. Why is shopping the only commercial activity available at that time? And why isnt everyone else responding to my emails as rapidly as Im sending them? Dont they know how busy I am?
Dont they recognize Im depending on their answers?
My frustration only grew. How can I be efficient if no one else is? I told myself. (Instead of what I really should have said: You are becoming a little obsessive; have a drink and go to sleep.")
Perhaps Im jittery from all the coffee I now need to keep my awake (I console myself with the fact that three to five cups a day are supposed to ward off Alzheimers) or perhaps its just the ongoing tyranny of that To-Do list. Can someone else please go to the dry cleaners and the grocery store?
Its not a time management or organization issue I could write those books. Its strictly a numbers game. Theres just a lot to do. And theres really no one to blame but me. I took on all my responsibilities gladly. And I am happy about all of them. Really.
There seems to be only one solution. Hire a personal assistant! No, seriously, I mean a deeper, more spiritual solution. I need help. And while I could (and do) delegate where possible, the real assistance I need is more profound. I need to ask the Almighty to give me the energy and the peace of mind required to accomplish my daily tasks. And I need to remember Hes got my back.

Commonly question about Nice Stop Anxiety Attacks photos
Question :
I was a victim of a brutal attack (please read)?
A few months ago I was seeing this guy my mother worked with, John. My mother had hooked us up because she thought he was a really nice guy and they were very good friends. Anyway a week after seeing him I found out he had a girlfriend. I happened to personally know his girlfriend so I thought it would be best if I told her and I stopped talking to him (wouldn t you want to know if your boyfriend was cheating on you?) So I texted her and she flipped out on me, and then he called me and flipped. I let it go and went to my best friends and a few hours later John called me asking me if we could talk about things. He told me he really liked me and that him and Kayla were officially done and that he was wrong for not breaking up with her, so I said "fine, i ll talk to you but not for too long because I can t be gone too long" so he came and picked me up from my best friends and he said that he had to do an erin real quick and I said alright but make it quick. so he drove me up to this apartment complex (river raisen, monroe michigan) and he told me his friends wanted to hangout with us and I said that I really couldn t go inside because I couldn t be gone too long from Sarah s. and he said fine. a few minutes later my side of the car door opens. i look up and this girl grabs me by my hair and pulls me out of the car. when i m out, John drives away. The girl ripped off the hood of my jacket and starts beating me. This black male (in his 20 s-30 s about 6 0) jumps in and knocks me to the cement. i m face down onto the cement and he over and over again kick s the back of my head (smashing my face) into the cement while John s girlfriend is watching and spitting on me. The other girl was spitting on me too. I begged them to stop. I thought they were going to kill me. after they stopped and I had the strength to get up I ran to the nearest open place I could find (which happened to be a nursing home) the lady was really sweet and she called the police and I was rushed to the emergency room. ever since i ve been afraid for my life. I m too afraid to go out with my friends because I think they are setting me up. I ve been having anxiety attacks. I knew bad things happened, but I never knew that people allowed bad things to happen... the police had made no effort to catch the two people that beat me. nor have they spoken with Kayla (john s girlfriend, and the accomplice). I have heard from several of Kayla and John s x-friends that they had payed these people to jump me. So far all I can do is press charges on John. I don t feel like I got the justice I deserved. What can I do? How can I get that justice I deserved? Any tips? and how much trouble can they get in for this?

I am 16 years old and i m tiny. I didn t stand a chance. I felt helpless and I felt like they were going to beat me to death. I begged them to stop. here are photo s of me the day after:

AND PARENTS; please tell your kids about what happened to me. A guy that me and my family trusted with everything set me up to get jumped by a man, and a girl. I could of been killed with the way they beat me. Nothing can ever cure the emotional pain i ve been in. Tell your kid s not to trust everyone and to make smart decisions because clearly I didn t and I was stupid to of trusted him. I don t want anyone to have to go through what I did.
Answer :
maybe you should do some stuff like self defense and try to build up your confidence to not be scared and carry around a weapon such as a stun gun in these cases
Question :
I dont have a social life? Please help im very serious? I am getting very depressed about it?
hi there guys, im a 20 year old female and i m not very happy with my life. I have absolutely NO social life or that much friends. I only have one that is sorta close to me and just several other acquaintances from school but i never hang out with them. Back in high school, I wasn t confident at all, infact i was extremely insecure, still am today. Due to my extreme shyness, I closed myself off from social events which required alot of interaction with other people. I couldn t even do a presentation properly without shaking my hands or avoiding eye contact. I don t have good communication skills since all my life i have avoided people. Ive never been able to hold a conversation or run it smoothly in social situations. I always think too much in my head and then i get rush of anxiety attacking me and it just makes it worse! Because of it, ive been feeling down lately. And my words always come out wrong. i cant even express myself. Its annoying because people look at me weird and then its too late to explain. In school its so awkard with my collegues because we always exchange these two words hello, how r u. Hi im fine, u?. And it stops there. It makes me feel so horrible and i feel like everybody thinks im boring or something.

I have even Closed down my Facebook for the reason because i dont have any socialising photos in albums like everyone has and i dont want people to know. So i always tell people its hacked when they ask me but i feel like they are suspicious of my life.

I think part of that problem lies with my parents. My mom is extremely overprotective and very veryy strict. Her and my dad are just mainly concerned about my safety and just me succeeding in school. Every single day its a routine...going to school, coming home...going to school, coming home..thats it. boring life. She doesn t want me dating anyone. Also i m not allowed to go clubbing and im 20 years old! She thinks something horrible will happen and she doesn t trust those scenes. She just wants me to focus on my studies (im studying to be a nurse). Just talking about these problems with my mom doesn t help and she never listens to what i have to say. She ends up yelling at me and thinks she is doing what s best for me. My dad is a bit reasonable and listens to me but he too thinks that clubbing isn t right for me so my weekends are never exciting, im always just at home having a non-productive life. Plus i don t have much friends to have fun with. Moving out isn t an option either since im not financially stable to do it plus my parents help me with other fees which is my only advantage while living with them. Having a part time job and studying nursing is hard to do, so i don t work and my parents help me pay for whatever i need. I feel that when i eventually move out, I won t fuction well in the real world or if im by myself since my parents have done EVERYTHING for me.

I feel like im going under downhill and i have never had a boyfriend either. I don t see myself as pretty even though people may say so. I just dont understand why this is happening to me? I feel like death is my option if this carries on for longer. I seem to be the loneliest girl behind my mask and i cnt really hide anymore.

I feel like time is passing by me faster then ever and i wont be able to stop it and i feel like nothings going to improve. why why me? I really deserve some friends...but i feel like people always misunderstand me for no reason. When im nice to them, they just shut me off like they hate me? I dont what to do anymore..
Answer :
if possible, move out of ur parents house and break away. get a job and rent out a little apartment. also u should force urself to take a public speaking class, maybe this summer? i know this is going to be super hard but the only way to get over this is by talking. maybe start when u go to the store and ask an employee where something is. then the next time u go out talk to 2 people you don t know. change is the hardest thing in the world and in order to stop feeling this way you have to force urself to try to communicate.

me! i used to be just like you. i am in the process of doing some stuff i mentioned above. it is so hard but it is so worth it! good luck
Question :
I dont have a social life? Please help im very serious? I am getting very depressed about it?
hi there guys, im a 20 years old female and i m not very happy with my life. I dont really have a social life or that much friends. I only have few friends (2) and only one that is very close to me. Ive fell out with other very close friends in the past because they were very disrespectfull and selfish to me. I have difficulty communicating with people, if it helps im a capricorn and its true i really have hard time trusting people especially 2faced gossipers. I use to college when i was 17 to 18 but dropped because i was ill and even in college, i didnt really have that much friends.
Ive never been able to hold a conversation or run it smoothly in social situations. I always think too much in my head and then i get rush of anxiety attacking me and it just makes it worse! Because of it, ive been feeling down lately. And my words always come out wrong. i cant even express myself. Its annoying because people look at me weird and then its too late to explain..

In work, its so awkard with my colleques because we always exchange these two words hello, how r u. Hi im fine, u?. And it stops there. It makes me feel so sh*t! and i feel like everybody thinks im boring or something.

I have even Closed down my Facebook for the reason because i dont have any socialising photos in albums like everyone has and i dont want people to know. So i always tell people its hacked when they ask me but i feel like they are suspicious of my life.

I feel like im going under downhill and i dont really have a boyfriend either. Its not like im ugly either. I just dont understand why this is happening to me? I feel like death is my option if this carries on for longer. I seem to be the loneliest girl behind my mask and i cnt really hide anymore.

I really wanted to go Uni but i havnt even got any qualifications. Im thinking about going back to college and doing 1 year course but by the time when i go Uni i will be 22! :(. I feel like time is passing by me faster then ever and i wont be able to stop it and i feel like nothings going to improve. why why me? I really deserve some friends...but i feel like people always misunderstand me for no reason. When im nice to them, they just shut me off like they hate me? I dont what to do anymore..prolly kill myself.
Answer :
Don t be too hard on yourself. Be yourself and remain calm you will bound to find friends.
I would really suggest u to go back and get that degree - don t worry who s talking and who s not. Its your life.

If you don t change your life or your thinking now - you will be stuck in the same phase even after 10 years. So set ur mind straight - Dont worry about others just go get what you want in life.

Being a social animal has nothing to do with how you want to lead your life!!!!! Come on..
