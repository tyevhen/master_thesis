Furious Seasons has another tidbit from the Zyprexa documents. It involves the terms "diabetes" and "whitewash." You can read the internal Lilly document yourself at Furious Seasons and decide for yourself.

If you've been living in a cave for the past 10 months or so, here are some other features regarding the infamous Zyprexa documents:
Zyprexa: Off-Label Promotion?
Demented Marketing of Zyprexa?
Zyprexa: The New Mood Stabilizer and Downplaying Risks
Zyprexa: Off-Label Marketing Part 2
And then there is Abilify. Read Brandweek NRX's piece here. Oh, and Seroquel? Read here and here. The lawsuits will keep coming, and there will be large payouts. I'm not a fan of suing the pants off everyone, but if there is no other way to fight off-label marketing and other dubious promotion tactics, then so be it.
