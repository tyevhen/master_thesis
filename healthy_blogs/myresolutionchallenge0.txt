My Blog Has Moved
http://www.motivatemenow.co.uk

Four and a half years ago I joined the blogging community by launching My Resolution Challenge (which I later re-named Motivate Me!) here on the Blogger platform. I shared regular content and loved every second of communicating my thoughts on a variety of personal development topics, disclosing information about the host of challenges I’ve taken part in, and getting to know you, my fabulous readers.

After careful consideration, I’ve decided to move the Motivate Me brand over to WordPress. As I already use this platform for my author blog, I know how easy it is to navigate, and I’m already a member of the huge WP community of bloggers.

Rather than lift all the content from this established blog and move it over (which makes me feel slightly queasy to think about!), I’ve chosen to leave this blog in place so that all my old content is still accessible. I’ll be hand picking the most popular posts and giving them a shake up and re-posting on my new site together with brand new content.

There only remains one thing left to do:

If you are a regular reader of this blog, then I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, and encouragement. It is hugely appreciated, and I hope you will join me on my new platform so we can continue our friendship.
If you are joining me today because one of the links in my book sent you here, then may I say a huge thank you for buying and reading my book, and also invite you to explore this site if you have time, and join me on my new platform.
If you are popping onto this site for the very first time, welcome! Thanks for taking the time to read this far. Feel free to have a look around; there’s plenty of content here to keep you entertained, or come over and join me on my new platform.

Thank you, everyone, for being awesome. I’ll catch you on the flip side!
