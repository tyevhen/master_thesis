Stop Searching: Find! from salsadev on Vimeo.

The killer UI experience here is:
Highlight an arbitrary piece of content on a Web page. (Select some text in your browser window.)
Let go of the mouse.
A panel appears automagically, containing contextually appropriate webfinds.
The user has essentially created a "query" through the simple gesture of click-dragging across some text on a page.

This ought to give anyone in the Search business an awful lot to think about.
