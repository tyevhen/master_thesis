The designation of Mental Health Awareness Month was created more than 65 years ago by Mental Health America to raise awareness about mental health conditions and the importance of mental wellness and promoting good mental health for all. 

During Mental Health Awareness Month professionals, organizations, schools, communities, hospitals and even media outlets will join together in an effort to raise the awareness about mental health and attempt to decrease the stigma that prevents people from getting the help they need. If you have a mental illness or love someone who does, reach out to the many community resources and planned events this month. 

Mental Health Blog Day is May 20th. To be part of it or read the related blogs that are celebrating mental health awareness click the icon link below.
