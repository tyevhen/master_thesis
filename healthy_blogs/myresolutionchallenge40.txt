One year ago, my life changed direction. I was fighting with a health issue that not only depleted my energy but caused me pain, anguish, and fear.  To this day, I remain undiagnosed, left with the doctor’s parting remark, ‘we’ll probably never know what it is or why it happened.’ I translated this to mean ‘just get on with it.’

So I did! I chose to take control of my life and health - it was the hardest decision to make but in hindsight, it was the right one. After seven years of hard work, I closed Body & Soul Holistics, my holistic health spa. A small business that had evolved and flourished until I had an eight-month waiting list for ladies wanting treatments.

My clients were incredible and supported my decision, having watched my health deteriorate before their eyes. They were also wise and intuitive about where my life would take me.

Knowing I enjoyed writing my books, they all believed that the Universe was giving me a push in this direction. ‘Everything happens for a reason’ was batted around a lot.

So, today, one year on, I still struggle with my symptoms, but I try not to let them get me down. When I get tired, I stop what I’m doing and rest. I know my limitations and plan my days around them. I’m still in contact with many of my lovely clients who make my day with their messages.

Life is very different, but it’s good. I chose to take control of my life and health. It’s been difficult at times, mentally, physically and financially, but I know in my heart that it was the right thing to do.

I faced fear, looked it straight in the eye and still jumped off the cliff – I knew I could grow my wings on the way down.
Thank you to everyone who has followed my story, supported me in so many ways, whether that’s in ‘real life’ or online. Your encouragement and kind words have meant more to me than I could ever say.

I’m still fighting, and I’m never going to quit – in the meantime, I have books to write!
