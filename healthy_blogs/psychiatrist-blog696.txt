Roy came over last week bearing gifts.  He brought me a large green baseball bat.  On closer inspection, I realized it was a club.  What would I do with a green club?  My imagination ran wild.

"From my garden," Roy said proudly.  He must be using the green club to beat away the squirrels.  Ah, but then I realized it was a Zucchini!  Roy had grown the world's largest green squash.  I'm set on vegetables for the next few months.  Zucchini on anabolic steroids!

For Clink & Roy, from page 58 of the Better Homes and Gardens Bread book I've had since college:

Zucchini Nut Loaf

1.5 C flour  (Clink: the "C" stands for 'cup")
1 teaspoon (t) cinnamon
0.5 t baking soda
0.5 t ground nutmeg
0.25 t baking powder
0.5 t salt
Mix the above together and set aside (dry ingredients)
1 C sugar
1 C finely shreeded unpeeled zucchini
1 egg
Beat together sugar, zucchini and egg, the add oil and lemon peel and mix well.  Stir in the above dry ingredients.  Fold in chopped nuts
1/4 C cooking oil
0.25 t finely shredded lemon peel
half C chopped walnuts

Good stuff.  And for the record, Roy hates when I exaggerate, but the zucchini is about as long as my dog, Kobe.
Turn batter into a greased 8X4X2 inhl loaf pan and bake for 60 minutes at 350 degrees or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes.  Remove from pan, cool on rack.  Wrap and store loaf overnight before serving.  (Oh, my--- I never read that last sentence before.  I've always eaten it warm...perfect that way).
