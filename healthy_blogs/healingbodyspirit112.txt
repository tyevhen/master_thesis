A vitamin B-12 deficiency can sometimes be mistaken for dementia or alzheimers. Recently, a l study showed vitamin B12 supplementation slows the accelerated rate of brain shrinkage and declining cognitive scores in older individuals. Another study showed that older individuals with higher levels of B12 in their blood had less shrinkage of the brain than others with lower levels.
