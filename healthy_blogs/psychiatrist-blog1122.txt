Yesterday's issue of Environmental Health has an open access article by Shia T. Kent, et al, entitled "Effect of sunlight exposure on cognitive function among depressed and non-depressed participants: a REGARDS cross-sectional study."

They looked at sunlight exposure for nearly 17,000 subjects from another depression study to determine if cognitive function was affected by gloomy days.

People with major depression were 2-1/2 times more likely to have impaired cognitive function during periods of reduced sunlight than were people without depression, independent of other factors.

I saw this first on Health Day.
