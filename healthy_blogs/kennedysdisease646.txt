This holiday season is a time of reflection for me. I take time to review my “gratitude journal” to help remind me of all the blessings that I have experienced this year. It is also a time to be with family and friends to share the “Spirit” that is Christmas.

Please, take a moment to give thanks for the men and women who serve in our armed forces. Many cannot be with their families for the holidays. 

May you be safe … healthy … and feel the love… during this holiday season and through the coming year.
