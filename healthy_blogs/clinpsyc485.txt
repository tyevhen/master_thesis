In addition to PMD, Corcept is working with Eli Lilly and other partners to develop a patent portfolio of state of the art psychopharmaceuticals to treat Alzheimers, Catatonia, Cognitive impairment, Cocaine Addiction, Dementia, Delusion, Migraines, Postpartum depression, premature infants, stress, weight gain and a host of widespread concerns using the cortisol mechanism, with fewer side effects than previous medications.

The market for these medications is blockbuster size. CORT is remindful of some other drug companies owned like Alza, Smithkline and Syntex that hit home runs."

So what are you waiting for? Oh, you’re waiting for research that actually backs mifepristone's efficacy given its meager performance to date. Or maybe you’re waiting to see if anyone beside company employees and consultants (here and here) has anything nice to say about the drug. Well, it could be your loss! Personally, I’ll sit this one out.
