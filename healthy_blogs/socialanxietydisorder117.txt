It is that time of year again when people reflect on their lives and think about how they can improve their health and happiness in the new year. For over a century, the science of psychology has sought to better understand how these universal goals can best be achieved. Unfortunately, as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and pseudo-scientific options have grown in popularity, they have overshadowed the importance of readily accessible lifestyle factors in contributing to psychological, social, and physical well-being. "Attending to these lifestyle factors can help prevent the typical pattern where the optimism that initially accompanied our new years resolutions is soon replaced by disappointment because we didnt know how to go about pursuing our goals or because the ways in which sought to enhance our health and happiness proved to be ineffective," said Dr. Edrick Dorian, psychologist and co-founder of Thriveport, LLC.
