As a school conflict practitioner, I am always searching for outlets to promote conflict resolution to my students.  After listening to the Texas Conflict Coach's radio program, I became very excited about the possibility of joining this organization to promote conflict resolution, violence prevention, and community service in my school.  One aspect of SAVE, which I really admire, is the fact that the organization encourages peers to become educators and advocates in the school.  Since, I am very passionate about peer education, peer advocacy, and peer leadership, I think SAVE could be a great avenue to support these activities.  

During the 2013-14 school year, I hope to use my new SAVE chapter members as mediators, educators, and ambassadors who can earn service learning elective credits for their contributions to the school community. In addition, I would like to offer a scholarship to a senior who embodies the goals of SAVE.  So, I guess my next step is to apply as a sponsor for SAVE...onward!

Also, stop in and listen to the Texas Conflict Coach, Pattie Porter, interview SAVE Board member Kit Evans. Pattie has a lot of great information for educators regarding conflict, bullying, violence prevention, and other issues in our schools.
