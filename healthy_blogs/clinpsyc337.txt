It appears that the FDA is conducting an investigation of the safety of over the counter cold medications for children. Apparently, the safety of these medications in children is largely unknown despite their widespread use in kids. There are also concerns that in overdose, these meds may be harmful or perhaps fatal.

I appreciate that the FDA is getting off its duff, but Stephany at the Soulful Sepulcher has an even better idea -- how about the FDA investigating the safety of psychiatric medications in kids? Something tells me that Zyprexa, Seroquel, and Depakote might, just maybe, have more safety issues in kids than Dimetapp or Robitussin. Hey, maybe there is a problem with the cold meds, but can we at least consider that heavy duty psych meds might also impact the health of youth? After all, meds such as the atypical antipsychotics are experiencing quite the boom in prescriptions for kids -- wouldn't we want to be sure that this boom was not leading to a corresponding increase in health problems?
