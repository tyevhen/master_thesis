Thanks for reading and answering.
Answer :
This looks like a scam to be honest, especially the ion therapy lamp which I guarantee is a complete scam.

The people in my link can give you further advice. You are probably looking for a full spectrum lamp which will fit in an ordinary lamp holder and not cost you such a ridiculous amount.
