Health Care Renewal has a post that tells a striking story about what can happen to whistleblowers. Here's the abbreviated version...

Paul Kornak (who went by Dr. Kornak yet never completed medical training) fiddled with medical records in drug studies and, adding injury to insult, apparently pled guilty to negligent homicide of a patient in a chemotherapy study. Making this tragic tale even worse was that when a few brave souls attempted to blow the whistle on dear Mr. Kornak, they were punished. This scandal could not be put at the feet of a greedy corporation... this was all done in the VA medical system. The retribution taken against the whistleblowers involved the loss of employment and trumped-up charges of patient abuse and practicing medicine outside of competence areas. If you think the teaser sounds bad, wait until you read the whole story.
