Welcome back. Sorry for the delay in getting this out. I will be getting #24 out this Sunday, June 10. Be sure to check out this upcoming podcast as we will have a special guest joining us -- Dr. Phil.

June 3, 2007: #23 Loons, Lefse, and the Flea

Topics include:
Doctor Anonymous to be guest on June 17 podcast.
Clink brings back notepads with loons on them and cinnamon lefse from the midwest.
Flea's medical blog affects his malpractice trial. This is a fascinating story, which is well-summarized and explained on Eric Turkewitz's legal blog. We're waiting for Flea's book to come out.
Dinah talks about transference. Also see prior post on Transference to the Blog.
Rules for Bloggers. In response to Flea's troubles, ClinicalCases suggests Five Rules for Blogging:

1-Write as if your boss and your patients are reading your blog every day
2-Comply with HIPAA
3-Do not blog anonymously. List your name and contact information
4-If your blog is work-related, it is probably better to let your employer know
5-Use a disclaimer

We mention a survey of medical bloggers that was done last year. Anyone have a link?
Movie Review: Away From Her. Clink thought this movie about a woman with dementia was very good.
Oh, remember... check out next week's podcast, when Dr. Phil will be joining us for a brief interview.
