At last, an online service that deters head hunters from pestering me.

The unusual promise made by NotchUp is that potential employers who want to contact you directly (avoinding the expensive services of a professional placement agency) will actually pay you to agree to an interview. All you have to do is sign up with NotchUp, and wait for the phone to ring. (And wait. And wait.)

How much will you get paid? The NotchUp folks have put a fee calculator on their site. It shows that an IT professional with 10 years of experience can expect to receive $380 per interview.

NotchUp membership is free to interviewees, but you have to go through an application process and be accepted. Which already sounds fishy to me.
