While I was away, ClinkShrink did a Spectacular job of keeping up the blog. And the rare moments I could get computer access, for 20 shekels a shot, I got to play beat-the-clock attempting to get through my email. There were about a zillion in response to Clink's posts. Great posts (and beware the surgeon who dares to lie to Dinah)...but no pics? Why no pics, dear ClinkShrink? Ah, but it's not too late--- I will help her out here.
