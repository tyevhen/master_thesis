This post continues the discussion of Heat.

EMPTY HEAT

"Empty Heat" derives from Yin deficiency. There are two aspects I would like to clarify straight away.  The term "Empty" Heat may give the impression that Empty Heat is not "real" Heat. Although deriving from Yin deficiency, Empty Heat is "real" Heat and it heats up as much as Full Heat.

The second important clarification is that, although Empty Heat derives from Yin deficiency,  this may occur by itself for years before giving rise to Empty Heat.  Thus, although Empty Heat derives from Yin deficiency, it takes time for it to develop.  Therefore one may have Yin deficiency for years without Empty Heat.

The tongue shows this very clearly. Yin deficiency  manifests on the tongue with lack of coating; if there is only Yin deficiency without Empty Heat, the tongue will lack a coating but will have a normal colour. I have several dozens pictures of tongues that lack a coating but have a normal colour.  The tongue below is an example of this.

This tongue lack a coating and has scattered Stomach cracks: it therefore shows a pronounced deficiency of Stomach-Yin. Its colour is normal and this indicates that there is no Stomach-Heat yet.  Eventually, without treatment, this tongue will become red and, when it does, it means that, besides Stomach-Yin deficiency, there is also Empty Heat of the Stomach.

Therefore, a tongue without coating with normal tongue-body colour indicates Yin deficiency, while a tongue without coating and a red body colour indicates Yin deficiency with Empty Heat.

The tongue below is red without coating.

The diagram below illustrates the timeline of Yin deficiency and Empty Heat and it highlights how one can have Yin deficiency before the development of Empty Heat.  The blue line illustrates Yin and the red line Empty Heat.


The clinical manifestations of Empty Heat in general (irrespective of organ) are:

-   a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening
-   a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips
-   malar flush (red cheekbones)
-   a dry throat at night
-   a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called A5-palm heat@)
-   dry stools
-   scanty-dark urine
-   a Floating-Empty and Rapid pulse
-   a red tongue without coating.

Thus for every organ, there is a pattern of Yin deficiency (without Empty Heat) and one of Empty Heat.  This distinction is very apparent also from the categories of herbs and formulae in Chinese herbal medicine.  The category of herbs and formulae that nourish Yin is quite distinct from that of herbs and formulae that clear Empty Heat.  Herbs that nourish Yin are sweet and cold and while those that clear Empty Heat are bitter and cold.

For example, herbs that nourish Yin are Mai Men Dong and Bei Sha Shen and these do not necessarily clear Empty Heat.  An example of a formula that nourishes Yin is Sha Shen Mai Dong Tang Adenophora-Ophiopogon Decoction.

Examples of herbs that clear Empty Heat are Qing Hao Herba Artemisiae annuae and Di Gu Pi Cortex Lycii.  Examples of formulae that clear Empty Heat are Qing Hao Bie Jia San Artemisia annua-Carapax Trionycis Powder or Qing Gu San Clearing the Bones Powder. Of course, one can simultaneously nourish Yin and clear Empty Heat in which case one would start from a Yin-nourishing formula and add some herbs that clear Empty Heat.

With acupuncture too, there is a difference between nourishing Yin and clearing Empty Heat.  To nourish Yin, one would use points such as SP-6 Sanyinjiao, Ren-12 Zhongwan or KI-3 Taixi.  Generally, one can use the Yuan points of the Yin organs to nourish Yin (KI-3 Taixi, LIV-3 Taichong, SP-3 Taibai, LU-9 Taiyuan, HE-7 Shenmen).

To clear Empty Heat, one would use Fire points such as P-8 Laogong, HE-8 Shaofu, LIV-2 Xingjian, etc.  Acupuncture is less Aprecise@ than herbal medicine as the Fire points can also be used to clear Full Heat.

Aetiology of Empty Heat

As Empty Heat derives from Yin deficiency, there is no specific aetiology of Empty Heat, only of Yin deficiency.  In my experience, the main cause of Yin deficiency is overwork in the sense of working long hours without adequate rest, leaving home in the early morning and returning in the late evening, year after year.  Overwork intended in this sense is particularly detrimental because it always involves two other causes of disease, i.e. emotional stress and irregular diet which are associated with overwork.

However, there is in my opinion a cause of disease that would favour the rise of Empty Heat and that is emotional stress.  In particular, emotions that cause a rising of Qi. In fact, Empty Heat is particularly associated with a rising of Qi towards the chest, throat and head. Empty Heat causes a rising of Qi because it derives from Yin deficiency.  Yin is the root that should Aanchor@ Qi: when the root is weakened, Qi rises.

Emotions that cause a rising of Qi and therefore favour Empty Heat are anger, frustration, resentment, guilt, shame, worry and fear.  Yes I know, the Nei Jing says that fear Amakes Qi descend@ but I think that is more fright than fear. A chronic state of fear, such as that seen in chronic anxiety, makes Qi rise and it causes a disconnection between the Lower and the Upper part and between the Kidneys and Heart.  The rising Qi combines with the Empty Heat (which has a tendency to rise anyway) causing a feeling of heat of the face and malar flush (red cheekbones).

I will now describe the Empty Heat patterns for each of the Yin organs plus the Stomach. For each organ, I will give the pattern of Yin deficiency (without Empty Heat) and that of Yin deficiency with Empty Heat.
