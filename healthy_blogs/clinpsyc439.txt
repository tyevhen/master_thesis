The results are in for the 2006 Medical Blog Awards. While I did not win in the category of Best New Blog, I thank all who voted for my site. It was an honor to receive quite a few votes and to be listed next to some excellent sites. For results, please go here. Congrats to all winners, especially to the NHS Blog Doctor, who won in three categories.
