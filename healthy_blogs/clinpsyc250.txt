For those of you who have seen The Constant Gardener, you are now allowed to wonder if the movie was really fictional. Criminal charges have been filed against Pfizer for allegedly setting up a clinical trial in which they misled African child participants badly and used a very weak comparison drug, which may have led to the demise of some participants. Here's one piece from the lawsuit, courtesy of Pharmalot...
“The families of the children who [Pfizer] used as laboratory guinea pigs were led to believe and in fact understood that the Defendants were providing their children with volunteer relief, clearly focused humanitarian medical intervention and nothing more,” the lawsuit says. Parents were not told that alternative treatments were available, it adds.
