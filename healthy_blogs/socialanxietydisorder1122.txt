I hope you don t mind; I ve edited your essay for punctuation and grammar and a few missing or misplaced words. Here:

In 1902, Doctor Still was the first person to diagnose ADHD as a disorder. He proclaimed it a type of defect of moral control. In 1922, the symptoms of ADHD were diagnosed as Post-Encephalitic Behavior Disorder.

By 1980, the American Psychiatric Association invented the name Attention Deficit Disorder. The name was changed to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in 1987. The American medical association said in 1998 that ADHD has been one of the most researched disorders.

ADHD is defined by the frequent pattern of hyperactivity and inattention. There are three types of ADHD; the most common is the combined type, which is involves all the symptoms of ADHD. Inattention ADHD is also known as ADD, and consists of not being able to focus on tasks. The third type is hyperactivity impulsive, which is hyperactivity without inattention.

Inattention symptoms may not be visible until you are in a job or have difficulties in school. Hyperactivity symptoms can appear with kids as young as preschool, and can present before the age of 7.

There is non stimulant medication such as Strattera and stimulant medication such as Concerta, Ritalin, ADDerall and Vyvanse. The recommended ADHD diet is high protien content and protein supplements, less carbohydrate intake, and lots of water.

The problem with ADHD is that it does not always come alone; there are often other disorders (known as comorbid disorders) that are diagnosed as well. These can include Tourette Syndrome, bipolar disorder, Learning Disabilities, Depression, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and conduct disorder. ADHD is also linked to sleeping problems and disorders. ADHD can cause social problems, such as not being accepted by kids at school, which can cause low self esteem. The cause of ADHD is unknown, but most evidence leads to genetics.
Question :
Ways to view behavior????
Billy was the third of loving but busy parents. When he was growing up, he thought that his parents favored his older siblings. When Billy was four, his parents divorced, and he remained with his father. His brother .and sister moved with his mother to a distant city. Billy rarely saw them. Feeling inadequate in raising his son alone, Billys father responded by providing the child with costly toys and frequent trips to amusement parks. As Billy grew older and attended school, he had trouble focusing and was taken to a doctor for an appraisal of his abilities and disabilities. Billys medical evaluation showed symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but Billys father dismissed the diagnosis. Because of these difficulties in school, Billy had trouble making friends and was ridiculed by his classmates. This diminished his self-confidence. By the time Billy was an adolescent, he had difficulty forming lasting relationships despite his expertise in athletics. He was capable of high academic achievement, but his grades were below average. Teacher reports frequently cited his excessive need for attention, he felt lost and doomed to failure.

Ive got a challenge for you guys, try answering the following questions from a humanist approach, Psychoanalytical approach, behaviorist approach, cognitive approach, and a biological approach based on the case study above.

1) What is the basic cause of Billys problems?
2) What will happen to Billy?
3) What steps could Billy take to improve his life????


Remember, Humanist approach emphasizes the concept that people are in control of their own destiny. Psychoanalytical approach emphasizes that a persons behavior is determined by primal drives and the experiences of early childhood. Behaviorist approach emphasizes the connection between stimulus/response and behavior/reward. Also, that a persons behavior is determined by the actions that were rewarded or punished. Cognitive approach emphasizes that a persons difficulties often stem from false perceptions of reality. Biological Approach emphasizes the genetic, medical, and neurological components of the person. Theorists believe that theses biological factors influence behavior. Hormonal changes, brain anomalies, and neurochemical differences help determine a persons actions and subsequent changes in behavior.
Answer :
1) one has to ask why did billy not move with his mother and siblings? This coupled with his relationship(or lack there of)with his father gives strong clues as to why billy is the way he is. he feels abandoned and probably has not learned enough from his parents to devolop a clear and secure personality.

2) He( like most chilldren) has probably learned that the most effective way to get attention is to get in trouble. After time this develops into involuntary behavior. the behavior/reward system is in place to teach us, after a pattern develops in this a reward is no longer neccacary. If he continues he will find himself more and more at odds with society as he leaves childhood for adulthood further increasing the feeling of being different and unacceptable which he first exposed to as a child. He will likely continue in his bad behavior striving for attention from society ( you can see it all the time in prison inmates, they are all willing and waiting to tell their stories to have someone hear and understand them), and will have deep anger and trust issues, which only continues his downward spiral.

3)What he really needs is loving caring parents, however seeing how this is unlikely
cousnleing is the best and fastest option. He needs to learn about himself and understand why he feels the way he does. Also positive and supportive friends and rolemodels will give him a sense of family, which really is just the basic feeling of love and security.

p.s. i love spellcheck, also let me know if i m at least on the right track this is just a guess;)
Question :
Why do people think people with ADHD are "retarded?"?
Help me out here. I know someone with the mental disorder, and she acts "different", but she is ranked third in her class, thanks to her good grades. But she is sometimes harassed by people who call her a "retard" because of her ADHD, "big" because of her 5"11, 180 lb. frame, and "ugly" because of her acne scars that are riddled across her entire face because she has bad skin problems. I am the ONLY person she turns to when she s down, and I always tell off people who make fun of her. I love this girl(not like THAT!)and I hate when people do this to her. We re home girls for life, and I was wondering what you guys think about this ADHD v. mental retardation thing.

And if you guys don t know, ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Answer :
My Chloe is 7 and struggles to sit still ect ect but I have been told many times that she has an above average IQ for her age and has a photographic memory. I worry that she will become that child that nobody likes. I am sorry that this girl is going through this but I see nothing that you can do. anyone that thinks people with ADHD are stupid or retarded in anyway have not got 2 brain cells to rub together.
