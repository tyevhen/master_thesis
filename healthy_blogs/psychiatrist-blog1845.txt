ClinkShrink likes to hear about psychiatry from our readers in other countries. Lily (DrivingMissMolly) sent us a link to a blog owned by an Iraqi psychiatrist. Check out Psychiatry For All by Saminkie of Baghdad. The photos, the rendition of stigma in that country, the accounts of limited electricity and dealing with PTSD while the guns are still firing-- they are moving. I read the whole blog, it's not long, but it is a rich account of a poor and war-torn nation.
