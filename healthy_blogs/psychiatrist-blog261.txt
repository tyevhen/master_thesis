Apparently, states have different mental health issues.  West Virginia is the most neurotic, and Wisconsin is the most extroverted (it's all that cheese filling their heads).  Clink took the test and she belongs in Connecticut.  I, apparently, should live in Massachusetts where perhaps I could get World Series seats?  Go Red Sox!  Those folks in Utah are laid back.  What state works best for you?
