And from today's Sunday New York Times Magazine.....
Oh, my paper came today without the magazine section. I should complain. It's summer and I'm in slow motion, much too lazy to even figure out who to complain to.
The Shrink Rappers have slowed our pace lately--- 13 posts in July, this may be our all-time low month. I'm getting ready for vacation, Clink is hanging from cliffs, Roy...has anyone seen Roy? He posted last, so I think he's lying around soaking in the rays.
Just to say "Hi." I'll check out the NYT magazine on line.....
