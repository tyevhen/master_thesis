Dear Ms Curtiss


I noticed when I take a shower by laying down in a warm water increases depression. I think cold water is better because it keeps you active and not relaxed.


Regards, R.

Dear R,
I think you are right that cold water keeps you active and not relaxed to fall into self-focus. Nothing like a little physical effort or discomfort to get you outer-directed.  A. B.

Dear A. B.

I wish you all the best Ms Curtiss


I would love to give you a hug and let you feel better. Please let us know if you need any help. 

Regards,
R

I appreciate all the comforting messages. Hope to have an MRI early in the week and find out what's wrong. A. B.
