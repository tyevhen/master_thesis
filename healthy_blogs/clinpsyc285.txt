Very sad news to report. Pharma Giles, easily the most entertaining pharma-related blog, has decided to call it quits. I wish he were just pulling a Peter Rost and retiring for a week, then coming back, but Giles strikes me as pretty serious. That being said...

PLEASE DON'T GO!!! PharmaGossip and Peter Rost agree with me, as I'm sure do others. You can't possibly leave. Who will fill your shoes?
