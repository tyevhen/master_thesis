Technology seems to be the theme of the moment here on Shrink Rap.  We're all playing with new toys and trying to figure out what makes them fun and what makes them useful to our work.

For this week's post on Shrink Rap News over on the Clinical Psychiatry News website, I have an article up on Siri and the Psychiatrist.  Some information that might be useful to anyone who is thinking of incorporating this technology into their practice, and oh, a little tongue-in-cheek humor there with many thanks to Dr. Bob Roca at Sheppard Pratt and Dr. Paul Nestadt at Johns Hopkins who both allowed me to quote them during their more playful moments.  There is also a techy post up on  Shrink Rap Today over on our Psychology Today Website with links to some of our past technology posts.
 
Roy is trying to figure out how to use his iPad to interface with Electronic Medical Records and wrote about it last week for our Clinical Psychiatry News SR blog, see iPad: The New Black Bag.  His last post on Shrink Rap was about Depression Apps, and he inspired me to add the Moody Me app to my own iPhone.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'll let you know how it goes, but the colorful smiley faces were more than I could resist.  Depression Apps will also be a topic in one of our upcoming podcasts. 

Okay, so if you read my post on Siri and the psychiatrist, it will make me happy:










If you comment on it, it will make me really happy:

But be nice, I don't want to be sad:
