Charles Nemeroff, about whom I have written much, continues to disappear. His latest vanishing act: From a psychiatric research gathering in Berlin in late November 2008. Their website now reads: "Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff (Atlanta, the USA) called his participation off in the congress and its scientific contributions." We can only hope that they had another key opinion leader of his stature to replace him.

Back story.
