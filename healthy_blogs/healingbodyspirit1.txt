Why I Am a Mormon

 
The short answer is that my great-grandfather heard the gospel preached in Wales in the spring of 1844. His two cousins, Hopkin and David Mathews, came into the village preaching the Mormon doctrine. They heard how in 1820 a young man by the name of Joseph Smith, who after reading James 1:5 in the Bible went into a grove in Palmyra, N.Y., to pray about which church was true.  There he saw God the Father and His son, Jesus Christ whose glory and light were beyond description.  He was told that he should join none of the churches, but that through him the church of Jesus Christ would be restored to the earth.  It would be restored by a process of revelation and by translating the Book of Mormon.  My grandfather and his wife were convinced this was true. I am convinced that it is true because by the power of the Holy Ghost the spirit has born witness to me. I have walked through that sacred grove and know without a shadow of a doubt that God the Father and that His son, even Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith.  I bear testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is another testament of Jesus Christ and His dealings with an ancient people on the American Continent.
