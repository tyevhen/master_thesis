For the last few months, I've been publishing an online psychotherapy daily newspaper called 
Psychotherapy Daily News - by Josephine Ferraro, LCSW - NYC Psychotherapist.

The Psychotherapy Daily News has articles every day about mental health, health, science, education, the environment, career, and leisure issues that I think would be of interest to readers.

Each day, the newspaper has a few of my blog articles as well as articles from other sources, like the Harvard Business Review, Science magazine, the New York Times and other various magazines and blogs.

Here's a sample of articles from today's Psychotherapy Daily News
Psychotherapy and Beginner's Mind
Allow Your Children to Have Dreams & Use Their Imagination
Developing Intuition to Tap Into Your Creative Abilities
Why Has It Become So Hard to Find a Psychotherapist in NYC?
Mother-Daughter Relationships:  Letting Go of Resentments
Alcohol Disorders - Practical Tips
How to Make Change that Lasts
Your Employees Are Not Mind Readers
You can subscribe to the newspaper completely free of charge by going onto the site and clicking on the subscriber button.  Then, everyday, you'll receive the latest Psychotherapy Daily News.

I hope you enjoy reading Psychotherapy Daily News, and I welcome your comments
