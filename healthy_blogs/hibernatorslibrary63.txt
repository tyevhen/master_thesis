This week was a good one. I didn't do a lot of stuff, so I had lots of extra time to read. I didn't do anything for Halloween since I'd expected to work (in fact, the electricity went out and I got to leave work early, but I was tired when I got home and used the extra time to relax). I'm looking forward to election day coming up. This has been an exhausting election season! I hope you all take the time to have your voice heard on Tuesday. Vote!


On the blog: I reviewed two books this week: Stiletto by Daniel O'Malley and Men We Reaped by Jesmyn Ward. I also kicked off Nonfiction November by describing my year in nonfiction. Check it out, it has a lovely picture of all the books I read! 

Books Completed: In the rather stubborn desire to complete my goal of 75 books this year, I've added graphic novels to my daily reading. That'll probably continue into next year since the Bible group read will significantly reduce the number of other books I get read. And how can I make a goal of less than 75? I finished the series Chi's Sweet Home, by Konami Kanata, and continued reading the series Bone, by Jeff Smith. 


Acquired: Despite my intent to use one of my last two Audible credits to buy White Trash, by Nancy Isenberg to supplement my Nonfiction November reading, I spent both credits on the 2-for-1 sale. Good job Rachel. But I got some good books. White Trash will have to wait. 


Currently Reading: North and South, by Elizabeth Gaskell is my current serial read. I'm listening to Neurotribes, by Steve Silberman, but have set aside The Stand, by Stephen King for December when I won't be trying to pack in as much nonfiction. I'm also enjoying The Righteous Mind, by Jonathan Haidt, and The Price of Silence, by Liza Long. The graphic novel I'm currently working on is Bone: Volume 4.
