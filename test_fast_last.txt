depression stressful possibly exhaust someone physically seen many days nights i spent floor uncontrollable fits tears punching head pulling hair sheer frustration despair real horrendous certainly mind i believe strongly psychological physiological health intertwined i feel human body understand i think society want neatly place mental health separate box suffer want hide suffering distance

confusion lack understanding must fight speak educate make heard i hoped blog may play small part i hoped fellow sufferers would get board share experiences thing many people spent years decades even trying prove condition imagined head many felt seeing cfs words mental health together title blog disastrous set hard work back intention i simply wanted explore connections physiological psychological health i wanted see cfs sufferers spotted similarities story many every negative comment i received i got positive one i believe reacted negatively misunderstood whole point failed see

sufferers peril many want hear want know someone better even doubt milder cases cfs ill probably ill one said me talking illness need know awful lot apparently notice said illness i dismissed even real sufferer i interpreted cause condition differently i even told 'based appearance mental health issues ca cfs fellow sufferer basing assumptions appearance say one type cfs many types cancer treatments decided upon accordingly many types depression equally different treatments different success rates dependant type maybe different treatments work different types cfs i came across uk girl aged recently diagnosed cfs writing blog efforts get well changes diet exercise hoped blog would share positivity add piece puzzle people positivity efforts welcomed cfs community faced hurtful comments resentment accused potentially harming fellow sufferers thankfully letting put people cfs support groups justify treating newly diagnosed young girl way may slightly different symptoms varying severities original trigger conditions may vary unseen poorly understood condition i urge stand together embrace similarities differences keep minds open show support understanding tell story

diagnose chinese disease gives idea prognosis pathology treatment i given list chinese diseases corresponding type cancer previous blog post example carcinoma thyroid may compared shi ying type goiter read shi ying learn something pathology treatment condition course important enough chinese disease shi ying would entail concept malignancy secondly need identify patterns involved formulate treatment cancer identify patterns also closely linked chinese disease example case shi ying always phlegm blood stasis makes goiter feel hard palpation next essential step diagnose whether patient condition primarily full empty guides choice prescription i expelling pathogenic factors full conditions tonifying body empty conditions i explained previous post i generally primarily tonify body beginning stages primarily expel pathogenic factors middle late stages emphasis word primarily prescription i use would simultaneously tonify body expel pathogenic factors albeit different degrees thus prescription expel pathogenic factors would least one two tonics prescription tonify body would herbs resolve phlegm invigorate blood choosing preferably herbs also anti cancer effect point view modern research finally choosing herbs keep account pattern treat also modern research example need yang tonic would prefer ren shen huang lu rong former two herbs anti cancer effect lu rong another example could herbs toxic heat need herb resolves toxic heat dou gen radix sophorae tochinchinensis would preferable qian li guang herba senecionis scandens therefore i would summarize steps necessary choice herbal prescription follows identify chinese disease identify pattern decide whether condition primarily full case primarily expel pathogenic factors primarily empty case primarily tonify body choose formula suits pattern add tonics expelling pathogenic factors herbs resolve phlegm invigorate blood clear toxic heat tonifying body modify addition herbs anti cancer effect following example prescription patient breast cancer year old woman diagnosed breast cancer years previously several hard lumps skin lumps reddish purple tongue swollen sticky coating red points chest breast area pulse

chemo therapy radio therapy entirely different chemo radio therapy treat patterns underlying cancer concentrate supporting immune system minimizing side effects treatment treatment principle chemotherapy tonify nourish yin cool blood resolve dampness clear heat treatment principle radiotherapy nourish blood cool blood nourish yin invigorate blood unfortunately widespread view among oncologists patients undergoing chemotherapy take antioxidants reason would chemotherapy oxidates cancer cells destroy therefore anything anti oxidant would stop chemotherapy working i disagree view case chinese herbs contain antioxidants patients surgery radio chemo therapy treating patients surgery radio chemotherapy need assess chinese medicine perspective need evaluate whether patterns caused cancer first place still i base assessment primarily tongue pulse three main patterns cancer blood stasis phlegm toxic heat tongue pulse show signs i consider cancer still active even eradicated surgery treated radiotherapy chemotherapy therefore tongue purple blood stasis swollen phlegm pulse full i treat patient cancer still tongue top purple blood stasis swollen phlegm evaluating whether blood stasis also look sublingual veins tongue bottom shows dark swollen veins indicates blood stasis purple colour dangerous sign tongue red many red points indicates toxic heat toxic heat always indicates poor prognosis means cancer may spread pulse rapid red points pulse pulse full type wiry slippery firm indicates pathogenic factors caused cancer still active pulse empty type weak fine indicates condition primarily empty therefore tongue pulse show pathogenic factors still active i give prescription primarily eliminates pathogenic factors i say primarily i would always add tonic herbs support immune system addition i would also use herbs anti cancer effects indicated tongue pulse show pathogenic factors active pronounced deficiency i prescribe formula primarily tonifies yang blood yin i say primarily formula would also include herbs expel pathogenic factors herbs anti cancer effect following example prescription patient treatment surgery chemotherapy i primarily expelled pathogenic factors year old female patient ovarian cancer years previously hysterectomy oophorectomy followed chemotherapy months consultation discovered lumps abdomen chemotherapy tongue reddish purple pulse wiry full general weak kidney positions i diagnosed severe blood stasis basis tongue pulse underlying kidney deficiency based tongue pulse recurrence lumps i decided treatment aimed

 __label__control i presenting chinese medicine view cancer patterns treatment principle herbs herbal formulae many patient cancer cancer reason i think extremely important understand cancer point view chinese medicine even actually treat moreover even treat cancer patients survived cancer great service develop treatment strategies prevent recurrence chinese books try prove concept cancer already nei jing later books truth ancient books fairly comprehensive theory tumours concept malignancy differentiation benign malignant tumours however passages clearly indicate treating tumours ancient doctors well aware condition indicated poor prognosis example text song dynasty says describing ru yan i hard breast lump broken patient saved broken treatment difficult palpation hard rock hence name ru yan breast rock treated late ulcerate spread zang organs fatal please note descriptions tumours ancient books one actually describe secondary infections cancer rather cancer pathology tongue shows one case seldom see infections women seek western treatment much earlier ancient chinese women would done moreover chinese medicine theory cancer refers masses therefore envisage cancer without masses blood tumours leukemia myeloma spite fact chinese medicine concept malignancy i believe lot offer four areas treat cancer without western treatment treat cancer integration western

differentiation also modern research anti cancer effect another factor surgery cancer surgery cancer entirely diagnose chinese perspective example breast lumps benign malignant diagnose palpation phlegm blood stasis obviously longer possible surgery different approach treatment first difference cancer assume deficiency zheng therefore must use tonics every case second important difference choice herbs guided also modern research third important difference treatment principle according stage disease diseases generally beginning stage one expels pathogenic factors late stage one tonifies opposite cancer i beginning stage one primarily tonifies late stage one primarily expels pathogenic factors emphasis word primarily one always adopts approaches stage example another disease might ms beginning stages invasion dampness treatment principle therefore eliminate dampness disease progresses deficiency stomach spleen later deficiency yin liver kidneys late stages therefore one must tonify zheng cancer beginning stage characterized deficiency zheng without would cancer one therefore primarily tonify prevent cancer growing spreading late stages pathology cancer characterized strong pathogenic factors i blood stasis phlegm toxic heat i repeat stress word primarily always adopt treatments i tonify zheng expel pathogenic factors different proportions according stage beginning stage late stage diseases expel pathogenic factor tonify zheng cancer tonify zheng expel pathogenic factors integrate chinese diagnosis western diagnosis course obvious never rely palpation chinese diagnosis breast lumps example applies cancer another example would prostate cancer man urinary retention never treat without prostate biopsy ascertain whether carcinoma western diagnosis also presents new opportunities ancient chinese doctors would example cervical dysplasia diagnosed pap smear test treat usually successfully may turn cervical cancer integrate chinese western treatment cases need integrate treatment western treatment i chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery times i used chinese treatment patient strongly western treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy attention directed treating cancer supporting zheng treatments chemotherapy radiotherapy make clear diagnosis whether still strong pathogenic factors order decide whether primarily tonify primarily expel pathogenic

approach treatment western treatment important clear idea approach treatment patient western treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery see many patients treatment approach depends type treatment basically one must decide whether primarily tonify zheng aim preventing recurrence cancer whether still primarily expel pathogenic factors spite western treatment received example woman breast cancer phlegm mastectomy make sense still resolve phlegm cases yes i choose treatment principle lot according tongue pulse tongue pulse show full condition i primarily expel pathogenic factors always addition herbs tonify zheng support immune system tongues indicating primarily full conditions swollen thick coating purple stiff tongues indicating primarily empty condition purple swollen thin coating coating purple thick coating purple swollen red thick dry coating pulse indicating full condition full slippery wiry possibly rapid pulse indicating empty condition weak fine choppy thus tongue pulse indicate primarily full condition i treat patient still cancer choose herbal formula first i refer chinese disease corresponding type cancer order see chinese formula adapted patient apart chinese disease formula must also based pattern therefore good pattern identification essential i modify formula three ways make additions subtractions according patient condition way i would disease add herbs proven anti cancer effect according modern research herbs also treat presenting pattern even better example huang yao zi anti cancer effect resolves phlegm would therefore choose herb phlegm add herbs tonify zheng stimulate immune system also anti cancer effect better approach treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy i treat patterns tonify zheng order support organism treatment chemotherapy i use three treasures remedy chemo support radiotherapy radio support treatment principle chemo support tonify zheng resolve dampness clear heat radiotherapy i use three treasures remedy radio support treatment principle radio support nourish cool invigorate blood information chemo support found three treasures newsletters summer information radio support found three treasures newsletters winter information chemotherapy antioxidants found three treasures newsletters spring please note effects radiotherapy long lasting i therefore advocate using radio support least months end treatment

strength fever hot feeling body reflects intensity struggle depends relative strength external pathogenic factor strength zheng stronger external pathogenic factor higher fever hot feeling body likewise stronger zheng higher fever hot feeling body thus fever highest external pathogenic factor zheng strong therefore three possible situations strong pathogenic factor strong zheng high fever hot feeling body strong pathogenic factor weak zheng vice versa medium fever hot feeling body weak pathogenic factor weak zheng low fever hot feeling body fever however relative strength pathogenic factor zheng one factor determines intensity fever hot feeling body another factor simply constitution person person yang constitution i predominance yang prone invasions wind heat rather wind cold

educated correctly remove makeup keep skin clean time i skin riot clogged congested red angry matter many baby wipes i scrubbed face skin improving get me wrong coming puberty definitely helped i started taking care skin developing proper routine i actually started notice difference flash forward today simple three step routine cleanse tone moisturise turned whopping korean inspired step nightly extravaganza complete peels potions oils acids sheet masks retinol list lost yet let me break pre cleanse keeping real usually involves johnson face wipe train home work ones purple packet favourite leave skin feeling dry enough moisture wipe feel like i smearing end day makeup around face remember using wipe remove makeup breaks harder remove products eyeliner mascara however makeup residue still skin moves next two steps oil cleanse i wear spf makeup daily i always double cleanse i start oil cleanser breaks remainder makeup plus keeps skin feeling hydrated i find foaming soapy cleansers make skin feel really tight dry go oil based cleanser lush ultrabland i tried time one i always go back milk cream cleanse next cream cleanser step actually cleans rebalances skin preparation everything else i apply bobbi brown cleansing milk strong favourite however i recently using pixie caroline hirons double cleanse i loving plus oil cream cleanser tub handy acids next comes acids i like use toner containing glycolic acid pixie glow tonic ultimate fave help exfoliate skin without use beads scrub glycolic acid helps increase cell turnover evens skin tone aids collagen production helps fight signs ageing yay science skin really thanks me little guy one products i used i noticed difference skin pretty much instantly bright glowy really smooth i really ca rave enough toner i follow drops hyaluronic acid although mixed reviews i loving one ordinary hyaluronic acid humectant meaning draws water skin helping prevent moisture loss well giving me hydration boost nifty little serum helps repair dry damaged areas skin leaving looking smooth instantly plump sheet mask weekly ahh sheet mask korean cult favourite new world korean skincare let me give quick sheet mask sheet masks cotton based sheets infused serums essences contain variety different ingredients target different skincare concerns need wash face pat remaining essence continue regime easy i like use sheet masks weekly boyfriend steven bought me whole bunch tony moly masks christmas weird wonderful ingredients i loving working way sheet mask skin always feels soft looks bright hydrated

using bobbi brown hydrating eye cream i love cooling feels around eyes skin feels moisturised de puffed excellent retinol i know thinking i promise almost done i move end skincare routine i like use retinol based serum retinol form retinoid derivative vitamin commonly used give skin healthy boost minimising fine lines wrinkles smoothing texture reducing hyperpigmentation dark spots i know i luckily yet see wrinkle dark spot skin however thats whole reason i starting use anti ageing products slow process keep skin looking youthful radiant long possible trust me thank me skin year old note must use spf decide use retinol based product retinol encourages skin cell turnover new skin delicate exposed sun without adequate protection serum ok almost second last step penultimately i go serum serums contain highest concentration active ingredients get without prescription ergo work work well absolute ride die stuck desert island ca live without serum without doubt kiehl midnight recovery concentrate sweet lord divine feels luxurious skin i admit me definitely lives hype skin feels hydrated redness significantly reduced soothing need drops per night bottle lasts forever win win side note product heavily fragranced plant essential oils therefore may aggravate sensitive skin moisturiser ahh finally last step final product i slather face snuggling sheets humble moisturiser would deprive body hydration likewise must deprive skin moisture proper hydration keeps skin looking healthy eliminates rough flakey patches keeps face looking smooth soft fresh plus fights signs premature ageing skip moisturiser i chop change different formulas right i loving origins make difference plus reason exactly says tin ok i lost i hope something i put practice overnight i developed routine
