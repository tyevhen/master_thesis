We went to a local U-pick Strawberry farm this past Saturday. We picked for a little over an hour and got almost 30 pounds of strawberries! The kids had a wonderful time, and they both had so much fun picking!


The hardest part was fighting the temptation to pop them in our mouths!



After picking, we headed to Yellow Creek State Park for a picnic. Picnicking is one of our favorite things to do in the summer. And we do it often. It's very economical, and our kids just love it. No need for an extravagant outing. Just pack up a nice little lunch and grab your picnic blanket, and you're all set to go. We have found that state parks are awesome spots for outings because they have lots of picnicking areas and many have play areas and beaches.

I packed up ham sandwiches with American cheese and lettuce and onions from our garden. I also cut up some refreshing honeydew, and packed baby carrots and garden zucchini with ranch to dip them in. Oh, and we couldn't picnic without a bag of our favorite potato chips - Cape Cod Kettle Cooked. Yummy! It was such a scrumptious and refreshing lunch to have after picking our strawberries.

After a game of soccer and a short swing on the tire swing, we ended our day eating Bomb pops on the beach. This was a nice little treat for the kids that they thoroughly enjoyed!

We have definitely added strawberry picking to our mental list of family activities to do annually.

So, you may ask what I'm going to do with 30 pounds of strawberries. Well, we've already eaten a bunch and as for the rest of them? Well, that's my project today. Fresh strawberry pies and yummy strawberry jam. I'm off to start!
