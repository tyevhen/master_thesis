Much to my excitement, last week my hometown was graced with a beautiful dusting of snow. Although I love summer, winter is without a doubt my favourite season, I just love bundling up in cosy jumpers and thick coats. I thought I'd take advantage of the idyllic snowy scenes and showcase my go-to coat combo!

I filmed a little "Get Ready With Me" / "OOTD" video for this look on my youtube. Feel free to check it out below.
