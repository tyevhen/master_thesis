So, it's been a month since I first put out the call for zine submissions, and I have half a dozen pieces that people have sent in.  However, I was silly and never really mentioned a proper deadline.  SO, I'd really like to have everything in by December 1st, so I can start putting it together then and have it completely finished before Christmas (when I won't have time to do much of anything)!  I know how easy it is to get sidetracked and forget about stuff like this (I know I have done so more times than I would like to admit...), so I figured I'd send out a friendly poke to everyone who said that they may want to contribute something to the zine... *Grins* If you do want to send something in, but aren't able to by December 1st, that's still totally fine.  Just drop me an email at open.eyed.slave@gmail.com to let me know when you're able to send it in by!

Thank you so much to everyone who has expressed interest in this project, whether or not you're able to submit something!  Just having this much interest has made a big difference to me. :-)

Peace,
Idzie
