"Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."
~Martin Luther King Jr
So true. And now, to write papers...

Edit: Turns out part of this quote was not accurately what MLK Jr. said, so I removed the parts that were not his words exactly ("I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy."). The internet is a weird place sometimes. (source)
