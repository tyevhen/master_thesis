Work was good again today, I spent a lot of time preparing for my trip to the US. The office was very quiet as a lot of people work from home on Fridays plus a few have taken holiday as many of us are flying to the US on Sunday.

I ate my lunch in the Orchard again today, it is really pleasant sitting there in the sun. Someone from my office came to join me so I did not feel quite so much like a loner! It was someone who does the same job as I do but I have not talked to him much as we work in different teams.

I have a lot to do tonight and tomorrow, although I have all my work stuff ready to go on Sunday I have not started to get my clothes ready and I do not have a suitcase. Most of them are in the dirty washing and the rest are in the ironing heap.

I have arranged to meet someone I met on a dating website for lunch tomorrow, I stood him up last time as I got really nervous and freaked out. He came quite a long way to see me and he is coming a long way again tomorrow - I can not stand him up again - I hope I do not get too nervous. Not sure why he would still want to meet me? I have been chatting to him for a while now and I have not managed to put him off?

I have loads to do so I need to get on! I will post again tomorrow evening.
