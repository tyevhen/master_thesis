This may be a short post, as I am totally wiped out. My first three days of the mood disorder program, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, were great but long. Mentally, I was whipped going into the weekend. Well, all of that sitting must have ruined me physically, too, as my 13 mile run yesterday was absolutely brutal. It was going so poorly, and I was feeling so fatigued, I probably should have cut it short, but of course I didn't. I spent the rest of the day barely moving. I did get a couple of chores done. Then my friend, Wendy, was kind enough to have me over for dinner. It was nice to spend some time with her before collapsing in bed.

Unfortunately, my fatigue has continued today. I was scheduled to run 5 or 6 miles, but that was unrealistic with how tired I felt. Instead, I shoveled what little snow remained on the driveway and sidewalk, rested, watched some football, took Jet around the block, and did little else. I'm hoping to recoup before I start with the mood disorder program again tomorrow. I think another good night of sleep will do wonders. Until then, I've got more resting to accomplish.
