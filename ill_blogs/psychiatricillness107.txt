I mean what a nightmare. My perfect Christmas would be just me, a bottle of wine and a mountain of films. Instead I have to stay with family and participate in the festivities. I am not even allowed a lie in as I have to help prepare for guests I do not particularly want to see. I hate the tension and the small arguments and bickering.

I have drank far too much wine on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to try and make myself oblivious to my surroundings. My stomach now sounds like stew bubbling and simmering away. The stress of Christmas just drives me to drink!

But oh yes, we have another big meal today and if I pass it makes me the selfish person spoiling Christmas for everyone else. In fact I dispute this. Everyone else is spoiling my Christmas as they make me do something with others everyday. I actually would prefer to be alone, I hate Christmas and families equal nothing but stress!

My family will not let me be alone at christmas but this is more for their sake than mine. I would much prefer the solitude. I dream of a week to watch some films, surf the internet and go to the health club. Maybe stroll around the sales or have some chosen friends to dinner.

An argumentative stressful family events forced upon me is my idea of hell!! Roll on new year and my return to work! Next year I will be stronger and insist on doing my own thing. I will leave the country on a solitary holiday if that is the only way to escape!
