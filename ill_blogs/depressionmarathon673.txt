I had my ninth ECT treatment this morning. It went fine, but I've been really wiped out since then. I spent a lot of the day sleeping and lounging. For whatever reason, this treatment seems to have really sapped my energy.

I saw my inpatient/ECT psychiatrist (different than my usual psychiatrist) this morning before treatment. We discussed doing an entire course of treatments, which means 10-12 total. I'm taking this Friday off, so I'll likely be done with treatments next week or early the following week. I'm feeling better, and I'm encouraged by that. But I can't wait to be done with ECT because I am not allowed to drive for the entire course of treatment. Asking for and arranging rides everywhere is really tough for me.

Living in two houses--at my friends most of the time and occasionally at my own house--is also quickly getting old. I love my friends. I love their home and appreciate their generosity, but I just want to get back to my life. This illness steals so much, big stuff (like my soul) and little stuff (like my daily routine). I want to go back to where I was in early February before this episode began. I want my life back.

I want my life back, yet I'm terrified of taking it back too soon. I don't want to fail. I want to get my life back and keep it. So I'm worried about returning home while simultaneously craving time alone in my house. Returning to work frightens me, yet I miss my patients and the structure my job provides. I want to run errands and be responsible for myself again, although I feel slightly overwhelmed by the prospect. Eventually, I need to take back what depression stole from me. It's knowing the correct timing which may be tricky.

Hopefully, the time for action will become clear as I move back into my life. The good news is I'm at a point where I can even consider such action. The ECT has helped. I am feeling better. And that, I think, is the best news of all.
