I've just got a short update tonight. I had a good, busy, and productive week. I worked 5 days this week. In fact, I just put my feet up after working all day today. After work I ran 10 miles and cooked a couple of meals for the upcoming week. I ran long this week, almost 50 miles total, including my 20-miler yesterday. On Monday and Wednesday evening I attended my kettlebell and suspension training classes, which I really enjoyed. I like getting stronger. I spent last night listening to a fellow alcoholic tell her amazing story of recovery. I feel so blessed to have found recovery when I did. I was spared some of the alcoholic destruction others, like the woman I heard last night, had to experience. And in my spare moments this week, I was continually entertained by my puppy, Jet. He makes me laugh out loud many, many times every day. I'm so glad we found each other. That's my week in a nutshell. Have a great week everyone. Take it one day at a time.
