Time goes by in the blink of an eye. Truth be told, I'm exhausted and worn. But it's all for a worthy cause--we moved! As the most spontaneous thing either of us has ever done, we put an offer on a really cool house after seeing it at an open house when we weren't even really in the market. They accepted our offer contingent on our current home getting a paid offer within 30 days. Drama unfolded as we prepared our house to sell (staged it and had photos taken all within 48 hours). We put it on the market on the 4th of July and it sold within 3 days. Zoom! It was bittersweet to say goodbye to our first home together. We bought it and got married; and we brought our 2 beautiful children home there from the hospital. We had so many happy times and so many heartbreaks. But we are moving in to a wonderful new space that feels like home. It's much bigger, has great personality, and has so many nooks that make me happy. We are only 20 minutes away from our old house but it feels like we are far out in the country. We are surrounded by wonderful old farms, mature woods, and all manner of nature. I have a renewed esteem for my New England homeland! It's a new chapter and I'm excited to share it here.
