I have had a few months where I have been hypomanic for about 50% of the time. Now that is over I seem to have lost the good support network I had. It's hard to get it back :o(

I guess this is my lifetime struggle, no one elses. Other people and friends will come and go through my journey but the bipolar will always be there. Still it is a part of who I am and I must ride out the flat times.

I feel quite low, nothing too severe, just empty and wondering if this is how everyone else feels all the time or whether I am really low. I still feel blessed to experiance life in such an animated way, I still wouldn't stop the illness even if I could!

I have had a bad day at work, struggling with my boss. He treats me like a second class citizen and I am afraid it has got to the point where I can not talk and pass the time of day with him without him jumping on everything being patronising and even insulting. Interfering on with my working relationship with colleagues.

I don't think anyone is out there anymore.
