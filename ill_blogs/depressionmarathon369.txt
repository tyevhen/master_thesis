I escaped the inpatient unit yesterday. Last night was my first night home alone with my dog, Jet. It's strange being home. Because ECT destroyed my memory, I feel lost in my own home. Nothing looks familiar. Nothing feels familiar. I can't remember why I'm doing certain things. It's very disconcerting. I feel like a stranger in my own home, and it sucks! Tomorrow I'm hoping to get outside and walk a little bit. I need to get back to running. I'm actually missing The New York City Marathon, which is tomorrow. I have many friends out in New York who will be running tomorrow. I got my plane ticket, hotel room reservation, and was planning to be there, too, but it was not meant to be. Hopefully, I'll make the journey next year instead. I'll focus my energy on getting myself back onto the road tomorrow. If I can accomplish that, tomorrow will be a very successful day. Besides running, I'll also hope to putz around my house a little tomorrow. After being away for so many days, I feel the need to be present and accounted for around here.
