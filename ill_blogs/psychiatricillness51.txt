I have had enough.

It feels like I am never going to get any better and even if I do it will come back again.

Work is falling apart I am completelyover whelmed by the amount of work I have to do.

I go days and days without talking to anyone and I am  feeling more lonely every day.

I tried calling the psychiatrist today but no one was there.
