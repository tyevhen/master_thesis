it is neither my goal nor my intention to use this blog as a platform of complaint. rather, my premise is education, conversation, and hopefully support. over the last several days, my desperation, frustration, and sadness certainly could be characterized as complaining. certainly. however, in the midst of ever-increasing debility and ever-decreasing energy, the reality of depression while sounding like "poor-me" complaints is actually just reality. unfortunately, it's just reality. and with this illness, sometimes (not all the time, as my fabulous therapist reminded me yesterday--i count on her to do that) reality sucks.
