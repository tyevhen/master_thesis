I have not gone to work today, I went to bed about 10pm and set my alarm for 6am. I pressed snooze a few times, but the next thing I knew it was 8.15. I got up and cleaned my teeth and washed myface but I felt a bit odd and all I wanted to dowas collapse on my bed. I rang in sick and went back to bed. I have just woken up at 1pm. I have slept for 15 hours that can not be normal!!

I feel quite well now though, I find a good nights sleep fixes many problems, I'd like to go to work this afternoon but I think it would lead to suspicion of why I was off. You can not exactly put over tired on your sick form (is this an illness), I do not want to put bipolar as it makes it seem like I am not coping with work. Has anyone got any suggestions?

I wish I felt I could go in this afternoon as I love work and I have a lot to do! I stayed up late for me (10pm) last night as I was getting stuff ready for work. I don't think I have done anything wrong by taking the day off but I do worry about it! Has anyone got any similar experiance of needing to take an odd day off work?
