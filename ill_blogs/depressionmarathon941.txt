Uh, oh...I'm not feeling so well. A little achy, a little nauseous, a little flu-ish. Of course I am! I registered to run the Whistlestop Marathon yesterday. You know, the one I was thinking about doing this weekend! Well, now I'm registered, and now I don't feel so hot. Fortunately, I didn't have to work today. I got in a 6.5 mile run--really slow--and since then I've slept, slept and slept some more. I'm on my way back to bed again right now. Hopefully, more sleep will do the trick.
