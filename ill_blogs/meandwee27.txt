It's so easy to find original art to adorn your home that you can afford! I'm so thrilled to be part of it!
I've removed all my original work from my Etsy store and I'm going to keep that shop focused on open-edition prints/nursery art and greeting cards. Artfinder will host all my originals. It's such an easy-to-use website and if you become a member, you can keep track of your favorite pieces of art and you can follow your favorite artists.
