We tented out last night.


In our backyard. Right off the back deck. Close and convenient to the indoor plumbing.


Hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? (Actually, if it was up to Brad, we'd be setting up tent out in the middle of the wilderness and I'd be relieving myself in a bucket. The truth.)

Lily and I enjoyed a game of Cooties while Brad and Ian enjoyed a game of chess. (I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that my 6 year old can understand and play chess and I can't.)



In other news... I'm frantically flying around getting ready for Ukraine. Oh, please, please, please pray for us. I miss my kids terribly, almost unbearably, already and we haven't even left yet!

Let's see... Oh, yes. We all opened my parents' pool. And we've been swimming a lot. Soaking in the Vitamin D! I'm in love with summer. And with the pitchers of sweet iced tea that come with it!

Lily got a hold of the camera again. Actually, she uses it a lot, but she was walking around taking pics last night before our camp-out.

Here's her dirty little tootsies and suntanned feet...


Her crazy brother...


Her crazy self...

And our bunny Max...


Hope you had a great Memorial Day weekend!
