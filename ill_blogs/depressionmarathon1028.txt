I'm getting prepared for my second race of the season today. Actually, it begins in just over an hour. It's a 15K. I'm not sure what to expect today. Running at least as well as I ran a couple weeks ago would be nice. So I guess I am shooting for around a 1:16. Yes, 1:16 would be nice. However, the way my running has (not) been going lately, and my general blah-ness the last few days, whatever happens will be a surprise! I'll let you know what that surprise turns out to be in a few hours...
