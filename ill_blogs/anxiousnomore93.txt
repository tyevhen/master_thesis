For all of you procrastinators out there- today is the final day of the Reality of Anxiety's first giveaway so get to it! Entering is easy and if you win (winners will be randomly selected by a 3rd party drawing service) you will recieve a free copy of The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Edmund J. Bourne. As I have said in the past, this book has been the greatest help to me personally in learning to manage my anxiety. The tools found in its pages can bring you so much clarity and peace. I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from any kind of anxiety or fears.
So how do you enter? You can do any of the following (each one you do will be a separate entry so you can enter up to three times):

HOW TO ENTER:

ALL ENTRIES MUST BE RECEIVED BY 11:59:59 PM (MST) ON Sept 25, 2009.

SELECTION OF WINNERS:
