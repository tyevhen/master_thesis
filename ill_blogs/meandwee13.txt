Hi friends!
Here's a time-lapse video I made of myself creating a painting of a junco wearing a capelet. It features collage and gouache and I hope you enjoy watching it! It was fun to make! For reference I used a photo my father took (with his permission of course!) and I created the capelet myself from imagination. The final piece is 5x5 inches.
