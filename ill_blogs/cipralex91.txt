The doc said it will take 2 to 4 weeks for the pills to start have a positive effect, until then, it can also get worse...but thats normal, so take this into consideration, have patience and continue to take them even if nothing good happens in the first month...



but you will feel something (besides the side effects) i mean, something good, doesn't matter if you're taking it for depression or anxiety or for panic attacks, there are mild changes from day 2 you will notice, that will keep you going...
