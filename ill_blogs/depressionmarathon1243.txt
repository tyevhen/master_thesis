Puck is home. He seems to be in a lot of pain. I'm exhausted, and I have yet to run today! I've already missed two days this week, and it's getting desperately close to three if I don't liven-up pretty quick! But I think Puck's being in pain makes me exhausted! Is that possible?
He's got some pain meds, an anti-inflammatory, and an antibiotic, but he's had everything he can have today, and he still hurts. I hate it! He's quite pathetic, actually, and I mean that in the most loving way possible!
I have to do passive range of motion and massage to his knee twice per day. He's not very fond of me touching his leg, but he trusts I won't hurt him and allows me to do it, which is nice. This is definitely a time where I feel more of a two-way bond with him. He's counting on me to keep him safe and comfortable. When he's well, he'd go with pretty much anyone without looking back!

I did observe the surgery yesterday, and as soon as the vet clinic locates their camera's cable, I will download pictures for all to see. It was really interesting, and I was less anxious being in the room with him where I could see he was still breathing! Seeing surgery has also helped me already with his rehab. Since I know exactly where and how much was cut, poked, stretched, etc...I have a much better feel for where to massage and how much pressure I can apply externally. So I am very glad I decided to observe.

I think these first few weeks are going to be very long. Total recovery time is going to be 8 weeks, most likely. But my boy is a trooper. I'm glad he's home. I know he'll get through this. The jury has yet to decide if I'll make it or not...
