In a decision which can only be described as baffling, the Pentagon has decided that a purple heart shall be awarded only to those who suffer "physical" injuries during a war. This is a slap in the face to our country's military personnel who bravely risked their lives, shockingly witnessed violence, maiming and death, and then tragically lost their jobs, homes and families as a result of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Perhaps loss of function would be a better determinant of who should and should not qualify for one of our military's highest honors. Is a traumatized soldier who can't sleep, can't work, can't sustain his marriage, and eventually commits suicide as a direct result of his war experiences less deserving of this medal than a soldier who takes a bullet fragment in the ass? How can anyone, even a government agency, ponder such a comparison and still find justice in this decision?

Stigma and discrimination rear their ever-present, ugly heads once again. To the U.S. servicemen and women belittled by this ridiculous "policy," let me be the first to say, "I'm sorry."
