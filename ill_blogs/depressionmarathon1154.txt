Three letters never before associated with my name--D.N.F.
I walked off the course today at mile 11.5. I was on pace to qualify, but my body was expending so much energy attempting to stay warm, I knew I was not going to be on my feet much longer if I continued. The weather called for "showers" that were supposed to start later in the morning or early afternoon. Unfortunately, the rain and wind began within 10 minutes of the start. The temperature dropped, and then it began to POUR! A steady downpour continued from approximately 4-11 miles. Around mile 10.75, we turned a corner and things went from barely tolerable to worse. A stiff, cold wind whipped us from the left. By the time I walked off the course 3/4 of a mile later, the temp was only in the mid 40's, which meant the windchill factor must have been around freezing! I decided to live for another day rather than risk my health, my body and my mind by struggling through another 15 miles.
I have never NOT finished a race before. I'm going to take a few days off, and then look for another marathon to enter within the next two months. It was brutal being bussed to the finish line, at which I arrived just as I would have been finishing. Watching hundreds of runners finishing under four hours, I thought, "Why them and not me?" But I think I made a good decision, even though it isn't sitting very well right now. Tough day.

P.S. Insult to injury--as I sit here typing this, one hour after I should have finished, the sun just came out and the temperature is on the rise. Gotta love the marathon!
