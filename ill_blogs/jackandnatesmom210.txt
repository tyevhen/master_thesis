This weekend is a very very special anniversary for John and me. In some ways, even more important than our wedding anniversary.  This weekend it's been a year since we began our Retrouvaille journey.  See this post for a refresher:

What a year it has been!  I am so proud of us!  I am so proud of our family.  And I know that we are both in it for the long haul. 

We are going away today for the first time since we had children, just the two of us.  Unless you count our Retrouvaille weekend, and we do not.  Thank you mom and dad for watching the boys.  It's only one night, and we are going to the TACA conference, but hey, away is away.  Meals without kids are meals without kids.  A full night's sleep is- well, it's heaven.  And the craziest thing is that this conference is taking place in the exact same town in Pennsylvania where our Retrouvaille weekend was held.  Malvern!!!  Not even that big of a town! 

We have learned so much about the true meaning of love, and real commitment.  We know each other in a way that we never did before this experience- and maybe that's what it's all about.  You can let a crisis in a marriage and family be the end or you can take it, recenter yourselves, learn from the situation, and bam, you may just find yourselves at a whole new level in your relationship.  Totally. worth. it.

I stand by this, now more than ever
