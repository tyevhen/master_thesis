Today, to my surprise, Psych Central included this blog in their list of the top ten depression blogs on the web. Wow! I am stunned, honored, humbled, and grateful.
Thank you, editors of Psych Central, for this tremendous gift. Thank you, readers, for sticking with me through this first year. I've learned a lot, developed e-friendships galore, and felt your love and support when I needed it most. Thank you.
