--------

Update: Kudos to US Bank! After a few more e-mails and a couple more phone calls, I spoke with Kathleen at the Stillwater US Bank location where my $50.00 went "missing." She confirmed a few pieces of information so she could "review the tapes," but then immediately asked for my address so she could send me a $50.00 check. They are going to refund my money. She obviously hadn't yet "reviewed the tapes," but she was going to refund my $50.00 anyway. Cool. It almost seemed too easy after all the previous hoop jumping. Perhaps she had already reviewed the receipts and found the teller was at least $50.00 over. I don't know. She didn't say if she found an error or not. I don't really care. She did the right thing. I am a happy customer who will continue to bank with them. Maybe that actually did matter for something. Thanks, Kathleen.
