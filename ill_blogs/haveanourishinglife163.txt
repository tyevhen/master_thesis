Something that helps promote my positive body image is creativity.

I like starting with a blank sheet of paper, a clean canvas, a word document, a new ball of yarn, or an untouched recipe.

The process of creating is more fun and more fulfilling than the final product.

  Remember: You don’t have to be artistically talented to be creative…

  Creativity is about enjoying the expression of yourself.

Whether you are copying a master or inventing something out of nowhere, you are still producing unique, original art that you, and only you, are capable of creating.

Don’t deny the world your creations just because you don’t think you’re good enough!

And don’t deny yourself the wonderful experience of creativity just because of the artist stigma.

  To cultivate your creativity try…

Showing up for 20 minutes a day.

Step 1: Set your kitchen timer for 20 minutes.

Step 2: Show up to your creative space and “be there” until the timer goes off.  Even if you are just standing in front of a blank canvas, even if you end up organizing your art supplies for the first week, even if you don’t finish your project in the time allotted, just show up for 20 minutes – no more, no less.

Step 3: Repeat daily.

  Try it for a month…

I guarantee you will begin to enjoy a more nourishing life in the process!
