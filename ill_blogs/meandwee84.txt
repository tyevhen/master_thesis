Like I said the other day, I'm trying to figure out my artistic aesthetic and style. I recently went on a shopping trip and realized a lot of the clothes I bought (thanks for my Mother's Day gifts Chris!) seem to have a similar style. That can't be coincidence! So, I went around my bedroom and took a few pictures with my iphone of a few of my favorite new clothes, little color combos I like, and objects I love. I'll have to do this around the rest of the house! I can definitely see a theme standing out. Yay! Here are some of the photos so you can see what I mean. Thanks for joining me and humoring me!
