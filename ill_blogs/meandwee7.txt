Hi friends!
I've got a whole bunch of woodland critter nursery art prints all finished up and ready to go! I'm so excited with how they came out. Paige (age 6 now!) begged for me to put the unicorn print up in her room and I was happy to oblige! I recently showed a few of the original paintings of these at a local art show I did and the children who walked by all stopped and gushed about them and wanted one for themselves (each one had their own favorite!).

It felt so awesome to see children in "real life" enjoyed my artwork and they were enthusiastic about it enough to want it for their rooms. I noticed those kids were around 8 years old or so. The prints work great for baby rooms but also work great for older kids' rooms too because they don't look babyish...they grow with your kids. I sold some to adults who favored a certain animal too...good for their office space or craft room. Win!

 I have two sizes of prints for sale: 12x12 inch and 8x8 inch. The larger prints are the size of a standard vinyl record album cover. They are great when framed; they aren't too big or too small and work well hung in a set. The 8x8 are smaller and work well framed standing upright on a dresser. A friend of mine has a whole series of them framed and hung in a row lining her daughter's bedroom wall...really cool! I will continually add to this line of animals; I'm currently working on a raccoon and a chipmunk as I write this. Do you have a favorite critter you'd like to see? Feel free to comment below!

The original paintings of these are for sale at Megan Carty Art. They are 5x5 inch acryla gouache paintings on aquabord (like clayboard). I did the little accessories on watercolor paper, trimmed them out, and used archival gel medium to glue them onto the painting. I like the little added dimension of that. They also come with a cute little display easel. I think this style would be great for your own small custom pet portrait. Please email me at megan@megancartyart.com if you are interested in something like that!

Here's a little high-speed movie of one being created:


The prints are archival giclee (this means they are done on super-fancy thick cotton paper with fade-proof professional inks) so they are made to last and be of the highest quality.
I hope you like them as much as I do!
