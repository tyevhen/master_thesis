AND



Chris and Paige (mostly Chris) put out this year's mulch over the weekend. That pile still wasn't enough!
Chris and I have also gotten back into our "two date-nights per month" routine. We schedule with the babysitter at the beginning of the month so that it's planned and on the calendar (most likely to do it then!) Saturday night found us at the fancy mall doing some childless shopping (you know, the non-rushed kind where you can browse) and ate a long meal at the Cheesecake Factory where we went nuts over the taquitos. I love that man!
Next Saturday Paige turns 3. Oh my!
