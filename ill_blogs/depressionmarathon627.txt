I'm afraid my body is against me. My right knee has been steadily improving. It has improved so much, in fact, that I was able to run on it today. I did a one mile lap with Puck to warm up, and that went really well. After dropping Puck at home, I set out again. I was just settling into my relaxed pace when I felt a tug and then burning in my left calf. I knew immediately. It stopped me in my tracks. I pulled my left calf muscle again. My body, apparently, is revolting.

I'm so frustrated. I was only two miles into my run when this happened. I don't know what to think. I've been working hard and doing the right things, but to no avail. I guess I'll make a massage appointment. My massage therapist fixed my calf in August. Maybe she can work her magic again. The Twin Cities Marathon is looking more doubtful every day. Oh well, maybe this is God's way of telling me to rest. If so, I don't like the message!
