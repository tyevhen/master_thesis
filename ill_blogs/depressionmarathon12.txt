I hate being sick, and boy have I been sick! For 6 days I've had a painful cough, congestion, and body aches. I've been unable to work, exercise, or even get out of my house. Today I can't talk. It's been really rough. I keep waiting for whatever this is, likely flu, to improve, but it just keeps hanging on and dragging me down. Enough already!

As a result of being sick and being stuck in the house, my mood has taken a little dip. I have way too much time on my hands. I have little to no energy to do anything with my time, yet I can only sleep so much. So here I am, bored, and tired, and feeling under the weather for the sixth day in a row. I'm not sure what to do with myself.

I hate what this prolonged illness is doing to my fitness and finances. Just as I was getting back up to speed in both areas this virus comes along and stops me in my tracks. I've missed 3.5 days of work and 6 days of exercise. Money and fitness flying out the window. Frustrating. I'm reminding myself this is temporary. I'll feel better soon. But I'm getting a little impatient. I hate being sick.
