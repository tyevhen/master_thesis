What make us forget? Forget about how it used to be and just live the moment like that’s how it’s always been… I wonder a lot about that lately…
I’ve notice that lately I forgot that I’m on cipralex, I forgot that I used to experience panic attack, depression, flushes and stress…daily stress… on every silly little thing that happens…sometimes even on events that never took place…I guess it was the old “what if…” days…
You probably wonder why I am bringing this up, the reason for that is that in recent days I noticed I just forget that I’m cipralex and I act as if I’ve always been like I am now…
That’s good… but sometimes I also forget to take the pill on time…missed a day or two lately…
But it’s interesting … maybe it’s a sign I soon won’t need those pills…
Meanwhile I’m sticking to my plan and to the doc instructions…
I’m happy and stable…
It’s now been 390 days I’m the pill… and I’m not regretting it at all!
Probably was one of the smartest decisions I took in my life.
Take care now, I’m reading your comments always and it’s great to see you guys help each other.
I will post more soon.
