Well, The feeling of "the drug presence" is kinda gone... at least for this day, I've notice my modjo is bit down, Seems like sex starting to intrest me less... but I've checked and double checked, I have no problems with errection and getting orgasms, I actually feel more in control of my body...
anyways, they say you need at least a month until you actually see results...but there are waves like always, I call them feelings waves,



and the gaps between feeling good, ok or bad is now changing...
I will post more about that one soon...take care.
