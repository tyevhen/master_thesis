Irrational Mind (IM): I feel a little heavy.
Rational Mind (RM): That's normal. You're tapering.

IM: My legs feel heavy and tired.
RM: Your legs always feel heavy and tired during your taper. It's normal.

IM: I think I've gained 2 pounds.
RM: It's normal to gain a little bit of weight, even a few pounds, during a taper for a marathon.

IM: I'm afraid it's going to make me slower.
RM: We've been through this 22 times. You'll be fine, just as you've been every other time.

IM: My knees feel sore.
RM: That's happened to you before. Aches and pains, and worries about aches and pains, are normal while tapering.

IM: What if I don't finish?
RM: Worse things have happened. The world will not end. Besides, you've finished 22 times before!

IM: I feel worried and anxious.
RM: You always feel worried and anxious just before a marathon. It's normal.

IM: I'm worried my mood will be affected.
RM: You always feel worried and anxious before a marathon. It's normal. It doesn't mean you're mood is faltering.

IM: Are you sure?
RM: 22 times!!

IM: I'm worried about Jet. I hate leaving him.
RM: You always hate leaving him. He's resilient. He'll survive. So will you.

IM: What if something happens?
RM: Your dog sitter is very capable. You've used her before, and nothing has happened. Why would this time be any different?

IM: I don't think I did a very good job speaking to that class yesterday.
RM: Where did that thought come from? I thought we were talking marathon!

IM: Oh, right... I feel a little heavy.
RM: Ugh. Here we go again...
