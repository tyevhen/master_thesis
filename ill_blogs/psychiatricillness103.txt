I've had a better day to day but I still feel so low. My confidence has had a major knock as it all relied on work and my success at work. Now I know that those who built my confidence did so on a wonky foundation. I am not good, at least not as good as anyone else in the office. They have been so patronising saying yes you are good, just not as good as me and not as good as anyone else because they are just better. So where does that leave me!!!!

I've had friends round this afternoon, we went for dinner. One of my friends stayed a bit longer and we went for a drink. I talked a bit and again it is helping me get things back in perspective.

I took extra quetiapine last night to help me sleep. I do not like the dizzy sensation it gives me. I'm staying completely off alcohol for the time being. I will take extra quetiapine again tonight just to make sure I sleep. When I woke up this morning my limbs were so heavy but today my mind has rested.

Tomorrow I am going to the gym and in the evening I am going o a pub quiz with a friend. I am still trying to keep busy and get things back into perspective.

Work sucks and I am angry at some people. I guess it is better I am hating them than hating myself. I like my job and other colleagues just a few have been arseholes.
