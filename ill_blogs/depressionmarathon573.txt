This post could also be titled, Another One Bites the Dust. Catchy, don't you think? Both titles are appropriate. Depression has cost me a lot over the years. So many valuable assets, like self confidence, financial independence, and employment security, have been lost to this illness. It is the king of thieves. And it has struck again.

Remember D? He was the boyfriend I had been building a relationship with since last June. Well, he's gone. Another victim of this selfish illness, he was unable to hang in there as depression ravaged my life over the past couple months. It wasn't dramatic. It was more of a slow, quiet disappearance. And then he was gone.

I last saw him at Christmas. We spent it together. In fact, I got out of the hospital, after three days, in order to travel to his home and be with him for the holiday. It was wonderful. One week later, I was back in the hospital. It was then that he began to pull away. I heard from him less and less, and only if I initiated the contact. Finally, after a long period of silence, I phoned him last week. We talked. But it was too late. He was already gone.

It's too bad. I will miss him. I already miss what we were building together. My friends tell me I deserved better. Maybe that's so, but D was where I was putting my energy. And I liked him. I respected him. We were good together. It's frustrating to lose to depression once again. It's too bad he couldn't see past an illness. It's too bad. And that's about all there is to say about that...
