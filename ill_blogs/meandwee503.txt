It's funny how I turn into a crazed lunatic every time I get hungry. I've found lately that I'll think to myself "hmm. I might be starting to feel hungry." Or while out shopping Chris will ask me "how are you doing? Do you need a snack?" And I'll say "oh, I'm ok for now. Maybe a little hungry, but I can wait." I liken these statements to the moment a werewolf sees a full moon.
Well. Usually it takes about 5 more minutes before suddenly I'm in freak-out mode. My eyes widen as I become a drooling scavenging monster. I become a shell of the person I once was. I become inconsolable, angry, and desperate: MUST....HAVE...FOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!! ARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH *drool* *drool* *pant* *pant*
This reminds me of the old Saturday Night Live sketch with Chris Farley dressed as a school girl at the mall food court with her friends. He's using a cutesy girly voice and seems calm. She's eating from a plate of fries and a friend says "Same some for us!" as he is starting to wolf them down and he suddenly screams: "Lay OFF bitch! I'm staaaaaaarrvviiiiing!" as he starts shoveling fistfuls into his face. Well. That is me. Fine and willing to share one second. And a screaming panicky mess the next. I find I just cannot wait when I need to eat and everything must be put on hold until food is en-route to my stomach. Violence seems excusable. Note to self: Keep tasty snacks with self at all times. It will save yourself and your marriage. P.S. Twenty weeks today and half-way there!
