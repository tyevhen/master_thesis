I saw the psychiatrist last week and he has reduced my sertraline from 150mg to 100mg because I am having too many hypo episodes. I have been taking the lower dose for about 5 days. I feel quite empty and possibly a little depressed. I wonder if it s the change in medication or whether I am just cycling. not even sure if I am just in a normal mood or slightly low. I don't think I know what normal is like anymore. I am still takng the Quetiapine and have no plans to reduce that ever!! I am feeling quite fed up and almost want o be hypo again! I'm just really fed up with it all at the moment.
