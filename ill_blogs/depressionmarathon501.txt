It's Sunday, and two weeks from today I will be sitting here recounting the details of the wonderful, hopefully, fast, hopefully, marathon I ran that morning. Two weeks from today is The Twin Cities Marathon. I ran 13 miles at marathon pace yesterday, and I felt pretty good, especially considering I had a very busy week. I spent my time running, especially when I was feeling good, visualizing marathon day. Hopefully, those visualizations will help when marathon day is actually upon me.

I'm really looking forward to this race. I'm trying not to let the negative, worry thoughts slip in. It's a bit dangerous to get too excited about a marathon, as it's such a long race, anything can happen. But I feel like I've trained really hard, and I've definitely put in the work to set myself up for a good day. That's all I could do. The outcome is yet unknown. We'll see what happens. Only two weeks to wait.
