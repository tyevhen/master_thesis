I've heard about it, and now I think I may be feeling just the beginning of it, maybe. Post-marathon depression. Does that sound familiar to anyone? I'd love to know your story if you've got one, as I don't think there is much written on the subject. I'm feeling a little let-down, a little droop in my mood. I'm trying to guard against a big post-event plunge partly by just being aware of it. Other than that, I'm not sure what to do.

I'm guessing that focusing forward will help. That's why I'm already thinking about my next goal. In fact, I'm thinking about another marathon! Given the result of this race, I'm convinced I can run a better race by fixing some of the weaknesses of this training bout.

Running more miles on fewer pounds are two of the weaknesses I can easily address. For example, I only ran around 30 miles per week. Running at least 40-45 miles would give me a more competitive base. And then there are these 10 extra pounds I'm lugging around. I certainly will run better if I lay off the chocolate...but I LOVE chocolate! Fixing these weaknesses will make a big difference in a race--any race.

Racing--that's another thing I plan to keep doing to guard against post-marathon depression. I want to take advantage of my current condition, and stay motivated to improve my condition by signing up for more races. I hope racing more often will help keep this one race in perspective. After all, it was just one race.

Other than that, I think I'll keep talking to all of you. Since I began this blog 18 months ago, my depression has steadily improved. Coincidence? I don't know, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
Have a good day everyone!
