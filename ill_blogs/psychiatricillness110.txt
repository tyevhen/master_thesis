Work was horrible, a really hard slog today. I was in tears twice for no reason at all. I went to submit my end of year appraisal to find my supervisor had been changed on the system. I guess this is an administration error surely this would not be done without informing me and it is VERY unlikely to be the person it has been changed to. This just adds to the uncertainty and stress :o(.

Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day!
