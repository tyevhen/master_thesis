Here is my account of Liam's labor and delivery story; born at 39 weeks. I hope you enjoy!

And to answer my longtime reader "Sapphire's" question in my previous post: Paige is going to be 6 in April, Noah has just turned 3 (a post about that to come soon!), and now Liam is here! He was born 3 days before Noah's birthday! Looks like we'll have a busy January from now on! And your idea to do a post/video about our routine with 3 kids is a good one! I'll work on that soon; especially once I HAVE a routine with 3! Ha! We're muddling it out right now...so far so good! And I also will be doing a video about my Mommy Must-Haves, now that I've had 3 kids and a bunch of perspective in hind-sight. See y'all soon!
