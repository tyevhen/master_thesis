Dear Readers,
What you are about to see is the most comprehensive and compassionate description of Borderline Personality Disorder I have ever seen. Thanks to Clinically Clueless for finding this and posting it on her blog, which is where I first viewed it. I also send heartfelt thanks to the creator, aperfectingangel on YouTube. Thank you, aperfectingangel. This is truly beautiful.



If you know anyone touched by, confused by, or suffering from BPD, send them this video link. I bet they'll thank you for it.
