I had my last ECT treatment today. It was uneventful, just the way I like it. I will be in the hospital overnight, and I will return home tomorrow morning. I can't wait to see my dog! I miss him so much! Apparently, he's been quite the charmer for his caretakers. I can't wait to return home with him and settle into our normal routine again.

Overall, I'm feeling 100% better than when I came into the hospital. I can't believe the difference a few weeks inpatient and a few dozen ECTs made. I'm like a new person. I hope to stay shiny and new for a long time to come.

I'm being discharged just in time to begin training for the Boston Marathon. I don't think I'll be breaking any speed records at Boston this year, but I'm going to run it nonetheless. I'm anxious to test out my newly healed right knee. Here's hoping it holds up to the rigors of marathon training.

That's all I have for today. I'm feeling healed. Depression, I think, has been beat back once again. I hope it's a long, long time before I need to see the inside of a hospital once again.
