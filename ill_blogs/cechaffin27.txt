I need to be hospitalized for acute depression, and we shall try today.

My manic journey is recorded on this blog.  It always ends badly.

I cannot write anymore about depression.  It is the soul destroyer.

I know I have spam problems with this blog and I know they will accumulate in my absence but I leave this as a note.

Namaste,

Craig
