Anyone who knows me will know I have a HUGE obsession with Ariana Grande! She recently recorded a song with UK artist Mika (which obviously I love because she's in it) and the video is just spectacular! It's so creative, the costumes and the makeup are AMAZING and I've been dying to try and recreate her look myself...
