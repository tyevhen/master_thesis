Black and white. My two favourite colours when it comes to fashion. 

As i've been picking up bits and bobs for my A/W wardrobe, I've noticed that all I seem to be buying are simple, understated, black and white pieces. I think thats a great combination to go for if you want to look effortlessly cool, especially if you want to take a new direction with your style but don't know where to start. Basically, what i'm trying to say is, you can never go wrong with black and white!
