I'm going to look like this soon if my hair loss keeps up. I read that during pregnancy your scalp retains the hair so you don't shed very much each day like normal. Then, once the baby comes, you supposedly lose the hair you would have shed during the nine months. But it all happens generally at the same time. So, 2 weeks ago when Paige was 10 weeks my great hair shedding started. Holy geez, my hair comes out in clumps as I brush! Then, my hands pull out even more. And it's every day!!! I'm just glad I'd read about this, otherwise I'd be having a coniption. It seems like it might be finally slowing down now, but I'm not sure. Once glance at my bathroom floor would say otherwise. Sometimes I even find one or two in Paige's little fist...like a little prize. My hair is showing up everywhere! I wonder if I can pull off a bald look?
