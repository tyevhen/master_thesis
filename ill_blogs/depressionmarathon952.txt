It's been almost 8 complete weeks since I began training seriously again. With one exception, I've run 5 days per week every week, just as my schedule dictated. I've also run the miles called for at each workout. In previous training cycles, neither of the above were true. When I created and followed my own schedule, I often tinkered with the mileage and many times missed days. Following The Runner's World schedule, and revealing only one week of the schedule at a time, seems to be working for me. I've been able to focus on the present, keep motivated, and stay on track.

I'm starting to feel like a runner again. Training runs have gotten easier. I'm feeling lighter. I'm racing often. And finally, my race times are coming down! I ran a tough, tough cross-country race last night. This year my finishing time was two minutes faster than last year's time. In a 5K race, that's a notable improvement! So things are improving, and I'm starting to feel like a runner again.

It sure is nice when hard work pays off. I'll keep plugging away one mile at a time.
