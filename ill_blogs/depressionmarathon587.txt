A one ton gorilla
sits atop my chest.
It is depression.
I am pinned.
Suffocating.
There is no chance
of getting up.

A one ton gorilla
sits atop my chest.
I can't breathe.
My thoughts race
looking for a way out.
But the gorilla
will not let go.

I squirm with might.
I wiggle and flail.
Past successes matter not.
This time
the gorilla is not phased.
I know not what else to do.
My tool box is empty.

From my precarious perch
I scheme with friends.
I consult with professionals.
I summon the best,
and they surround me with care.
But the gorilla,
he is not moved.

A one ton gorilla
sits atop my chest.
Oblivious, he is,
at my attempts
to remove him.
Hopelessly suffocating,
I fear for my life.
I no longer know how to escape.
This gorilla, it seems,
will never be moved.
