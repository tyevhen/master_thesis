I just came in from a run/walk. Yes. I ran yesterday and today. It was my first time out since my hip surgery October 21st. Specifically, I ran for 3 minutes and walked for 1 minute for a total of  2.3 miles yesterday and 3.2 miles today. Both days were crisp and gray, and the cold air felt good on my face and in my lungs. My gray mood had kept me inside for the previous 13 days. It was a relief to get out the door, and even more of a relief to put one foot in front of the other down the street.

My depression symptoms are still hanging around. Some moments feel better than others. I think I'm beginning to feel a little better. But my thinking is still dark and even, at times, a little paranoid. It's depression. My brain only lets such thoughts seep out when the darkness has set in. Like I said, some moments are lighter lately. I'm still making it to work. Adding exercise to work means I actually got two things accomplished yesterday! It's a beginning.

In other news, and possibly related to my depression symptoms, I was just diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. Basically, I stop breathing multiple times each night. My sleep is disrupted every time I stop breathing, which may explain some of my fatigue. Fortunately, it's treatable.

Fatigue has always been a part of my depression. The worse my symptoms get, the more tired I get. My psychiatrist is very hopeful that beginning C-PAP therapy (wearing a breathing mask at night), which I began a couple of days ago, will put an end to my fatigue. That would be incredible. I can't imagine my life without fatigue.

I appreciate all of your supportive comments lately. You guys really hold me up when I'm feeling down. I write this blog in hopes of helping others, but at times like this, it turns out I'm the one being helped. I'm so grateful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
