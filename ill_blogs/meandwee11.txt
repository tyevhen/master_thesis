Liam, you were baptized on April 19th at St. Joseph Church here in our little town. It was special and beautiful. I will work my hardest to teach you all about Jesus and why we live our lives to help others in our own unique special ways. We should always try our best to love others, no matter what. We need to pray for those who are in their hardest times and know that we are all equal and children of God. Every person matters and every person deserves love and an amazing life.
We love you little peanut!

Here you are with your proud Godparents (Auntie Anne and Uncle Brian) and Daddy making funny faces...
