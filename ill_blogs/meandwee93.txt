Do you ever feel discouraged? Like when you have grand plans and work so hard on them but nothing happens?
That's what I'm going through right now.
I guess I'm just in a little frustrated rut. You see, I've created so many different artworks and paintings for my shop but my sales are not at all what I'd hoped they would be. It's hard when you get excited about your own work, but others don't see it the same way. Especially when you put your heart and soul into it.
My confidence has taken such a hit and I find myself questioning what I'm doing. If I'm going to spend my free time creating, I also want to be making something that I can sell. Finding that "magic formula" is so hard. I feel like I am just all over the map with my work and can't settle on one approach. Does anyone else ever feel like this?
I know I need a niche and a focus for my work but it's been so hard to settle on one thing. It's hard to tour around all the great Etsy shops and see so many shops having lots of sales each day. Where am I going wrong? What am I missing? It's one of those days where I just want to toss up my hands and give up.
I know better than that. Does anyone have any advice, wisdom or feedback? I'm happy to listen! I'm so grateful for any thoughts you may have!
I'll be back soon with more positive words! sigh.
