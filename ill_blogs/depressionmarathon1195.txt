been a long time
many synapses successfully bridged
millions
until today

until now

sharp is less
pain
bloody
the same

can only hold
stem the tide
so
long

i am not the me
you
think
i am not the me
i
want
who am
i

slasher
failure
relief


failure
slasher
relief

bridges collapsed
synapses down
medic
needed

where's the wizard
i need
a
new
brain

too too late
