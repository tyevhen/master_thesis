Hello!
It's that time again to play along with What I Wore Wednesday. We're all inspiring each other to get dressed (at least sometimes!) during the day and feel good about ourselves.
This outfit was donned thanks to a hot day. I used to throw on shorts and a random t-shirt, but I've found I enjoy the breeziness of a skirt. If it's long and soft, that's even better! With all the scooting around with Noah all day, I need the skirt to have length.
This skirt in the photo is from Downeast, as is the fun little short-sleeved sweater. One thing I took a risk on was with matching the colors of the skirt and shirt. I wouldn't normally choose them together first, but they do coordinate. I like that it's an unexpected combo. And I also like the unique shapes of the pieces...there's a definite 1940s thing going on that excites me. All are machine washable, easy, and comfortable. I know most of my clothes lately are from the same place; I just hit the jackpot with Downeast Basics...cute clothes that are unique and inexpensive. Weee!

I'd also like to say, in full disclosure, that this photo was taken specifically for this post. (And yes, I'm sucking in my stomach like a Hoover vacuum again) I was alone, so I put the camera on our patio table and used the automatic timer feature. I felt like a douche standing there in my yard acting silly, but hey. All in the spirit of sharing, right? I'm a dork, and it's ok.

I hope you enjoy your Wednesday! Feel free to link back if you have your own Stay at Home Mom Style post; I'd love to see and share!!!
