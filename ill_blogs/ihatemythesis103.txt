I chose to write this blog anonymously because I didn't want my thesis adviser to read it and get mad. I also don't want any of the people who are in charge of keeping me on track (i.e. the few friends who don't try to tempt me with beer and good times) to know how off track I just may be. So I have taken the reasonable precautions of withholding my name and using a fake picture (kudos to anybody who can tell who the picture is of).

THESIS PROGRESS: 2.25 of 40 pages written*
*That's only for chapter 3, the full thesis is much longer.
