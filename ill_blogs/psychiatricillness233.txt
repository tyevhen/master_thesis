Last tear when I was at a very low point in my life, I had just come out of hospital after a psychotic episode and I was finding life very difficult. A friend encouraged me to write a list of things to do before I was 30. I was quite seriously contemplatng suicide at the time so I made the list things to do before I die (much to her concern at the time).
