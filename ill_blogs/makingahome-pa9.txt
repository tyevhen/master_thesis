It has been so gray, dreary, cold, and rainy here for way too long. When I woke up yesterday morning, the sun was actually out and the sky was blue and I was so, so happy. I'm telling you all, I do not tolerate gray days very well. Which is completely ironic since I live in Western Pennsylvania, which happens to be one of the least sunny places  in the United States. Really now. Go figure. 

Anyway, the sun was out yesterday when I woke up, and I immediately felt so much more energized and ready to go about my day. I had herbs, veggies, and flowers that I wanted to plant, and I had a big pile of my handspun yarn that needed heat-treated and hung out to dry. 

I managed to get all of the yarn simmered and pulled out of the pot and hung outside to dry. I'm not kidding when I say that a mere ten minutes after I hung out the skeins, Lily yelled into the house that it was thundering. I thought she was mistaken, but then the wind started to blow and the rain started to pour from the sky. Thankfully, Lily's warning gave me time to grab the skeins and put them on the back porch. 

It was a short-lived rain. It probably only lasted less than an hour, and then the sun did come out again and remained out the rest of the day. I can live with that. And while it rained, we ran to our neighbor's nursery and picked up a few hanging baskets and flowers. We also stopped and picked up a couple of fleeces that a neighbor was giving to me since she was literally just going to throw them away. (Gasp.) I have no idea what type of sheep she has; she didn't know either. Her son had bought them for her at an auction. However, I'll clean the wool and play around with it and see what it's like.

It ended up being a pretty productive day. The yarn dried. I got all of the plants into the raised beds. I prettied up our landscaping with some flowers. And I enjoyed doing all of these things while replenishing my vitamin D levels.
