Are you sleepwalking through life? Is your first thought in the morning your dream of going back to bed that night—to get through the day as quickly and painlessly as possible, in order to escape back into the realm of dreams that night, and forget your life as much as possible? This is a living death. Going through the motions. This is a life that is void of purpose.

Does this sound familiar? This was my life when depression was kicking my ass. I couldn't find any purpose as long as my symptoms were knocking me flat. I couldn't see any reason for the excruciating pain--often still can't when I am in the middle of it--and that led me to see suicide as the only way out. I didn't succeed. I remained among the living dead for a long, long time.

My depression has not released me. I am not yet free. But I believe one reason I am now often able to withstand the ferocious attacks is because I have discovered a purpose. This blog. In a way, I'm now able to use depression's own crippling strikes to strike it right back. Writing has always been an effective escape for me, but now I have you; reading, commenting, and hopefully finding comfort in the very pain that transforms my keyboard. You are not alone, and I am not alone. I have a purpose, and by offering connection, humor, or support to you, I receive support, too. How cool is that?!

Recognizing our true purpose—what really drives us—can allow us to make dramatic changes in our lives. Determining what one’s purpose is and vowing to pursue it to the fullest can lead to a true renaissance in our personal and professional endeavors.
