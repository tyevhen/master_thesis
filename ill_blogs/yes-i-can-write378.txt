We signed up officially, paid, reserved the hotel room, the whole thing! This makes me very happy. :-)

I haven't been blogging much, which makes me considerably less happy! I'm going to write a proper post very soon, but for now I want to address a few things...
I've been feeling slightly overwhelmed by all the blogs I follow, so haven't been commenting on them as much lately... This does NOT mean that I haven't been reading your blog, because I most likely have. And I'm going to try and comment more again!
I added a post to my secondhand blog. I've been updating that blog very infrequently, but when Summer (aka garbage hunting season) rolls around, I should be posting a lot more often!
Oh, and there's also a chance my family will be going to the Great Big Happy Life unschooling conference in New Jersey. The big draw? John Taylor Gatto, a brilliant man and a legendary one in the unschooling and free-schooling world, is going to be speaking there!! That's enough to make me want to go all on it's own, plus the rest of the conference looks like fun. :-)

Like I said, I've got ideas floating around in my head, and I'm going to write a proper post soon!

Peace,
Idzie
