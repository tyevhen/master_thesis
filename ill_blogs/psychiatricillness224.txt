Work was good today, I was productive and I enjoyed it.

My boss said some really nice things to me this afternoon about how far I have come in the last 6 months compared to how I used to be. He said that hehas received a lot of good feedback about how different I am now to how I was 18months ago. He said he loves working with me and I am one of the bravest people he knows. He said he was looking forward to my performance review next week. I could not ask for more support but I still did not tell him that I was not at work yesterday because I could not get up!

I explained to him how I find a good review at least as stressful as a bad one and he promised to keep that in mind next week. I find it stressful, the better I am doing the higher the expectations on me are and the more I have to loose if it all goes wrong again.

I went to the gym on the way home, I spent 20mins on the exercise bike and then did a yoga class. I felt energised afterwards. I went to Mc D's for tea.

I am going to read Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.
