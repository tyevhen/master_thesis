I went on an Internet hiatus the last few weeks, and it was good.

I was amazed at how much more productive I was during that time without social media distracting me. I was able to get so much housework done, did a lot of cooking and baking, got completely caught up on laundry, spent a lot of extra time in God's Word, did some rearranging in our home, and spent a lot of time doing tasks outside in the gardens and with the animals. I also had time to spend reading aloud with the kids, something we haven't really done since we finished up our homeschool year back in May.

It's been good.

And although I'm back online now, I'm going to make sure that I restrict my access. That means that the laptop stays off and put away during the day until all of my tasks are completed, and even after that, I know that I need to put a time limit on myself.

I have come to realize that I was using the Internet as a way to kind of escape the everyday drudgery. I would look online for inspiration, but I would spend so much time looking that I didn't have any time to do. And then, of course, there is the comparison trap that we all fall into from time to time.

Anyway, did I mention that going offline was good?

It's been a good month.  A productive month. A focused month. A restful month. A contented month.
