Sheila (I can't for the life of me figure out how to turn a name into a link, if someone can enlighten me, that would be awesome!), who's blog is http://exploratorylife.blogspot.com/, tagged me to tell six random things about myself, so here goes!

1. I've been vegetarian for nearing ten years

2. I hate eating anything that isn't organic, or using products that have nasty chemicals, so I'm always looking for natural options to things

3. I love writing, but rarely manage to write stories more than a page long (and even the one page ones are rare!) since I tend to lose interest in stories faster than I should :-S

4. I think hats and scarves are the most amazing fashion accessories ever invented

5. My sister is my best friend in the entire world

6. Finding new music that I like makes me unbelievably happy

So, as for who to tag, that's hard. None of the friends I know IRL have blogs... And many of the blogs I read I feel I don't really know the authors well enough to tag them. So my one tag is:

Stella (http://notanordinaryteen.blogspot.com/)

Now speaking of scarves being an amazing accessory, here are some pic's I took of scarves and me! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
