In looking at my traffic it appears the majority of viewers come from Beaumont (either Texas or Washington). I just wanted to leave a quick shout out to those viewers with a thanks. From the high numbers I can't help but be more curious about who it is that is there. Is it just MSN polling my site or is it real actual readers? Any other bloggers have the same phenomenon? Who is all from there? How did you find my site? Is there anything that you are looking for that I can help you with?

Lets have this be a global shout out as well! Anyone who visits the blog leave a comment about where your from (if you are ok with leaving that info- it can be vague) how you found the site, and any questions or thoughts that you have about anxiety. I already know some of the readers but you can leave it again if you want for others to see. We'll open it up as a message board. Even if you don't suffer from anxiety I still want to get to know more about my readers.

I'll start. I am from Salt Lake City, Utah and I have social anxiety. I have had it since high school and have only diagnosed it since October of 2006. I have made lots of progress but have a long way to go still. I really enjoy helping others that are going through the same or similar things that I have gone through.

Don't be shy! (Well I guess thats a horrible thing to say especially if people have social anxiety like I do.) If you want to be shy thats fine, but I still would love to see some comments from others. :)
