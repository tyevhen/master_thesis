As you can see, Paige had a snazzy Fourth of July weekend! Here it is in pictures.


First, she dawned a fine frock for a visit with Nana and Grandpa Cassidy.


Grandpa made Paige laugh and smile so much!


We had a visit by a Momma turkey and her flock of babies...they even took a nap in the mulch out back.



On Sunday, we went to the town beach across the street and had a picnic and enjoyed the good weather.


She has a new swimsuit!


She enjoyed some lounging



And Laughing



Had a nice nap on Daddy


Posed for photos with the parents



Had a picnic lunch


And took in the sights


And made sure to entertain all with her Marlon Brando impression: "I made him an offer he couldn't refuse."

We're off to a great start to the week! Happy Monday to all!
