This is my chance to say thank you to all of you who have been with me since the first Warriors of Poseidon book, Atlantis Rising, hit bookstores in 2007. I am so honored that you've shared this journey with me.

I am excited to announce that YES, there will still be a few novellas in the Atlantis world to wrap up some important characters' story lines, most important: DENAL!! And Jack! Jack will not only get his own book, but his own SERIES!! News coming in 2013!! Also, my new series, The League of the Black Swan, will debut in May, 2013!

But for now, ALARIC!! The reviews for Heart of Atlantis are so wonderful! Night Owl Reviews gave it a Top Pick!
