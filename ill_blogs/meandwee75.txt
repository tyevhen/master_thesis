This photo is an oldie but goodie. :)

The other day Paige was curious about why I used to have a different last name (I'd changed it when I got married like many women do). I explained this all to her as best I could so her four-year old mind could follow along. After thinking about it for a minute she lit up with so much excitement and said "When I marry Daddy, my name will be 'Paige Daddy!'"

Her eyes sparkled and twinkled with the idea.

And then I about died from the cuteness.
