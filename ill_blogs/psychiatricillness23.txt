My old psychiatrist said to me that once I was in a protective relationship we could consider reducing my medication.  I do want to reduce them one day but at the same time I am quite scared.  I have had a brilliant 6 months, probably one of the best times of my life.  I don't want it to end and I don't want Mr R to be put under any pressure or stress if I become sick.  Neither can I afford to be sick from a work point of view.  I am on 3-4 months check ups with my GP at the moment, I may raise it with her next time I visit.
