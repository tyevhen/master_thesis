I wanted to tell you about our Mother's Day! Chris took all Noah's feedings during the night and day. I got to sleep in until 8:30 in the morning! Heaven! Then, the fam brought me breakfast in bed. Heaven 2.0! After some fun gift time, we went over to a local farm/hiking place and saw some animals. And then, we headed over to the local ice cream mecca and enjoyed some treats and Paige had her very first pony ride. Follow all that up with me having time to myself in the afternoon and it was a perfect day! Score! I hope all you who plan to be Moms, are pregnant, or already ARE Moms had a great Mother's Day.  I know I did!
