I wanted to make something sweet for a friend that moved to NY as a house warming. It's too bad he didn't stay in California - he would have a regular supply of them. I did half turtle and half m&m for fun. I'm thinking about shipping them in a peanut butter jar with a custom label. Don't you wish you were my friend??
