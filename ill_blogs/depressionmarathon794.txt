I'm feeling a little bit better. Yesterday I got out of the house for my usual AA meeting early in the morning. It was a little difficult being surrounded by so many chatty people at first, but I settled in after a bit. On the way home, I could feel the darkness surrounding me, so I didn't go home! I went over to Bill and Cindy's home for some pancakes and espresso (they got a new toy--yummy!). After an hour or so at their house, I had to come home. I was whipped. Napping helped. I felt better again.

After my nap, I stared at my bike. I didn't feel like going, but I had just enough energy to get out the door. Thank God, because in less than 20 minutes I wanted to go home. I didn't. I soldiered on. I got a little lost and briefly ended up on a gravel road. That was exciting. No worries, I found my way back on course. It was warm and windy, and I was wishing I was done, but I kept going. After 97 minutes, 29 miles, and one hill too many, I made it home. I needed another nap.

I had to rest again. That ride really wiped me out. But I'm so glad I went. I actually have a relay triathlon with two of my brothers next weekend. I'll be doing the bike stage, and I've been feeling really guilty about not practicing. I'm definitely not in shape. Fortunately, the bike route is only 21 miles so I think I'll be able to handle it. Hopefully, I'll have the motivation to ride again before the race. At least I went today, right?

I'm encouraged I was able to get out. I'm encouraged I was able to last for 97 minutes. It wasn't the fastest ride, but I gave myself permission to go as slow as I needed to go in order to continue. I'm definitely still being racked by the fatigue of this current dip, but maybe things are improving? I don't know. I try not to think or worry about it. It will pass when it passes. Until then, I'll keep taking one day at a time and one step (or pedal stroke) at a time.
