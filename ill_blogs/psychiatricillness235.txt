I am going Salsa Dancing tonight, I need to leave in just over an hour. I am trying not to think about it too much - if I winde myself up I don't think I will end up going. I just want to meet people and find people to go out with. I also find dancing quite sexy and if I meet someone nice tht would be cool!

WISH ME LUCK!!!!
