Dear Little N.,

You're 13 months old! WootWoot!!!!
The biggest news is that you are getting more brave and can stand without holding anything for a couple seconds. You've even taken a few shuffle-steps on your own (3-5 steps at a time!). Paige learned to walk around 13.5 months and you seem to be on the same time track.
You also had your first haircut this week and you were a champ. Sat so nicely with Daddy and looked like a big boy. (sniffle).
It has been a hard month too because you've been battling double ear infections, a bad cold/cough, and just overall fussiness. You've taken to going to bed fitfully and crying a lot which always ends up with you throwing up everywhere (EVERY NIGHT!) I don't understand what happened and why you feel so lowsy!? Poor thing.
In the meantime, you are still incredibly sweet and adorable...loving and fun. We are figuring out how to make our routine together fun and rewarding for both of us. So many changes!
I wish I could keep you a little baby forever, but you are bursting with such promise and pride with what's to come. I'm so excited for you.
It's wonderful being with you in this time of your life; how lucky am I? What a blessing to kiss those adorable cheeks every day. I could swim in those eyes for eternity.
I love you always and forever,
Mama
