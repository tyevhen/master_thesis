I wrote a new poem last night which I'd love you to check out (and some of my other poetry that's on that blog to if you want!) at www.art-is-expressions.blogspot.com. Thanks! :-)

In other quite surprising news my sister is (*gasp*) actually cooking!! It may just be packaged pudding mix and all that her cooking of said mix involves is stirring, and she does have help (from her bunny rabbit Kumagoro pictured below) but still... Emy's previous cooking adventures have often ended in charred food at the very least (once she set something on fire in the toaster oven... I've yet to let her forget about it! :-P), but this time things seem to be going well! As my mother says, we'll make a cook of her yet! Love ya Em :-)

Peace,
Idzie
