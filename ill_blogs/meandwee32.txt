Hi friends!

LOL, aren't those photos funny? My baby belly can't stay away from anything I'm doing. I was going to edit it out but I just didn't have the heart! Ha!
I'm participating in a local artisan fair next Saturday, Oct. 25th! I'm so excited to be able to sell my original paintings and greeting cards in person and meet new people! This is a chance to get some of my original work before it is gone! This is a small intimate event, perfect for finding a one-of-a-kind gift for a loved one, or find a unique goodie for yourself! If you want to come meet me and grab some affordable art for your home or as gifts, here are the details:

What:  Pepperell Fall Artisan Fair
When:  Saturday October 25
Time:  10AM-5PM rain or shine

10 vendors will be selling their wares inside both a Victorian home and a barn.
