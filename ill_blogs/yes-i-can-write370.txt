I've had a Flickr account for a while now, but I've never really used it... So now I finally decided to make some use of it, and upload some of my pictures that I consider to be decent. You can check out my photostream here. Some of the photo's there have also been posted on my 365 photo blog and some have not. If you decide to check them out, thanks a bunch, and comments and constructive criticism are much appreciated! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
