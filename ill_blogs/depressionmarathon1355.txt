a long day.

actually thought of posting a picture today of my now 10-day-old clean clothes hanging on the drying racks in my living room. it's become a bit comical. but, my dishes are clean again today.

spent almost all day--during our mega-degree below zero, blizzard conditions--online learning. i would really like this site to be helpful to people. i would like to connect with others who are suffering, struggling, or battling with this illness. i'd like to educate the families, friends, and even professionals we surround ourselves with...or, more accurately, who surround us even when we could care less! i'd like to have a forum where people felt like someone was speaking their language, and at the same time not celebrating helplessness, victimization or negativity.

unfortunately, i spent 8 hours researching how to find "my market," and so far, the results are pretty disappointing. there may not be a market. my disappointment culminated when what appeared to be an organized, reputable, fairly popular depression forum hadn't had a post since 12-31-2007. the chat room was only slightly more active.
and that is the problem with this illness. we have depression!! we have an illness that makes it difficult to trust, share, connect, expend energy, risk, or even feel sometimes! so i found that there is space for what i want to provide, the trouble is, there appears to be few virtual souls to fill that space.

i actually think the souls and the need are there, but connecting people with mental illness is a dilemma. the bigger dilemma, based on my experience with depression, is how to keep people engaged once they're connected. maintaining breathy engagement is contradictory to depression's suffocating immobility. what to do? what to do?

i will keep brainstorming, researching and learning. i want to provide an informative service. if you are reading this, please help me out. any comments, suggestions, thoughts or ideas will be greatly appreciated. thanks.
