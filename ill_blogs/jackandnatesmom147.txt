Here is some information about the site:


Established in February of 2011, the Sensory Processing Disorder Blogger Network is a community of special needs parents committed to supporting each other’s journey by writing about their sensational lives and sharing them here.
It’s nothing huge, but it’s a step, so I’m really excited about it.  Thanks as always for all of your support!
