Ok so the attempt to update frequently didn't go so well. Things kind of changed drastically in my work life. I left my old job (which was giving me frequent and bad cases of anxiety) and a week later I started a new contract that lasted until two weeks ago. It was overall good and a great learning experience, but I did have a few cases of anxiety again. If you're wondering what I do for a living, my last two jobs have been in the film industry. The industry is known for being tough- you work long hours, you don't really have a social life, and it's very fast pace. With that being said I did wonder to myself.. Can people with a mental health illness work in that environment? I toss back and forth between yes and no. But more on that another day.

So for the past week I've been simply relaxing. I'm spending these next few weeks cleaning, seeing old friends, running weekday errands, walking the dogs, seeing my niece, and... preparing for mine and B's move in December. That's right.. .this yuppie is moving to Langley! More on that another day as well.

My goal for this blog is to update every Sunday. Write about something even though I feel like I have nothing to write about.

Till next Sunday.
