Okay, Mother Nature! I totally give up! Uncle! Uncle! What can we do to make it stop? This morning's workout called for seven half mile repeats on a beautiful, spongy, oval track. Afterward, I planned to linger on the luxuriously green infield grass stretching my tired muscles slowly while soaking in the sun. That was the plan. And it was a wonderfully appealing plan! And then I woke up.
  This is a photo of Jet taken one week ago in my backyard. He was making me laugh, as usual. He discovered this large piece of lumbar under the fence and proceeded, with all his might, to drag it all over the yard.  
He dragged it, attacked it, tossed it, hurdled it, chewed it, barked at it, and generally romped around with it for the better part of an hour. He was in heaven! But then again, he's pretty easy. He finds tiny sticks, flying leaves, unearthed rocks, and even pieces of wayward trash to be heavenly toys as well.
  The picture above is my little boy racing through our backyard this morning! Now you understand my first paragraph! Unlike his mom, Jet thinks this is just fabulous! He couldn't wait to get outside! He's been out for almost three hours now, and he's barely stopped moving. If he could speak, I'm sure I would hear him screaming, "Wheeeeeeee!"  
  I wish I could share your enthusiasm, Buddy. But instead of a nice soft track on which to run fast and luxurious green grass on which to stretch, I now face stationary breathlessness on a revolving rubberized belt breathing stale, sweaty, shared air. My favorite.
  And as you can see in the last photo, the snow is showing no signs of letting up. So what's the deal, Mother Nature? It appears you are currently catering to the canines. That's nice. My little canine certainly entertains me. But will it be our turn soon? I can't wait for my opportunity to squeal, "Wheeeeeeee," too!
