Just a short post today, as I am just getting ready to leave for Duluth and Grandma's Marathon. The car is packed. I brought way too much stuff. Puck is on his way to Bill and Cindy's house, otherwise known as "The Doggy Spa." He gets spoiled rotten there. I'm anxious to get the show on the road.

I have no idea what Saturday will bring for me. My training has been slow and tough lately. I feel heavy and sluggish. It's not exactly an ideal way to feel approaching a marathon. I was hoping to shoot for a fast time, but I've scaled back my goals now. My new goal is "we'll see what happens." I'll probably start the race at the slightly faster pace of which I originally planned. However, I now lack the confidence that I'll be able to hold that pace over the later miles. That's the beauty of the marathon, though. You just never know how it's going to turn out. Success depends on so many different variables when tackling 26.2 miles. It's always unpredictable, but usually interesting. We'll see what happens.

And now I'm off to begin the journey. I'll let you know how it turns out.
