As we all know, no matter how we feel, life moves on. One of the events I am moving toward is The Boston Marathon. It is now only 11 weeks away, and I am as far out of running shape as I've been in the past 3-5 years. I managed a couple of 3-milers on the hospital treadmill while inpatient, and I've not done much more than that since coming home. On top of being plain out of shape, my right leg is still quite weak as a result of my knee surgery last October. Running, right now, is really difficult and no fun.

I've actually been contemplating skipping Boston, as 11 weeks is not really enough time to go from zero to the marathon, but I'd rather not skip it. It's important for me to go. It's important for me to get back in shape. It's important because going and getting back in shape are both ways for me to fight back--to battle against this ever-present depression--and to reclaim at least one positive aspect of my life.

I'm talking tough, but it's all talk. I really don't feel confident that I'll be able to battle back in time for Boston, but I've got to try. Today's effort consisted of a 4-mile long run. A 4-mile long run is a bit silly, but that's where I'm at. I was near tears by mile three. I'm not accustomed to running being so difficult, and I had to work hard to battle discouragement. Four miles was better than nothing.

My mood continues to be problematic. I am low, low, low. It's frustrating and scary. My mother is leaving tomorrow. It's been nice to have her here, and I'm a little worried about being alone again. I'm going to continue working an abbreviated schedule this week. The decision regarding disability, I figure, will eventually become clear. Life moves on. I've got to continue to move with it. I appreciate all of your comments, suggestions, and support as I battle through this difficult time. Thank you.
