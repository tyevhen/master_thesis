Lately, I found myself experimenting with outfits a lot more. My style is constantly evolving-and this time is heading towards a more minimalistic and casual approach, with the exception of a few accent pieces (such as a patterned trouser or shirt) 
After discovering and becoming stupidly obsessed with WEWOREWHAT, I am just itching to update my wardrobe. 

That being said, here's my autumn wishlist. The pieces range from chunky knits and oversized coats, to ripped jeans and tartan mini's, with each item complying with this seasons key trends.
