The scooter crashed to the ground once he abandoned it. Just moments before he was racing down the path, his push foot flying forward and back. He couldn't have been more than eight. I slowed my car to see what had so urgently caught his eye. I assumed he was running toward something quite intriguing. I was surprised when he stopped at a simple sign beside the path. No Motorized Vehicles Allowed on Path--that was his aim. I watched with amusement as he jumped, and jumped, and jumped, each time tapping the top of the sign, just because he could. Apparently pleased with his success, he returned to his scooter and resumed racing down the path.

I smiled as he retreated from view. What a simple lesson, I thought. Stop, notice the small stuff, and create success. Whether it's tapping the top of a sign or getting out of bed today, anything can be defined as success. Does life have to be more complicated than that?
