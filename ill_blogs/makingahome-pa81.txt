Anybody even read me anymore???? I haven't updated in a month, I know! Sergei has been here. Leaves on Thursday. It's been very challenging but wonderful all the same.



Not ready to really post much about the experience yet. Too emotional. Would require too much energy to describe the emotions and experience in words. I'm not ready for that.


But do know that I'm here, alive, and hoping to get back to blogging some day soon.

Good bless!
