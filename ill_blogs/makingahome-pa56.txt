We love to watch the birds that come to the feeder we have mounted to the railing of our front porch. It has been so fun to watch all the different kinds of birds that come as well as how they interact with one another.


It's been even more beneficial having the feeder there lately because we're using Jeannie Fulbright's Exploring Creation with Zoology 1: Flying Creatures of the 5th Day (Apologia Science Young Explorers)right now in school and we're studying birds. So we can sit on our couch and read about birds all the while being able to glance out the front window and observe "our" birds. It's been fantastic.


At our homschooling co-op several weeks ago, one of the other moms had mentioned making Crisco-coated bagels for the birds. I was excited to hear about this idea because most of the recipes call for peanut butter which is a no-no in our home due to Lil's allergy.

So the kids and I made them recently. All that is needed are bagels, Crisco and bird seeds.


Slather the Crisco on the entire surface of the bagel and then roll/sprinkle with the bird seed. Then you can tie yarn through the middle hole (which, by this time, you will have to dig out a hole since it will be totally filled Crisco) and hang it from the branches of a tree.


We actually just put the yummy treats in our bird feeder, and the birds pecked away at the bagels. They were a big treat for the birds and the bagels were completely gone within three days.


This is a fun, easy, and cheap science project to do with your children. My kids really enjoyed it and they enjoyed watching the birds devour their treats!

Add one or two of the following resources, and you'll have yourself a fun, interesting bird unit study just in time for spring!
