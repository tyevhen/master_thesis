The alarm clock blared. The NPR station, which at 4:45 AM broadcasts BBC news from across the globe, shattered the darkness. The reluctant runner rolled over and covered her head. The dog sighed.

Thirty minutes later, she stirred. The BBC was loudly covering a concert in Australia. The dog lifted his head. With great effort her feet hit the floor. The dog didn't yet believe. He remained coiled comfortably on his bed.

Under his watchful eye, she dressed. It was the tights that brought him to his feet. She wondered how he could instantaneously go from slumber to anticipation. Actually, she was envious. If only she could greet the cold darkness and impending exertion with such form.

Bouncing around the kitchen, he couldn't wait for the gloves and the hat. The runner was moving entirely too slow. She checked the weather on the computer. It was 28 degrees. Oh, that's warm; it shouldn't be too bad, she thought. His eyes screamed, "Huuurrrrry uuuuuupp!!"

A quick bite of banana was almost too much for him to bear. The runner dodged his hips and hops. His tail he could not stop. He didn't want to let her out of his site. Occasionally, she tries to leave without him. The runner smiled at his jovial persistence. Finally, the collar encircled his neck.

If possible, he would have cheered, but she bristled as they stepped into the darkness. It was colder and darker than she thought. He didn't notice. To the end of the driveway was as far as they got. "I'm sorry, Buddy," she said, "I just can't."

He looked confused, as she removed the leash. Enthusiasm drained from his eyes. She felt guilty. His hopping and his tail, they both stopped. "I'm sorry. We'll go later," she said. "I promise." The dog sighed. She wondered if she was telling a lie. Perhaps he wondered, too. Resigned, the dog curled tightly on his bed.

The End.

Addendum: The reluctant runner kept her promise. The dog smiled for 13 miles.
