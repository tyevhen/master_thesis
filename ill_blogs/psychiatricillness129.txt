I was wondering again the other day whether all these labels put on me and the medication switching was real or not. I have never really though about when I have had clear bouts of hypomania. They usually pass so smoothly aqnd efficiently I only recognise I have been high after the event.

I thought of this example the week before I moved, the more I think about it the more I believe it is not something most people do....

It was a sunday and I had to do some work to do, it was also the weekend before I moved so I had to get a certain amount of to be packing done. To start off with I dithered a lot and flicked between one task and then the other, but then I had an idea and set the kitchen timmer. I did 45 minutes of packing followed by 45 minutes of work. I was so efficient throughout the day I managed to get everything done. My mind just managed to switch on command, everything was so clear and under control.

It was like the usuall anxiety and lack of confidence and fear of failing, then super efficiency kicked in and everything worked like clock work. It was great.....
