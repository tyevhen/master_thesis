I had my right Achilles tendon surgery yesterday. I'm back in my boot, non-weight bearing for the next few days, and then partial weight bearing with my crutches for rest of the week. I'm hoping to return to work next week, still in my boot, but without the crutches. I'll be in the boot for 2-4 weeks. Of course, I'm hoping for two rather than four.

The surgery itself was quite simple. I was a little anxious, but after they numbed up my ankle I didn't feel a thing. I'm feeling very fortunate, as I've had no pain since the procedure. I have nothing to complain about.

Today, if I can get through the pending blizzard descending upon us, I have my orthodontist appointment to get my bottom braces. And Thursday the real pain will begin, as I will have oral surgery to remove my ankylosed right canine tooth. It's a jam-packed week, but I'm hopeful it is the start of better health times to come.
