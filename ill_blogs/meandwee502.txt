Hello all! In exciting news, we had our follow-up ultrasound yesterday and Little P's heart and organs looked healthy and on track! The perinatologist said there was no cause for concern and everything looked as it should. She said that the only thing wrong was the umbilical cord issue and that's it. Phew! I felt a HUGE relief spill over me! They did a full anatomy scan again and Little P looks so much bigger than last time. Her features are really starting to round out and boy, does she move! She rocked and rolled the whole time! This makes sense because I feel her move a lot of the time now. Chris is also excited now that some of the movements can be felt on the outside...we were stuck in a snowstorm in traffic (parked on the highway for over 4 hours at one point) and the kicking was strong enough for him to feel. We sat in the car marveling over each little poke and it definitely kept us entertained during the wait. What a joy to see the look on Chris' face as he felt each little bump at his hand...it's the kind of thing I've been so excited to experience. I'll leave it at that. No 21 week photo of me this week...I look the same as the last photo so I will leave you with the latest photo of our little lady. I'm headed off soon to celebrate Christmas with my family; Happy Holidays to all and I'll be back soon with updates! Much love to you all and best wishes for you in this New Year!
