I am wiped out! Two hours of hard work outs yesterday combined with a twelve hour work and workout day today have left me tapped out. My get-up-and-go has gotten up and went! For that reason, I have little energy left to type these lines. I apologize, and I promise to give you something worthwhile to read tomorrow.
