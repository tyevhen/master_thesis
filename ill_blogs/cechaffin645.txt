To me!

Keep those cards and letters coming.

If it's not about me I don't want to hear it.

(The problem with this world is that there's too much "me" to go around.)

At 51 I'm almost playing with a full deck!

I spent my birthday, yesterday, in bed with intestinal problems, took the cure for amoebas and salmonella, couldn't drink much because of it.

Still off cigs!

I watched a lot of TV yesterday because I wasn't feeling well, but God was good. I got to see three Law and Order episodes, one which I hadn't seen before, two that I had perhaps seen only once. And I fell asleep during The Fugitive. That's good viewing on Mexican basic cable.

My faithful Kathleen spent the day with me.

No epiphanies save slight nausea and a fullness in my abdomen and that I hate Mexico. But you knew that.

Just de-wormed myself a few weeks ago, hope I don't need that again.

I have to take more medicines for parasites than a dog.

Thanks, daughters and friends, for the nice e-cards. I especially like Rachel's, wherein she correctly identified me as the black sheep of the family.

If your life is so boring you stopped to read this, well, what can I say?

"Keep coming back!" as in AA.
