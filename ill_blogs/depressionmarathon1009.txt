She had nearly completed the note by the time the officer pounded on the door. Only a few words were left unsaid when her daughter later discovered it. Standing in her mother's silent home, the eerie mid-sentence stop terrified her. She had no idea.

Earlier that morning, her mom, a mutual acquaintance, sent my co-worker a text message saying she was done. She "couldn't do this any more." Calls to her home were met with hysterical sobbing, ominous predictions, and finally hang-ups. I dialed 911. We had no idea.

She is safe now on a 72-hour-hold. We are shocked, dismayed, worried. Wanting to help but meeting the family resistance of shame, we are told to stay away. Stigma rears it's ugly head.

It is a lesson, a reminder. We may never know an other's secret anguish, as mental pain is often hidden by shame. We must never take words for granted. What if we hadn't called the police? Like chest pain and shortness of breath, words can also predict imminent death. It's a lesson not to forget.
