So, I thought that I would try something new.  My life as it has been and as it continues to unfold is a story.  One story made up of many stories.  One complex, yet simple story.  One sometimes messy, but so beautiful story.  One story that I wonder if it might be interesting to be told.

This blog is going to be my attempt to put part, or parts, of that story into words, or pictures, or whatever form my mind can wrap itself around or create from within myself to express what it is like to be the one inside Cindy's Story.  I don't know much about how this will work, so it will be an exploration on my part and on yours in reading, and seeing, and maybe even hearing.  It will not be chronological.  It might not always make sense.  But, it will be my expression.  It will be me.

If you are reading this, it is because you are important and you have made your way into my story, or you saw when it began.  You are invited to continue on with me as I see what unfolds........
