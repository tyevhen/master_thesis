For a year, I rode my bicycle to and from work every day.  I was always very careful to wear my helmet, use lights at night, wear bright clothing, ride on roads with bike lanes, and watch out for crazy and un-alert drivers.  I was as safe as I could be.

I worked at a clinic in a hospital.  I left work around 6:00pm one Tuesday night and was riding my bike along road.  I had only gone one block when suddenly, a guy in a parked car opened his car door directly into my shoulder.  I was knocked off my bike into the middle of the road.  Luckily no cars were coming, but I had blood running down my leg and a huge bruising knot on my shoulder.

The guy in the car was very shocked and apologizing.   I ended up just walking home with my bike, happy that my bike or I had at least left a mark on his car door.

The awfulsome thing is that the next day when I was walking in to the hospital to go to work, I saw a flyer on the door giving directions to the room for the "Driver Safety Class" on Tuesday nights at 6pm!  I don't think the guy that hit me had learned very much in his class yet!
