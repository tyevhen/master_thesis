Sigh. Here are my tempting supplies calling to me. But my sick kiddos call more loudly. Noah's got a double ear infection with a horrible cold/cough and Paige is still sick from a bronchial issue. We're all working on healing but it's been since just after Christmas! So, I'm over it. But, I've accepted that my most blessed important job is to soothe and comfort my loveys and give them the best I can. My work plans will have to wait! But aren't those colors just so fun? I've got big plans for them. In other news, I'll be back soon with my first Deliberate Motherhood post for February...the theme is the Power of Love.
