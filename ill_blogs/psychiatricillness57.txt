Working on some learnings from my time in hospital a few years ago, how you feel physically and mentally are very closely linked.  I have booked a deep tissue massage for lunch time in the hope it will induce a relaxing and productive weekend.  I am extremely tense and my shoulders are hunched up.  I'm looking forward to an hour of bliss!

I am working from home on easy stress free stuff this morning :o) but I feel awful about the stress I am causing others by not doing the most urgent stuff :'o(.  Still at least I am working!
