I'm a little overwhelmed. And busy... I picked up my new puppy, 4 month old black lab mix, Jet, on Saturday. He is incredibly cute, and he is all puppy! He's not totally house-trained yet, plus he has a bladder infection, which makes training a little more difficult. When he drinks water, he literally has to go out approximately every 10 minutes, or less, for about an hour afterward. And his need to go out is immediate! He's only had two accidents so far, and both times were when I let him out of my site for just a few seconds! My fault. Considering the infection, and the limited supervision he had in his foster home, he's actually doing quite well.


Jet is extremely playful, which is quite fun, but exhausting. Fortunately, he is kennel-trained, and he can stay alone in his kennel for at least 8 hours without difficulty. He also sleeps in his kennel, through the night, as long as I pick up his water a few hours before bedtime. And he travels silently in the car in his kennel, also very nice! We just finished over an hour of playing, and he's apparently finally tired out, which is why I have this moment to write.


Unfortunately, he has had little to no socialization up to this point. He's fine with a single dog, such as Bill and Cindy's golden retriever, after a bit of warming up, but he viciously growls and barks at every dog at first. He's kind of scary. He also barks just as viciously at strangers at first. He's timid. I think that's where the aggression comes from. It worries me. I took him to work at the nursing home on Monday in order to expose him to many people and even another dog. It worked out okay. I think I'll take him again tomorrow. I absolutely do not want an aggressive, or even aggressive sounding, dog!


We're working on sits and downs. We're working on staying off the furniture. We're playing fetch. As I said, it's fun, it's a little overwhelming, and I'm very busy. I'll keep you updated on the saga!
