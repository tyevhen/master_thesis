The noise is a bit less today. While the thoughts aren't totally gone, I do have less runaway thinking. Unfortunately, my mood seems to have lowered in concert with the noise.

My mood is lower despite yoga this morning and a speed workout this afternoon. That's a bad sign. Exercise is often protective for me. That is, a good workout helps my mood. Not today. This is another reminder I have an illness.

Depression. Depression is an illness not unlike other chronic illnesses. It has its own ups and downs. Sometimes I can influence the symptoms. Sometimes I can't. Apparently today I couldn't.

I'm frustrated the exercise didn't protect me today, but I'm grateful I was able to accomplish my goals. Hopefully sleep will cure what ails me, and tomorrow will be a new day.
