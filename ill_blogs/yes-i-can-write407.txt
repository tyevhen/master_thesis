I've wanted to try vlogging for a while... It seems like a cool idea, and something that would be fun to do! So today, I posted my first video. :-) It kinda sucks, especially since I don't have video editing software that accepts the format my camera records in, but hey, it's my first one!



Oh, and I got a new haircut!

Comments (or suggestions), as always, are appreciated! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
