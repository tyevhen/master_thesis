I can't get one of them
out.
OUT of my head.

Bouncing, banging, bashing between my ears
it is.
Loud
Hard
Sharp

Stabbing like a knife.
Screeching
as nails on a chalkboard.
Rubber
screaming on pavement
tires locking before the hit.

It is not a disease
Loud-
It is not a disease.
Hard-
A state of mind,
Sharp-
nothing more.

"Depression is not a disease,
it is a state of mind
and nothing more."
Slam!
"Get over it."
Slam!
SLAM!

a state of mind
a state of mind...
Get
Over
It.

Loud. Hard. Sharp.
SLAM!

ouch.
