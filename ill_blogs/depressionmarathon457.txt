It's been really chilly and gray here. I think it's getting to me. I saw my psychiatrist this morning and told her I was doing okay, which is true, but that's it. I'm not good. I'm not bad. I'm just okay. My mood seems to be in a holding pattern, a slightly lower than normal holding pattern. I guess I match the recent weather. I'm gray.

Gray is actually quite tiring. I'm so tired! I'm lacking motivation and spunk. I feel like I'm walking through molasses in a fog. I don't like that feeling. It's a feeling I usually associate with being quite low, so of course it makes me nervous. I'm hoping it passes before the other shoe drops.

Today was a particularly slow, tired day. I had things to do, but I couldn't get off the sofa most of the day. When I finally did get up, I took Jet for a walk, and then feeling like I was on a roll, I decided to run. Maybe that wasn't the best decision, because right now I can barely move!

My run was horrible. My legs were dead weight. My pace was slow. My lungs couldn't seem to take in enough air. I even had to walk in the middle of a 3-mile loop! The combination of low motivation and poor physical response was too much to overcome. I was frustrated, and I couldn't wait to be done.

Now I'm sitting here in sweats, barely maintaining my upright position, ready to hit the sofa once again. I guess it's just one of those days. It's one of those days I periodically experience, as I live with this illness of depression. Tomorrow will hopefully bring some energy and relief. Until then, my friends.
