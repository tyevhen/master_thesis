The Art of Suicide Notes & Origami
By: Samantha Lou Walker

This story starts with me
But you can still see
The scars on my skin
Tell the story for me
It wasn't long ago
That I lost myself
Like a curious child
In a busy store
But I was deaf
To anyone paging for me
I was a lost wallet with no ID
Even if I was found I had nowhere to be returned to
I'm not sure I even wanted
To be found I was a broken thing
I feared if anyone saw
The condition I was really in
That I would be left out
With the trash on the curb
I felt like a price of candy
Found on the floor
The parent scolding
"Drop that, it’s dirty"
I felt lost and unwanted
When you feel so discarded
It’s easy to lose hope
Easier still to quit looking for it
Like a ring swallowed
By the sands of a beach
Why bother even trying
You know you'll never find it
Why not just quit life
Like you quit your crappy college job
Why not just give up
Sign your resignation in blood
I was hurting
Lost
Only think of myself
I wasn't thinking
As I carved up my arm
I was really carving out the hearts
Of those who love me
As I recklessly planned my end
I didn't think about the consequences
It would have
For the people in my life
I never imagined
My baby brother would find me
I never meant to lay this burden
On his young shoulders
I selfishly wrote a suicide note
That he found I didn't think it was possible
To hurt any worse than I did
I had no idea
That 6th under rock bottom
Was the look in a 13 year olds eyes
As he realized why I held a knife to my arm
I didn't know that depth of pain even existed
It was a moment of clarity
Do sharp it pierced my very soul
In a way no Sunday sermon
Or self-help book could
In the months and years
Nothing else could reach me
The calm, clear words of a child
"It is okay, Sammy,
No matter what is going on
In your life that made you feel
Like you had to do this,
Gods got it."
It's been a year
Since that fateful night
I went back a read the note
Baffled at how I ever felt so
Worthless
And I took that suicide note
Folded it in to
An origami crane
Something I wouldn't be here
To do, without
My little guardian angel
By the Grace of God
I was able to take that note
From the darkest time in my life
And turn it in to a symbol of
Hope & healing.
