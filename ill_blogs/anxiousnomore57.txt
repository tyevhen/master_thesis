I just wanted to announce that I have posted some fun necklaces or pendants for sale at the new Reality of Anxiety Shop! You can see the widget on the top left side of the blog, or you can get there by clicking here. I only posted 4 items so far so I can get an idea of how much interest there is before I go all crazy and bust a ton more out. Although I do have some that are already made that I haven't posted that say "Bring It On" "I Can" and "Calm".


I don't want to just have necklaces, so I can do any of them as pendants as well that you can use for a keychain, a phone accessory, etc.

Also, I have been toying with the idea of creating customized journals as well. Journaling was the first thing I did to try to cope with the anxiety. I carried that thing around with me everywhere and flipped through the pages for references all the time. I listed my affirmations and important things I wanted to remember when not by my computer or not at home with all of my books. I am a crazy scrapbooker and so I may put some of it to use in the future.


As I've mentioned before, everything can be customized to say whatever you would like including names, phrases, and dates. Just let me know!
