With all the political drama going on around us, it makes me stop and wonder. Do we need to put the burden of change only on our politicians?
I am asking myself: Am I doing enough to help others? Can I contribute to good things in my own community? How can my family and children help make a difference? What am I passionate about? What really matters?

Shouldn't we all ask ourselves these questions and try to answer them? We need to be responsible in our own lives and in our own communities. It's on all of us to show up.

That being said, I'm remembering the simple things in life and what matters most to me. More to come!
