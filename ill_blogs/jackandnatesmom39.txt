See, I told you you were going to be hearing a lot about this event!!!  THIS Saturday is the Mariner Music Fest at Metropolitan Kitchen and Lounge in Annapolis- it goes from 12pm to midnight- there are events such as arts and crafts, live music and an instrument petting zoo for kids from 12-4pm and live music for adults starts on the second floor at 3pm.  There really is something for everyone and in case I need to remind you (again)- all proceeds benefit the Avergan Foundation- which provides scholarships for kids on the spectrum to attend Cisco Center.  Hope to see you there!
