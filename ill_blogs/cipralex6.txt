Hello my friends, I hope all is well with you, I was very busy with the wedding and everything so I haven’t had a spare time to update you with anything…sorry… The wedding ceremony is behind us now… wow, I cant believe I’m done with that…went very good actually, all the focus was on me and my girl… you can imagine… but it went ok, and I’ve dealt with it…



so I’m amazed once again… and I’m starting to forget why I’m taking the pills anyways… We’re flying to Spain next week for a quick honey moon… and maybe afterwards to Thailand… Now I have a lot of comments to read… I’m still on 10 mg… but thinking about going down to 5…

Take care now
