I visited my sister last night, her and her husband made me dinner and I walked her three dogs in the forest. I have been working too hard this week so I left everything at work last night.

Tonight I went to see a work friend who is on maternity leave, her baby is four months old already. She is very sweet. My best friend's baby is due on Monday. I am really excited but it is her first baby so she is a little nervous about the birth. She is also planning on moving house in the next few weeks.

Work is very busy, I am really busy at work at the moment :o(. I am enjoying it though and I am enjoying new challenges.

I am talking to my Mum on the phone, she does not know about my blogg! I am going for a bath now - I'll post again soon.
