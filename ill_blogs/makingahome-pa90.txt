I just told my kids that I'm changing my name. It's no longer "mom". Ian asked me what my new name was, and I told him I wasn't telling anyone. That way I wouldn't have to hear my name being called in utter desperation every two minutes.

Anyone else relate?


(All the above typed with a thankful smile :o) on my face.)
