This week, both my therapist and my psychiatrist encouraged me to get back to it. You see, my mood has been slipping since the last few days in Colorado, and I've taken to my bed for many, many hours since I've been home. Feeling poorly has led to laziness, lethargy, and eating poorly. Laziness, lethargy and eating poorly have led to feeling worse. It's been a vicious cycle, and I needed to get out of it.

So get back at it, they said. Get on the bike. Go for a run. Take a swim. Oh, if only it were that easy... But of course they were right. I knew that. It's just been so hard to escape the rut. Until today. Today I got back on my bike.

It's the first time I've been on my bike since the triathlon, June 20th. I had a staff inservice at work, so I got on the bike and rode a 15 mile, hilly route to get there. After sitting in the meeting for a couple hours, I rode the same hilly route back home. In total, I traveled over 31 miles in just under two hours. It was hard, but I'm so glad I was able to motivate myself to go.

I'm worried about my mood. I'm worried about my lack of motivation, lethargy, tearfulness, and inability to take proper care of myself. I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like setting any new goals. I feel like sitting on my ass, eating chocolate, getting fat, and sleeping. That is not a good sign. Plus, if I do what I feel like doing, I'll end up in a desperate state.

So I'm really glad I got on my bike today. I don't want to end up in a desperate state. I know this is a time I need to fight. But how does one fight when fighting is the last thing I feel like doing?
