We gave Paige a 2-wheeler bike for her fifth birthday (among some other smaller gifts). It has a unicorn pouch (!!!)  at the front and is covered in unicorn designs...it is also a combination of her favorite colors so she's pretty thrilled. There are training wheels on it to help her get used to riding and she took to it like a duck to water! Overall I'd say the bike is an epic win!
