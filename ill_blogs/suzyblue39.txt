Today marked the first day back at uni after a 5 month break and as much as I loved having the time off, I was itching to get back and see all of my favourite girls! 

Since it was the first day, I decided to make an effort and dress up a bit! I settled with grey Topshop overalls, a sheer v-neck blouse, my FAVE Zara flats and thee cutest pink Longchamp backpack - deffo going to be my staple item for uni!!

Hope everyone has had a great day! Let me know what your staple item for uni//school is this term!
