I very recently discovered for myself a band called Chumbawamba.  I thought I'd share one of the songs from their newest album, The Boy Bands Have Won.  I present to you the lovely song Words Can Save Us.



I find it quite annoying how much talk and arguments there are to do with music.  What's "good" music, what's "bad" music, who's "sold out", who's *really* political and who's just doing it for the attention...  I love listening to music with a strong political message, especially if that political message is anti-civ or at the very least anarchist.  However, I listen to music that I like listening to.  I'm far more concerned with how a song makes me feel than if the band has sold out or not!  So that's my mini rant on that.  And just so you know, the members of Chumbawamba are anarchists... ;-)

Peace,
Idzie
