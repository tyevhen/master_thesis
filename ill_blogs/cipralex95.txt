also took a 10mg for the 2nd day now... but havent been a week or two from i started taking it... mean while i do see mild improvement... and if thats only after few days i wonder what will happen after two weeks or a month which is the minimum time for it to start kicking in...so , so far the side effects are manageable and much less than what i tought they will be like...after noon now, my teeth clintching again...at chilled again... later on we went to meet with eya and i once again had an anxiety before the meeting dunno why, not too serious this time... also i can say that im still freezing but just that i less give a ...about it...
