It's early morning, and I am getting ready for work. I work 6 hours today prior to taking off for D's lake home in Wisconsin. I can't wait to get going. Although packing is not my favorite thing to do, and doing so kept me up late last night, tired, I am nonetheless ready to go. My vehicle is stuffed with dog kennel, dog food, dog beds, dog towels, dog treats, dog toys, dog tie-out, and even a doggy life vest. I've got a medium-sized SUV, and there's barely a spot left for my suitcase! I'll try to post while away. Unless I totally collapse in the sunshine, I may even share some pictures. Although I won't object if I do collapse under the sun. Until we meet again, have a great day, friends!
