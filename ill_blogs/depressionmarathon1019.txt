I finished second.
No, I'm not talking about running this time.
My piece, Winter Waterfall, won second place in the juried art show at the local art center.
This was quite a surprise, as there was some beautiful, emotional, and intriguing art work in the show.
And the awards were voted upon by art center staff--i.e. people who should know what they're doing!
I'm shocked.
And honored.
