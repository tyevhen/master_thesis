Hello all

Happy new year.

I apologize for my time away, also for restricting my blog temporarily.

You see I have had very little to say in the last little while that was not a mere repetition of what I have previously already said.

There are just so many ways you can say the same thing without just becoming dull as, well what exactly is that dull?

I am going back to work soon and my return is already not going very smoothly.  Also, the new year has not started very well either as my son's laptop has broken.

I am due back at work on the 7th of January.  It scares me.  I am not sure I am quite ready but I have to face the music eventually.  I am to go back part time, which will pay about the same as when I was on Employment Insurance.  I hope to qualify for my insurance to pay the balance but I have yet to know if that will be the case.  There are no guaranties you see.

Some limitations and accommodations are suggested for my return as I should not yet deal with difficult clients as I have yet to start my therapies.  These things take time.  If they cannot accommodate me then I may not be able to return as quickly, so the insurance will become paramount.

I am still not sleeping very well and the times I sleep best are in the morning.  Unfortunately, it's morning I am to work.  Maybe I will be able to change it later if it's not working.  We'll see...

I am on medications and they are helping with my mood but I am still wrought with moments of anxiety and despair at times, so fearful of setting the house on fire.  Needless to say I still struggle with my self esteem.

It's unbelievable that I have already been off work for three months.  I have done so little.  Time has flown.

I will let you know how things go once I am back at work.

Thanks for reading.
