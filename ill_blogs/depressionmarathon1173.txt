Thank You!!!

I want to take this moment to thank ALL of you who have ever commented on this blog. If you do not write a blog, you may not realize how nice it is to get a comment! Lately, I've been struggling with motivation. I've been questioning my purpose. It's classic depression crap, but that doesn't make it less bothersome or real. Your comments help me cope with the crap.

Submitting a comment lets me know I've touched someone outside my miserable self. When you comment, I learn a bit about "you," and what you need, want, or appreciate. Comments let me know that I've connected with you, and for that instant my writing fulfilled the intended purpose. Maybe something I wrote made a small difference in your day--that's always rewarding to hear. Maybe a post helped you think about something in a little different way--positive or negatively--and that, too, is satisfying. Maybe something you read helped begin a discussion with others in the real world. That's very cool.

Depression is such a silent illness, maybe reading my blog is the only time you "talk" about it. I always hope I've caught at least one person like that. I want to offer support and relief. I want readers to know, "You are not alone." And when you submit a comment, you also tell me I am not alone. Your comments help me because my depression is isolating. It is often a silent, solitary illness for me, too.

Your comments keep me going when I want to stop. They keep me connected when I think I want to be alone. They instigate a smile, a laugh, or a bright moment in my day. I appreciate your opinions, your feedback, and your experience. Your comments support me, and I appreciate them more than I can express.

So, thank you! Thank you for taking a moment to read my pondering. Thank you for expressing your point of view. Thank you for sharing your experience, strength and hope with me and all the other readers here. Thank you.
Thank you.
