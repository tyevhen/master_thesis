This is the second 10 mg pill i'm taking, I still feel the more or less the same... Actually It feels as if the stronger effect was couple of days ago... Anyways had no headaches or problem with the jaws and teeth but I do feel dry...so i'm going to drink now...(water...)
As always, Will keep you posted.
