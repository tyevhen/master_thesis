It's almost my birthday. Another year gone by, another number added to my age... I'm not really thrilled about it. I'm not too fond of this aging thing. I think it reminds me, again, of my lost decade. I have all the thoughts about not being where I wanted to be at this point in my life. All of those depression resentments resurface. And each advancing year feels like I have less and less time to get where I already thought I'd be. I'm trying to let tomorrow be a special day, but all of this garbage successfully sneaks in, too.

I'm attacking the garbage, and trying to make a special day, by throwing myself a little dinner party with a bunch of sober friends. So far I've got 10 on the guest list. I don't think I've had 10 people in one place to celebrate me since I graduated from high school! We're going to a slightly fancy local restaurant with nice atmosphere. I'm really looking forward to it!

I think I'll bring my newly purchased birthday present to dinner tomorrow night. I bought myself a new digital camera this afternoon. I had a couple of Best Buy gift cards, so old I couldn't remember when I got them, so I bought myself a Sony Cybershot. It's half the size of my current digital camera, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm excited to try it out.

New toys, old friends...I'm going to have a good day. Happy Birthday to me.
