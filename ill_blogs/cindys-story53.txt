I wrote the following verses down like this sometime during 2001 when I was 25 years old.  This would have been either during the end of my year spent as a missionary in Kenya or during the first while that I was back home in the US.  This is exactly how I had it written down, even the colors are the same.  I pray that God will help me to keep these as desires and goals in my life, and that he will make them true in my life.

MY PURSUIT
"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.  I will be found by you," declares the Lord.  - Jeremiah 29:13-14
MY STEPS
Whoever claims to live in Him must walk as Jesus did.  - 1 John 2:6
 MY MISSION
We proclaim him [Jesus], admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.  To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.  - Colossians 1:28-29
MY TASK
I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me - the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.  - Acts 19:24
MY TIMES
But I trust in you, O Lord; I say, "You are my God." My times are in your hands.  - Psalm 31:14-15a
