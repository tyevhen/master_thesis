There is a ray of light peeking into my soul. With the help of my psychiatrist, I made it through the long Labor Day weekend. With the support of my social worker, I returned to work on Wednesday, and although I didn't think I'd be able to handle it, I did. I spent last evening with friends and noticed a bit of my humor coming back. Today I struggled but completed my 11 mile tempo run, actually made it to the grocery store and purchased my groceries, and again spent the evening with friends. My mood has lightened. My anger at this damn illness has softened. And tonight I'm feeling just a little bit better. I'm putting one foot in front of the other, and for the first time in a couple of weeks, I actually feel like I'm getting somewhere. I'm so grateful for that.
