I just found out the website GoodTherapy.org, a site dedicated to "helping people find therapists and advocating for ethical therapy," has chosen my blog as one of their favorite depression blogs from around the web. This came as a total surprise. I am humbled and honored by the unexpected recognition.

When I began this blog almost 8 years ago, I had no idea what to expect. I hoped a few people would find me and take the time to read my words. I hoped to give voice to a debilitating illness which derailed my life. I prayed others would find encouragement and solace in my struggles and triumphs. And I wanted to fight the stigma which surrounds and burdens those of us battling depression. Over 1000 posts later, I hope I've accomplished at least a couple of these goals a few times.

Writing this blog has been more therapeutic (for me) than I ever imagined. Knowing I'm accountable to you, my readers, keeps me fighting when I want to give up, keeps me running when I feel too tired to move, and motivates me to always do the next right thing. If you'll continue reading, I'll keep writing. I'm extremely grateful to Jo Sahlin at GoodTherapy.org for her recognition and support.
