Happy Anniversary my love! 4 years of wedded bliss and every day is better than the one before it. I couldn't have asked for a better husband and partner. You always remind me of that in the little things you do and say each and every day. Like this morning when you woke me to say goodbye on your way to work...I said: "life itself began when I married you" and you said "my life really began when I MET you." I love you.
