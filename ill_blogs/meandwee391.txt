Hello there! Paige here! I wanted to tell you about my first Thanksgiving! We went to Nana and Grampa's house in Maine for the day. I had so much fun!

I got dressed up.



I played with Nana, Grampa, and my Uncle Jason




Nana read me my Thanksgiving book that my Godmommy Sue sent me. I love it!




I ate good food (I liked the peas but a spit out the pureed Turkey)



The next day, I relaxed and then got in a Post-Thanksgiving workout.




Thanks for sharing my first Thanksgiving memories with me!
