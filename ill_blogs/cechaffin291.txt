It is a week since I started on the expensive $14 tablet/day that my wife insisted we buy, contrary to my best depressive judgment. I can honestly say before God and Man and the Devil that I haven't been depressed in a week. I've cried in grief, but have had no depression. It's a fucking miracle! .

As my elder brother Chris always says, "Good to have you back!!"

Good to be back!!!!!

I can't tell you how grateful I am to science, luck, my doctor, the Demiurge who gave us reason and my darling wife, who insisted on more snake oil at a scandalous price, as well as the support I've received here. Know that your encouragements were never wasted, however dark it seemed to me.

At 3 Kilobunnies,

I don't know how I fucked up this underlining feature, but not being depressed, I can live with imperfection. Hoo Haw!
