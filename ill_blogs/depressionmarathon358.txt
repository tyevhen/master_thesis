I am back within the confines of my local mental health hospital. I was re-hospitalized yesterday afternoon. Unfortunately, though my mood seems somewhat improved, and I've even had a bit more energy to expend, my thinking is off the rails. My brain is broken.

I don't have a lot more to report today. To say I am discouraged is a massive understatement. I am so discouraged and depleted right now. I know this episode has to eventually pass. I know it can't last forever. But the depths of and length of this bout of depression has been beyond anything I've experienced in the past. I am praying for resolution. I am praying to hang on until I am returned from the abyss and able to resume my life once again. Keep moving forward with me, my friends. And thank you for your continued support.
