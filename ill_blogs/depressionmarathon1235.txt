A better week than last week, but still frustrated with fatigue. I did get both of my speed workouts done, but both way more difficult than I felt they should have been. And only two pennies on the ground all week...People are definitely picking up their pennies these days! Getting in the pool on Saturday helped my legs lose some of their heaviness. I hope I feel a little lighter and energetic this week. Here is the summary of Week Thirteen of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program.

Week 13: June 2-8, 2008
Ran: 4 days
Miles: 26.6
Long Run: 8.1 miles
Speedwork: 10 x 3 mins. hard with 1 min. recovery & 4 mi. tempo
Swam: 3/4 mile +

Low miles, but higher quality miles than last week. Only 13 days until race day!
Have a great week, everyone!
