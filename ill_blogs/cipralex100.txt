Feeling a bit chilled, a bit tired, mouth little bit dry, Breathing is a bit slower, feeling of a little bit electricity or brainwaves down the neck, i'm yawning a lot, but maybe its placebo? dunno, anyways its nothing too serious... meanwhile everything is ok, i'm abit excited and a bit frightened or worried of what to come...



had no problem with going to the bathroom or having sex...so far so good.
