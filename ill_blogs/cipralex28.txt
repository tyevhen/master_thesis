Hello again my friends and thank you for sharing your insights and experiences, your comments are helping many other people in the situation, so keep commenting, sharing and getting better.
Last night I was laying in my bed looking at my girlfriend sleeping while she hugs me, there was a good breeze coming from the window and the weather was just fine, then I realized again, wow, what a change…amazing…just amazing….(I mumbled that to myself) what wouldn’t I do a year ago to be in that position, everything was good, everything was awesome…
The change is dramatic and so noticeable…but sometimes when you’re inside something you don’t notice things… and it’s really important to stop – from time to time and realize what you achieved so far...
And honestly I think I’ve changed my life around, for the better.
Here’s a question I got for you guys, what have changed so far in your life? When was this moment when you said to yourself… things changed.
I’ve met with my doc got prescription for the next three months… all went smooth…meanwhile I’ll stick with cipralex…see what happens next…
Who knows? Maybe I’ll even get married. Lol.
Cheers and take care and keep helping each other.
Until next time
