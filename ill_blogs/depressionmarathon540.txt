If you are a regular here, you may have noticed the new badge atop this blog. Apparently, Healthline.com has named me to their list of the 18 Best Depression Blogs of 2012. I'm very honored and grateful for the recognition. I hope the link above works. Unfortunately, there seems to be some glitch with my computer, and I haven't been able to read the article yet!

It's always nice to be recognized. I've been working on this blog for 4+ years now. Reducing the stigma surrounding depression and other mental illnesses has always been my goal. Recognition by sites like this will help get my voice out there, and that's more valuable to me than any badge will ever be. A big thank you to Healthline.com, and a bigger thank you and to all of my readers. You're the reason I'm here, and my efforts would be futile without all of you.
