The downside of local coffeeshops
Two very skilled pianists are playing a frantic (though technically perfect) duet of “It’s a Small World After All.” The ill-advised Russian tea cake I just ate has given me a sugar rush and now nausea. And I’m trying to pound my way through my horrible, deplorable thesis in spite of sickness and those infuriating tinny refrains. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

The upside of local coffeeshops:
The random witty guy sitting near me heard my sighs and asked how I was doing. I complained about the song, and he called the pianists a “cover band” and said they played the soundtrack to the Disney ride just for me. It made me laugh. I guess you just had to be there.
