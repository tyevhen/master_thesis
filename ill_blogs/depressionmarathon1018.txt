Ask me to stand in front of a room full of people and tell my story of living with depression, and I can comfortably go into great detail. I've done it bunches of times. Ask me to speak about alcoholism, however, and I'm scared to death.

Tonight, consider me scared to death. I've been asked to speak to my large home AA group in three weeks. I may spend the next three weeks in a mild panic. You see, my story is quite boring. I drank to numb my depression. Thankfully, in my short history of problem drinking, I drank alone. Fortunately, I didn't do anything outrageous, commit any crimes, or end up in the gutter. Those things happen, and they make for good comeback stories when people get sober.

I guess I have a comeback story, but there just isn't a lot to it. There's not a lot to say. I drank to numb depression. Soon, I got to a point where I couldn't stop drinking. It was my comfort, my courage, my connection, and most importantly my medication. I drank alone and watched re-runs. I drank alone and painted my living room. I drank alone and watched sports. I drank alone and ran the next morning. It was pathetic, really. But there's not much more to it than that.

So I'm scared to death. The prospect of standing in front of a large room full of people I admire and respect to tell such a boring tale...well, let the panic begin.
