Hi friends! I hope all is well with all of you! Things are coming along well here! We have been so busy here experiencing all of Paige's "firsts." Time is going by too quickly! Her first night home, her first feedings at home, her first visits with friends and family...
5 days after her birth her little umbilical cord stump fell off, and I promptly cried in a fit of hormones...she's growing so fast! Of course, it's funny since we had our second pediatrician visit today and she now weighs 7 lbs. 8 oz...up from her birth weight of 7 lbs. 4.5 oz. Such a huge difference, eh? Anyway, I'm ultra sensitive and emotional right now...if I were to allow myself I'd likely cry all day! Not in a depressed way, just in a sentimental and overwhelmed by love way. I never knew I'd be like this. Anyhoo, her stump fell off, so we gave her the first tub bath. It was pretty scary, but we figured it out and now she's a bathing champ. She loves the warm water and the sounds of the splashing. Phew!



Another first and the moments fly right by and disappear. I've never been more aware of the fleetingness of time in all my life. I wish I could press a "pause" button so I could savor things all the more.
