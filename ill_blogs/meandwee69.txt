OMG, we live right near an awesome apple orchard and farm stand. Score! I can't say enough how much I love our new town. I think the kiddos are pretty happy too. Paige yelled "This is the biggest apple in the WHOLE PATCH!!!!!" every single time she picked an apple. (I didn't correct her to say "orchard") You could hear her little voice echo through the land! So sweet. Living in the New England country is better than I imagined. There seems to be a new treat around every corner.
