Hi friends!
Sorry I've been missing. We are busy battling colds here. UGH! I was hoping we could avoid the common cold during these first few months of Paige's life. No dice! Chris is almost done with it and I'm in the middle of it. Paige had the lightest case of it, but there was still a few days of suctioning out her nose with the bulb syringe and letting her sleep upright on my chest or in the vibrating chair. I was so paranoid and scared she would choke on her mucous. Ick. She seems so much better now and I got a little more sleep last night (as did Chris!). Grandma Carty came by to help for a few days which was heaven! I got lots of little things done while she doted on Little P and took good care of her. Grandpa Carty joined in toward the end and put in lots of good quality time with the li'l schnook too.
Chris and I even made it out on Saturday night to the wedding of a friend! I had the worst hormonal pull...I felt like I would cry toward the end of the dinner that night because I felt this need to rush home to her. I missed her terribly...it hit me like a ton of bricks. But, we made it through most of the evening and she was safe and sound at home. Last week she went to the 1 month doctor visit and she measured over 93rd percentile in height and 50th percentile in weight. Her head circumference is tiny, so I guess they are going to keep an eye on it. Looks like she's taking after her Daddy more and more...he's very tall ( 6 foot 3 inches) and his head measures a bit smaller than mine. That is no reference to his brain size, mind you, he's a smartie. :)
So, that's the news here! Hopefully I can share more soon, especially when we are feeling better! I at least wanted to update you and say hello! I hope everyone is doing great!
