A while back on one of my regular blog key word searches for unschooling (I love searching various things I'm interested in in blogs, and seeing what other people have to say about the subject), I came across a blog post on unschooling by a student teacher. As part of their class, each student is keeping a blog on various aspects of education, which I find quite fascinating in itself! This particular student's blog theme was educational and intellectual curiosity, and as such she'd written a post on unschooling, and was mildly critical of it. Now, that's kind of a pet peeve of mine, hearing negative things about unschooling since I've had to put up with so much in my life! I just had to comment. And she asked to do an interview, to give a better idea (both to her and her classmates) of what unschooling is like. So of course I agreed! Here is that interview, which I invite you to check out, especially if you have questions about unschooling!

Oh, and I've also added a couple more of my favorite blog posts to the sidebar.

Peace,
Idzie
