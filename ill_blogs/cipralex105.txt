Hello again,
have'nt posted in a while, lots of stuffs on my mind, and sometimes i just let myself do whatever i feel like, maybe even too much.
I talked to my shrink, she said i should pass to two pills per day, thats 20 mg, she said she does'nt think it effect me enough...



have'nt done so yet, but i will soon, I think in the next week or so.
I wish i could control my life more, I kinda got into a loop again.
but it just bother me less, or in a diffrent way.
anyways, will do something about it soon.
cheers!
