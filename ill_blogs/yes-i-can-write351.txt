My wonderful Manga, Anime, and anything Japanese obsessed sister, really really really wants to go to the Japan. And she's getting the opportunity to do just that, through Eli Gerzon's Worldschool Travel Tours. However, it's a LOT of money. She's therefor doing a bunch of things to raise money, one of which is making and selling bags, pincushions, jewelry, and other lovely things. If you're interested in supporting her, please check out some of her stuff on her deviantART acount. Items will soon be listed in her Etsy shop, CreationsbyEmi. Thanks a bunch, from both of us (I love to see my sis happy)!

Peace,
Idzie
