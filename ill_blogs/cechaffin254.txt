This is Topaz, a rather exotic beauty with a gem on her forehead. She is indomitable. If the day ever came when she did not do exactly what she wanted when she wanted the world would stop.





This is JoJo, a skittish athlete with an eating disorder--she eats too much. She and Topaz love to skirmish, sometimes leaping up into the air at the same time and colliding. We thought of calling Topaz "Cato" because she usually iniates the fights, as in the Pink Panther movies.




The cats are a welcome distraction from myself.
