It's so interesting being sober at a drinking party. I went to a good old fashioned drinking party last night. I don't know what else to call it. I mean jello-shots were involved. It was a little strange. I haven't been to a party like that--where much of the focus is on getting drunk--for many, many years. I know I haven't been to one since getting sober. It was fun. It was interesting.

The party was at the home of one of my co-workers, and it was mostly co-workers in attendance. It was fun to see them outside of work. I work with some very cool people. We played stupid games, people got loud, and we laughed a lot. I was the only one who wasn't drinking, and I was perfectly okay with that. I was just as silly and loud as many of the drunks. That surprised me a bit. I was expecting to feel more reserved without the loosening effect of the alcohol. I wasn't reserved, and I had fun.

So what's my point? Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how okay I felt. To me, it means I'm doing well. It means I'm feeling spiritually fit at this moment, and my program of recovery is working in my life. There have been times in my sobriety where I couldn't have participated like I did last night. The thoughts about joining in the "fun" would have been too great--the cravings difficult to ignore. But last night, I had fun. I was a participant. And that's what recovery is about, participating in life, one day at a time.
