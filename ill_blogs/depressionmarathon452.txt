You know, it takes no creativity, no brilliance, no sensitivity, and certainly no conscience to copy a blog post verbatim and present it as one's own. Copying 70 of them blatantly demonstrates someone who is devoid of any character! What is the point? What do they get out of it? Even photos? I mean, c'mon! Get a life!

Yes, it has happened again. It's been a few years, but I just discovered that another blogger.com blog, called depressionproblem.blogspot.com, (please don't visit this jerk's site!) stole close to half of my 2010 blog posts, pictures and all. Despite the blog title, the other posts on the site, likely also stolen, seem to be right wing political garbage. It appears the jerk began the blog in late 2010 by copying 70 of my posts before switching to the ranting political stuff. All of the posts, ranting and otherwise, stop in 2011.

I'm enraged! What motivated this idiot to copy my blog posts? Again, what is the point? I've contacted Google, but all I've received from them is a form letter (e-mail), saying they are very busy with multiple complaints, they've put my complaint into the queue, and they'll only get back to me if they decide they need to take any action. Otherwise, I won't even hear from them. If any of you reading this know of other avenues I can take to find and stop this plagiarist, I'd be happy for the assistance.

Until then... thanks for letting me vent.
