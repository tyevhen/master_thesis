Depression sucks because it makes me fat.
Just back from a run with Puck, my svelte black lab, and feeling the weight of me.
Yes, I look fine, and I don't have an eating disorder or body image disorder, but I am 20, that's TWENTY pounds over my best racing weight.
Thought it was the birth-control pill started in October, 2006.
By May, 2007; 20 extra pounds, and losses to all the locals I used to beat when racing!
Turns out, my psychiatrist and I just realized I also started a new anti-depressant in October, 2006. (I'm not going to say which anti-depressant because I don't want a bunch of people to throw away their meds.)
So now what?
This med has made a HUGE difference. I have been very stable and functional since starting it.

But, I am also a runner.
And a runner can't compete with 20 extra pounds.
Part of my identity is missing...
Now what?
