I admit it. I'm watching curling. And you know what? I've actually curled! Oh ya, you betcha! I grew up in Northern Minnesoooota, don't-cha know! Of course I've curled!

I'm also sitting here eating M&M's, fretting about how heavy I am, and wondering why I'm not losing weight. Hmmmm...I wonder.

I have M&M's to eat because I bought a pound of them to share with my sponsee today. She was scheduled to do some work with me today, but she called and cancelled. She not only cancelled, she said she needed to take a break. That's a very bad sign. Usually, taking a break from working the program is followed closely by taking a drink.

Her "taking a break" causes me to wonder, again, why it is that some of us get it, and some of us don't. Why am I enjoying a sober life? Why me and not so many others? All I can do is pray for "the others," I guess. But I do wonder...

I've been really tired this week during my workouts. Today I swam 1200 yards before doing the strength circuit. Twelve hundred yards would have been a cinch before I started this triathlon training, so I thought it would be even easier now. After all, I'm finishing my 6th week of a grueling regimen. Instead, I had a really tough time in the pool today. I had to take 4 or 5 rest breaks! Quite discouraging. I hope I'm just having a low energy week.

Thanks to my readers who've been leaving comments lately. Your comments really brighten my days! Thank you.
A full moon is arising outside my window. It's beautiful. It was a gorgeous winter day here in Minnesota. Looks like it will be a gorgeous winter night, too. Enjoy your evening, everyone.
