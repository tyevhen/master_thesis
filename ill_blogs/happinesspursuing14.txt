I'm worn out. It's been a long week and I've made some progress on that professional problem I alluded to in my last post. I plan to spend this Friday afternoon playing WoW.

So, the question: Is it wrong that I washed down my lunchtime dose of folic acid with a couple of ounces of whiskey? It didn't feel wrong.

Now, I'm off to kill some evil orcs and dragons!
