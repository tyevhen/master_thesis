I've got more cards out! Oh boy! Here's one to get if you know of anyone who's got a baby on the way (adopting or pregnant): Oh Mr. Stork; I hope there's a car seat in there! And then I created this whimsical little hand-lettered card a bride-to-be gives a friend to ask if she'll be a bridesmaid in the wedding. I guess people do that now? I love traditions that might involve cards. More fun for me! You can snag these over at my shop; thanks for considering them!
