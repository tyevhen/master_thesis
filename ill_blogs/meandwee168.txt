Hi friends!
I hope you had a great weekend! We had a family birthday party to attend and it was a lot of fun. The kids all played together and it was great to see Paige participating in the action rather than hiding in the corner like she did in the past. Things are going so great!
Chris took the kids all day Sunday to allow me time to do what I wanted, so I got a pedicure and then I spent the rest of the day working on my newest painting.
Here it is:


It's an 8x10 fine art print of my original watercolor painting. I wanted to create something specific for a nursery with a baby penguin and its parents.  You can find it for sale at the MeandWee etsy shop.

It was so sweet of Chris to give me the time. Thanks honey! It's with his help that I'm able to create my art and I'm so grateful.
He came down to my little studio and took some shots of me working. Here are my favorites...
Isn't it fun to peek into the work spaces of others?
