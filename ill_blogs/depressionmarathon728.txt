Well, the precipitous plunge was fast and severe, but it didn't last long. I've already lightened up. In fact, I began feeling more energetic and less hopeless yesterday. Just like the plunge, I seemed to lighten up overnight. Weird. On Monday night I could barely move. Yesterday I was able to do my speed workout without too much difficulty. And today I was able to work, run some errands, and take Puck for a walk. So it seems things are already getting back to normal.

I appreciated all of your comments on my previous post. It was nice to know some of you could relate. I'm still amazed at how fast I fell so low. It was strange. And it was so scary once I dropped. I didn't know how long it would last. I didn't know how low I would go. This time it was short-lived, but next time who knows? It's hard not to think of the worst when the worst is so bad. You know what I mean?

I'm grateful to be feeling better and more energized already. A little blip on the radar--that's all this turned out to be. Here's hoping the radar trends upwards from here on out.
