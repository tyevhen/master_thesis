A while ago Ty brought up the possibility of going on a road trip this Summer, and initially I dismissed the idea. It would need money I didn't have, and a month long road trip is a pretty big thing! But lately, when the idea was brought up again, I actually thought about it, and realized that all I usually do is dream about things but never put them into action. I really want to travel. This is an opportunity to do just that. Why on earth should I pass that opportunity up? So I've decided that I really do want to make this work. We'll try and get together four to six of us, including me and Ty, find a vehicle we can borrow, and take off wherever the mood takes us. Now I finally have a compelling reason to get a job! Which means I'm going to go to the job finding place tomorrow or the next day, and start asking around... I've got tons of ideas bouncing around in my head right now for how to make things work... Thinking of where/with whom we could stay, where we could go, what we could see, and how much money I need to make. As you can quite probably tell, I'm excited about this. I like having goals to work towards. They make working at all tolerable! :-P

Peace,
Idzie
