The last few days have been tough. I think I'm experiencing a little dip in my mood. I don't think our cold, gray, wet weather has helped one bit. I think we've seen the sun once in the past 7-10 days. It's been 60 degrees, gray and wet for at least 3 consecutive days with no end in sight! I've never experienced such a wet, gray Spring, and I hope I never have to again. Even my 90 year old patients are amazed. They've never seen anything like this! And that's saying something!

The cold, wet and gray have finally worn me down, I think. Staying upbeat and positive when surrounded by gray has gotten more difficult. My mood is beginning to match the weather. Over the past several days I've been more tired and had less energy. I've struggled with irritability, something I usually don't struggle with at all, especially at work. I've found less joy in simple things and fretted more about things of which I have no control. I've sought out friends less and spent more time alone. These are all signs that something is amiss.

Of course, like many of you, after 3-4 days of this, I worry about the heavy black fog slowly engulfing me once again. And yet, I feel more confident I can handle it even if that is what this is. That's a little different. While I'm worried about the darkness descending, I also have a sense I'll get through it. It may not be easy or comfortable, and I definitely won't like it, but I know it will pass. I'll just have to walk through it one step and one day at a time, and I know I can do that. I've done it many times before.

I've walked through a lot of darkness and pain over these past 12 years, and yet here I am. History is on my side. But let's hope all this anticipation is for naught. Tomorrow is another day. Perhaps the sun will shine. Perhaps my mood will brighten. Perhaps 3 or 4 days is the entirety of this episode. That's the hopefulness I will hang onto when I say my prayers and close my eyes tonight. Stay well, my friends.
