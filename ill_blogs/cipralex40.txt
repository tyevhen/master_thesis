its been a while since the last update, been on vacation with my girlfriend, and dealt with many issues but over all everything seems to be ok, sure i have some days when i'm bit down and others that i'm a bit up, but life is manageable,



and the only times went i did felt bad was when i haven't took the pills on time.
