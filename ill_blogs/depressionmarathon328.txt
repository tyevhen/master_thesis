I'm continuing to put one foot in front of the other today. I'm keeping it simple and focusing on each moment. I worked a few hours, napped, ran 10 miles, and napped again. The fatigue is frustrating, but at least I'm still moving forward and accomplishing what I need to accomplish.

I had a long weekend alone complete with a dip in my mood. I shouldn't spend so much time alone, and I know that, but it still takes a maximum amount of energy for me to get out and socialize, so I often don't. I didn't expend the energy over the weekend, and I paid for it with a slow descent of my mood.

My mood was still a little low when I awoke this morning, but being around people, working and running all helped. I'm glad, actually, that I did have to work this morning. It forced me to get up, shower, and get out of the house. I needed that.

And that's all I have to report today. I'm looking forward to a simple, quiet evening with Jet. He makes me smile (and laugh), and that's always helpful. Don't know what I'd do without him...
