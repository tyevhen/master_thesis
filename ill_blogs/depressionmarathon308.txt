I'm having a good week. On top of the blog award and the pay-it-forward breakfast gift, I had another good thing happen to me this week. Yesterday I was hired by another therapy company. I will be an on-call therapist at two of their local rehabilitation facilities. The reason I applied and accepted the position, which is in addition to the two other on-call positions I already have, is because they have regular hours for me at both of their facilities. Finally, I'll be able to get back to somewhat consistent work, and I'll be able to see if I can handle working part-time hours.

I'm not sure I've ever totally believed in the maxim, "When one door closes, another door opens," but that's exactly what happened this time. I lost my part-time position as a result of my recent depression relapse, and my employer hasn't had any on-call hours for me to work since March. As a result, I've been under a bit of financial pressure and worried about covering my bills. And along comes a better opportunity. A door closed, but another one opened. I'm lucky. And I'm very grateful. I start Monday.
