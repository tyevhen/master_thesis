I can't believe it's true. Next week is the first of September. Our summer here was so cool and strange this year that it just doesn't seem right to be ending already. But as I stacked the canned salsa on my can cellar shelves this morning, I was met with the realization that fall is indeed right around the corner.

Because I saw this...

And this...

And who can deny fall when you see these...

Oh, goodness. Where did summer go?
