The afghan that I was supposed to have finished for Lily's birthday at the beginning of the month is finally finished. And the only reason that happened is because I had to break down and tell her that I was making it. Unfortunately, it became very evident that it was going to be impossible for her to receive it anytime soon if I stuck to working on it in secret when she was asleep.

Since then, I have been working on it in all of my free minutes. It's made using the crochet linen stitch which is extremely easy but also extremely time-sapping since it's just single crochets alternating with chain stitches. Makes for a slow go. 

But it's done! Yay! And she loves it! Yay! And it's huge, which I'm very much pleased with. The first few photos are of it laying across our queen sized bed. (As a side note: this little dog tried to claim the afghan before I could even give it to Lily. She loves soft, fluffy things.) 

I love making my kids handmade things. In my mind, I see them treasuring them forever, although that may not happen in reality. However, I feel like I give them a little piece of myself (and my life) when I make them something with my own hands. And for me, that's a wonderful feeling, and my whole tribe really seems to love and appreciate the things I make for them. 

Some project notes:

The pattern ~ Beach Stripe Surf Blanket
The yarn ~ Bernat Super Value (Although I would definitely consider myself a yarn snob and reach for the natural fibers for most projects, I have used mainly acrylic yarns for large projects like afghans. They hold up well, I don't have to worry about laundering them in any special way, and they are more economical. This blanket cost about $60 in yarn using the super value yarn. It would have been at least triple that if I had used a wool blend.)
