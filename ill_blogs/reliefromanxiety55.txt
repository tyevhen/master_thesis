I thought I'd take this week as an opportunity for you to read my other work on mental illness besides my own blog. 

The link below will send you to a link that contains all of my guest posts and work including writing for Mind charity, Time to Change and Relate charity. You can read all of these, here. 

I hope you all enjoy.

See you all next week!

Best Wishes, 
Amy Xx
