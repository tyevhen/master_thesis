Baby curling! It's a quick clip with a great guffaw at the end. Fun!

I hope you guys had a great weekend! We had fun; we took Paige to the New England Aquarium and she seemed fascinated with all the sea life. There was an amazing jellyfish exhibit that had her riveted. I found you can become a member for a whole year for a small fee (just under the cost of two visits) and it pays for yourself, a guest, and a child under 3 for unlimited visits...a full year of free visits. It's a great activity and fun for us too!
