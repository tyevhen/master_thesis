We finally had the opportunity to bury my friend, Stan, yesterday. He died several states away a few months ago, the victim of alcoholism. It was a nice service performed in the very church in which he was baptized. After the service, his ashes were buried in the family plot right across the street. I finally got to say goodbye.

The church was filled to the rafters with fellow alcoholics, which made communion interesting! (Don't worry, Stan would have loved that observation.) Stan had an impact on everyone he met. He had a kind heart, a great sense of humor, and a generous soul. If only he could have stayed sober. Burying him yesterday made his death real and reignited my sadness. He's really gone. I miss him. I miss him a lot.

Rest in peace, Stan.
