I haven't mentioned it. I haven't written about it, because I wasn't sure it was realistic. Actually, I'm still not sure. Perhaps it's a bit more realistic today. My hip has tolerated three weeks of training, 30-36 miles per week. The injection into the iliopsoas tendon (hip flexor) seems to have worked. I tolerated a 15-mile run two days ago, and I've tolerated the energy expenditure so far. I've been able to run.

I think my training secret was also due to fear--fear of failure, specifically. If I don't reveal the goal, it's as if I never set one. No goal, no possibility of failure! How's that for some really screwed-up reasoning? Truthfully, setting goals is daunting for just about anyone. Setting goals when you have an intermittently debilitating, chronic illness takes audacity. I've written about the dicey-ness of goal setting before.

Goals are tricky things when you have depression. The evil depression constantly bombards my brain with condemnation. "You are worthless! You are stupid! You are slow! You will never be the person you used to be! This is it. This is how you are going to be the rest of your life! What a hopeless waste, you are!" (insert evil laughter here)
The audacity it takes to strive for a goal you may FAIL to achieve is enormous! Yep, goals are tricky with depression. With my illness constantly corrupting my thoughts, setting goals is often terrifying. If I fail to meet or exceed those goals, all of the nastiness screaming in my head is instantaneously reinforced. And once those thoughts are "proven" to be "real," they stop being thoughts and become me. My depression loves it when that happens. It gets what it was craving, and it is satiated by my desperation. Depression wins. (from goals, 01/17/08)

Well, here I go! I'm about to be audacious! I plan to run and finish the Twin Cities Marathon on October 5, 2008. My secondary goal is to run it under 3:50, which, I believe, would qualify me for The Boston Marathon, April, 2009. Wish me luck!
