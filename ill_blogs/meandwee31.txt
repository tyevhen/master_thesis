Whoa. This pregnancy is zooming by with zest! This poor little babe...being the third I think he's already getting shortchanged, especially in this space! No pregnancy posts or bump progress shots! That's what happens when you are caring for two small children and working on a side-business. There just doesn't seem to be enough time in the day for all the things I'd love to do. SIGH!
Things are progressing nicely with him. I'm huge already; just like my last pregnancies at this time, Ha!  I waddle around and am already hurting everywhere! I hope 3 months will go by fast! The kiddos are excited to meet this little baby; they hug my belly, kiss it, and talk to it every day and it just melts my heart! I was scared about the prospect of having a third child at the beginning, but now I realize I have 2 other little ones who can help provide "entertainment" as needed. I think you know what I mean, *wink*. I already know what I'm doing and I don't feel so alone like a deer in the headlights.
I have so much to talk about when it comes to this pregnancy and the time keeps getting away from me. It's been filled with a lot of emotional and personal drama that I never anticipated. That's what's so funny about life, isn't it? So many ups and downs and we navigate them as best we can. Despite all this, this entire experience has made me stronger than ever so I can be grateful for that. Even in my darkest trials, I feel like God is guiding me to the best outcome and I've learned to trust in that. I'll gather my thoughts and share a few more posts on this topic soon as I think being transparent could help lots of other people like me. I'll see you soon!!!
