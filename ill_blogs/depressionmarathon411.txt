I do not have much to report tonight. I am still quite ill. In fact, I may head to the doctor tomorrow if things don't improve. I have worked all week, but it hasn't been fun or easy. I have little to no voice, which is comical when trying to communicate with my elderly patients who generally do not hear well anyway. I'm looking forward to my day off tomorrow. I plan to rest, rest and rest some more.

Other than this viral illness, the rest of my body recovered very well from the marathon. I had little soreness and could have easily resumed running within 1-2 days. I haven't run yet, but it's been due to my chest congestion rather than sore muscles. I'm looking forward to getting back on the road, but I'll hang out until this virus clears first. It's now time for me to head back to bed. Sleep seems to be the best thing I can do right now. Hopefully I'll be feeling better and have a little more to say when we visit again in a few days.
