The past month and a half has been a bit of a slog for me. If you've been following along, you know that. But things may be changing. Once again, the light seems to be returning. I'm not dancing a jig just yet, but I'm hopeful this brighter trend continues. The simple act of feeling hopeful is in and of itself an improvement. Hooray for improvement!

I'm leery of getting my hopes up, of course. The rollercoaster of symptoms has taken its toll. But I'm enjoying feeling better today. One day at a time... I'll take it one day at a time, keep taking the next right action, and use the supports I have in place to (hopefully) finally disembark this ride.

I had a good day yesterday. It was cake night. Cake night is a night of celebration where family and friends are invited to celebrate sobriety anniversaries with those of us in recovery. It happens once per month. Last night we gave out 14 cakes and celebrated 167 years of sobriety. I was responsible for 9 of those 167 years.

Prior to the meeting, I had a wonderful steak dinner with friends, some of whom were also celebrating, and then we all attended cake night together. It was wonderful to be surrounded by a room full of family, friends, and miracles. I never tire of hearing the stories of lives changed by sobriety. I am so grateful for the life I have today, depression and all; a life that would not be possible if I were still drinking.

Today is dawning bright, warm and clear. I'm looking forward to going for a run/walk with Jet. I'm having coffee and catching up with an old friend this afternoon. And I'm hoping to begin putting my house back in some sort of order. Depression has taken a toll on my surroundings, too. I know I'll continue to feel better if I can clean up a bit. Hoping you all have a bright, clear day, too. Carry on, my friends.
