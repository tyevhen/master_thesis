A new job. On the stress meter, it's supposedly equal to a death in the family. So far, I'm not feeling too stressed, but I don't start until April 12th. Yes, that's right. I got the job. As of mid-April, I will be a physical therapist for a local home health agency. This will eliminate my 50-60 minute drive at the beginning and end of each day. Even though I will likely be driving more miles overall (between clients), I will have more flexibility throughout my day, and hopefully I will only be away from home for 8 hours, versus 10 hours, per day. I think this is a good opportunity, and I'm hoping it will be a nice change.

It's sunny and warm outside this morning, and I'm watching Puck out in the back yard. This is the first time he's been in the back yard, on my brand new grass, in a couple of years. After the flood a few years ago, I had to dig up the concrete patio and yard, re-grade it away from the house, and then plant new grass. So Puck's been relegated to the small front yard since then. I think he's pretty happy to be out back again. He's the epitome of happiness right now. He's rolling around on his back and soaking up the sun. Pretty cute. He always makes me smile. Don't you wish your life was as simple as my dog's life? I do.
