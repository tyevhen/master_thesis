Still rough today. Still wiped out from my ill-fated research yesterday. Hardly able to move. Eating too much. Sleeping too much. Not exercising at all--day #3, and counting. All of which makes me feel worse rather than better!! Yet, I can't seem to do anything different.
I've had this illness so long I no longer know what's "normal." Specifically, is my heavy-heart-hangover, sloth-like immobility, and debilitating despair--which I am sure will turn into at least 30 days of desperation and hopelessness--is this normal? Or is this depression?
Part of me wants it to be depression. It feels so big, so debilitating, so overwhelming it must be abnormal. But another piece of me wants it to be normal, something everyone would experience given the same circumstances. It would be nice to share some experiences with "normal" people once in awhile. It gets frustrating talking with Normies about how I'm doing when I'm talking about depression and they're talking about feelings. (right now, the readers with depression are nodding, "yes!" and the Normies are looking confused and thinking, "huh?")
The bottom line is I am tired
and sad.

My body is tired
and sad.

My brain is tired
and sad.

I am tired
and sad.

I am sad.

I am sad
I am sad
could be depression
could be life
