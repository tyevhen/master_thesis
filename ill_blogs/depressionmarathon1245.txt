Often when feeling low, I look for humorous things to read, watch or listen to. It's a very useful skill called Opposite to Emotion Action which I learned in Dialectical Behavior Therapy. Ironically, it was this skill that led me to sign up for the half-marathon I ran this past weekend. And if Puck hadn't ruptured his ACL, you likely would have already read an entire post about this skill, post half-marathon, and in recognition of the end of Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month, which I'd been planning to write.
I didn't go out looking for humor tonight, but boy did I find it!! Thanks to http://adsquefty.com/for highlighting this YouTube video on his blog, which is where I found it and now share it with you! It's called, An Engineer's Guide to Cats.
ENJOY!
