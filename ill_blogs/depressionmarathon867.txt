When I volunteered to speak about gratitude for my AA group's anniversary celebration, I had no idea how difficult the topic would be! I've been working most of the day on a 15 minute speech, for crying out loud! And I'm freaking out just a bit! I've finally got something put together, but I'm not thrilled with it. So I'm pretty nervous about speaking tomorrow night. In fact, I can't wait until it's over!

The other focus of my day was working out. We're getting into the middle weeks of our training now, and the workouts are certainly heating up. Yesterday we did a "brick," which was a 50 minute spin class followed by 20 minutes of fast running. Today I ran outside for 50 minutes and then went to the gym for the strength and ab portion of the program. My legs are tired! Actually, my whole body is tired. Tomorrow, thankfully, I've only got a 50 minute bike ride, and then it's on to a jam packed weekend.

Well, I'm off to practice my speech one more time. I know whatever happens, it will be okay. I couldn't be speaking to a more forgiving audience. I have to try to remember that tomorrow night. Wish me luck!
