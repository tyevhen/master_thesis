Happy New Year! I wish all of you good mental health, stability, and joy during this upcoming year. Those of us with mental illness know the path will not always be smooth. There will be rough patches, but they will pass. They always do. Join me in putting one foot in front of the other in 2015. Moving forward, one moment at a time, is the only way through the bad times, and the best way to fully experience the good ones. As long as you continue reading, I will be here, writing and fighting with you. We can do together what I cannot do alone. Thank you for joining me on my journey. I am humbled and honored to be a small part of yours. Here's to 2015! May it be great!
