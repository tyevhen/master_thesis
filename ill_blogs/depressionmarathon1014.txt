Which comes first, the heavy fatigue or the sliding mood?
Am I feeling lower because my energy has plummeted?
Or has my energy plummeted because I'm feeling lower?
Which came first?

Does one cause the other?
Is the low energy responsible for the falling mood?
Is the falling mood causing the low energy?
Or are these simultaneous occurrences,
each a bit part of a much larger scene?

Is the depression back after a long reprieve?
Or did I simply over-extend?
Twenty miles...carrying bricks;
Am I simply tired?
Or were these enough to start a tailspin?

Is this a tailspin?
Perhaps it's too soon for that.
