'Sunday was sad. I cried a lot. I cried for never hanging out with him again, no more gorgeous kisses, no more lovely sex. I cried for that horrible feeling of rejection, for history repeating itself and my wasted heart. I cried because I felt a fool, that I'd made/fantasised all this up - I thought he cared about me. I cried for being 26 and dumped, but not dumped because we were never together. I cried for him because he was giving up on something I knew could have been amazing.'
