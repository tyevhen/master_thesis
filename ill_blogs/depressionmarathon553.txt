I'm on my way to bed after running a very long, hot Boston Marathon. This was probably the toughest marathon I've ever finished. It was in the mid-seventies at the start, and I believe it was somewhere in the high-eighties when I finished. The sun was beating down on us from above and the pavement was radiating heat up from below. By mile four I was pretty sure I wasn't going to finish. I kept making little deals with myself about running just to the next mile marker, or even half mile marker, before walking. Early on I decided to walk up every hill, in order to save my energy, and that's exactly what I did. I ran as much as I could. I ate and drank everything that was offered to me. I willed my body to go when it just didn't want to move anymore. It was tough, but I finished. It was one of my slowest marathon times, 4:13:02, but the winning times for both the men and the women were the second slowest and the slowest, respectively, in recent history, too! It was a long day out there on the road. I'm happy to have finished.
