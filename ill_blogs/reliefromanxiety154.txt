3. You will never find me without my camera.

4. I am constantly thinking about life and writing pages on it. Always thinking about the philosophical meaning and trying to find answers.

5. Travelling and concerts are some of my favourite pastimes. I will almost never miss an opportunity to go to a concert or go travelling.
