With this pregnancy being so different from my first one, I knew I had to be having a boy this time around. My first trimester was pretty awful. Now that I am in my second trimester and the morning sickness is gone and I am getting my energy back, hopefully things will liven up around here. Finding out I am having a boy has only ensured many stressful, gray hairing days to come. Hope all is well with you! Drop me a line and let me know how things are going. Feel free to ask any questions too :)
