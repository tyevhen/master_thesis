Hello! As my post title says, today I am 17 weeks pregnant. Wow, those words astound me! I remember thinking 7 weeks was a big deal! All is going well here. I'm still waiting to feel some baby movement...I think I've maybe felt a flutter here or there, but nothing is for sure yet. I figure in another week or 2 I'll start to feel something I'll be more sure about. I hope! Chris and I went out to dinner on Friday night and when we got to the waiting area a lovely woman and her two young children jumped up off the couch as she proclaimed "let's go guys, this lady needs the seat more than us!" Woa. That was the first time a stranger had acknowledged my "condition!" And gave me her seat, at that! I told her she didn't have to, but she very much insisted saying "I remember what it was like." And I chuckled and stated that I wasn't very far along. But, I took a seat and and sat there kind of stunned. I'm just glad I am pregnant...what if I'd just had a few too many cheeseburgers? She made a lucky guess...or maybe I look more pregnant than I think? Today I went to the dentist, and when I walked in, the receptionist (after I took off my coat) said "OH! I guess that answers our question of if you are or aren't!" Again, I was called out. Believe me, I'm not complaining. I guess I'm just amazed at how fast time goes. And that it's ME they are talking to! How many times do I need to pinch myself to believe this is truly happening?
