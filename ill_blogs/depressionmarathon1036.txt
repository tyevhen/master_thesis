Eighteen miles today. It was a long 18 miles. My legs were tired from a good, quick week of running. I knew it was going to be a long day when I felt tired within the first five miles. Puck pooped out around ten, so I dropped him at home, took a bit of a break and then continued. I purposely put myself far from my home for miles 13-16 because I knew those would be really tough. They were, and I had no choice but to run them. I finished with my usual ice bath--yes, ice bath, as in a tub full of cold water and ice. I really needed it today. Now I've got my eyes on some chocolate!

In other news: I bought a triathlon bike. Holy cow, what an expensive sport! I bought the bike on ebay, so that saved me at least $1000. However, the pedals cost $100--ebay again--and the shoes look like another 100 bucks! Plus, I had to have it assembled at the local bike shop. You guessed it, $100! I will have to have it fit to me, another $100, and I haven't even begun to shop for those expensive tight shorts yet! Yikes! I hope it was all worth it. I practically have to try a triathlon now! I'm looking forward to getting out on the road.

My mood has continued to stay strong. It's nice to see my doc and not have much to say. That's been quite a switch for me. I'm not waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm just staying in each moment and enjoying the relative calm. Like I said, it's been nice. I hope each of you are having similar calm today!
