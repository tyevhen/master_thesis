And a Merry Christmas for those who celebrate! We will be off celebrating and making merry. We'll see you in this space soon! Thank you all for reading and sharing my life this year; it's been so helpful and so fun! I can't wait to see what 2011 will bring us all! I hope for good things for all of us. Many hugs and thanks!

Megan, Chris and Paige
