Despite my best efforts the dive in my mood continues. Actually, rather than a quick dive, it now feels like a gradual, suffocating, slide underwater; really black, heavy, murky water. The symptoms I'm experiencing have multiplied over the past couple days. And today depression took away what little energy I had left. I'm heavy, exhausted, and slow.

I've been trying to do what I can to get out, keep to my commitments, and talk to friends (though I admit I haven't done too well on that score). Socialization is always the first to go. Today, I lost running. That's a scary sign, as that's often my last bastion of normalcy. But today I tried and failed.

Okay, perhaps I'm being too hard on myself. I didn't totally fail. I did get some of my run accomplished, but very unlike me, I could not complete the miles I had scheduled. And the miles I did run were so difficult, I was incredibly frustrated. I was forced to begin walking far from home. My body just wouldn't go. Jet and I slowly made our way back. It was a long, cold, misadventure.

I'm concerned. I certainly don't want to go through another depression episode. I want to keep moving forward. I want to keep working, running, and socializing. I want to feel the feelings of life, not stand outside myself and coldly observe. I'm going through the motions without feeling. I want to be in motion instead.

I'm speaking to a high school class about depression tomorrow. Hopefully that will help get me out of my head for an hour. I'm also scheduled to see my therapist, which I certainly hope will help turn the tide. I want and need to get my head back above water. I'm low, so low. Up is the only direction I have left to go.
