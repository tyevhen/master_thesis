Hello again,
I've noticed some of you wonder when is the best time to take it,
I guest It depends on you guys, I personally take it at night, couple of hours before I go to sleep, It works best for me.
And I suggest that you do the same for start, that way even if you'll have to deal with side effects, you'll be able to learn them before dealing them around other people.
