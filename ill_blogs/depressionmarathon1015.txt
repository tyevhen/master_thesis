I'm having a sleep day today. This happens every once in awhile, and it has been a little while since the last one. I just can't wake up. I am sleepy, tired, and heavy. Basically, the only comfortable place is in bed, asleep. And no matter how much I sleep, I can easily sleep some more. I just got up from my third nap for crying out loud!

I guess I should have known something was up when I fell asleep at 7:00 last night. After sleeping 11 hours, I figured I was in for a good day. However, after my usual morning oatmeal, coffee, and Sportscenter, I needed a nap. I thought maybe I just overdid it yesterday. I helped some friends carry bricks and build a path. But that must not have been the problem, because the sleepiness just won't stop.

Perhaps this is what I was supposed to do today. After all, there is a Law and Order marathon on USA. It's drizzly and gray outside. The one appointment I had was cancelled. Everything lined up for a tired, sleepy day...and my body won't let me do otherwise. Whew...I think I need a nap.
