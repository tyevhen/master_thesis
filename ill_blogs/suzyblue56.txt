Hello you lovely lot!

This semester at uni is craaazy busy, but there is so much to look forward to!
One of our more exciting modules invloves us (the fashion management students) collaborating with the fashion design and textile students to create our very own clothing line. I'd like to take this time to introduce you all to Anagram Fashion. Anagram is an edgy, upmarket, alternative approach to unisex clothing. Don't let the word unisex put you off, these designs are FABULOUS! Heres a sneak peek at some of the initial sketches:


As you can tell, we are still in the very beginning stages of creating this line but oh its all so exciting!! Keep your eyes peeled for more updates and information on our twitter page (@AnagramFashion) and make sure you like and share our facebook page! http://www.facebook.com/AnagramFashion 

Until next time
Stay classy
