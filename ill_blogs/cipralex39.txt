Once again its been a while since i've posted, but in a way thats a good thing, I spend most of my time with my girlfriend and friends, having fun living.

I'm very calm...maybe a bit too calm, at least that what my gf thinks, I haven't told her anything about it yet, and with a little luck I would never need to.



Everything is fine, no panic attacks lately maybe just a mild one couple of days ago...but nothing serious...

I will post more soon.
take care and happy holidays
