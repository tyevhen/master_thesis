I'm going to have to stop going to church. This morning, as has happened several times, I got really sad upon leaving church. Really sad... And for the life of me, I can't figure out exactly why. It's a heavy sadness. It washes over me and settles like a leaden cloak upon my back. It weighs me down. It makes me tearful and tired. It negatively effects the rest of my day. If this continues, I'm going to have to stop going to church.

I don't understand the sadness, nor why it happens upon leaving church. It may be connected to loneliness, but I hate to admit that. That sounds so pathetic. But loneliness is the only thing that even remotely makes sense. I go to church alone, and there are lots of families and couples there together. Maybe those reminders are just a little too much? I don't know.

I'm curious to know if anyone else ever experiences this. And by this, I mean sadness upon leaving a group, or an event, or anything which shouldn't evoke sadness. It bothers me. I don't like feeling sad, especially when the reason is not clear. Does this make sense to anyone else? I'm curious, and confused, and, well, sad.
