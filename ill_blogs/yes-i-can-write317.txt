Before it gets to be a ridiculously long time since our vacation, I wanted to share some photos from our week away (the first week in August). I took several hundred photos on our last full day there, and all the photos shown below are from that one day! I may share some pics from the rest of the week at a later date, or I may not... I'll see how things go! I don't have the energy right now to add captions, so I'm not going to.



















Peace,
Idzie
