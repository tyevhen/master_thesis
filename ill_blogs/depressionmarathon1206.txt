Living with depression requires an enormous amount of patience, resilience, and coping. One of the my favorite coping skills is humor. When I lose my sense of humor or my sarcasm I know I am in a very deep hole. It's not pretty. One of my favorite sources for humor, especially on weekends, is National Public Radio. Living in Minnesota, I am quite fortunate to have a thriving public radio network, and I spend most of my weekend alone time listening to my local MPR station.
Today I heard one of the funniest segments I have ever heard on one of my favorite NPR programs, Car Talk. If you are in need of a really good laugh, spend the next 10 minutes listening to this! You won't regret it for a second! Enjoy!
