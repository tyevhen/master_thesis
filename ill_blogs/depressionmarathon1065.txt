This morning, on the way to my usual AA meeting, I couldn't wait to talk to Stan about the Vikings new quarterback. We both loved the Vikings, and we both hated last season's QB options. It took a couple seconds before I remembered I wouldn't be sharing any thoughts with Stan. I looked to the sky... I could almost see him smiling with optimism for next season.

The Vikings--Stan and I discussed them a lot. He was one of few men who didn't flinch when, on occasion, a woman knew more about sports than he. I never told him how much I appreciated that. I never expected I wouldn't sit with him, share chili and the game, and yell at the TV again. I'll miss that.

We never know, do we, when our exit will come.

Just a few days after Stan died, my yoga instructor said, "Tell the ones you love. Tell them today what they mean to you. Tell them now, because even though you are planning to come to class tomorrow, you may not make it here." That's the reality of life, isn't it? And yet, even with my recent experience, I've had difficulty taking her suggested action. Why is that? How about you? Have you said, "I love you," or "Thank you," today?
