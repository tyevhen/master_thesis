I start my new job tomorrow. For some reason, I'm really anxious about it. I don't understand why I'm so nervous. I've worked in nursing homes before. I've cared for the geriatric population a lot. I've been a therapist for a long time. I don't get it. Why am I so anxious?

I'm recovering well from Saturday's marathon. My soreness is almost entirely gone today. I haven't gone out for a run, or done any other exercise, since the race. I guess I'm taking a little exercise vacation. I'll probably start up again tomorrow. I am going to sign up for another marathon in August. That will give me one marathon every other month, plus one extra marathon in May, for the year. Initially, I had no plans to do that, but it sort of worked out that way once I got rolling.

I saw my psychologist this morning. My mood has been really good lately. It's nice to be feeling so well. Of course I feel like I have less to share here when feeling so good, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm looking forward to continued stability, getting to know the new man in my life, and training for my next marathon. Keeping it simple...I like it like that.
