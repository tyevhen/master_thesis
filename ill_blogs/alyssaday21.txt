Quick pop-in to say hi and answer a few questions:

Quick pop-in to answer several reader ?s at once, since I've received these same questions from many of you, my lovely friends:

Q: Did writing Alaric's book make you cry?
A: Yes, several times. The goodbye scene b/w Quinn & Jack early in the book nearly destroyed me. Quinn & Alaric finally together. Bringing them all back to Atlantis in the end. Conlan's speech at the feast. So many scenes . . .

Q: Are you EVER going to post Alejandro's Sorceress, you SLACKER?
A: I have thrown out this entire story & started over twice now. I promise you that I WILL announce it when it's posted so you don't have to email me & ask any more. :)

Q:  What are you working on now?
A: Finishing the novella for ENTHRALLED, the anthology that will now be out in July, 2013.

Q: When will Denal's novella and/or Jack's 1st book be out?
A: I will never announce an upcoming date again until it is ROCK-SOLID FIRM. I have SO learned my lesson.
