Unusual day today. I went golfing, which was unusual. I hadn't golfed in two years. But even more unusual, I went golfing with three other women. I don't generally spend time with other people. It was strange to be out of my house all day, and even stranger to be out of my house with others.

You see, I'm a bit of a loner. I'm okay being by myself. Don't get me wrong, I like people, but people are complicated. People are social. People are exhausting. People require energy expenditure. Since my depression began, I've typically decided to expend my limited energy elsewhere. It's easier in so many ways to be alone.

But today I wasn't alone, and it was nice. Maybe this is another sign things are going well. I made plans. I didn't end up dreading the plans. I followed through with my plans, and I had fun. Hmmm...interesting.
