Dear Little P,

Here we are! We made it! One year. One whole year. One year ago; the best day of my life, you were born. This past year has been a swirling whoosh of newness. I've learned to get used to having no clue what I'm doing. I just follow my heart I guess and so far so good! You are my treasure...my sun, my moon, my stars, my heart. It is the biggest joy of my life to watch you grow and change and become who you were meant to be. It goes so fast it is hard to keep up. But I'm so lucky you look to me for love, for assurance, for confidence and support during each day. And Daddy feels the same way. He misses you so much during the day and races home every night to give you dinner, play time, snuggle time, bath and bed. Every moment with you is precious and special. I don't know what this next year will bring. But here is what I wish for you, today, on your birthday: Love, Friendship, Happiness, Peace, Confidence, Fun, and more love. Hold my hand and we will jump into the next year together; I won't let you fall. Happy Birthday my love. It may be your special day, but YOU are MY biggest gift.
Many hugs and kisses and love always and forever,
Mama
