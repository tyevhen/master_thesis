If you forget Valentine's Day, you're actually kind of a hero.  For flowers.

While we're on the subject, look at this romantic card I made!


UPDATE:  As I was reading through my comments, one in particular really stood out to me: 


-Nutella on Toast

It's so sweet, yet so creepy.  So eloquent.  I just don't know what to say!  

And we have a rebuttal! 



-Maxie

(To settle any confusion, I have lived in both Idaho and Montana, but I currently live in Montana.  I don't know whether to give the points to Maxie for accuracy or to Nutella on Toast for successfully stalking my childhood...)
