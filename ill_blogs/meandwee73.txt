We are settling in to our new home...slowly but surely! We're taking our time and making sure to find true homes for all our belongings. No more just throwing stuff into cabinets to "deal with later." It's even kind of fun! I'm enjoying our new town too. Everyone is so friendly wherever we go. It's just such a breath of fresh air! The kids are enjoying our new back yard space and all the adventure it has to offer. There's lots of big trees, hidden little alcoves, bushes and plants, gardens, swings, a tree house, and a big slide. I'll have to take some pictures of their fun to share here so I can always remember this magical time! Tomorrow is Paige's first day of school for the year...her last year of preschool. She's expressed that she's nervous to start a new school with new kids and a new teacher but says she'll be ok as long as she has her lovey "Buggy-Boo" by her side.
