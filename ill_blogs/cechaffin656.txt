I was trying to post to another's blog and found establishing my own the price of participation.

If you've never heard of me, I'm not surprised.

Sometimes, no often, no frequently, no with the eternal recurrence of Nietzsche, I wish I'd never heard of me, too.

Nevertheless, you can google "C. E. Chaffin" and find more than a few references to my various contributions to the literary net.

Happy to talk, blog, blog, blog.


Thine in Truth and Art,
