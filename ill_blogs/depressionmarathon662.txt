I can't imagine having children. My dog, Puck, had surgery today, and I thought I was going to die from the anxiety I felt. I'd been anxious about this surgery for a week. I'd had doomsday thoughts about it. I couldn't help it. I was sure he was going to die. I hardly slept last night. I was worried. Can you imagine if I'd had a child in surgery? I would have been out of my mind!

I'm not sure why this surgery was so difficult for me. He's had multiple surgeries over the years. I'd been anxious about all of them, but not to this extent. And this was the simplest procedure he'd had done by far. It was only a dental procedure. He had two fractured teeth which needed to be repaired. Simple, but they still had to put him to sleep to do it. That's what had me so worried. So worried I cried when I dropped him off, and I prayed all the way home. I was a bit of a mess.

Thankfully, my boy is fine. I haven't seen him yet, but the vet tells me he did well. He's awake and hungry. They were able to fix the fractures without pulling his teeth. That was good news. I'm so, so relieved he's okay. I hated having the doom and gloom thoughts. I hated waiting. It was tough. I love him so much, I don't know what I would do if he was suddenly gone. Thankfully, he's not.
