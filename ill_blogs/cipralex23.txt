Hello again my friends, I got many emails about the previous design of the blog was a bit...problematic - well it was hard to read with all the black colors around.




Anyways I had couple of free hours so I've decided to upgrade the blog design a bit, do let me know what you think about it and if there's anything you want me to add.

Enjoy.
