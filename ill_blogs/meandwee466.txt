At 4:00 this morning (Eastern Time) my water broke!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm almost done gathering my stuff etc. and we are off to the hospital!!!
(They aren't dicking around when they say a "gush" of fluid...this was like taking a bucket...a FULL bucket of water and dumping it upside down and then it goes for a while. And then goes some more. It's crazy!!!) Luckily, the fluid was clear and now the running around by Chris and myself has ensued. I'm shaking and trying to stay calm. I'm having light irregular contractions now, but hadn't been before. I'll add more later on, but had to let my blog family know...this is it! Please pray for us if you can, or send good vibes. I'm scared and excited. I can't believe Little P. is going to be here soon. Our dream is finally coming true! Much love...
