Hanging out chewing his Kong, Jet's recovering nicely from his surgery. The surgery was a complete success. The surgeon found a "huge chunk of bone" floating around in Jet's right elbow joint. The bone fragment was so large, the surgeon had to break it into smaller pieces in order to extract it from the joint. This was all done arthroscopically, so the recovery "quiet" time will only last two weeks, rather than six, as I had originally been told. That was a relief!

I was also relieved the surgeon actually discovered the chunk of bone. It certainly did not show up on the x-rays, so we were just supposing it was there based on his other symptoms. Jet was likely in a fair amount of pain, despite not always showing it. He does have arthritis in the joint, which is a result of the bony fragment floating around in there. Hopefully, with supplements and a slow return to activity, it will remain mild for a long time to come.

The surgeon told me the recovery from this procedure varies widely. He thought Jet had a good chance for meaningful recovery, but he had no way of predicting if Jet will ever tolerate normal levels of activity, like running with his mama. We've got some doggy physical therapy to do over the next 4-6 weeks, and then we can begin short walks. We can't even attempt running for at least another 6 months. Of course, if he limps with walking, we won't ever attempt running.

I'm not worrying too much about running right now. I'm relieved he's home and well. I'm grateful this procedure gives him at least a chance at a full recovery. Thank you for your kind words and prayers as Jet and I have traveled through this process. He's doing well. And come to think of it, so am I.
