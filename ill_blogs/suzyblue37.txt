This week, i've been bunged down with an awful chest infection so I haven't been able to go out and take my usual outfit of the day pictures or do a face of the day post! So today to cheer myself up, I was internet "browsing" and put together a little collage of things I plan to treat myself to on payday...the nine day countdown is on!
