Well, she finished it. Her very first machine-sewn project.

And just in time, I must add, since the recipient is going to be needing it within the next day or so. 

You see, this little quilt is for the newest member of our family. My sister-in-law is in the hospital right this moment in the midst of that glorious, but oh-so-painful, thing we know as labor. And {hopefully} she will be delivering her and her husband's very first baby very soon. A baby girl. 

Lily is so excited to give this to her. She even stitched a drawstring bag out of a vintage sheet (or pillowcase, I can't remember) to wrap it in. And I'm hoping that today by dinnertime, we'll be able to take the short trip to the hospital to see the new baby.

And if you think about it, please say a prayer for my sister-in-law. Her name is Amber, too. She's pretty nervous about this whole thing, as all first-time mommies are.
