I wrote this poem during high school when I felt sad and alone.  I had so much confusion and sadness inside of me, and I didn't know why.  I was afraid I was a fraud and a bad person for feeling the way I did so I kept it inside of me.  I really wanted to trust someone with my struggles, but was so afraid.

ALONE IN MY ROOM
by Cindy Boersma

Alone in my room
My face wet with tears
I long for a friend
To tell all my fears

I try to look cheerful
As I go through my day
But sometimes those sad feelings
Get their own way

You can tell something is wrong
You say you listen well
I hurts to keep it in
But I can't bring myself to tell

I want to spill my soul
And let my feelings out
And I would tell you
If it wasn't for this doubt

Can I trust you my friend
With these secrets I guard
Will you keep it between us
Or will that be too hard

I know I am not the only teen that has felt this way.  In confusion and sadness, desperately wanting someone who might understand what I was going through.  Now I wonder how someone might have gained my trust?  What might they have done to reach within my sadness?  How would I have learned to trust and share?
