My favourite thing about a change in season is getting to switch up my makeup. Now that summer feels well and truly over, and Autumn is fast approaching I thought I'd share with you my go to everyday makeup for the A/W months. (All products used linked below)

A dark lip is my favourite thing to do and is sure to be a huge trend this season. Pairing it with a simple winged liner and slightly bolder eyebrows makes for a perfect, quick and simple everyday look.
