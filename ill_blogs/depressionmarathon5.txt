One of my fears about returning to running was injury. Specifically, I was worried that my weak left leg would alter my gait, which could cause an injury somewhere else. And even though my left leg seems to have regained its strength, and even though I cannot detect a significant alteration in my gait or running form, I seemingly have an injury to my right knee. I think I may have torn my medial meniscus.

My knee has been sore off and on for about a month, worse after running, but not so sore that I can't run. In fact, it doesn't hurt when I'm running, and my running is going well. Unfortunately, there have been a few occasions, the day after a run, when my knee has painfully locked up. That's the sign of a meniscus tear. I've been able to manually mobilize my knee, free it up quickly, and go about my day each time. Good thing I'm a physical therapist.

I was hoping to nurse myself through this, or that somehow it would magically heal itself, but I guess it's time to call the doctor. If the meniscus is torn, it's a relatively simple arthroscopic procedure to fix it. I'd rather take care of it now before it gets worse or I cause myself another problem. However, as long as it doesn't hurt while running, and it doesn't feel like it is getting worse, I'm not planning to quit running. Maybe that's asking for trouble, but that's me being a runner.

I am planning to call my orthopedic doctor tomorrow. Hopefully he can take a look at me soon, and I guess we'll go from there. I'm a little frustrated, but like I said, this is hopefully a pretty minor injury which can be fixed. I'm still looking toward running a marathon again early this summer. That's my goal. I need that goal to keep moving forward. I want to make it all the way back. I need to make it all the way back. This, I hope, will only be a small bump in a long road.
