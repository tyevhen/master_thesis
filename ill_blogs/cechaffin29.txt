My Heart


O my heart if you were not my heart--
But--you are, you are, you are, you are!
Were I not stuck in orbit Iâ€™d depart
This bed of tears for some far frozen star
Where from a throne of ice I might survey
All human feeling as not worth my notice,
My heart like steel, my eyes Athena gray
With wisdom, not compassion, only justice.
There I might judge the love you used to slay
My dragon nature as a dangerous thing,
An interruption of the world of play,
A diminution of my alpha being.
Still I cannot renounce this blessed earth
While you remain to lend the planet worth.


Namaste,
