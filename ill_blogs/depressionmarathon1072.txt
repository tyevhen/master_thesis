Today was the first day of the next 18 weeks; 18 weeks which will culminate in Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, MN. For my long-time readers, this will be deja vue all over again. Last year at this time, I began training for the Grandma's half marathon, a.k.a. The Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon. While that was a semi-success, The Twin Cities Marathon which followed was a huge DNF disappointment. Perhaps that DNF is what's scaring me about taking on Grandma's in 18 weeks.

Setting goals is always risky, maybe more so when illness is part of daily life. As was my goal last October at Twin Cities, I'd like to qualify for Boston. How will I feel if I don't meet that expectation again? Will my leg hold up, or will injury slow me down again? Do I want to take the risk, or do I want to let my apprehension hold me back? Finally, and most importantly, do I want to put in the amount of work required to not only finish the race but finish in 3:45? Perhaps that's the biggest question.

Today was the first time I've run since the first week of my 40 days of yoga class. I didn't miss it. The yoga was more than enough. In fact, I think the core strength I gained during yoga will serve me well while running. However, I'm not looking forward to the training. That's the first time I've ever said that. On my first three miles today, I couldn't wait for it to be done. It's going to be very difficult to train properly if every 3 miles feels like ten. Starting over is always difficult, and I hope that's the only thing happening here.

It's tough to train if training is unappealing. It's even tougher if training is drudgery. Since I'm starting anew, I'm going to push through for at least three weeks before making any long-term decisions. Today the goal is a 3:45 at Grandma's Marathon in 18 weeks. I'll keep you posted. In the meantime, any words of encouragement or experience would be greatly appreciated!
