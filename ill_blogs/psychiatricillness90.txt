I have just read through my posts for the last month. When I getreally low I do get a bit delusional and paranoid. I was convinced someone would read my blog and no it was me. I was also so convinced that my line management hated me, I was a nuisance to the department and they were trying to upset me as much as possible in the hope I would resign. It seems a bit silly now but I was so upset and wanted to know what I had done wrong. In reality nothing had changed.

I still feel my ex-boss is a total idiot. I have managed not to even make eye contact with him all week. I feel so much better. I think it is just a personality clash but as I do not report to him any more I don't think I will make the effort to be civil anymore. I will say good morning and be totally professional when we need to work together. I will not try and help him at all or try to make him understand when he gets the wrong idea. He is no longer my problem as I am no longer his.

I feel released as I no longer care for what he thinks of me, he can do and say what he likes now and as I no longer have one ounce of respect for him, I don't think I care!! I have got more from my new supervisor in 2 weeks than he has given me in 12 months!

My blog may vanish again tomorrow, I've been up and down so much I don't know where I am. Today I feel calm tho' and this is the first time for quite a long time.

I've missed everyone, I hope you all come back...
