Guess what? Guess what? I'm nominated in the category of Best Teen Girl Blog in the Homeschool Blog Awards!! I am very flattered, and want to give a hearty THANKS to the peeps who nominated me! I greatly appreciate it. :-)

Oh, oh, and you should DEFINITELY check out the Best Unschooling Blog category! There are soo many wonderful blogs on that list that I had trouble choosing which one to vote for...

EDIT: After I'd already posted this, I discovered another unschooling blog hidden in a different category, and that was Eli Gerzon's Worldschooler Blog, in the Current Events, Opinions or Politics category. Go vote for that too! ;-)

Anyway, thanks again! *Happily dances off*

Peace,
Idzie
