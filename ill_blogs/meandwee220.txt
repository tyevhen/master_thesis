Born on Saturday January 14, 2012 at 1:59pm
3 weeks early!
7 pounds, 12 ounces.....20.5 inches long



We are home now and resting...acclimating and healing. We are in love with our little fella!! He's quite dreamy, sweet and lovely. I know I'm in the first week honeymoon stage so I'm enjoying the peace while I can! :)
I'll be back soon with his birth story!

Chris even caught the tear in my eye! Way to go honey! lol


Yummy! He scarfed his meal right in.


Happy Daddy!


Noah and his parents. He's happy to be with us before he thinks we're lame.


Mama's Boy


Paige is beyond elated about her brother. All she talks about is Baby Noah.


She's so proud.


Nana and Grampa Cassidy watched Paige for us while we were away and enjoyed their first visit!


Getting another peek before my sleeping pill kicked in.


Morning snuggle


Ready to brave the New England winter. Warm enough?


Look how cute!


Paige adores him already.


Maren is concerned and protective and sweet to him.


See you here soon!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this journey with us! I'm excited to share how we move forward.
