I'm not sure how to answer that, but I did tried things like hypnosis, NLP, CBT and many others before I decided to give cipralex a chance...

if you're not feeling good about taking it you should try those things first, because sometimes it really helps, in my case it was a waste of time and money... and the worse was that i did not get better...

Now I can sure notice the change.
