February in coming now… I’ve been off the pills since November 1st , that means I’m off it for about three months. Three months and counting… Haven't had a lot of time to write to you guys, sorry about that.
I think I finally reached a point where I dont need it any more... at least for the time being. Still got some pills packages left...i'm going to throw them away in couple of days... Apparently the best place to stop taking cipralex is thailand... lol... I've had some rough weeks, getting really angry and arguing with people for nothing reasonable by I kept it together... always reminding me that this will happend...at least until the full effect of the pill will go away... I know its short but I will write again, and I got all of your questions to answer. just wanted to quick update you. take care. all is good now.
