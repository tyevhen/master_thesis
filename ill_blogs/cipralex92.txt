ok, I know many of you want to know more about this, so i've decided to post about it some basic pointers to consider, however the bottom line is this:

If you can't fall a sleep after taking cipralex you should take in first thing in the morning

If you get really tierd after you take it and feel like sleeping, take in at night.

thats my conclusion, whatever works for you - I take it in the morning anyways...
