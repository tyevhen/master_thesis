I heard a very telling story this morning on one of my favorite NPR radio programs...very telling, very sickening, and very sad. Use the following link to hear a story about Tommy Blake, a top NFL prospect until sidelined by mental illness. It is an excellent piece about his diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent comeback attempt, but be prepared to hear a sickening comment by a "top NFL scout" highlighting the ugly pervasiveness of stigma.

Tommy-
Stand tall, run fast, and hit hard!
And if you get a chance, pummel that "top NFL scout," for all of us!
Good luck.
