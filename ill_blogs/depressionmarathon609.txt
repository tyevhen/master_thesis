I'm home from my weekend away with D. We had a really nice time, which made up for the stressful drive there and back. My vehicle was acting up a bit, and it made for a tense drive. Every time I thought I had the problem licked, it would crop up again. I guess a trip to the mechanic is now on my to-do list.

Anyway, the weekend was really good. Yesterday we went to The Harley Davidson Museum. As a former motorcyclist, I really enjoyed that. Last night D took me out to a nice Italian restaurant in a a very hip section of the city. We had a fabulous dinner and then walked the streets and talked. I hadn't been treated to a romantic dinner in quite a few years, so that was also really nice.

The physical distance between us was a topic of conversation a couple of times during the weekend. We both acknowledged it was difficult. We have such a nice time when we're together, but building the relationship in fits and starts is not ideal. Unfortunately, that's the way it is right now. Fortunately, it is changeable. We ended up agreeing it was best to take things as they come, one day at a time. After all, fretting about how far apart we live won't do either of us, or our relationship, any good.

My mood remains good. I'm sure being doted on over the weekend was helpful. Puck and I are now settling back into our home and routine. He's already asleep on his bed, and that's exactly where I'm headed--bed. Sweet dreams.
