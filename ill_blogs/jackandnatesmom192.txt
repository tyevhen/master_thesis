This morning while Jack and I were walking to the bus stop, he reached over, grabbed my hand, and said "I love you mommy".  Swoon.  I am so thankful that this boy still wants to hold his mommy's hand sometimes.  And I'll be honest and say that it's moments like these that make up for him screaming "stop or I'll shoot" when I give him his shot in the morning. His smile has the power to melt me and John instantly.  Really, almost anyone, he is a beautiful child.


 
That smile hasn't changed- not one bit.  And this gorgeous boy is going to turn SIX on Sunday.  I have been a mommy for 6 years???  Totally. In. Denial.
