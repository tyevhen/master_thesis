This is some more notes I wrote in those days...

*seems like i like more types of music that i got tired of long time ago...funny....

*Meeting with the doc, he asked me if i think we should increase the dosage, i said i don't know...i'll see what's up with this in a week or two, from one side I don't want to take any pills at all, but from the other hand they help alot....

*went to get the pills today, i hate doing that, always makes me feel like a freak.... however my appetite is back...



*went out tonight, went to a pub with friend drank some beers and whisky, was ok, also set a meeting with a stylist...dunno why but i did...
always wanted to...never had the gutz...

*side effects are, gone, do i need to increase the dosage??? i think the doctor think i should, but we decided to wait 1 more month...

*i sure feel better than a month before, but still not there...

*its getting better all the time... good song....
