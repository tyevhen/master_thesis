After not writing anything on this blog for over ten days, I figured I should let readers know I'll have no internet access for a week.  Instead of at home, I'll be in an apartment in town with a group of friends, hanging out for what will hopefully be a very pleasant week. 

I'm afraid I don't have much to say right now, and even if I did, I don't have time to say it, since I haven't finished packing yet!  Sure, I could make a trip or two home during the week, but I'd rather spend my time with friends, not driving/bussing into the suburbs to pick up stuff from home.

Now, is there anything else I should add?  Hmm, well, as of yesterday, I'm not longer a teenager.  I have left those years behind me forever.  Seems a bit weird still, actually, though it doesn't feel nearly as horrifyingly momentous as I feared it would!  It wasn't a bad day at all, when I turned 20.  This is my birthday in pictures...

Me and mom.

Emi thinks wine & umbrellas go well together.
And, of course, there was cake.
...With candles.
Lit candles! (Don't you love the four scattered lighters needed for a few candles?)
Which, being the birthday gal, I proceeded to blow out.

Cake!

Gifts included the first two seasons of Supernatural (yay!), and the newest CD from Rise Against.  Plus some money put towards the aforementioned week long gathering, for which I leave tomorrow!

Organizing it has proved to be rather stressful, but I'm really hoping it'll be an enjoyable vacation.  Hanging out with friends and just chilling...  Getting away from a house that's in the middle of some major repairs thanks to some serious leakage...  It should be good.

And that is all!  I wish everyone a lovely week, and I hope to come back online in a week filled with fresh inspiration, and ready to finally overcome the huge writing block I've had for the last month!  I can hope, right?
