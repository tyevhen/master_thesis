I am all packed, house work done and ready to go - the taxi gets here in 10 minutes.
I will not post while I am away so next entry will be next weekend.

I am really looking forward to the trip but it is going to be hard work, I will have to be social and I will get tired. I hope people do not think I am weird.

I am sure it will be fine, I can talk about work. As long as I do not have to make too much small talk.
