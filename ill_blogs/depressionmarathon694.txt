It's Sunday, and I'm at work. I'm working at my supplemental job, which is inpatient orthopedic physical therapy. My day will not be over soon enough. I don't have particularly difficult patients, but I'm having a difficult time. I don't know how to explain it. It's an old, familiar feeling, and I don't like it.

I feel overwhelmed, even though there's nothing overwhelming taking place. I've had to step into a stairwell multiple times today to catch my breath and/or say a prayer. I like the stairwells. They are gray, solitary, concrete structures with little color nor variation; perfect for an overwhelmed physical therapist.

I don't like being so easily overwhelmed. This feeling takes me back to when I first transitioned off disability and returned to work. At that time, I was constantly stepping into stairwells, sometimes to cry, or settling myself in a dark, quiet, hospital corner for a break.

Over the years, I've gotten my confidence back. Feeling overwhelmed has lessened. I've been able to work like a "normal" person. But today, it's back. I'm anxious, overwhelmed, and filled with dread. I really want to go home and go straight to bed. Curled up with the covers over my head seems the only safe place right now. And I hate that.

I hate feeling like I'm going to go to pieces at any moment. I hate the dread. Not sure I have the energy to put a smile on my face or intelligence in my voice, I dread approaching each patient. I hate that, too. This is all quite exhausting and without sense. I'm tired. I'm overwhelmed. I just want to go home. But I've got patients waiting to see me, so off I go.
