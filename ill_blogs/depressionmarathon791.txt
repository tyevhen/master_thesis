I'm on my way north to the triathlon. My brothers and I are teaming up for a relay. My youngest brother was a state qualifying swimmer in multiple events, so he's obviously doing the swimming (0.8 miles) portion. I'm the only one with a bike, so that's my responsibility (20+ miles). And my other brother was an awesome runner--not sure how he's doing these days--so he's running (5 miles) the last leg. We're entered into the "silver" division. That means we're old! It should be fun, and I'm really looking forward to it.

It's been a long time since my brothers and I teamed up in anything. In fact, it's probably been since Little League Baseball since we've done any sporting activity together! We're not the closest family, and being the only girl of four siblings, I often end up feeling isolated from the guys. So this is actually kind of special. I hope it goes well. I think we may have a good chance of placing, but I'm going to focus on having fun and spending quality time with my brothers.

It will also be nice to be back up in my home area. I'm from the most beautiful part of Minnesota (in my humble opinion), and I miss it terribly. I almost always feel peaceful when I'm up there. Peace may be harder to come by on this trip, as I'm staying with my brother's family. Two young, very active children in a small space does not always lend itself to peaceful moments. Hopefully, I'll be able to get away for just a bit to gather my head. If I can do that, this will be a particularly good trip. Wish me luck! I'll let you know how everything turns out.
