Hi friends!
I'm sorry I've been away from this space! Time has gotten away from me. Also, Paige has finally shown an interest in grabbing on tops of tables and surfaces so we've been having to be more vigilant and child proof more things. She also has started opening drawers and cabinets, so I've been needing to secure many of those things too. She never cared and then one day she just decided to explore the world she couldn't see. Look Mom! This cleaner looks cool! "Comet"...hmm...it seems so powdery! And look! Maren's dog biscuits! This tastes a little funny...not like my normal graham cracker treats....Anyway, I'm much busier than before. :)
I hope you have a great weekend! Saturday is our photo shoot of Paige in her nursery as our contest winning...we're excited. Bummed that it will be pouring rain outside and there won't be a bright sunny light in the room, but that's life. I'll keep you posted if I'm allowed to show any of the photos.
I'll leave you with these photos of Paige. That skirt kills me.
