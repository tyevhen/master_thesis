If you're a regular here, you may have already noticed a few additions to my site. With the kind assistance of Blog Angel's very informative three part series on plagiarism, I was able to add several protections to my site. These protections don't guarantee that another idiot won't scrape my material again, but hopefully I've taken steps to make it a little more difficult.

I spent three hours this morning researching and then applying these steps. First, I finally got myself a Creative Commons License which delineates exactly what others can and can't do with my work. Then I added my blog to My Free Copyright.com. My free copyright is a free service where you can register your blog. Once registered, My Free Copyright uses my feed to create a digital fingerprint of my content and e-mails it back to me. By doing this, I have a third party dating and time stamping my original content. (I'm not a techie, so I suggest you check out the site for a much better explanation!) Lastly, I began using a service called Tynt Insight. Tynt Insight automatically adds a link back to my original content with every paste. As I understand it, if somebody copies and pastes material from this blog into their own sham blog, my material will be linked back to my blog, which identifies me as the author. Sounds too cool to work, doesn't it? I'm amazed what people can do with computer code! So that's it. That's what I've done so far. Hopefully, these steps will protect me from having to deal with unethical jerks again!
