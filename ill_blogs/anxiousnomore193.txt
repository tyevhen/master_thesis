Yep, my hubby got fired this week from his job. The stress is horrible. So many thoughts race through your head. What are we going to do for money? What can I do to comfort him? What kind of changes are we going to have to make to our budget? Are we going to have to move? Am I handling this the right way? Should I be angry? The list goes on...

Also, I think this would be a great time for him to go back to school, but he is still deciding. I have told him my thoughts several times, but I can only nag so much and its his life. Its so much easier for me to say what to do when I don't have to do it.

So for now we will see what happens. Honestly I think its a blessing because the company he worked for was horrible and didn't appreciate his hard work at all. Plus now he can hopefully find something he loves doing or like I said, finish school. I have tried to be very supportive and loving. I have tried not to worry too much because I know he can find another job easily if he needs one soley to pay the bills. Its still stressful though. I am not sleeping well lately at all.

My latest favorite song on the radio is by Sara Bareiles, called Love Song and the first few lines of the lyrics are,
" Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that"
Hits home right about now.

Has anyone ever had a spouse in this same position, and if so, how did you handle it?
