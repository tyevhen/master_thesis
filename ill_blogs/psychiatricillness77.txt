I have had a lovely weekend. Last night I went out for dinner and then on to see Avatar in 3D. It was the first cinema 3D film I have seen. I was sitting right on the front row and it was a bit close, still it was a great film.

Today I went out for sunday lunch at the social club followed by a French film, "the grocer's son". Tomorrow I plan to go to the pub for a lecture on "Global Shipping". These lectures are very popular and they have a very good reputation. I'm looking forward to it.

My television broke down about two weeks ago and I think it is doing me some good. I may notfix it or replace it ;o).
