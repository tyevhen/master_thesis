5 Ways to procrastinate when you have escaped the Internet and handcuffed yourself to a Starbuck’s table:

1. Eavesdrop on the baristas’ conversation (Right now they are talking about how the song “Hallelujah” comes from the movie Shrek. It doesn’t, but it was featured on the soundtrack.)

2. Stare at coffee mugs. Wish wasn't unemployed & had $$ for frivolous purchases (Clearly $9 coffee mugs are frivolous, whereas $5 coffees in disposable cups are not)

3. Listen to the music. Really listen. Ponder which is favorite version of the song “Hallelujah”: Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright or the dumb kid who covered it on American Idol?

4. Turn off cell phone so as not to be distracted

5. Write this blog
