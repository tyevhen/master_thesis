I know I am a few days late, but I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year from our family to yours! I hope you all had a wonderful Holiday and have a promising outlook for Twenty Ten.

This past year of the Reality of Anxiety has been greater than I ever imagined and mostly because of you all. You truly are the motivation that keeps me trying to improve and blogging. So, to the Readers of the Reality of Anxiety, I'd just like to say....

Thank you for simply stopping by
Thank you for the motivating and kind comments
Thank you for inspiring me to try new things
Thank you for your input and inquiries
Thank you for spreading hope
Thank you for participating in all of my ventures
Thank you for creating friendships
Thank you for just being you.

Happy New Year!

Love,
Aimee, Tyler, and Peyton
