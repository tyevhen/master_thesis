After a hiatus, I am fostering again.

We have gotten 2 kittens of a litter of 9.  I wonder if they are all the same litter as some look definitely bigger than others.

There were two female cats, monther and daughter.  Maybe they were both pregnant and gave birth a week or two apart.  I know a cat can have a lot of kittens but it must be hard to feed so many.  I figure two moms double the milk.


On top of the first two, there is Fancy, rescued from a dump and two more kittens, Pebbles and Bam Bam.



Anyways, here are some pictures.




Anyways so tell them apart

Charlie is the grey and grey tabby
Coco is the all black girl
Fancy is the long haired calico
Pebbles is the short haired dilute calico
BamBam is the long haired Orange and white



***Update, August 8, 2012.  All the kittens have found forever homes.
