I have a pretty exciting, scary, and overwhelming project I've just recently decided to take on...

For a while now, I've thought it would be great to have a freedom based education (unschooling and freeschooling, basically) conference here, and so I've decided to go past the thinking about stage and onto the actually doing it stage!  So I've been brainstorming with a couple of people, have sent a call out for people interested in helping organize and run this event, and am just generally getting the ball rolling!

In some ways, it seems a pretty strange decision to make, seeing as the slump I was in for a couple weeks after getting back from SMUG was caused largely by my feeling overwhelmed.  But I know it's the right thing to do, because as soon as I decided I was going to go through with it, my mood lifted and I just felt so free and happy!  I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be write now.

So it's exciting.  But yes, still most definitely scary!

I don't have much to add to that, though I do want to apologize for having neglected this blog a lot lately.  Inspiration will hit again soon, I hope, and until then you have a few updates on my goings on as well as a couple more exciting guest posts to look forward to!

Peace,
Idzie

P.S. If you're local and want to help out with this conference, or at the very least find out more, please send me an email at open.eyed.slave@gmail.com.  And if you're further away but have ideas or experience to share, I'd also be very happy to hear from you!
