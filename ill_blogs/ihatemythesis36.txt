So you probably think my parents were a little over-indulgent for flying me home at 2-hours' notice. And you probably think I'm over-dramatic for going on and on about my unhappiness when I've been given every opportunity in the world to have a master's degree. Well, you're either partly or completely right.

I am a rich, lucky, spoiled American who can quit a job to be a full-time student without sacrificing a $5-a-day coffee habit. And that makes me both the scum of the earth and exactly like every other student on my campus. So am I redeemed by my pseudo-liberal guilt? I don't know. Could that get me into heaven? Maybe, ... if I can still afford a good lawyer at the end of this.

But, dear readers, as somebody in the bible once said, "To whom more is given, more is expected." And for how much I've been given, I have a universe of expectations to fulfill. And since I'm so far not producing a good return, I get a little depressed sometimes. OK, signing off. I gotta go dig some talents out of the hole I was storing them in.
