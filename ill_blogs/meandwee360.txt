Hi friends!
I'm sorry about the silence...I had my surgery on Monday and have been recovering and was sick as a dog on Tuesday as result of the anesthesia. It was like the worst sea-sickness ever with a horrible migraine. I couldn't even lift my head! Things are looking up though and I'm able to move around and do what I need to. The doc said the procedure went great and I should see good results. Of course, I have about 2 months before I can have any clue to that, so we shall see. Thanks for all the wonderful emails and well-wishes!
