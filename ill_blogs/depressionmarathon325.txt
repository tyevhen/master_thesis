Short post today, as my mood has taken a dive. Things are very dark today. My energy is low. My thoughts are negative and slow. It's difficult to move. It's been a long day. I'm counting on this being a temporary crash. I have to believe that. I can't fathom going back to where I've recently been. I will not. Despite my hopelessness, lethargy, and fatigue, I've been trying to move. It took two attempts, but I did get a short run in today. And I'm right now preparing to go to an AA meeting, despite the fact that being around people may be downright painful. I can't go backwards. There is just too much to lose. I pray my efforts will pay off and my mood will bounce back soon.
