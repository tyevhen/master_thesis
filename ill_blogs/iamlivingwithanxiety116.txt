A useful concept my current counselor taught me is to consider, What way is the train heading? When you're anxious, it's easy to lose sight of your progress. It's easy to feel defeated.

Yet recovery is a journey. Anxiety usually doesn't develop overnight, so neither will problems dissipate as quickly as we would hope. So consider where you are in your recovery process—are you taking healthy steps to feel better? If so, you probably are headed in the right direction.

Your "train" may slow down at times, but with hard work you can keep it chugging toward your destination—a healthier, less anxious life. It's not easy to stop, let alone turnaround, a train, so if you stay on track, you will reach your goal.
