I had really good intentions of sticking to routine tonight, I was going to come home, check my email and then go for a walk in the park. I was going to come home cook, have a bath and get to bed at a sensible time.

I have spent 2 hours online (whoops!) It is 8:30 aleady. I have registered with Social Anxiety UK (see Social Anxiety link on the left). That is where I found a link to the blogg below. I can still get to bed by 10pm. I still do not think I am hypomanic as I can do 8hours straight without it entering my head that it is a possibility, like the selective mutism entries below.

Work is going really well, my boss is giving me loads of positive feedback and he has said my interim review will be really good so I don't have to worry. Of course I am still asking myself whether he is just trying to build my confidence.

I have also volunteered for the interdepartmental football team :o)!! I am really looking forward to it! They have not got enough players yet so fingers crossed that we will get a team together!

OK I am going to practise some self discipline - Dinner + jobs - wash up then - bath and bed!!!
