This week I had an opportunity to put my Recovery skills into practice during a meeting. Someone was chewing his gum very loudlyâ€”smacking his lips and making more noise than I cared for. Then I glanced at my Recovery tools worksheet and noticed that Dr. Low said that people do things that annoy us, not necessarily to annoy us. That helped put the situation in perspective! I certainly didn't need a burst of temper at a Recovery meeting :) .
