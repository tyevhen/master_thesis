Hello again,
Hope all is well with you all, here's a quick update of what happened lately…
Well first of all I feel even better, I'm starting to rediscover myself and the world around me in a fun , entertaining way.
I'm dating this girl that I'm starting to really like…but too soon to make the call if it actually is, I'm having fun anyways.



The side effects are a far away memory and hardly notice I take cipralex in term of the side effects.
Still sometimes I have difficulties to wake up or to fall a sleep but its no big deal, probably because of the beers here and there.
I will keep you posted. Take care now.
