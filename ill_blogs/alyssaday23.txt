Well, it's nearly 9pm so Valerie's guest post will be a Thursday giveaway, because I figured most of you were busy Halloweening!  We had a great time here, but nothing as exciting as Halloween in Japan on the Navy base.  We had hundreds of little Japanese munchkins--all wide-eyed with excitement over their first trick or treat experience!


Daisy the pug pumpkin was the star of many, many families' Halloween photos!


This year Daisy was a pumpkin again, but we have added Rescue Dog Riley to the mix:

Happy Halloween from my family to yours! 

hugs, Alyssa
