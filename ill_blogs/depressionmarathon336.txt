I'm not sure if it's a weekend hangover (no worries, I don't mean the alcohol induced kind!), or if it's medication side effects, or if it's secondary to marathon training, but I have been wiped out this week. While I've been getting my training runs accomplished, I've not had the energy for much else, and in fact have been sleeping a ton--day and night. I have not been able to keep my eyes open. It's been strange and a little concerning.

I did see my doctor yesterday, and she confirmed some of the fatigue might be due to medication side effects, but she didn't want to change anything at this time. I understand that. The decrease in the "fat med" (that is, the medication with the weight gain side effect) a few weeks ago has made a big difference. I lost more than two pounds in the last ten days. That's exciting, but now it appears we may have to deal with fatigue, too. We'll see how the weekend goes.

I actually have a race scheduled for this weekend. I will be off to run a half marathon early tomorrow morning. It's part of my marathon training schedule. I have no idea what to expect, as I have not raced since August, and I've certainly been through a lot since then! Despite my anxiety about racing, I'm also looking forward to it, as it will give me a lot of information about my current level of  fitness. I'll let you know how it goes.

In addition to my return to racing, I have another big return to report. I was given the go-ahead yesterday to begin my return to work. My doctor and I discussed a gradual return, hopefully a couple of four hour shifts per week. I'm looking forward to getting back at it. I miss my co-workers and my patients. And I miss the meaningful activity work provides. I'm looking forward to my return.
