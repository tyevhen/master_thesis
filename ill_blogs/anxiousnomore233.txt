If anyone is looking for a quick encouraging message I have a couple websites that are a must see:

http://your.phobias.willbedefeated.com

and this next one you have to fill in part of it (for unpersonalized version just click the link otherwise type in the address as needed in your address bar):

http://[type in your firstname].[type in your last name].youaremighty.com

Doesn't that make you feel so much better?

Thanks Ben for showing these to me. They made my day.

UPDATE: Apparently neither of these links take you to those sites anymore. If anyone knows if they exist elsewhere, I would love to know where they went. Thanks!
