Yup they are coming fast!

Holidays are not amazing things for people like me.  I am making an effort, spending money even though I have a special levy and need new tires.  Oh well, what's more debt?

I'll celebrate on the 21 with my kids and do Xmas with the rest of my family.  Both will be minimal.

I have decorated.  Done a tree, lights outside, some things here and there.  Made an effort.

My mom will be visiting with her friend, she will be here for a few days.

Then I have to get ready to go back to work even though it terrifies me.  I am not ready to serve the public quite yet but my leave is at an end.  Just thinking about it makes me shake.  I am such a wimp.

I've changed a few things around the house, pictures, decorations.  Make it more homey, somewhat.

I don't have much to say yet say too much.  Takes talent to do that!  I am working on correcting that.

So that being said, I'll leave it at that, having said already too much.

Thanks for reading.
