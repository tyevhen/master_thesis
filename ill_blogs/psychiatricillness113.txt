I keep imagining ways to end it all but that's not what I want. I have just had a bath and got dressed. I just feel clean and miserable now. I don't want to go back to work, I can't face it. Hopefully I will feel better by Monday.

I think I will just try and clear up and do some laundry today. It is probably better than doing nothing. It might keep my mind occupied. I liked being physically ill it kind of gave my mind a rest. My mind needs a kick start now as the emptyness leaves a void for the negative thoughts to sneak in. There are many many negative thoughts at the moment too. Mainly regarding my ability at work.
