I have a pile of new goodies for sale in my shop. I'm on a roll, people! (*fist pump*)


Owl decor...I love this for the rustic-chic look. Great for an owl/woodland nursery theme too!

Deer decor...good for that same rustic-chic look. And another winner for a woodland/forest themed nursery!

My brother said this to his girlfriend on Facebook on her birthday once. I then asked to make a painting for her using the phrase and got permission from him to use it in my shop.

This was my attempt at a Valentine's Day card that a man might want to get. Right?


If you're so inclined, you can find me in all these places. Let's hang out!
