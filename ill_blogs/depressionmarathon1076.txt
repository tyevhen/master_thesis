Thirty six days ago I could do this...




Today I can do this...


and this...


and most incredibly, THIS...


Just one hour per day for 36 days.

We can do anything if we put our minds to it, don't you think? I've grown physically, mentally and spiritually because I made one simple decision and then took action based on that decision. So simple...so profound.
What decision could you make to change your life today? What actions have you yet to take? If I can do this, you can do anything, too. Think about it.
