I had a great day in New York today! I cried, actually cried, when the starting line came into view for the first time. After the start I kept my head up and my eyes open. I looked around, paid special attention to each neighborhood we ran through, enjoyed every moment, and ran well to boot! I finished in 3:51:30.

It was tough to run with a consistent or quick pace through the first 15 miles, as the streets were quite crowded. As a result, I ran a massive negative split, meaning I ran the second half faster than the first. I ran 1:57:15 through 13.1 miles, which equates to a 3:54:30 finish time for the full 26.2. It's every marathoner's goal to run a negative split, but I didn't have such expectations today, which made the surprise negative split even more fun!

At mile 16, after coming off the very long, very uphill, Queensboro Bridge; my slowest mile of the entire day, I realized I was feeling good so I went for it. I felt good and ran well through mile 23, at which point I was certain I was going to finish (and shed a few more tears). From that point forward I hung on for the ride. The last 3 miles were tough but powerful, I maintained my pace, passed a lot of runners, and shed more than a few tears at the finish line.

I don't remember if I've ever before cried at a marathon. I was truly overcome with emotion today, and that was totally okay. I deserved it. It's been a long haul getting back here. So I cried. But I also smiled more, waved more, said thank you more (to volunteers, military and police officers), and generally enjoyed myself more today than I have at previous marathons. It was a good day.
