[I prepared the following testimony in Swahili and English to be able to share my simple conversion story with the people in Kenya.]

Kutoka mwanzo wa maisha yangu nilijua ya kwamba familia yangu ilinipenda.  Nilipenda kuwa na wakati mzuri na baba na mama wangu  na hatat babu wangu.  From the very beginning of my life I knew that my family loved me.  I loved spending time with my dad and mom and with my grandparents.  Kutoka kwao niliweza kufahamu vitu vyilivyo na maana maishani na pia maana kamili ya kupata upendo/kupendwa.  Pia niliweza kufahamu ya kwamba kulikuwa na mtu maishani mwao ambaye alikuwa kiini cha uhai na chanzo cha upendo waliokuwa nao, hii kuwa Mungu. From them I learned about the important things in life and what it meant to be loved.  I also learned that there was someone in their life that was their reason for living and the source of the love they had, which was God.
Siku moja milipokuwa msichana mdogo nilikuwa nikipumzika kwenye sofa nikitazama paa la nyumba.  Nikaanza kufikiri kuhusu Mungu na yote niliyofahamu/funzwa kuhusu Yeye nyumbani na hata kanisani.  One day when I was still a small girl, I was lying on the couch staring at the ceiling.  I started thinking about God and what I had learned about Him at home and at church.  Nikafikiri kuhusu dunia na mimi.  Nilijua ya kwamba Mungu alinipenda.  Mamangu alikuwa amenifunza kuimba nyimbo "Yesu anipenda" wakati wowote nilipokuwa na uwoga.  Nilifahamu pia ya kwamba nilifanya vity vilivyo fanya Mungu dhaifu/kuhisi vibaya.  I thought about the world and about me.  I knew that God loved me.  My dad had taught me to sing "Jesus loves me" whenever I was afraid.  I also understood that I did things that made God sad.  Ijapokuwa nilikuwa msichana mzuri lakini nilitenda dhambe.  Biblia inasema "Kwa sababu wote wamefanya dhambi na kupungikiwa na utukufu wa Mungu". (Warumi 3:23)  Hatahivyo nilijua ya kwamba Yesu, mwana kamili wa Mungu alikuja duniani na akafa msalabani kwa ajili ya dhambi yangu.  Although I was a good girl, I still sinned.  The Bible says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23)  However, I knew that Jesus, God's perfect Son, came to Earth and died on the cross for my sins.  Pia nilifahamu ya kwamba alikuja tena akiwa uhai akashida kifo ili nikimuamini na kumpa maisha yangu nitaishi na yeye milele mbinguni.  I also knew that He came alive again conquering death so that, if I believed in Him and gave my life to Him, I would live with Him forever in heaven. Biblia inasema ya kwamba "Kwa maana jinsi hii Mungu aliupenda ulimwengu hata adamtoa mwanawe pekee ili kila amuaminie asipotee bali awe naa uzima wa milele." (Johana Mtakatifu 3:16)   The Bible says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." (John 3:16)  Nilifurahi sana hata nikakimbia kwa mamangu nakumueleza hiyo uumbe mpya.  Alinichukua na sote wawili tukapiga magoti kando ya kitanda changu na nikaomba baada yake ombi (kama) kili: "Mungu mpendwa najua ya kwamba nimetende dhambe na kukufanya uwe na udhaifu."  I was so happy that I ran to my mom and told her the good news.  She then knelt with me beside my bed, and I followed her in a prayer something like this: "Dear God, I know that I have sinned and have made you sad.  Naamimi ya kwamba Yesu alikufa na akafufuka tena kisha adachukua dhambe zangu.  Tafadhali nisamehe na njoo rohoni mwangu.  Asante sana kwa kunipenda.  Katika jina la Yesu, Amina.  I believe that Jesus died and rose again to take away my sins.  Please, forgive me and come into my heart.  Thank you for loving me.  In Jesus name, Amen."
Wakati huo Yesu alija maishani mwangu.  At that moment, Jesus came into my life.
