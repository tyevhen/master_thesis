I am staying at home today, I have had a really good nights sleep and I even took an afternoon nap yesterday.  Maybe my body just needs time to adjust after taking quetiapine for several years.  The quetiapine made me sleep 10 to 12 hours per night, sometimes longer so it makes sense that 8 hours will not be enough during the transition.  I took an extra 25mg of quetiapine yesterday as I could not settle and sit still.

I am staying at home today, maybe do a little work from home once I start to get bored.  I think I could go back to sleep right now :o)!
