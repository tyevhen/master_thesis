It is the end of February. The poor month that is infamously known as the longest (though numerically shortest) month of the year. February gets such a bad rap.

Let's celebrate the coming of March with a little giveaway, shall we? I have a feeling that, despite the fact that the first of March is only a few days away, we will still have a fair share of blustery, wintery days. So who would like to win a handmade wooly gift? A "thank you" from me to you.

This infinity scarf is hand crocheted by moi. It's made with a blend of lamb's wool and acrylic. It's very chunky, very long, very soft, and very warm. It can be worn wrapped twice (as in the above pictures) or even three times.

So how do you enter?
