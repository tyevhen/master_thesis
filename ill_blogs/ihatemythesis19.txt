I wish I had gone to Coachella this weekend. I went last year. But that was my old life. This year, I stayed home and studied. (And still managed to be three days late on a deadline.) In honor of the missed music festival, I feature one of the bands that played. What have you missed out on for your education?


The Verve - Blue
I don't know if they played this at Coachella, cause I wasn't there.
