According to Online University Reviews, the Reality of Anxiety ranks in as number 62 on their list of the Top 100 Mental Health and Psychology Blogs! They have it broken down into different categories of mental health, with only 3 blogs dedicated to Anxiety. The first is Anxiety Insights, then The Reality of Anxiety, followed by We Worry: A Blog for the Anxious which you can also find in my blog roll.

I thought you may also want to take a look at it if you are interested in other topics such as Depression, Bipolar Disorder, or more. For most, depression and anxiety go hand in hand.

With so much stress in my life and so much worrying going on, its nice to celebrate the small victories when I can!

UPDATE: It appears that this website has also made the Top 100 Fascinating Brain Blogs List, woo hoo!
