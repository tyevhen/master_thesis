So you all know about my long-term battle with fatigue and my more recent concern with weight gain. Both depression symptoms significantly and negatively impact my running. I am tremendously satisfied to report to you that I feel better. I am less fatigued, and I've lost some weight. Running is becoming fun again. I began taking a new supplement a couple weeks ago, and I think I have the supplement to thank for these changes.

I already buy, use and love this company's juice. (Actually, I became a distributor in order to get the juice cheaper.) Their juice totally solved my IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). They came out with this supplement several months ago, but being a skeptic--despite my success with their juice--I waited, and waited, and waited. A million positive testimonials later, I finally took the plunge and decided to try it. Well, I'm no longer a skeptic.

I'm no longer a skeptic because the supplement seems to work. I took the company's 'vigor' test, and after two weeks on this supplement my 'vigor' score rose from a 7 to an 18. I can't believe the difference in how I feel. I really can't. After discussion with my psychiatrist (let me repeat that: after discussion with my psychiatrist) I discontinued the anti-fatigue med I've felt so ambivalent about taking. Yes, the anti-fatigue med is now gone. Even without that med, I feel more alert and energetic throughout my day. I've lost a couple pounds, and most importantly, my running has improved. My training runs have been quicker and easier. It's all rather surprising to a skeptic.

I'm still waiting to see if the results will last. I mean, I've been battling this fatigue for 3-4 years. I've been battling weight gain for at least 2 years. It will be a very pleasant surprise, and rather ironic, if the answer turns out to be a simple supplement. I certainly hope to continue feeling the way I feel today. It's such a relief! I'll keep you updated on my progress.
