I ran this morning! It's only the fourth time I've run since The Boston Marathon, and I could still feel Boston in my legs on those pesky downhills! I wanted to go 10 miles, as I need to begin training for Grandma's Marathon in June, and I made it 10.2 miles at a nice, quick pace. It was one of those feel-good runs. The weather was perfect, and I felt great. It was sure nice to be back out on the road.

I ran a hilly route. I guess I learned my lesson in Boston. I need to train more on the hills. Grandma's is a bit hilly. Like many marathons, there is a long, heartbreak hill right around mile 21. I've had to walk at least part of that hill the past couple of times I've run Grandma's. This year I'd like to conquer it in stride.

I'd like to have conquered this depression episode in stride as well, but it's still hanging onto me. I will have three more ECT treatments this week to try to shake it loose. I do feel better today. Yesterday was a long one, even though I began my day with my AA meeting, which was really nice. Apparently that meeting wore me out, because I slept for several hours once I returned. Obviously, I've got more energy today. Maybe depression's grip is loosening just a bit.
