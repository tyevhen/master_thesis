 I have some exciting news. I am announcing my very first giveaway on the Reality of Anxiety! This is the first of hopefully many giveaways to come.
I am really excited to announce that one lucky reader can win a free copy of the book The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Edmund J. Bourne. As I have said in the past, this book has been the greatest help to me personally in learning to manage my anxiety. The tools found in its pages can bring you so much clarity and peace. I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from any kind of anxiety or fears.
