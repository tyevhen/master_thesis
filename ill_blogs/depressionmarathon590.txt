I thought I was going home this morning. I had it all planned. I was going to finish my ECT course as an outpatient over the next two weeks, and I was going to return to part-time, part-time work on Wednesday, January 11th. Unfortunately, after a brief reprieve, I've been very low over the past two days. My mood absolutely tanked again, which meant returning home this morning was not the wisest thing to do. So here I am. It's been 8 days now, and I'm still here in the hospital.

It looks like I may go home tomorrow or Monday. It's most likely that I will have another ECT treatment Monday morning and then return home. I'm hoping for a mood rebound over the next couple days.

I'm facing some difficult choices once I leave, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the dip in mood. Most of the choices center around work and finances. Those are both triggers for me, so again, I shouldn't be surprised by the mood decline. Basically, I'm faced with the to-work or not-to-work decision. It's too complicated to explain at this time, but suffice it to say it is a very difficult decision to make. When things get clearer, I'll try to summarize it here. Right now, it's too overwhelming to write out.

I'm trying to remain hopeful. I'm trying to stay in the moment and have faith that everything will work out as it should. I'm trying to stand tall despite the battering this illness is currently inflicting upon me. I appreciate your thoughts, prayers and comments of support.
