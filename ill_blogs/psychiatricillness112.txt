I'm feeling a bit better today. I walked into town and finished my Christmas shopping. I still fill with dread and anxiety when I think about work. I think I will just try and knuckle down and think about practical tasks which I need to complete. I might make the list tomorrow so I will be focused on Monday morning.

I have taken out unemployment / redundancy cover for my mortgage. It is a bit of reassurance for some of the anxieties in my head.
