A full seven days prior to when I expected to, I was able to run painfree today! I got a new pair of shoes, donned the compression sleeve over my calf, and set out for a run at noon. I ran 8 miles, including six miles at my marathon pace, without pain. I'm really happy! We'll see how I feel tomorrow, but I think I'm back.

As I noted in my last post, I spent time with my new friend D. over the long weekend. Things went really well. It is too bad we live so far apart, but I'm hopeful. We have so many things in common, it's unbelievable. It seems we were meant for each other. It's nice to have the attention of someone special again. I've missed that.

My mood continues to be good. And I'm sure being able to run again will only help that continue. It's really amazing that I can feel so good within just a few months of feeling so low. Remember that time? It wasn't that long ago! I'm enjoying life right now, and that's really nice.

Feeling better reminds me depression can be conquered. It's temporary. I can't control when it throws a wrench into my routine, but I can control how I attack it. I'm glad I attacked. It didn't keep me down for as long as I feared it would. I'm grateful for that.
