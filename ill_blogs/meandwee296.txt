Paige had a great Halloween! A few days before, she got to celebrate at her Dad's work Halloween party for the kids. Last night, she went on her first Trick-or-Treat expedition with her friend Matthew. As you can see, she dressed as a little piglet. She even kept the costume on the whole time! Phew. I hope you had a great Halloween too!








Her first house she went to for her first Trick-or-Treat!
