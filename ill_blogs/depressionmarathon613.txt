I need to write.
I need to let you know,
I am still here.

I need to write.
I don't want you to worry.
I'm still moving.

I need to write.
Times may be tough, but
I've not given up.

I need to write.
I feel obligated
to stay on track.

I need to write.
Though I have not much to say,
I am still here.
