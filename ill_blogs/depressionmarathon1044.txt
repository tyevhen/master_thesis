The good news is my mouth, with it's new vacancy, hurts so much that I can't possibly focus on depression! OUCH! I wasn't planning on having a tooth pulled when I saw my dentist yesterday. It was supposed to be time for a crown. Unfortunately, I fractured the tooth during lunch on Wednesday. It was a wild, freaky, concrete piece of granola which lept out of my yogurt and doomed the tooth. As soon as I clamped down, I heard and felt an unnerving CRACK! Damn granola! Beware of unusually crunchy, stealth granola, readers!
