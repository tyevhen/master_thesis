Hey friends!
Today marks 39 weeks in my pregnancy! I went in to get checked out today and I've still made no progress...no dilation, no changes. SO, I am to head in this Thursday afternoon where they will insert the Cervidil and I'll spend the night as my cervix ripens. Friday morning, if labor hasn't begun from the Cervidil, I will be induced with Pitocin and then "have a baby." According to my doctor. :)
Looks like we'll have a baby in our May Day basket! My fingers are crossed that it will go ok. I know anything is possible, so I'm trying to not expect anything of certainty. Just that Little P. will arrive and be healthy. I've got a bunch of work to wrap up today, so I'll leave you with that. But I certainly have a lot of thoughts running through my brain and I'll have to check in with you tomorrow! The adrenaline that is running through my veins right now...well...I bet I could throw a schoolbus.
