Written by Cindy Boersma in her high school years

I sit alone on the back of a river
Longing to see your face
I peer through the warm heavy fog
Across the deep murky waters
and strain my eyes to the far shore

Was that you?

I call out your name
But you do not hear
The ruthless wind has whisked my pleading words away
I try again
But it's no use

Are you looking and calling too?

At my post on the bank of the river
I hope for the fog to clear
Friends come along and stop by my side
With confidence they point your way
I think I see a shadow of you

Is it enough to hold on to?

I want to see you
So I keep trying, seeking, calling, and crying
Until exhaustion takes its tole
From a fretful sleep I raise my head
The fog is rising over the water

Will I be able to see?

Just a cool mist remains
Over the river running by
Without hesitation I jump to my feet
I search the far shore
Until my longing eyes rest on your face

Were you there the whole time?

We reach toward each other
But find the distance still remains
I search your face for meaning
For something to grasp
For some hope to calm my fears

Are you searching too?

Do you know that I long to be with you again?

Can you understand my pain?

Can you sense my fears?

Or from such a distance
Can you tell the mist from the tears?

Can you tell the mist from the tears?
