Have'nt posted in a while, seems like things are just a little but better, but also little bit the same...
My doctor advised me to increase my dosage to 20 mg a day instead of 10 mg I'm taking so far.
I lost control of life again, at least this is what I feel.
I've been prosponing the dosage increasement for a while now...
but I guess it is time.



will keep you posted.
Cheers.
