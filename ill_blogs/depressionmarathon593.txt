Six years ago today, I took my last drink. It's another birthday for me. It's hard to imagine my life today had I not quit drinking. In fact, I doubt I would have a life today. It's much more likely I'd be dead. And even in the dark moments of these recent weeks, I know I am privileged to be leading the life I lead. I have safe housing, a healthy body, the time and ability to do things I love, a wonderful dog, a new relationship, and I'm surrounded by amazing friends and professionals who care about me. None of that would have been possible without sobriety. I'm humbled by and grateful for my sobriety today.
