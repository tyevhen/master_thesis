Yep, I take terrible selfies too when I get an awesome crane brooch for free, doesn't everyone?
Deciding to go to the inaugural Big Hearted Business conference last weekend was one of the best decisions I have made in my life thus far. I left it so inspired, brimming with ideas and reignited with passion for this cause that I care for so deeply. I can't wait to share more with you all, but at the moment it is still a little overwhelming. So much to process. While not all responses to my endometriosis awareness campaigning at the conference were positive (there were a few people still peddling the "you just need some spiritual healing, it's a manifestation of something wrong in your life" bollocks), there were a lot of women I met who had endometriosis (you're bound to at a conference of 200 women! 1 in 10, 1 in 10!!!) and were thrilled that I was shouting from the rooftops about it.

My mum and granny are also visiting me this weekend, and I've heard some good work news, so basically after a lot of hard months, I feel like I'm getting the passion up again. Watch this space!

Let me leave you with this quote, which I hope will convey how the conference inspired me:
