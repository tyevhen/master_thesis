To give something back to you, my supportive readers, I have decided to do a (small) giveaway here on my blog!

My giveaway is open to all UK residents. I've tried to make the prizes something that everybody wouldn't mind winning! There will be only one winner who will be picked at random. The full list of prizes with pictures will be revealed soon and will include:
A product from lush
A small 'happy' notebook
A mindfulness colouring book with colouring pencils
A range of prizes from 'Giftboxz'
(Other prizes may or may not be added!)


Mini smiley diary
