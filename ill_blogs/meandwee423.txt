Holy crap. Paige measured at 26.5 inches long today at her checkup. Wowza! She is 4 months and 1 week old. She weighs 15 lbs. 7 oz...a little above average. He showed me where she measures on the chart and her height was way up off the curves...must be nice to be tall! It's something I've never experienced as I always had to hem my pants no matter where I got them. Now I see why she is constantly outgrowing all her clothes!
