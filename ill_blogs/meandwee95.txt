 Sometimes it's nice to keep an optimistic perspective, especially when the chips are down and things don't seem to be going your way. Inspirational quotes and motivational art can help. Your state of mind can really help improve things and this art print is my way of reminding myself of this. I painted the original with gouache and acrylics and used ink here and there. I think this would look good as nursery art or in an office. Do you have a phrase that reminds you to expect good things?
