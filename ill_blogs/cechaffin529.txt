A recent poll showed that a majority of Brits don't like Americans, but now I think they've gone too far:

LONDON (AP) â€” A guard dog has ripped apart a collection of rare teddy bears, including one once owned by Elvis Presley, during a rampage at a children's museum.
''He just went berserk,'' said Daniel Medley, general manager of the Wookey Hole Caves near Wells, England, where hundreds of bears were chewed up Tuesday night by the 6-year-old Doberman pinscher named Barney.

Barney ripped the head off a brown stuffed bear once owned by the young Presley during the attack, leaving fluffy stuffing and bits of bears' limbs and heads on the museum floor. The bear, named Mabel, was made in 1909 by the German manufacturer Steiff.

To mock Barney as well isn't cricket.

Moodwise I'm at 0-- also known as "rodent-neutral."

Speaking of which, remind me to tell you about a new mousetrap I built to Kathleen's specifications. It hasn't caught a damned thing.
