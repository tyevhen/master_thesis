The deep freeze finally relented yesterday. It actually hit the mid 30's yesterday and almost 40 degrees today, unheard of for Minnesota in January! Going from at least a week of many, many degrees below zero to almost 40 made it feel like July. I took advantage of the warm sunny afternoon yesterday and went for a run outside with Jet. It was a perfect opportunity.

Since I've been back running, I think I've only managed 2-3 miles on a couple of occasions, with most of my runs averaging far less than that. Since I was sick in December, I've felt sluggish and slow. On my last run prior to yesterday, I barely managed 2 x 1 mile at 10+ minute per mile pace. It felt really awful, and I was certain I was never going to run the way I wanted to again.

Well, I'm happy to report the narrative changed yesterday. Jet and I managed a 4 mile run; 3 continuous miles followed by a short walking break before I finished with another mile. It was still slow, but I didn't feel sluggish and heavy. I wasn't panting like an overweight dog. I felt like a runner again! Finally.

I know it's going to be a long, long road for me to get back to being a marathoner, but I'm so glad I finally got to feel my body working in concert again. It's a small step toward the ultimate goal. I'm not very patient when it comes to athletic endeavors, but I'm doing my best to hold onto encouragement rather than focus on what could be interpreted with discouragement instead. I ran 4 miles, 3 without stopping! This is a big deal!

The deep freeze is about to settle back into our little tropical paradise here, so I don't know when I'll get the opportunity to run outside again. And I'm never as good running on a treadmill. I hate the "dreadmill," but maybe I'll be surprised again when I next try it. One thing is for sure, I'll keep fighting. I'm not giving up. I will be a runner again.
