OK, since John has spent about an hour now laughing at all of the comments related to this article (on the news website) I am going to post them over here....they really are too good to miss!!


My wife didn't believe it at first. But after a few months she couldn't do without it. She also uses it as an appetite suppressant, for headaches, PMS and menstrual cramping, moodiness, an OCD medication for sexual addiction, gambling, smoking, drug/alcohol abuse,shopping and talking on the phone/texting, anti-depression and anti-anxiety relief, a topping for chocolate ice cream and a topical skin ointment. It has always been nature's cure all for women and their best source of protein. Try some today!

Give your wife that coffee .... same effect as sperm, although not as satisfying to you....

Oral acceptance of semen also cures menopausal hot-flashes. Proven. Been there done that.
