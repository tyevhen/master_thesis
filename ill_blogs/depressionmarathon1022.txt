The technician told me I slept really well. I only know that I woke up several times feeling as if I was suffocating from the C-PAP machine. Forced air rushing from the machine into my nose made exhaling very difficult. Eventually, my nose got so stuffy I was actually suffocating. I stopped the sleep study at that point, which was 5:00 AM this morning. The technician insisted I slept really well.

Perhaps she's right. After all, I'm still awake. After the first study, without the C-PAP, I came home and went to bed. I don't feel the need to go to bed now, so perhaps I did sleep better. I'm not sure about wearing a C-PAP every night, though, as my general impression was that I was uncomfortable. Then again, if C-PAP is the cure to my fatigue, the choice to use it will become quite simple.

I'm glad the testing is done, and I'm looking forward to discussing everything with my doc later this week. Nothing to do now but wait for the results. I'll keep you posted.
