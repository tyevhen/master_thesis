if you have just started with cipralex, you might wonder like me when things will really start to kick in, I can tell you that you'll start feeling a difference after two weeks, at the beginning , lets say first month its more like on and off and sometimes it can be kind of annoying, you might even ask yourself does this thing work at all? does it worth all the side effects?! the answer to both is yes, but it will take at least a month or two until you'll notice things change, but don't expect to just wake up in the morning and be someone else, that wont happen...

What will happen is more gradual thing, slowly you'll notice that things that caused panic attacks and anxiety or depression before will bother you less and less...



I do recommend you keep a diary and write down the changes and the things that stays the same, this is what I do and it sure helps me to keep track of everything that's going on, and don't mess with the pills schedule or amounts, just keep with your plan.

best of luck, and never give up, remember you can and you will over come this.

and its very brave of you to actually do something about the thing that bothers you do I congratulate you on that , job well done.

take care and feel free to comment and ask questions or just share your experiences.
