I hate doing posts, before I have caught up on emails, blogs, and comments but I have had this one on my mind for awhile.

I was watching a youtube video by NerdWriter1  about Casey Niestat a talented video blogger. It was talking about the art of editing and how when it's done well you don't even notice that it's been done, it's seamless.

This applies to far more than just YouTube to me, it applies to the internet as a whole. It's something we all forget about, we take things at face value. The perfectly edited and shot pictures on Instagram, the cute planned and rewritten blog posts, that have been been made with the purpose of being seen.

I'm guilty of this myself, all the pictures I post on here are carefully selected and edited to be the best they can be. Yet for every good picture I take, there are at least fifty bad ones. We have all gotten so good at hiding the rough parts from the world, editing our lives to be aesthetically pleasing

Most of what we see on a daily basis is a snapshot at best. A heavily edited one at that, an almost  artificial version. It's incredibly hard to be genuine online and off. Especially in a society that praises perfection as unattainable and manufactured as it is. We buy it anyway, I know I do. I rate myself by it, and think that if I just raise the bar a little higher I will make it. The thing I am trying to reach doesn't exist. This self imposed perfection, is wasting my time and wreaking havoc on what was left of my self esteem.

There is beauty in our imperfections. We need to start embracing them.
