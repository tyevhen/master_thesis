I'm sitting in my living room watching The Carol Burnett Show. My friend loaned me the complete set, so I've got lots of laughter ahead. That's good because otherwise things are moving along slowly here. My hip is healing slowly. Had I not ruptured one of the quad tendons, I'd be much further along than I am, and that's frustrating. Nevertheless I am healing.

I'm doing what I can to stay active. My surgeon told me not to do anything that hurts, so I've had limited exercise options. Fortunately I can walk without pain. In fact, Jet and I just came in from a one hour walk. It was a beautiful, sunny, brisk day for a walk. I'm grateful I've healed enough to allow me to  walk at this point in time.

My mood remains okay despite not being able to run right now. Getting outside to walk on these beautiful days helps. The more sunshine I can get the better. I'm a little worried about the shorter days coming up, but if I can keep moving I'm hopeful I will stave off any depression episodes. Laughing at Carol Burnett helps, too. I'm grateful my mood remains good. Keep moving, my friends.
