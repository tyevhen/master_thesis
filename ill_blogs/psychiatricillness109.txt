I use the TV, DVDs and soaps to hide from the way I am feeling. The last few nights when the lights have gone out; when all I can hear is the clock ticking, the cat purring and next doors TV I realise how alone I am in this depressing world.

This tme yesterday I could not see my way through today. Now I at least have a plan for tomorrow and maybe after that I will be able to see my way through the week and to the Christmas break! I hate turning the lights out!
