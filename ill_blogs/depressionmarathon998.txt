It's not Thanksgiving, but I'm feeling particularly thankful today.
I don't know why I'm feeling so grateful, but it's nice.
I like it.
I want to thank everyone today.
Gratitude feels good.

I think I am especially thankful for how I've been feeling lately.
I've been well.
Sure, I'm still tired most of the time, but my mood has been good.
And for that, I am extremely grateful.

I am so thankful for the helpers around me.
I'm grateful for my psychiatrist.
I really don't know what I'd do without her.
I'm grateful for my psychologist.
She selflessly gives me her time. Don't know where I'd be without her either.
I've said it before, but I'm going to say it again.
I have a skilled, generous, and compassionate treatment team.
Without Deb, Shawn, Dr. L. and others, I wouldn't be here today.
I very likely wouldn't be alive.

I'm alive, and I'm well.
I'm living now, not just existing.
I've had opportunity and energy for some very rewarding experiences recently.
Telling my AA story.
Running a marathon.
Spending time with my family.
All rewarding. All positive.
All non-existent if I were only existing, not living.

No wonder I'm feeling grateful.
I feel a little silly,
but I'm gushing with gratitude today.
I'm sober.
I'm feeling rather well.
I'm working, running, playing...
Living.

I'm even feeling grateful to be feeling grateful...
and I hope some of you know what I mean by that,
because that means you've felt it, too.
Gratitude feels good.
