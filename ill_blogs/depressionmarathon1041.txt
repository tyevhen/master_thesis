Maybe I am living one day at a time. Maybe I'm actually accomplishing that goal. I talk the talk. My intent is to walk the walk. But how do I really know? Is there proof?

Yesterday, I mentioned that I was feeling better. My friend indicated she was pleased. Then she noted that this most recent downturn didn't seem to last as long as some previous episodes. "What was it, maybe 2-3 weeks," she asked?

Two to three weeks?! I was astonished. I thought it had been 2-3 days! "Was it that long? It wasn't that long, was it," I asked incredulously? It was. I checked my blog. It was about 2-3 weeks. So what does it mean that I thought it was only 2-3 days? Hmmmm...

The fact that it was 2-3 weeks and not 2-3 days may mean a lot of things. It might mean I'm not very observant. Maybe it indicates my forgetter works really well, but my memory sucks. Perhaps it's a sign of how low I got this time around. All are interesting, viable theories.

If I look at it more positively, though, it could mean I'm actually experiencing life one day at a time--forgetting the past and not worrying about the future. I think I'll look at it like that. After all, when I feel like crap, one moment at a time is quite enough!
