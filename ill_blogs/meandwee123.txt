It's Christmas 2012! We wish you a peaceful and joyous holiday!
Don't forget why we celebrate...Jesus was born with the purpose of saving us all from our sins so we can join God in Heaven one day and be close to Him. Wow, right???!!! He died for ALL of us...the righteous, the weak, the sick, the lost...
Happy Birthday, Jesus...Thank You for the blessings and the glory you bring us, not matter what we have done.
