I'm a little worried. You see, my excellent run this weekend may have been due in part to a decrease in one of my medications. It is a med I take for fatigue. Today, I had another sleep-filled, heavy, dragging day. I did run my scheduled ten-miler, but otherwise I slept almost as many hours as I was awake. I'm barely hanging on now despite all that sleep. So, I'm a little worried. Running faster may equal being more fatigued. I really, really hope not, but I'm a little worried.

More on this tomorrow...I gotta get to bed!
