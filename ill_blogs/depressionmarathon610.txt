I'm tired tonight. But that's a good thing. I'm tired because I put in a full day of work, came home and took Puck for a walk, made supper, and am now in the middle of my third load of laundry. I'm moving.

I'm feeling a little brighter. The darkness has abated a bit. Connecting with members of my treatment team has helped. I've also spent more time lately with friends, Bill and Cindy, and that's always helpful. But mostly, I've focused on moving--one foot in front of the other--moving.

Speaking of moving, I'm preparing for a weekend away with my boyfriend, D. It's weird to use the term boyfriend at my age (and his age), but that's what he is, I guess. I'm not looking forward to the Friday evening four hour drive in the dark, but D's going to have dinner waiting for me at the other end. It's been three weeks since we last saw each other. I'm really looking forward to reconnecting.

I'm glad to be feeling better in advance of the weekend. I wasn't sure how I was going to handle feeling so down around D. He's not seen that side of me yet. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about it. I'm grateful to be feeling better.
