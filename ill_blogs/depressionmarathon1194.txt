stepped into the black hole. i don't know why. i don't know when. this was not on the schedule. i was not prepared. heavy. hurts to stand. hurts to sit. breathing takes all the energy i've got. nothing poetic or dramatic to say. can't breathe. can't think. brain is not my own. thoughts of nonsense. focus--i have none. never will be able to explain the whole-body experience of crippling depression. never. i can feel the hole in the middle of my chest...there is nothing more painful
than
that

empty

hole.
