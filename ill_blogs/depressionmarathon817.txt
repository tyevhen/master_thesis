A quick note to say thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. I was feeling conflicted about continuing to write because I've been doing so much better than when I started this blog a few years ago. Many of you said, much to my surprise, that's exactly why you read--because I'm doing better, and doing better offers you hope! I had never thought of that! My therapist would be proud of you for re-framing my negative thought into a positive one. Really, she would! So thank you all for your feedback. I am humbled and amazed by your support. It is certainly no coincidence, I think, that I've gotten progressively better since I began this blog. This blog proves when we help one another, we are helped ourselves. Since I need all the help I can get, I'll keep writing.
