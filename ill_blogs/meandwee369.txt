As you can see, Paige enjoyed Valentine's Day. It was our first as a family and it was lots of fun!
I hope you had a great one! I spent half the friggin' day trying to make cupcakes (from scratch from a cupcake recipe book). I guess I got an ingredient wrong and they were all goopy and weird on the inside and burnt and rock hard/deflated on the outside. They were also gross. After some tears (I just wanted to do SOMETHING right when it came to cooking food, plus it was part of my gift to Chris) I trudged off to the grocery store and bought the Jiffy brand of instant cake mix and made new ones. They are delicious. Is it bad that the recipe I was trying to do was called "Kid Simple Cupcakes" ? KID SIMPLE. *sigh* Oh well. The Jiffy kind hit the spot and I'm thinking I'll stick with those. I DID make the frosting with success and it's so yummy! I'll never buy the canned stuff again. Luckily, it's quick and easy to make. Phooey on the kid simple cakes. Hmph. :)
We are digging out of snow today, but it's 40 degrees outside which is warm in my book! Yay! I'm off now to get Paige from her nap...I can hear her chattering away.
