TAXES! Of course, I've put them off until tonight. But I had a good excuse: I was waiting to finish my thesis. But here it is April 14, and no thesis and no taxes. By tomorrow, I'll have one of the two completed. Can you guess which one?

NOTE: This painting by Jose de Ribera represents the way I feel about taxes.
