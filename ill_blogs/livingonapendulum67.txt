Keep in mind that other sources of help, such as friends and family, may be available. We do recommend that people seek out help if their StressTest scores are low (in the "extremely stressed" range). People who do not score low may still wish to seek out help to better deal with difficult stressors in their lives.

StressTest has emphasized interpersonal help. However, we also understand the importance of proper rest and exercise, relaxation strategies, and religious faith as important contributors to emotional well-being.


 It is important to note that all of these are in the RED zone.  I had some pretty pictures but blogger would not take them.
