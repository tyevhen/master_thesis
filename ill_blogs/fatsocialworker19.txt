Hey! All you fat-friendly, size diversity-supporting, amazing social workers! Get at me.

I want to create a collective. I'm not sure what it's going to look like yet, but I think it's needed. There are reasons I fell in love with social work: its dedication to social justice, teaching about privilege, eradicating and confronting all the-isms in the world that most people would rather sweep under the rug. There's just one -ism social work has avoided: sizeism.

Fortunately, social work is a profession where I think the people in power are willing to listen. But first, we need something to say and we need people to say it.

If you are interested in organizing with me, email me at fatsocialworker (at) gmail dot com. Why can't social work schools teach about size? Why can't we talk about Health at Every Size as being THE ethical way to approach working with *all* clients? NASW has begun to speak on obesity issues. They recognize the "multifaceted" nature of "obesity"--why not recognize the ethical way of viewing obesity, the one that honors self-determination?
