It's amazing just how much anxiety can transform your life. For many, this condition can make normally mundane tasks, such as reading, eating, driving, walking, and so on, excruciatingly difficult.

Consequentially, sometimes I look at those without this condition with jealousy. Their lives seem so much easier than mine.

Of course, the targets of my envy could have their own mental health problems or other life complications. Yet when I'm really anxious and I see people casually doing activities that drive me crazy, I can't help but envy their freedom from the "managed hell" I experience every day.
