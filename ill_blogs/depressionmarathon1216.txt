I am finally back from my western journey. It was beautiful, refreshing, fun and EXHAUSTING! I think I need a vacation! There were many, many people twittering about the property which led to more activity than I had planned upon. I was on vacation, and there were several days when I didn't have time to NAP! There's something terribly wrong with that! Returned home via a 16 hour road trip through bad weather and pitch black roads--a bit stressful. We arrived in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, i.e. the middle of the night. I have yet to unpack. Recovery may take a few more days...
Unfortunately, I returned to a huge drama at the home of the teenager I mentor. HUGE DRAMA! The environment in which he lives is so toxic it would almost be appropriate to don a hazardous materials suit before entering their home. He is not an innocent victim in this one. He contributed to the toxicity, but the alcoholic family dynamics and mother's BP illness keep the toxic fumes vehemently swirling long after they otherwise would have settled.
Within five minutes of entering the house today, naked without my haz-mat suit, I was sucked into the fray. Realizing the hopeless course I was on, I extricated myself as cleanly as possible, but the toxicity and stress remained. I had the skill to verbally disengage and the option to leave. The teen I work with doesn't have those luxuries. I care about this kid, and I am afraid this environment will eventually knock him flat, or worse... And the stress isn't good for me, either.

Despite the drama to which I returned, it is nice to sleep in my own bed again. It's nice to have a flush toilet, running water, and the company of Puck, again. The routine of living may take a while to get re-established, and I do miss gazing at snowy-peaks while sipping my morning coffee. But I'll manage.
This trip caused me to deeply ponder many things. I have a feeling you'll be a party to my ponderings if you stick around over the next couple weeks. Until then...
