I'm dating a new guy; Mr Actually. It's a bit of an odd one for me, it's easy, a slow burner but actually, Mr Actually seems quite kind, actually.

I met him way back in February and he was one the crops I've been farming for the last few months. I've been having fun with the dating game and I am still having fun, I am definitely in no rush to fall into anything. In fact, I'm not I will ever let myself fall for anyone again. I don't even think that's a bad thing.

Recently I've been chatting to the younger girls at work about their dates and guys. They all get so excited and are so 'loved-up', I'm not sure I will ever feel like that again. I simply do not trust myself, I don't trust my own judgement. I've fallen for the wrong guy three too many times. 

As sad as it sometimes feels, to be all emotion-less, I do feel more in control, more sensible and less likely to put up with nonsense from these boys. It's going to take a real good one for me to trust and fall in love with, unfortunately for them it's not going to be an easy think but maybe I've fallen too easily in the past, maybe I was too naive and too in love with the idea of being in love. 

I can't spend too much time worrying about how I feel. My feelings are my feelings, I can't change them, I just have to roll with it. Plus I'm actually going away to Ibiza next month. I have a bikini body to work on, actually.
