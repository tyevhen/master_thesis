Family and friends...




Boys finally settling down for the night...






A crazy little girlie playing football with the rest of them. In her sundress.






Early fall days still warm enough for a picnic...







Flower petals brought to me by the two youngest. Collected in egg cartons...






These two soccer-playing brothers...






Little pumpkins tucked in nooks and crannies...







Inspiring reminders placed throughout our home...






Fresh, soft, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Even better? Baked with the help of my little sweetie.






Baskets of books...





Lego creations...





A prayer shawl. Each stitch holds prayers for our family. Crocheted by a woman I've never met, but who cared enough to sacrifice her hands and heart for our family...







The grapevine wreath in the entryway. Grapevines collected and woven together by my darling and I the first year we were in our home. Foliage changed to match the season.
