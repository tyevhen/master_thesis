I ran another marathon today. The Lake Wobegon Trail Marathon runs through West-Central Minnesota along what used to be a railroad corridor. I used it as a long training run and finished in 3:42:25.

Unfortunately, that is not the news most pressing this evening. I attended this marathon with several other area runners. Our driver was a 35 year-old husband and father in perhaps the best shape of his life. He was shooting for a personal best 3:10-3:15 on this flat, fast course. After crossing the finish line around 3:14, he collapsed. He died a short time later.

There are no words for occasions like this. Why God feels the need for senseless occasions like this is a grand mystery to me. The needless agony of his family haunts me tonight. I don't know what else to say. I cannot shed any light on the darkness of the moment. Rest in peace, Paul. Rest in peace.
