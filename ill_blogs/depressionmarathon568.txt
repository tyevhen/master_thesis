It's tempting to say, "Why me?" It's tempting. My knee is keeping me off the road. The speed workout went undone on Tuesday. The seven miler did not get run on Thursday. And the 17-miler, crucial training for an upcoming Boston Marathon, will not even get started tomorrow. I am so discouraged.

It would be easy to inquire, "Why me?" I've certainly been through a lot lately. From November through early February, I was barely myself. Depression enveloped me like a dark, leaden cloak. I could barely function. Hospitalization, ECT, financial stress, and a break-up...I figured that was enough. But God had other plans, I guess. Other plans he had for me.

Much of the time, but not always, I believe things happen for a reason. Sometimes I have faith God only gives us what we can handle. Regardless of what I believe, however, I'm here, in this situation, right now. It is what it is. It's tempting to ponder, "Why me?" But what would that accomplish? I can't waste any energy feeling sorry for myself.

I'm worried. I'm worried about my knee. I'm worried about my mood. I'm worried about my mood because of my knee. My track record when I've been injured and unable to run is not the best. But more concerning than my past record is how I'm feeling in this moment. My mood has definitely dropped a notch since Monday's injury. That concerns me.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't frightened; if I didn't admit I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I am concerned. I know life is not always easy. And that's certainly true right now. I'm being challenged. I'm being challenged big time! It's simple to wonder why. But that only avoids the challenge and leaves me stagnant. I cannot wallow. Wallowing is useless. I do not have the luxury of self-pity. I have to face the fear. I have to fight.
