It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's an ElliptiGo! I am excited. After years of yearning, and months of searching, I am now the proud owner of an ElliptiGo. It's my new training tool.


An ElliptiGo is basically an elliptical bike. As you can see in the photos, I stand on the pedals and "pedal" in an elliptical motion that closely resembles running but without the impact. I heard about the ElliptiGo several years ago and immediately wanted one. Unfortunately, they were way out of my price range. As a result of my ongoing Achilles injury, I decided several months ago I wanted to pursue purchasing a used ElliptiGo. Unfortunately, there are very, very few used ElliptiGos on the market and most were still out of my price range. Finally, after months of searching across the country, I found one in Colorado. The woman selling it was very generous. We negotiated a fair price, and she agreed to have it disassembled and shipped to me. Now I'm the happy owner.


I'm still getting used to my new training partner, but I've already ridden it several times. I get very strange looks from everyone I pass while riding it. Not sure I like that, but it's to be expected. It's not something one sees every day.

Riding the ElliptiGo is fun, and it's a great workout! It works my legs like running, but I also get a good core and even arm workout while riding it. I generally average just under 5 minutes per mile on my rides. I only wish I could run that fast, even for a mile! I'll keep dreaming.

Once I'm back to training, I'm really hopeful riding the ElliptiGo will allow me to log more weekly miles than I'd otherwise be able to safely log on my recovering Achilles. I may use it on my easy days instead of running. We'll see how it all works out, but I'm excited to add it to my training routine. I feel like I'm taking another step in the process of getting back on the roads, and I'm really grateful for that.
