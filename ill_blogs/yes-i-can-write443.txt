Guess what?

IT'S SNOWING!!

Big wet flakes that melt on tongues and catch on eyelashes. That sting your face and delight your soul. That make wet sounds as they hit the pavement and melt, yet cover the lawn in a carpet of white wonder... The first snowfall is always something magical and soul lifting! Each new season brings such joy, that it would be absolutely impossible for me to pick a favorite season. I always tell people that my favorite seasons are the current one and the next one! The world never ceases to amaze me, to uplift me, to make me unbelievably happy. So here's to the wonder of life.

Peace, love, happiness, and lots of snow,

Idzie
