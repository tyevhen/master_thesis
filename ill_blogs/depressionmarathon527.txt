It's the end of another week in my life. I feel like I've missed most of it. This pnemonia has kept me down. I've spent most of my free time, and I've had a lot of that, lying low or sleeping. I haven't run in over a week. I haven't done anything except walk Puck. I tried a bit longer walk yesterday, about 2 miles, and it totally wiped me out! That was disappointing. I had hoped to get my running shoes on tomorrow, but now I'm not so sure.

That being said, I am feeling a little better. I still have a very nasty cough, but no fever or joint aches (except after my long walk). Today was my last day on antibiotics, and they did make a difference. I guess I might need to be a bit more patient about getting back on the road. I'm not too good at patient.

This week has been a little more challenging for my mood. As I said before, I'm not used to being physically down for so long. I discussed feeling a little low with my doctor yesterday. We decided I'll likely feel mentally better once my physical self heals. Again, patience...

Without exercise, I've had extra time in my life to focus on work. Things are improving there. I'm getting into the swing of things. I know what forms are in which drawers now. I figured out how to put a patient on my schedule. And today I mastered faxing orders to a doctor. Whoo, hoo! I'm still struggling to control my fear every time I get a referral for a new outpatient, but I figure that's got to improve eventually. Patience is king.

I'm laughing. Here I am writing about patience while internally I'm screaming, "Hurry up!" Oh well, I never claimed I was perfect. I'll keep working at it.
