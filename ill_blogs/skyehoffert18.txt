It's kind of funny that I always post my writing or photography here, but I rarely if ever post my sketches. Drawing was my first love, I started at seven copying Veggie tales and horses out of books. They weren't good but it was a start.

I think the reason I never post my scribbles is because, people love to criticize and even as a kid. They always had something to say. "Why are you drawing that!", "That looks nothing like it!", "I've seen better".

I need to step past all this because who cares it's just a drawing. I started with a blank page.

I'm only doing this because you guys asked.
