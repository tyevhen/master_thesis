I don't know about you, but sometimes being busy helps me distract from my current mood woes. I guess I'm getting better because I had enough energy to be busy at work today. My co-worker is on vacation this week, so I've got double the patient load. Whew... I was worried about how things would go, as my energy has been severely lacking, but I was able to put it together today. I saw all my patients, got all my paperwork done, and finished in a reasonable time. I ended up in bed when I got home--even though I really wanted to stay up--and slept for 1.5 hours. But I guess I needed that.

I think I'm doing a little better again today. I'm less overwhelmed, frustrated, and irritable. Obviously my energy is a bit better, and I'm functioning more efficiently, too. My dishes are actually washed! I hope this trend continues. The darkness was so, so dark this time. Here's hoping for more light...
