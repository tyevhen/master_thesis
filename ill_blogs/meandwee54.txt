It looks like this pretty much constantly here in my yard. This winter has been a nightmare here in New England. It's been the usual snow (blah) but that's not a big surprise. It's the temperatures that have brought on the hard times...it's been 8 degrees many days and highs seem to constantly hit 20 degrees at best. What the what??????!!!! I've got cabin fever in a big way and feeling so jealous of the parts of the country that get to enjoy spring. sigh.

See this picture below? It was 5 degrees when that was taken. Winter, you suck! (I said that in my best Maine accent by the way)
