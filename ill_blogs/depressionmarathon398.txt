For the second Saturday in a row, I ran a race. This race was 11 miles long. It's an annual event held on a paved bike trail which runs through the woods northwest of town. It's a very laid back race, and only about 50 people ran despite the perfect, sunny and cool weather conditions. I run this race every year, even though I always find myself questioning that decision somewhere around mile nine every year.

This year was no exception. I was feeling quite cooked by mile nine and cursing myself for running yet again. Despite that, I did have a decent race. I ran entirely by feel. I didn't look at my watch once. I wore one, because I like to see my mile splits after the fact, but I wanted to run without worrying about pace. Unfortunately, I had some uncomfortable GI distress, which kept my anxiety up until I finally took a quick pit-stop around mile four. After that I was able to focus all of my anxiety on the discomfort of running an out-and-back 11-mile race! (That was a joke.)

This is what I looked like about one half mile prior to the finish. I definitely look a lot better than I felt! I was totally ready to be done!
  I ended up finishing second overall, and first of only two women in my age division, in a time of 1:25:21. I'm okay with that. I didn't take any easy or rest days prior to the race, and I'm in the middle weeks of my marathon training, so 1:25:21 is a decent time. I'm sure I could run faster, but I guess I'll have to wait until next year to prove that. Next year... yup, I'm sure I'll go back.
