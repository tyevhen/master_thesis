I know that I don’t have a host of fans out there but I do have some friends and family and a few new online friends that are pretty diligent readers and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the comments, love, support, and feedback from everyone. I love getting comments and knowing that there are people that are benefiting from my blogging. It really makes it all worth it. If I can help anyone either struggling with their own anxiety or to better understand a loved one going through it than that is a huge bonus for me. Blogging wouldn’t be half as much fun if no one read it, so I just want to let you all know how awesome you are! If there are any questions about a topic that you are more interested in or would like me to mention just let me know and I will do my best :)

Thanks again to all!
