Today was the running of our local marathon, but I was out doing a marathon workout of my own. Just as the runners were getting started miles away, I was hopping on my bike for a 34.4 mile ride. I had hoped to ride it in 90 minutes, but it was very hilly for the first 20 miles, and we all know I suck on hills, so it took me 1:50 to finish. I followed the ride with a 35 minute run. My legs were very tired! But it was a great workout. In total, I covered almost 40 miles in just under 2.5 hours.

After showering, I hoofed it to the marathon finish line to cheer. If you ever want to be inspired, check out the finish line of a marathon. Most of my friends had already finished, but I got to chat with a few of them. Seems most had a good day.

It's been a long, slow, lazy day since I returned from the marathon. I napped, paid my bills, and watched some college softball on TV. After such busy-ness over the past few weeks, it's strange to have nothing to do. That's not entirely true, I guess. There are several things I could do, but I'm choosing not to. I'm being lazy instead.

I could go golfing, but it's really hot. I could watch some work inservice videos, but who wants to sit inside and work on a holiday weekend? I could go help my parents move into their new RV, but they might drive me crazy! Instead, I'm resting, getting a little bored, and trying to figure out what to do next. Such problems I have these days, huh?
