I took today off, so I had a long weekend. I was very productive this weekend; did my laundry, went grocery shopping, ran 17 miles Saturday, ran 5 miles yesterday and today, and played a lot of golf. Yes, golf. I'll have more about that in another post. Yes, it was a beautiful, productive weekend, but the one thing I didn't do, and didn't feel like doing this weekend was write. Sorry. I'm still here. I guess I just haven't had much to say. I'm sure that won't last too long! More soon...
