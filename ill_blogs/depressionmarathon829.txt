UGH! I woke up this morning with a sore throat, runny nose, achy muscles and joints. I felt like crap. I still feel like crap. Feeling like crap makes me crabby. I don't like being sick, and I don't like being crabby, but today I was both. I'm sure I was quite pleasant to be around.

I'm also cranky because I missed my workouts as a result of feeling like crap. I'm not a fan of missing my workouts either, but you probably could have guessed that one. It was smarter that I didn't go while feeling ill, but it still bugs me to miss them. Anyway, enough complaining.

On to gratitude... I'm extremely grateful to be at Bill and Cindy's house again, and at supper time, too! And they invited me despite the fact that I'm sick! With their company and Bill's cooking, I'll likely be all better by morning. I'll probably have more to say then, too.
