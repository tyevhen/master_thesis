Look what I made! I sculpted this cute little birdie using bright white polymer clay and then I sanded it over and over using various grits of sandpaper. I then added sleepy eyes with grey acrylic paint.
I put her up for sale in my shop if you're interested; there's only one for now!
If you like it, let me know! I can always make more.

I hope you have a great day!
