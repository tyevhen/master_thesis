Periodically I'll get a lovely message from someone who has read and liked my blog enough to drop me a line. I really appreciate this, and getting messages from people really makes me happy! But I've realized it must be a bit of a pain to contact me privately, since previously the only way to do so was through YouTube. So I've now made a public email account:
open.eyed.slave@gmail.com.
Please mention something to do with my blog, unschooling, anarchy, or whatever in the subject line, so I know it's not spam! For those of you who already know my private email address, that's still my primary one, and you should send your emails there.

Peace,
Idzie
