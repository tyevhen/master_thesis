Sometimes even the most diligent grad students need a pumping, futuristic, robot beat pushing them to study harder faster better stronger. (Added bonus: Any Daft Punk song could replace caffeine in a pinch.) Here is the same song with two different videos. Which is your favorite?

Open minded people could interpret this video as a metaphor for the education system or at least the conception of socialization, maybe.


I think I like this one the best because of its garage band simplicity and witty choreography.
