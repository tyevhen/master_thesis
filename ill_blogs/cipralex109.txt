Its been a while now that i'm working out, and I actually succeded to commite myself to it and do it everyday. amazing I could never do that before, I also notice I dare to say stuffs more freely, My communication skills are starting to go back the way they used to be. It seems easier on occaisons and sometimes hard as it always been...but in those special times when I do feel OK I communicate good. I still have no confidence in myself or my body, but I feel I just might change things to be like I want...
