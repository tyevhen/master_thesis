Journal Entry After Counseling
December 22, 2005

When I am feeling hatred toward myself and wanting to hurt myself:
I can know that Jesus doesn't condemn me.
I can realize that God says anger is okay.  It is just an emotion.
I can be angry and not direct it at myself.
I can remember that when people get to know me, they like me.
I can go through hard stuff and know that there are people who are willing to go through it with me.
I can ask God for help.
I can fight the thoughts of self-hatred and the desires to hurt myself, with the truth that God loves me and took my punishment for me.
