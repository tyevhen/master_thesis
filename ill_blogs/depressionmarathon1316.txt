Well, it had to end sometime...
Apparently, suburbanites walk with their heads down, or don't have holes in their pockets, or have more children roaming the streets because not one lonely penny was waiting for me today during my suburban 5-miler. I have to admit, I'm a bit sad.
The odds finally caught up with me today. A new streak, I hope, will start again tomorrow. Maybe it won't involve money...but I'll be looking for something to latch onto because there's been something more than training occurring here. I don't know what...but I'm having fun playing along!

...if I can't change the world, I'll change the world within my reach.
