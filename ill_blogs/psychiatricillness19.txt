One reason I have been thinking about which may be why I am a little down is my sleep patterns.   Does anyone know anything about sleeping too much.  Also what about diet and exercise can that help?

I go to bed each night between 9:30pm and 10:00pm and wake up around 8:00am to 8:30am.   I get at least 10.5 hours sleep each night. That would be manageable and not a long way outside the normal range apart from I rarely stir in the night and I have a lot of trouble getting up in the mornings.  I spend most of the working day yawning and can't wait to get back home for a nap.  If I go and lay on my bed I can be asleep in less than 5 minutes.

It is really hard to cope with as I do little more than work and sleep monday to friday leaving the weekend full of household chores.  Mr R would like to go out more in the week but I just can't manage it, it leads to me oversleeping for work.  Once I get behind on the housework and laundry I start feeling low, I eat junk and want to sleep more. It all gets into a viscous downward spiral which I desperately need to break!

Oh where to start.  I think I'll go for a short walk before bed as the evenings are lighter and I want to try staying up a little later tonight to see if I am any better tomorrow.
