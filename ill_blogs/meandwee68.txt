After we dropped Paige off at preschool Noah and I took a drive around our new neighborhood and took photographs of the changing leaves. Well, I did. Noah zonked out in his carseat (too early of course!). I find the landscape to be so soothing here. So much detail and lovely places to explore! New England foliage can't be beat! Pepperell is filled with some of the best scenery I've found in one place. Here are some of my favorites, but you can see the whole set here.
