Hey everyone. I'm taking a short break from packing (moving, ugh) to write this blog post and make a couple phone calls.

Do you have a couple minutes? Sady Doyle recently published a list of Dems. who support HR3. If you're not sure what HR3 is, here's a nice primer from Mother Jones.

I'd appreciate it if y'all could take a second and contact one or two of them and tell them that this is not okay. HR3 is not about saving tax payers money (fyi, 191 abortions were paid for by Medicaid in 2006... we're talking fractions of pennies compared to the debt we're in [source]).

According to this bill, most rape survivors weren't "really" raped, and they will be denied coverage for abortion from their own PRIVATE insurance. So, tax payers won't be saving money AND the government is regulating private insurance. WTF, GOP (and the dems on the list, too!)?
