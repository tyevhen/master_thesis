I've been taking 5 mg cipralex a day, I take it around midnight, Meanwhile I've had some headaches and seems like I really enjoy taking naps...The headaches aren't so bad, I'll continue to take 5 mg until a week will be completed, than I'll increase the dosage to 10 mg. I'll keep posting here, if i'll feel any changes.
