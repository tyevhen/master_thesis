While cleaning my basement yesterday I found an old notebook tucked away in an ancient Runner's World magazine. On my way to the recycle bin I realized the notebook contained some journaling. Dated from late 2000 through mid-2001, the entries were all about my early struggles with this illness. The magazine went in the recycle bin while the notebook and I sat down.

I began feeling like something was wrong, or a bit off, in November, 2000. My words reflect the confusion and concern I experienced as I tried to figure out what was happening with me. Many entries sound like this one: "I feel there is something wrong--something wrong with me. How else can I make sense of these overwhelming, powerful, intimidating feelings racing through my head?" That was from February 1, 2001. Those early months, powerlessness is reflected over and over in what I said. It appears I didn't have an understanding of depression's wide ranging symptoms.

I didn't know what was happening. My early depression was apparently dominated by racing, intrusive thoughts, distractibility, and profound confusion. I was disturbed by my brain's errant path and exasperated by my inability to control it or cope. Feeling like an impostor in my own body was a constant theme. It appears those early months were very scary, unsettled times.

It's interesting to see the difference between then and now. While my depression still unsettles and exasperates me sometimes, I now have the benefit of previous experience. I have a label for the restlessness, intrusive thoughts, sadness, and fatigue. It's depression. And based on previous experience, I know that whatever crap I am feeling will eventually pass.

I guess that's one benefit of an eight year battle. Today I have acceptance, knowledge, and support. Those are three things I didn't have in 2000-2001. Reading my old writings, it's obvious those are three things which keep me battling today. Without them, I'd be dead.
