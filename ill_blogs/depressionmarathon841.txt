That's me on the right. I'm looking quite relaxed considering how anxious I was.

Most of my class just before the start of the first wave.

Me.

Surprisingly, I was the first one out of the pool. (14:54 for 1/2 mile.)

Trying to get wet feet into dry shoes!

Looking over my shoulder as I ride up my computerized hill.

The first wave participants on our bikes.
Me and Mike running around the track.
All done. With my friend Renee, who graciously spent her morning taking pictures of me!
