With depraved indifference to the very patients they were supposed to care for, Los Angeles' College Hospital has dumped more than 150 mentally ill patients on skid row streets over the past two years. After discharging them, the hospital loaded these people into vans and drove them more than 40 miles into L.A.'s dangerous downtown area.

The case came to light after they dumped Steven Davis, a man suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, in front of the Union Rescue Mission. The mission, which has 'anti-dumping cams' out front, complained to the hospital. The hospital van returned, picked up Mr. Davis and deposited him a few miles away instead.

Can you imagine this happening to people with any other type of illness???

In a settlement announced yesterday, College Hospital agreed to pay $1.6 million in fines and charitable contributions to psychiatric and social service agencies. They also agreed to no longer dump patients onto skid row. Unbelievable.

I would have preferred to see them fire the person or persons in charge of this scheme. How about sitting them down in a room full of previously dumped patients? Force them listen, quietly, for as long as it takes. That might make a dent in their insensitive, criminal skulls. One would hope...
