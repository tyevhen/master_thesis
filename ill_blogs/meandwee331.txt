Hi friends!
Well, We're finally getting some rest again around here. Putting Paige to bed earlier has truly done the trick. She now wakes at 6:15 or so instead of 5:30. She also sleeps right through the night quietly and hasn't had tantrums or screaming night wakings. It helps if she is worn out when she goes to bed...so I spend lots of time running her energy out during the afternoon. She goes to bed between 6 and 6:30 and it works like a charm. She used to have that bedtime, but as she's gotten older and seemingly could stay up later we moved her bedtime to 7/7:30. Well, she fell asleep ok in the beginning but then the night-wakings with screaming began. Soon, she was tantruming at bedtime and then her morning wakeup moved from 6:30 to a painfully earlier 5:30/5:15 am. Moving her bedtime back to the earlier time has been magic. Thank you Marc Weissbluth and Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. Your book has not failed me ONCE during Paige's young lifetime.

In other news, I recently got to see the photos from the photoshoot we won a little while back from Kristina Young Photography. A few are included with this post. You can see the slideshow (up for a limited time) here if you want to see more. We are so thrilled! And Kristina was such a pleasure to have in our home...she was so warm, friendly, and made the whole thing fun. Now, the hard part is choosing which ones to have printed!
