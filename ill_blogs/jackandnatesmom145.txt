Nate's language had stalled over the past few months, but right now it seems to be picking up again.  I am not naive enough to think that "this is it", but I am enjoying it, that's for sure.  Food has always been the ultimate motivator for Nate, as it is for many kiddos. His first words revolved around food and any progress that occurs seems to be at mealtime.   He has been saying "more" forever, and eventually he did add "cup".  What happened though is that he started identifying every object as cup.  And the other things he likes seem to start with c as well- corn (popcorn), chip, chicken, etc.  Below you will hear him say more cup to start and then correct to more chip.  You can distinctly hear the "ch" sound in there.  Not that big of a deal for most, but for us- well, for us it's almost tear-worthy.
