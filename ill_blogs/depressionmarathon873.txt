I discovered I'm being plagiarized by a site called Alaska Psychiatry Journal. They take my feed and republish it as their own, submitted by "admin" and filed under the "category" Depression Marathon. They also list Depression Marathon in their sidebar as a "category" with no link to my site. And I'm not the only one. They are plagiarizing multiple sites in the same way.

To say I'm angry is a gross understatement. I'm incensed! I'm frustrated! I'm incredulous! There is no contact information for the site administrator anywhere on their site, but someone suggested e-mailing webmaster@alaskapsychiatryjournal.net, which I did. I asked them politely to cease and desist, but so far no word from them nor change in their plagiarism. I've also contacted their web host, IX Web Hosting, and asked them to intervene. They are "looking into it." I don't know what else to do.

Since this post, laughingly, will also be plagiarized by the site, I guess I'll ask again right here. Please, Alaska Psychiatry Journal, stop plagiarizing my original material! I put my heart and soul into this blog. These are my words, my thoughts, and my feelings. While it is nice to be recognized by other sites, to have you present my words, thoughts and feelings as your own is an incredible personal violation. Please, stop.

If anyone out there knows of another way for me to address this thievery, please let me know. Thanks, and thanks for letting me vent.
