The weather remains cool, gray and wet around here. My mood, however, not so much. The dip I feared never really materialized, and for that I am extremely grateful. I saw my doc on Thursday, and she gave me a nice pep talk. She is so supportive. She reminded me I've worked very hard and devoted myself to maintaining my physical and mental health. She was confident I was having a little lull of which I could pull myself out. Her confidence in me feels good, and her pep talk did help. I left her office feeling emboldened and immediately experienced a lifting of my spirits. She gave me exactly what I needed at that time.

My sponsor and I got together Friday night, which always feels good. I love working my program of recovery, and my sponsor is a great role model. After attending an inspiring meeting this morning, two women celebrated over 25 years of sobriety, I got some more recovery time in while running 12 miles with my friend, T. I usually do all of my training alone, so it's always nice when T and I get together to cover some miles. I enjoyed our run and chat.

The rest of my weekend will be restful. I don't have to work. I'm tapering for Grandmas Marathon, so I don't have to run much. In a couple hours my house will be clean and my laundry done. There are a few social things going on, but I haven't yet decided if I will attend or not. I may just stay in and enjoy the peace.

If it doesn't rain, I may spend tomorrow in the woods with Jet. We haven't been hiking together yet. It was one of my favorite things to do with Puck, so I'm anxious to introduce Jet to my favorite state park and trails. I think he'll love it, and I know I will love watching him experience it for the first time.

Until we meet again, carry on with health and happiness, my friends.
