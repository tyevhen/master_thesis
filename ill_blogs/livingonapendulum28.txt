Thank you for finally replying though I will respectfully disagree.   I read stories about corporations abusing their power in newspapers on a daily basis, including yours. It has also been proven that when a company feels threatened to their bottom line they become more cooperative.   I can only assume that this story is a conflict of interest for the sun.
I will keep looking.

Hi "Marie-Louise"



Thanks for the reminder.



Although you have a beef with Wind, we really don't get involved in customer disputes. Honestly, most companies do not respond to media coverage. They're not all of a sudden going to fix things because the Ottawa Sun decides to write a story. And we're not there to mediate disputes.



Good luck with them.



Regards



Don

Hello,

I tweeted for assistance and was told to submit my story idea to this email address.

I am having a severe customer service issue with Wind Mobile. Some of my friends, though disgusted with what I am going through are making jokes about my troubles,

I agree going through so much hassled does start to make a person sound a bit looney. I tend to bring out the worst in companies, but eventually, I manage to get them to do the right thing. With Wind nothing seems to be working so I am doing the unthinkable, reaching out to the Media for assistance...

One lone client doesn't matter, you can abuse them and if they leave you lose just what 50 a month... it's a drop in the bucket... why care about the client?


But maybe with you help, they'll care a little more.



Now I am giving you a link to my blog... I wrote everything there, , let me know what you think...
