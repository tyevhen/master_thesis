Dear kiddos,

Today is Mother's Day and I wanted to take this chance to tell you that it's been such an honor to mother you. Being with you is my greatest joy. Watching you thrive has been and will continue to be my life's greatest achievement. I love you both more than anything...that love knows no bounds and will stretch into eternity. They say that nothing lasts forever; but my love knows differently.
I love you always,
Mama
