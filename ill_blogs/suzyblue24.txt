 When abroad, especially if it's hot, my style takes on a very minamalistic and basic approach. While some girls can look amazing in flowy kimono's, beaded blazers and sequinned studded mini dresses, its all too fussy for me in the blazing heat! Don't get me wrong, I'd love to be one of those women who can strut down the street in all white with strappy heels looking as chic as ever - but when it comes to holidays, comfort takes priority for me! 

Even though these outfits are very basic and not hugely inspirational, I hope you enjoy scrolling through nonetheless!
