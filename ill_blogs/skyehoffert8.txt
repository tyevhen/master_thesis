I think you guys are probably used to my utter weirdness at this point. At least I would hope so, most people outside of my family aren't. It's always nice to find people who are. Like Cat, who when I saw her dreads and was like I must make you into a female Jack Sparrow. She seemed unfazed and actually ecstatic about it. The world needs more people like her.
 (Thanks for the fantastic shoot, Catherine)

(Also I stole this song idea from the Hillywood Show's parody of Pirates of the Caribbean)




















 I'm sorry this post is so long, I had a hard time choosing the pictures. This was a last minute shoot, we did a value village run, went home threw the costume together. Got Starbucks and headed to the beach, really happy with how it turned out. Had an absolute blast!
