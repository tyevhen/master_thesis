I got up early thinking I would shovel my driveway, make it to a class at the gym, and then drive to work--45 minutes away. This is what I encountered instead.
I had to push my way out the door. This is the doorway into my driveway. It sits at least 6 inches above my driveway.


This is looking out my door toward my garage. Those drifts are about 4.5 to 5 feet high. Needless to say, I didn't make it out of my driveway, as I don't own a snow blower, and I couldn't fathom shoveling this yet, especially since it is still snowing...
...still snowing hard. Fun, fun, fun!
