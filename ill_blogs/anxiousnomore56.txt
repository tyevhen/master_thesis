Every year when January 1st rolls around I have a whole list of resolutions for every aspect of my life. I guess its the perfectionist in me, as there is a never ending list in my head as to how I can improve. Then, as long as I actually complete one resolution, I am happy. Its sort of fail safe.


Last year one of my resolutions was to display some of my pictures that I take in my home. I came up with a photo wall of 9 16 X 20 canvas prints that I love. I have one left that I need to still fill of my hubby (getting him to do a photo shoot of only him will be a miracle). But it was a lot of work and took a long time to accumulate the photos and put it all together. So I am happy.


This year, I want to do a lot more for my home. Turning my house into a home kinda stuff. I have my toe dipped into so many little ventures, I would like to take one of them and run with it. Turn it into something bigger. As for my health, I have a lot of ideas for the site, but I haven't made any real goals for myself. I am still trying to master the once a week yoga. The holidays kinda took me off of that one, whoops!


I have spiritual goals and family goals, but they too come with roadblocks that make it hard. And I've decided I don't want to put too much pressure on myself. Make life simpler so as not to get so overwhelmed. So I think the simplest way for me this year is to sum all of my goals into one mission statement if you will:


To spend my time with people that I love, doing activities that I love, that make myself and my family happy.

Remembering that will help me to stay focused on where I should be.
