I often have to ask and remind myself what I want this blog to be. Right off the bat I get a bit afraid and overwhelmed because part of me is afraid to let people really know my thoughts. I doubt anyone really reads this however just the fact that it is out out of my head and publicly somewhere gives me a bit of anxiety. My goal is to break past that because I have always enjoyed blogging and it does make me happy.

For me this blog is:
- Sharing events in my life to remember
- Opening up about my past struggle with depression and my current struggle with anxiety
- Writing more so my grammar and vocabulary can expand
- Movie reviews?
- Beauty reviews
- Pictures of food!!
- Living with PCOS
- Practicing photography
- Trying new recipes/pinterest projects
- This big changes in life coming up!!
- Possibly a fitness/weight loss/healthy lifestyle blogs?

Overall I want this blog to my happy place where I can share whatever is on my mind.
