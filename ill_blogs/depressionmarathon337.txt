I'm back from my weekend away with my boyfriend, D. It was a very nice weekend. It was too short, as usual. Being back in his arms made me realize exactly how long it had been since we last saw each other, and that I missed him more than I knew. We ate in, ate out, watched a movie, went running, visited with family, and of course, played with Jet. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to go, and I'm already looking forward to seeing him again. It's difficult to live so far apart from each other.

I ran 17 miles along the Milwaukee lakefront on Saturday morning. Unfortunately, I didn't properly hydrate on Friday, stayed up too late Friday night, and felt tired before I even began running. Within the first mile, I knew it was going to be a long day. I tried to focus on the new scenery around me, but I had to do mental gymnastics to keep myself going for almost three hours. I almost completely ran out of energy with three miles to go, which forced me to take walk breaks the rest of the way. But, once again, I did it, and I'm happy about that. I'm also happy with how I recovered. D and I ran 5 miles together on Sunday, and I had no difficulty with that. So it was a mixed bag this weekend, and that was okay. I'm grateful I was able to run and able to run in new, beautiful surroundings.

I've not got much on my agenda this week. My mood remains fairly steady. I'm hoping to chat with my psychiatrist about returning to work when I see her on Thursday. I'm feeling ready to give it a shot. I think I'll be okay as long as I start slow and ease back into things. I don't actually know if I will have the opportunity to return to my previous position, but I'm lucky to be a physical therapist, as I know there are positions open elsewhere. I'll let you know how the conversation with my doc goes.
