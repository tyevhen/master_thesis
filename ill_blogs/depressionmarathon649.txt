I thought I was healed, or at least healing, but this morning my right calf tied up after only 5 blocks of running. Bummer. I was supposed to do a speed workout of 12 by 400 meters, but instead I headed to the pool and swam 12 by 75 yards. The pool was frigid for some reason, so the workout was a bit tougher than it needed to be, but I'm glad I went. After my calf tied up I didn't want to do anything except go back to bed and feel sorry for myself. Fortunately, I nixed that idea and got my butt to the pool. Afterward, I was pleasantly fatigued.

I'm not feeling terribly pleasant about my calf, though. I'm pretty disappointed. I had a terrible long run this past Saturday, and now I totally missed today's run. I am scheduled to do a short tempo run Thursday and 18 miles on Saturday. I hope this calf thing is a very temporary cramping situation. I'd rather not miss any more miles.

Of course, if I do miss more miles, everything will be okay. I'll survive. The world will not end. Life will go on. Acceptance. At my AA meeting tonight, we discussed acceptance. How appropriate. The Big Book of AA tells me that acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. It took me awhile to accept that (ironic, I know), but it's true. If I accept the situation, rather than fight it or try to change it, I live with serenity rather than aggravation. Simple, huh? Yep, not always...
