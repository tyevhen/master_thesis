The following is a poem that I wrote sometime in my junior or senior year of high school during a time when I found myself sad and crying a lot.  I had to rework the last verse a bit tonight because it didn't flow quite right, but otherwise the rest is my original work from that time.  Maybe there has been a time in your life when you could relate, or maybe it is now.

"Do You Cry With Me"

I'm crying

My tears, they're blocking my sight    
And I'm stumbling
Though I'm holding on with all my might
I'm still slipping
And my wings just won't take flight
I keep falling, falling
And I'm crying
Do You cry with me?

Which is wrong and which is right?
My head's spinning
Will things turn out to be all right?
I keep doubting
How long can I keep up this fight?
I feel like quitting, quitting
And I'm crying
Do You cry with me?

Though it's day it feels like night
My heart's hurting
Darkness shuts out all the light
No use searching
What once was peace has turned to fright
I can't stop trembling, trembling
And I'm crying
Do You cry with me?

When my tears flow as I hide
You cry with me
All  emotions kept inside
You still truly see me
You'll always stay right by my side
You just love me....
...when I'm crying

And I'm crying
And You cry with me.

Thank you Jesus
