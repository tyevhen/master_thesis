I guess I should have expected it. Wacky thinking for more than one week couldn't lead to anything but. I should have expected it's arrival. Maybe I wished for a different outcome, but no. It's setting in. It's here. Hopelessness.

Hopeless. I hate the word. I hate the feeling. Yet here I sit ready for work with tears in my eyes feeling heavier and heavier. Maybe the stupid car, which is really no big deal, was the straw that broke through and released it. Maybe the thinking finally wore me out. I fought it and fought it, but eventually...well, maybe I've reached my limit. No matter the cause. I'm feeling heavy. I'm feeling hopeless.

Another foe in this wide world of mental treachery, I will fight it, too.
