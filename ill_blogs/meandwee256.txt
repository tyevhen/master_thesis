Here's a snippet from a fun day. She want on to laugh in her crib for about a half hour during her "nap." I could hear her saying "nutty nutty" to herself through chuckles. It's a different day as I write this and she's chattering away in her crib...not napping as she should be. She sang the bye-bye song to her belongings (bye-bye curtain, it's time to go home now, etc.) and is making declarations about things. I can't make out what she's saying; but she definitely sounds sure about it.
