Obviously, one of my New Year's resolutions is to be less anxious in '09. Part of my strategy involves boosting my self-esteem. My counselor sees my low self-esteem and self-worth as feeding into my anxiety. This makes sense, especially since I have a lot of anxiety about "failing" in life. So I'm ending '08 and beginning '09 with a self-commitment to appreciate and value myself.
