Today.

Twenty six years ago
today.

It was the end,
and I was so, so relieved.

I can still feel
that
relief.

Today.

Twenty six years ago
today.

I didn't end,
and yet, I was relieved.

I can still feel
that
relief
too.

Happy
re-birth-day
to
me.

...if you consider suicide and option
I get it.
please, call someone.
anyone.
now.
