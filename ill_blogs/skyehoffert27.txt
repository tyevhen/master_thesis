I was tagged by Sarah@ Ink and Paper Tall Ship who is somehow managing to blog and go to college at the same time. She is remarkable.

1.What book kept you up all night reading?
  More than one let me tell you. Solitary by Travis Thrasher, kept me up late, because I was trying to figure out what was going on. It was also very creepy.

2.What books make you scared to fall asleep?
 House by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker, I think this one only did because I was far too young for it when I read it. I think I was 11 when I read it.

3.What book almost put you to sleep?
 Reading tends to put me to sleep, so I actually fell asleep reading, The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern I actually am really enjoying it though. The imagery is top notch.

4.What book has you tossing and turning in anticipation for its release?
Every Word by Ellie Marney, I loved the first book Every Breath. Its a modern Sherlock Holmes retelling and even though Watson is a girl in it, which made it a bit more steamy than I would have liked. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it just released, but I am no where near a book store.

 5.What book has your dream boyfriend/girlfriend?
 Oh, well not to use a book twice but James Mycroft, from Every Breath. Who is basically Sherlock in a much more age appropriate form. or Chris Buckley from Solitary Tales, is another favorite but I would probably end up being sacrificed.

6.What book world would be your worst nightmare to live in?
The Maze Runner comes to mind, I would die. Me and running don't mix.

7.What book has a nightmarish cliffhanger?
 The Raven Boys by Meggie Stiefvater, I had to go out and get the second one right away.

8.What book cover reminds you of nighttime?

Ink Spell its blue.

 9.What book have you actually dreamed about?

None actually,  which saddens me.

 10.What book monster would you not want to find under your bed?

Barrow Down from Lord of the Rings
