River rafting! Who knew it could be this much fun! Wow! I knew this was something I wanted to do, but it wasn't really high on the bucket list. It was one of those it would be cool if it happened, but I wasn't planning to go out of my way to make it happen items. Two hours later, I was screaming, "Let's do it again!!"
The rivers in Northern Colorado are at their highest level, and therefore running faster than they have in years! We had to duck our heads to safely get under bridges! It was incredible; a total adrenaline rush. I was almost bounced out of the raft once, and I was bounced on to the floor of it twice. Like I said, "Wow!"
I was reading about mindfulness earlier. If you need help focusing, meditating, or remaining mindful, I highly recommend a "scenic" ride down your nearest high water, fast flowing, roiling river. I think you will find, as I did, little time to focus on anything other than the whitewater in your face.

Of course you are free to seek a second opinion.
See you downstream.
