What a sweet day we had yesterday! To celebrate Lily's 5th birthday, we invited three of her friends over for a tea party. Lily loves to have tea parties, but she's only ever had them with me or her daddy so it was so fun for her to have a "big girl" tea party with her friends.


I had so much fun getting ready for the tea. Granted I kind of waited until the day before to throw it all together as far as the food and decorations, but it all pulled together nicely.

My signature cupcakes.


One of two cute, brand new tablecloths I scored at an estate sale a couple of years ago. Perfect for the pink occasion yesterday was.

Sugar cubes all the way from Ukraine. We brought these home with us last summer. The whole box of cubes cost us under $1.00 American.

Elegant white fabric napkins tied up with delicate pink ribbon. The placemat is just a piece of pretty scrapbook paper. Actually, three out of four of the placemats survived so I can use them again in the future. Yay!


Tea cups for each girl.



Chicken salad on wheat heart-shaped bread. The girls loved that the sandwich was heart-shaped.



Pink and white were the colors of the day.


I used the fabric balls I had made for Lily's room a few years back and used them to decorate the table.


First activity of the party - dress up.




Of course, every girl needs a princess crown...


Then I painted all the little fingernails pink.


Then it was time for lunch and tea. I tried to throw in a few small etiquette lessons during our time at the table.

Time for tea!


Lighting a candle for the birthday girl...

Happy birthday to you darling girl!






After lunch we enjoyed quietly reading some books...


...and coloring...


And then we made some beaded jewelry...


Some more reading...

And then it was time for everyone to go home.

We had so much fun today! I can't wait to have another one!

Have a blessed Thursday!
