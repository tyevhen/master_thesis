More Than Words® — The Hanen Program® for Parents of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder
As a parent, you know how challenging it can be for your child with Autism Spectrum Disorder to interact meaningfully with others and connect with the world around him.
The More Than Words Program was designed specifically for parents of children ages 5 and under on the autism spectrum. Addressing the unique needs of these children, the program provides parents with the tools, strategies and support they need to help their children reach their full communication potential.
More Than Words does this by empowering you to help your child reach the following three goals:
Improved social skills
The ability to engage in back-and-forth interactions
Improved understanding of language
I have been attending this class I think since early October?  First, there are many people who have had to bend over backwards to help me make this happen- Rhonda my amazing coworker and one of my closest friends, thank you so so much for covering my cases while I took a half day every Friday!  And although she doesn't read I'm pretty sure, I need to thank my boss Val for her flexibility in letting me take my vacation time in a rather nontraditional manner.  And my mama- thank you for getting Jack off of the bus most weeks since I couldn't get home in time- once again you came to the rescue. 

Has Nathan made tremendous progress through this program?  I don't really know how to answer that.  He has made progress, yes, no question.  But I think that while this program definitely helped him, it has helped me even more.  To understand Nathan.  He may not be talking very much at this point but he is definitely communicating!  It's almost like this class has helped me interpret his way of communicating.  And it also helped me to accept where he is, and anticipate what will come next.  I understand more thoroughly now that I NEED to invade Nathan's private world.  He cannot be allowed to stay there- basically I need to get in his face, force him to interact with me.  Because he would be happy playing with a ribbon all day.  So I am figuring out how to pull more out of him.  And that is priceless.

This class has also served as a support system in many ways- parents comparing and sharing their experiences, venting about frustrations and at times sharing sadness.  It has been through this class that I have come to realize that while Nathan's "play" is not "typical", he is not the only child that loves to play with tissues, ribbons, and leaves.  He is not the only child who loves to just run laps...and laps...and laps.  These behaviors are actually pretty darn common in kids on the spectrum.  I think I knew this in theory before the class, but being around other real families having similar experiences has been very helpful.  I hope and pray that I am able to keep in touch with people I really connected with- I am actually not too worried about that.  Think it's a pretty sure thing- we need each other.  Good autism mommy friends are hard to find  :-)
