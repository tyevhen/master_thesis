During my ten mile run this morning I was feeling grateful. I was feeling grateful for my recent run of feeling well, feeling great even, which made another decrease in my meds possible. I always love it when I can decrease my medication and still feel well. I was feeling grateful for my psychiatrist and thinking I really needed to let her know again how much I appreciate her. I was feeling grateful for the friends I had just run 8 of my 10 miles with, friends I only knew through running and only socialized with around running, but friends I otherwise would not have met. I was feeling grateful for the ability to run and for the opportunity to run marathons in many cities across many states. I may not have the nicest house or the fanciest car, but I've been able to travel and run, and I'm grateful for that. I was feeling grateful for feeling alive, remembering just a few months ago when my whole being, especially my soul, felt nothing. I was walking dead. I marveled at that fact for a bit. This illness continues to amaze me. I may not be the luckiest person, in that I suffer with it, but this morning I felt very lucky. Despite this debilitating illness, right now, today, I feel productive, active and alive. I'm grateful.
