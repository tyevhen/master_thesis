Are you scared to take cipralex?
At the beginning so was I, and i'm a freak control, but when it comes to the bottom line, which is better to suffer this anxiety and panic attack, or to suffer some side effects for a while....



you know the answer, If you can manage without it, than do it , however if you suffer, than you should do something about that too, there are many alternatives you can look into , including hypnosis, NLP, CBT and more, but the best thing to do is to consult your doctor, be brave and honest with yourself and make a decision you can keep up to.
