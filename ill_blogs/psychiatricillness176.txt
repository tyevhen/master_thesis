My car is still really poorly,I have started looking at new cars and I am taking the train to work at the moment.

I really like getting the train as it makes me stick to a routine and stops me working late. I also get to go back to sleep for a while instead of spending over an hour stressed and stuck in traffic. The train is also cheaper so it is better all around.

Iam looking for a new car although I have had to spend about Â£500 just to stop it falling apart. It still needs brakes and tyres and all drying out. The headlights are also messing around now so I just want to get shot of it!
