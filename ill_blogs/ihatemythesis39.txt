By yesterday, all of my problems had built up until I was completely overwhelmed and depressed. This was not some sort of ha-ha mock depression made for blog audiences; this was true physical anguish. I could feel the unhappiness weighing down my extremities and curdling my stomach.

Maybe leaving the house would help:
At Starbucks, all I could do to keep myself together was lean my head against the wall. And eat a chocolate chunk cookie. The cookie helped, but only temporarily. By telling myself, "You're going to be miserable either way, so you might as well get some work done," I was able to make a little progress. This phrase became my mantra.

Maybe going home would help:
Then I went home for the hiding-under-the-covers form of therapy. I guess it worked; I fell asleep. But then I woke up.

Maybe exercise would help:
Feeling a little better, I opted for an exercise class (studies show that a good sweat is about as effective as antidepressants; don't quote me on this). But all I could force myself to do was follow along in little half-movements, and tears kept welling up in my eyes.

Maybe going home would help:
So I left halfway through. (The only other time I've left exercise early is when I had just been hit by a car and my ribs were hurting.) The wettest of my tears dribbled below my sunglasses and then evaporated in the wind as I biked home. Home was no better.

NOTE: Painting is yet again by Banksy. Who knew that a London street artist could understand the pain of a thesis writer so eloquently?
