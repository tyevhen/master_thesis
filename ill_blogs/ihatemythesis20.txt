Two customers just walked in. The story comes out. This place is closing next week. They are sad. I am too. Perhaps I went to Starbucks one too many times myself. I should’ve come here more often. Explains the missing credit card machine and conspicuously blank walls (which were once covered in local art). I don’t want to turn my blog into a cheesy morality tale, but it is said to watch something good and unique shut down. So frequent your local coffee shops when you study, friends. This really is sad. You can help prevent this loss in your town, I guess.

The lady customer just said, “We should’ve come here more often.” Ditto. Ditto to everybody.
