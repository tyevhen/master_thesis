Yesterday was a huge milestone for Paige--her first day of preschool!
And it went excellently. We'd prepared her for a few weeks; letting her know that she'd "go on the bus by herself" and head off to preschool to meet her teacher who'd be waiting at the bus area. We got to go in last week to meet her teacher and play in the class for an hour. That really helped her know what to expect and got her very excited to go back. (I loved it there! And her teacher is so awesome!) So, yesterday, once she got her coat and backpack on she was psyched to go! She ran right up onto the bus and the driver strapped her into the carseat. I told her to have a great day and I would see her very soon when the bus brought her back. She said "bye bye Mammeeee! See you soon!" I ran up to the porch and watched the bus back out of the driveway as she stared out the window at me. I waved and blew her a kiss through tears while she started to wave back.
I don't really know what happened at school since she can't quite articulate all the activities of the day yet, but she seemed bright and happy when she got home. We then had lunch and she had her nap...a looooong nap. Her teacher called me right away in the morning to let me know she got in ok and that she'd settled right in to the day's activities without a problem. Phew! Looks like we're in for a successful school time!
It was hard to say goodbye to my baby and send her off on the bus, but I'm also very happy for her. She's having quite the adventure! And I got some time in the morning to get chores done (and have a slice of leisure time while Noah napped).
She will go 4 days per week (Mon-Thurs) all mornings. 2 of the days will be the full class and 2 of the days will be spent in a small class setting so she can work on social skills and such. I have to get used to having her gone for half of the day; it's too soon! It's too soon!!!! sigh
