Hello, and Happy Wednesday! I had a long work day today, but I got my nap in after work, and now I'm feeling fine. I'm tapering big time this week, so I've been resting on my non-running days, including today. Tomorrow I have a short 3-4 mile run scheduled, and I'll probably do a couple slow miles on Saturday as a final tune-up. Did I mention I'm running a marathon on Sunday?

Life is moving along smoothly. The financial stress I mentioned last week was relieved slightly with a paycheck I received yesterday. My regular job pays me on Friday, and I've got several extra hours coming on that check, so hopefully my relief will be even greater then. I'm working some extra hours this week, too. I think extra hours will be a fact of life far into the future, and as long as I remain stable, that's perfectly fine with me.

I've not much else to say tonight. I'm feeling good. Life is good. I hope for nothing but the same for you.
