I have always enjoyed reading the writings of G. K. Chesterton.

I first began to appreciate his work when I found out that we shared a birthday.

And I also like him because his middle name is Kevin.

Below are some of my fav GKC quotes:

Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a colored pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.

Art, like morality, consists in drawing the line somewhere.

A woman uses her intelligence to find reasons to support her intuition.

Tolerance is the virtue of the man without convictions.

Man does not live by soap alone; and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it.

The trouble with always trying to preserve the health of the body is that it is so difficult to do without destroying the health of the mind.

Christianity has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and not tried.

To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.

The poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.

The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land.

Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.
