Things are continuing to go well. I guess I could complain about my knee, which is still bothering me, but complaining is so useless. Besides, I had a great workout today. If I were able to run as I wished, I would have done 20 miles in preparation for my next marathon, which is now 3 weeks away. But 20 miles was out of the question, so I decided to bike, run and swim instead.

I wanted to work out for three hours, which is approximately how long it would take me to run 20 miles. I began my morning in the pre-dawn light on my bike. As the sun rose, I biked a 34.4 mile loop. It was quite chilly when I began, but by the time I finished, the sun had warmed me nicely. I jumped off my bike and ran 3.6 miles. My knee hurt, but it was tolerable. It was too bad, for I felt like I could have kept running forever. After my run, I drove a couple miles to my gym and got into the pool. I swam one mile. In total, I completed 39 miles in just about three hours. It was a great workout. I had plenty of energy, and switching things up definitely kept me interested throughout.

The rest of my day has been filled with errands, chores, and of course, a nap. I may go to a movie with friends tonight. Tomorrow I have to work. Pretty boring...

That's the problem with feeling well. I have less and less to say. I worry about what to write here. I don't want to bore you. I know some with depression have trouble relating when my life is so "normal." But this is my life with depression. Sometimes it hurts and sucks. And sometimes, as is the case right now, I feel well. So I apologize for having less to say, but I'll keep writing about my boring life as long as you'll have me. Thanks for listening.
