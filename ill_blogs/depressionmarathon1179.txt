I got blindsided by someone today. Totally blindsided...and it hurt. Still hurts. I like spontaneity and surprises, but not like this. I was expecting one thing to go one way, and bam! Totally shocked.

I'm racking my brain to see what I missed. How could I be so totally clueless that this unwanted shocker was on the way? Of course, my first thought was, "God, etta! What an idiot you are!" But now I don't think so. I still FEEL like an idiot, but I don't think I misread anything. I just got blindsided. It was cruel. It hurts. It sucks. And I'm having a hard time dealing with it.

Why are people mean?
Mean people suck.
