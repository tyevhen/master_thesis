I mentioned a few weeks ago that we had our portraits taken.  It was a freezing day and Nate was getting pink eye and crying for most of the session.  You would NEVER guess that looking at these shots.  Not gonna give em all up right now, but can't resist posting a few. 

I just couldn't be happier.  Oh wait, yes I could.  Today Nate said the following:
"I go up"
"go out back"
"go up"
"cat"

ALL NEW!!!
