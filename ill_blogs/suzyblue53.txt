So yesterday I woke up to the wonderful news that I finally have a job! Say hello to Kurt Geiger's newest employee! I am absolutely over the moon!! Within seconds of finding out I will be earning my own money again, I was straight over to my laptop, looking up all of the pretty things i'm going to treat myself to come payday! I don't know how much i'm expecting to be paid here...I think i've built my expectations of how much I'm actually going to be making a little high, so maybe this wishlist will have to span over a few paydays...

Until next time,
Stay classy
