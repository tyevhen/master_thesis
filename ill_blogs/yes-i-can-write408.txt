You know how in pop-culture magazines (I only ever read those when my grandma finishes hers and passes them on to me. Honest!) they have an "In and Out" feature thingy for each new season (and possibly each new year... I haven't really payed attention to that)? Well, I thought it would be fun to have my own Ins and Outs, things I've personally changed or gotten rid of in my lifestyle, the types of clothes I'm currently wearing, as we head into the year 2009. So here goes!

I think that's about all I can think of for now... I look forward to the new year, and to all it has to offer. I plan on exercising more (I'm a terrible couch potato), and finding some new activities to fill the void left by Cadets. I hope to see greater social change, and more realization that government is not and never will be the solution. I hope to see tons of dialogue between diverse people, all trying to come up with solutions for issues of climate change, corporate control, and human and non-human rights. A lot to wish for, but hey, that's what a new year is for!

Wishing everyone the best in the coming year and beyond,

Peace,
Idzie
