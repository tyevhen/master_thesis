make sure you write a diary or fill up an excel file, or post in your blog or whatever, just keep record of everything that's going on, every minor change, its really important!



you should include the following parameters:
1. sex ( from 1 - 10 how much sex intrest you and how are your....)
2. toilet ( any problem with that? write em down)
3. control ( how much do you feel in control from 1 to 10)
4. feeling ( how do you feel from 1 to 10)

do this everyday, at least for the first three month so you can make sure you progress according to your plan, if there's any problem which is not limited time side effects... than you will easily notice it, mark it and keep following, if doesn't change after a month talk to your doctor about it.

hope this helps
