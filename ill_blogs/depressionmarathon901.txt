It's my birthday. Guess how old I am? Old enough, that's for sure!

I'm actually kind of excited about this birthday. Usually, being a single person, I don't do much of anything for my birthday. But this year, I'm having two birthday events! Tonight I'm having dinner with several sober friends--I didn't even know I had several friends--and then we're going to a concert. Tomorrow I'm having lunch with my friend Renee and some other running pals. I'm anxious to get through work today so we can start celebrating.

I'm so fortunate to have all of these wonderful people in my life. With depression, it's often difficult to connect with others, or even to remember anyone cares. Today I'm feeling very grateful for the connections I've made, and for the people who care about me. I'm lucky, indeed.
