I got interviewed for an article on pricing on Etsy. Today it's on the homepage and I was quoted and everything. I'm thrilled and excited (and grateful!).
Pricing my items has been an ever-evolving process. Creating hand-made means you take on all the overhead for supplies, time, shipping and marketing efforts. It also means you put your level of expertise into the mix. The customer gets something made of quality, love, care and attention. In the end, you hope someone values what you make and sees a little of themselves in it.

And just because, here is a photo of Noah feeling proud of his animal parade.
