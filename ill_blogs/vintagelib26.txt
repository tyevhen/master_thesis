This skirt is one of my absolute favourite vintage buys. I'm so glad I bought it and had the guts to wear it that first time, because I just feel like a super star in it (so comfy but so stylish!). It's 100% wool, perfect for chilly Canberra winter spring days where you want to rug up but not look like a puff ball. I'm really glad I hung on to the earrings - my granny gave me a bag of her and her friend's old earrings when I was a teenager, and even though I didn't like them then, I hung on to them, and now wear them all the time.
