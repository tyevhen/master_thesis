Feeling failure.
Reeling from failure.
Depression twists facts
into fiction.
Failure first.
Sometimes only failure.
No accomplishments
allowed
in.

No satisfaction in a job well done.
Failure first.
No job ever well done
enough.

Expectations
don't change automatically.
Only constant vigilence
beats the failure
back.

Constant,
wearying vigilence
just
to allow
satisfaction
in.
