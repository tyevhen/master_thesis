I haven't been feeling my best, this past week.  And I'm not quite sure what to do about it.

I think sometimes it's a matter of accepting the darker, less pleasant feelings...  Sadness, depression, frustration, fear...  Accepting those emotions for being there, being real, being valid, and then sitting with them for a bit, instead of pushing them away, trying to pretend they have no right to be there, pretending they don't exist.

Yet at the same time, I feel like I'm using depression as a safety net.  Thinking that because I'm feeling down, I don't have to do the things that frighten or frustrate me.  Letting that keep me in my safe little bubble. 

So I don't trust these feelings, because I don't know how honest they are, and how honest I'm being with myself!  I don't know if I should be accepting and working through these emotions, or simply giving myself a kick in the ass and telling myself to stop whining.  It's a bit of a dilemma, really. 

Peace,
Idzie
