From the When-it-Rains-it-Pours-Department: My first words this morning were, "Uh-oh." As soon as I threw off my bed covers I felt it. Cold! I quickly checked the thermostat and my worst fear was realized. No heat. After throwing on multiple layers of clothing, clamoring to the basement, and fiddling with a piece of machinery of which I know nothing, I made the dreaded call.

Now here I sit, typing with gloved fingers, waiting for the furnace experts to arrive. I can only imagine how much this will cost me! With every ounce of my being I want to scream, "Why?!! Why me? Why now? Didn't you notice that previous post, the one about financial stress? Why?" But screaming those thoughts would be futile. So here I sit, with gloved fingers, waiting for the experts to arrive.

This bothers me on so many levels. I hate being cold, and I've been cold a lot this winter. I've been turning my heat up lately. I hate being incapable, and I am incapable of fixing this. I hate having to rely on others, especially others who can take advantage of the situation and charge you an arm and a leg just to show up!
I hate having to wait. The expert may show up in five minutes or five hours. And most of all, I hate being stressed about money!  Like I said, this situation is a multi-faceted pain in the ass!

Life. Ain't it grand? And did I mention I'm running 20 miles today? Outside? In the cold? UGH!!! This is not how I wanted to start my day! Ahhh...life.
