The Sea and Cake produce a unique emotional combination in the listener that I like to call "melancholy chill." Take a gander and tell me if you don't feel a strangely calming squeeze of sadness in your chest. It's as if the band has captured the exact sound of a yoga instructor's reaction to the end of the world. And since graduate students often feel intimate with the coming apocalypse, this makes nice study music.
