Poem for the Start of a New Day


                      The state you leave your bed

will reflect the state of your head.

So, make your bed and do your hair.

Do you hair and youâ€™ll think fair.

 
To go even farther, I would say,

brush your teeth for a productive day.

To top it all off, eat your breakfast food.

Breakfast will put you in a good mood.

                  These little things that you can do,

will show yourself that you love you!
