Forever being a music lover has meant that it has been a big part of my recovery. I thought I would share some songs which have been very close to my heart during the times of battling with my anxiety and depression. Here are my top 5:

1. I believe - Christina Perri

2. Don't give up the fight - Racoon

3. Unsinkable - Lucy Spraggan

4. This isn't everything you are - Snow Patrol

5. Recovery - James Arthur
