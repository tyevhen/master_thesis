Its been a month since I've started taking cipralex, I feel a change is going on, feel bit more secured, the anxiety is gone for now.
I talk more often and manage to avoid pointless argues with myself and others...
I can still get to orgasm and actually it even feel better ;)
Just incase you were wondering...



I'm more aware of myself and in a way trying to be less.
will keep you updated.
but still no major change in my life...Maybe I should wait some more...
stay tuned...
bye for now
