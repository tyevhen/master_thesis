I had the opportunity to work this week. I worked three, four hour shifts. The good news is I'm doing okay despite the stress of working. In fact, it didn't feel so stressful this week. That's a change for the better. I was pretty anxious prior to the first shift I worked on Wednesday, but my anxiety subsided soon after my shift began, and I was able to focus on working. It helps that I work with wonderful people who were happy to see me back. I'm lucky.

In general, I've been doing well. I'm feeling good. My mood has remained stable. I've been taking care of what needs to be taken care of lately. Running my errands, completing my housework (not all at once), tapering for Boston, and going to meetings. It's so nice when life is easy, when the grip of depression is loose and there is light in my world. I'm grateful.

I continue to be humbled and honored by you, my readers. Your comments surprise and satisfy me. I am so happy to hear my simple writings make a difference in your lives. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
