Right now I am all alone in my bedroom and all is quiet. The baby is sleeping, my husband is away giving someone a ride home, and I have been reading old posts from this blog and reading all of the warm heartfelt comments that readers have left me. I am filled right now with a real sense of peace. That's sometimes hard to come by, and with it being so much easier to complain about everything that is wrong in life, I thought it would be nice to note the good things too. Like peace. Even if it is only for a brief moment, before reality sets in again, before the baby starts to cry or the basketball game gets turned on and the chaos begins. Its a nice feeling, like I am right where I am supposed to be. And it's all of you who has brought me that peace, so thank you. Even though I have never met any of you, we are a tight little family in our own way where we can be open and honest. I read one post where I thought, oh no what if so and so read this and knew it was me? But then I realized there is something very liberating about being so open and honest. And I think opening up on this blog has really helped me because then I no longer have to bottle it up inside. Its no longer a secret. And that leaves me feeling at peace.

Wishing you all a little peace for your new year.
