So, it's been a few months.

I really haven't known what to do with this blog. It didn't serve it's purpose for me; I don't feel any better for maintaining it aside from the occasional email I get from a reader who finds something worthwhile in it.

I'm still heading down. I don't know how to stop it. But, someone might get something out of that so I'm going to try again to keep up with it.

Just saying that I'm back; I've succumbed to what seems to be a lifetime of miserable self-doubt and hate. But, I'll be telling you all about it.

That should be fun, right?
