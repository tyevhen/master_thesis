I've been having a lot of fun lately putting together this new line of chic original art...
They are small abstract squares (some are 5x5 inches and some are 6x6) of high end watercolor paper painted with Holbein Acryla Gouache (ultra fine paints that act like a really rich opaque watercolor).
I love putting happy colors together to see how they harmonize...and the results are so pretty and impactful! I love the surprise as each painting unfolds to life.







To increase the style and glam factor, I added bits of gold leaf (or silver leaf where applicable) to the design. I think it adds a delicate gleam that makes the pieces much more special.





These are all one-of-a-kind and totally affordable! I'm selling these original small abstracts for $45 each, unframed. It saves my collectors money to be able to choose their own frame and not pay for my markup. It also saves in shipping costs. These are small, but the frame makes all the difference! Also, you can put more than one together and fill an empty wall quite nicely! I only have 6 for sale now, but plan on making a ton more so that collectors can choose several in one colorway at once. I'm also taking custom orders for these if you want your own special color combination! I also think I'm going to offer a line of these at a larger 8x8 inch size for a higher cost.






I can really see these adding a special punch to a chic nursery or to a stylish glam teen's bedroom. I'm definitely making several for myself for my own master bedroom and bathroom. I want something that isn't everywhere else, you know? Something pretty and soothing.



 

Anyway, I wanted to share my excitement with you and I'll let you know when more paintings are listed in my shop. I hope you like them too!!! I welcome your feedback in the comments!
