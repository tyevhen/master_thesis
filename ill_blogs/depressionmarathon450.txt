I just heard back from Google regarding the dope who plagiarized 70, that's seventy, of my 2010 blog posts. Here's the Google Team's message,

That was certainly good news to receive, but it came with a caveat. The process of reporting plagiarism to Google requires the complainant to fill out a form with the specific URL of the original content followed by the specific URL of the copied content. I sent them 5 sets of URLs and explained that those were just 5 of the 70 posts which were plagiarized. I asked that they disable the plagiarist's entire site based on those 5 examples, as Google states they will disable entire accounts of "repeat offenders."

Unfortunately, based on their e-mail, it appears Google is only going to disable access to the 5 URLs which I provided. Therefore, it appears I will have to copy and paste all 70 original URLs and then copy and paste all 70 copied URLs into another complaint form.

It is going to be a very time consuming project, and I'm not sure when I will have that kind of time! It's really maddening that this jerk copied 70 of my original posts with a couple clicks of his mouse, and I'll have to spend hours to get it erased! It's daunting just thinking about it. But if that's what I have to do, that's exactly what I'll do. I'd certainly like to get my hands on the plagiarist, though!
