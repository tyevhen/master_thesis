Well, I've finally taken the plunge and gotten a blog. Which is ironic considering I'm a web developer by trade and have built blogs for OTHER people, but never for myself. I took the easy way out and went with Blogger rather than setting up a custom WordPress site, which sounded too much like work. I just want to write stuff, you know?

I've been thinking seriously of getting a blog for the last several months. The thing that finally pushed me over the edge was finding out that my friend SallyMandy was writing a cool blog on a variety of interesting subjects. I've known Sally for over 10 years, but had no idea she was a blogger until a couple of months ago (thanks Facebook).

Seeing her write from her heart finally made me feel like I have something to say too, although I don't know what it is or how it's going to come out. I feel I have a lot to say about recovery, suffering, childhood, and family-of-origin issues, along with sexuality and emotional and spiritual growth.

Sally, you were the impetus for all this, so THANKS!
