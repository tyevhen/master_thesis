Yesterday night I had a terrible migraine that lasted until this morning, I could not take advil or any pills to cure my headache, eventually I threw up in the middle of the night, and the pain after almost 24 hrs is gone...

I've research the internet for cipralex and advil and such pills mixed together and everyone are against it...so I decided to use tea, black coffee and hot showers, which worked well...



I'm meeting my doctor next will , I will ask him what can you do in such cases and keep you posted with more details about what can you do if you suffer headaches and such while on cipralex so keep visiting my cipralex blog for more details about that and more.

remember that if you have any questions about how should cipralex feel like, what's the best time of day to take it and cipralex with specific phobias this is the place to get that info, feel free to ask and comment.
