I gotta pee, but my rommate is FINALLY cleaning the bathroom. Well, I obviously can't pee while he/she is in there, and I don't want to interrupt him/her from this all-important job. But I really gotta pee! And there is nowhere else to go. I will just hold it.

But I REALLY GOT TO PEE.

Ah, one day, I will graduate and be an adult who has a private bathroom. This is yet another way that my thesis is holding me back from the rest of my life.
