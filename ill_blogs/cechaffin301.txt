We returned from Rachel's memorial with our youngest daughter and her friend, "Barfie," in tow.

It's a great comfort to have Sarah with me now; neither of us can fill the hollow left by Rachel's death, but it helps to have Sarah fill her own space.

Rachel is more defined by what she has left behind in us, a retreating, conforming space like a death mask or a mold for making a bronze.

I've never had so much space missing before.

I believe I am in grief, not the dreaded other condition.

After 12 hours of travel yesterday, Kathleen bravely woke and went to work. My idol.

Sarah and Barfie enjoy picking blackberries. They're city girls.

On a more important note, I want to thank all of you who have spiritually supported us during this time; rarely have I felt so supernaturally buoyed by the prayers of others.
