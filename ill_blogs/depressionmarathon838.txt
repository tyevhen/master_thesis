I'm watching an amazing program on PBS right now called The Misunderstood Epidemic: Depression. The film is by Susan Polis Schutz, a fellow sufferer of depression. It follows 12 people and families who have dealt with depression. There's a woman here talking about losing her physical therapy job. There's a family discussing the death of their daughter. There's a woman talking about the dilemma of dating. These people are speaking my language! How incredibly refreshing to see me, my life, portrayed so accurately on television. Check your local PBS affiliate, as many stations are apparently replaying this film multiple times.
