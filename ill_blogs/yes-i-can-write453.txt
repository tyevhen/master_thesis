So, today is finally the last day before Not Back To School Camp. I'm still stressed, still exited. Will it be a Life Changing Experience? Just plain fun? Will I like it? Will I make friends? All that should be answered tomorrow, or the following days... I just really, truly hope I can make some great connections there. Meet awesome people. But I'm so scared that my expectations are too high, and so I won't enjoy it! *Sigh* Wish me luck, and a safe trip, and I'll most likely have a super long post when I come back! :-) Peace.
