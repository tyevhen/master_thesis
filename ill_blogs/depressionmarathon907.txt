It's been snowing and snowing and snowing all day long. I love it, although I may feel differently in a couple hours. I'm about to go outside and shovel the 6 inches in my driveway, and I have a long driveway! The way it's snowing now, there will be at least another 6 inches by morning.

The snow, or maybe the extra sleep I got last night, energized me today. I went for a 5.3 mile run with Puck this morning! Great news: No left leg or calf pain. Bad news: My right knee hurts! Can't win. After my AA meeting tonight, I swam for 30 minutes. Two workouts in one day. Not typical for me, but it worked today.

I love running in the snow. I love the noise running shoes make on snow. It's kind of a quiet squeaking noise. And I love watching Puck leave happy footprints in the white stuff. He was practically smiling throughout our run today. Unencumbered joy...that's my boy!

Speaking of my boy, I spoke to the vet tech today about his biopsy. Apparently the lab wants to slice the sample into smaller pieces for examination, so we won't know the results until later this week. Keep those prayers coming, please. I don't want him to be sick. I want him smiling and unencumbered for as long as possible!
