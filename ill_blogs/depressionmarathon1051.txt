Three quotes which struck me this weekend:

Garrison Keillor on March in Minnesota: "March. The month God created so that people who don't drink would know what a hangover feels like."

Summarized from page 230 of The Big Book of AA: I discovered in pointing out the wrong attitudes and actions of others that I was really pointing out my own wrong attitudes and actions. If I expected others to change, I would have to work on changing myself, too.

Stephanie, yoga instructor extraordinaire: "Sometimes life is good. Sometimes, ahhhh... not so much."
