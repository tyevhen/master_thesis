I could fill this first paragraph with a stream of obscenities so profane it would curl your toenails. I am so angry! Why? Why does someone feel the need to blow people up? Why mar a beautiful, peaceful, celebratory event like The Boston Marathon? Does it fill an ego with pride to permanently alter the lives of others? To blow off the limbs of innocent spectators? What sense does that make? To kill an 8-year-old child? A child whose only sin was watching a race, perhaps even watching a parent, participate in one of running's greatest events? Why?

I first saw the horrendous footage from Boston as I was working with a patient in his apartment. It was all I could do to remain focused. The pictures literally took my breath away. I almost threw up. While I'm not in Boston this year, I have many friends who ran today. My mind immediately went to them. Fortunately, Facebook recently confirmed they are all okay.

The bomb at the finish line blew at 4:09:43. Someone researched this. That's a fairly average finishing time, thus insuring maximum impact. Boylston Street, which is the last half mile of the race, is also likely packed with more spectators in closer proximity to each other than anywhere else on the course. I've been on that street. I've run across that finish line. In fact, last year I believe I crossed that finish line around 4:10. That could have been me in the middle of those horrifying pictures.

I'm safe. It appears my friends and their families are safe. For that, I'm grateful. There are at least two families who will never see their loved one again. Multiple spectators, whose limbs were literally torn off by the blast, will never have the same life again. A beautiful, historical, celebration was turned into a grizzly slaughterhouse. Why? What is the point? Senseless. Absolutely senseless.
