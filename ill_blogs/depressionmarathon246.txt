Life is moving forward. I'm hanging on for the very slow ride. I'm feeling a little better. Maybe? Actually, I'm not sure. At least I'm not feeling worse. I'm hanging in there, I think. I continue to work 4-6 hours every other day. It's been a bit overwhelming, especially at the start of each day, but once I've gotten going my patients have kept me distracted. My exercise has slowed again, but I did get a run/walk in tonight. I ran 4 minutes and walked 1 minute for a total of 3 miles. That was my first run this week. It wasn't much, and it was slow, but I did it even though I felt like staying on the sofa. I see my doctor tomorrow. She's thinking of changing my meds. That process scares me, but I'm willing to do anything to feel better. This has been a long, slow stretch of not feeling entirely well, and I'm getting tired. But I'm hanging on, moving slowly forward, trying not to fall off the ride. Hang in there with me, my friends.
