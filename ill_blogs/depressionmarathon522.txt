It's Monday. It's a much needed rest day for me. No exercise, just work. I can't even walk Puck tonight. It's just too hot and sticky outside! Oh well, like I said, I needed a rest day.

I'm coming off a good weekend. As planned, I got up early and ran 20 miles Saturday morning. I'm still a little stunned it went as well as it did. Of course, I was tired and my legs were dead in the last couple miles, but overall I felt good, held a nice pace, and recovered very well. I was able to spend the rest of my day relaxing, socializing, and walking with Puck.

I worked at the hospital yesterday. It's my very part-time weekend gig. I ended up with some really nice, motivated patients. The day wasn't too long, and I got in a 25 minute recovery swim after I was done. At the end of the day I had another lovely walk with my boy. It was a nice end to a nice weekend. Things are moving right along, and I'm doing all right.

By the way, thank you for all of your comments on my last post. I really appreciate that you can appreciate my boring posts. I do hope that by doing well, I can inspire others to survive, and perhaps even thrive, despite having depression. Have a great week, everyone!
