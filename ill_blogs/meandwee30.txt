I've been really enjoying creating these abstract paintings! I call them jewelry for your walls. I really believe it's possible to have original art at affordable prices to add something unique to your home that is one-of-a-kind. I'm kinda passionate about that. Original paintings have a soul that you will not get in a manufactured print. Here's some paintings I'm hoping to sell at tomorrow's artisan fair that I'm participating in I mentioned in an earlier post. Otherwise, they are for sale in my shop.
