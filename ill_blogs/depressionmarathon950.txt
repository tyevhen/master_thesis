Live music blares
speakers
the size of buildings
the football stadium rocks

Cheers deafen
as another group
finishes the walk

Memorial placards
honor loved ones
Their journey over
years too soon

Survivors are noted
by silver t-shirts
and even some caps

Rather than scorn
ridicule
and fear
those survivors are welcomed
loved
slapped on the back

Long gone
the days
when mental illness
meant suffering
alone

Corporate sponsors
local businesses
moms, dads, grandmas, and kids
proudly participate

Thousands
of people
Millions
of dollars

The walk
is a smashing success
Eventually
mental illness
will surely be cured
