We got our first dusting of snow overnight. I love running in the snow, although I'm not thrilled about the cold. I went indoors last night, rode the stationary bike and lifted weights at the gym. I swam on Sunday and plan to swim again today. I do hate getting into that pool when it's cold outside. Those first moments are always chilly. My leg feels a lot better though, so I'm going to continue resting it for a few more days.

I had to take Puck to the vet on Tuesday. He's had a small, round, hard bump inside his mouth for the past couple months. It was almost between two of his front bottom teeth. I figured he got something stuck between his teeth, had some inflammation, and it would eventually pass. It didn't. Unfortunately, the vet said it could be a tumor. He sedated Puck, excised the bump and sent it off to the University of Minnesota lab for analysis. Of course, I'm worried. The vet said he'd call me with the results "in a few days." Say a little prayer for my boy if you are so inclined. Thanks.

I had my chat with my assistant at work yesterday. As expected, she was more interested in rationalizing her faulty techniques than she was in listening to feedback. There was unnecessary tension throughout the office afterward. I've been replaying what I said and how I could have said it better ever since the chat. I could have, should have, been more directive than I was. We'll see if anything changes. I hope so. I don't want to have to do this again.

I'm off to do some online Christmas shopping before jumping in the pool.
May the sun warmly shine within your heart throughout the day. Have a great day everyone!
