Hi friends!
Today I'm showing you the last of my newest affordable art nursery prints. I'm already planning and brainstorming the next wave...if you have any animals you'd like to see be sure to leave a comment and I'll consider the idea in my next round of illustrations. I want to make the things YOU would like to see and have on your walls.
Now, on to this print:
Sam the Polar Bear and Silas the Penguin are best friends. They find themselves in all kinds of funny predicaments due to them being polar opposites! I think there will be more illustrations of them to come. In this little situation, Sam and Silas simply wanted to ride the seesaw together. What they didn't plan on, however, is the ride Silas got when Sam sat down. Whoops!

You can find the print and all the others at the MeandWee Etsy shop!
