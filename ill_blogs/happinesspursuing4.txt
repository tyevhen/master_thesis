It's been a while since I said anything. Things have not been good for me personally or professionally but I'm surviving. I have no patience for people whining about their life's circumstances so I won't bore you with mine.

So, here's a quote I stumbled upon:
"You can accept or reject the way you are treated by other people. But until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed. You can bandage the bleeding with food, with alcohol, with drugs, with work, with cigarettes, with sex, but eventually, it will all ooze through and stain your life. You must find the strength to open the wounds, stick your hands inside, pull out the core of the pain that is holding you in your past, the memories, and make peace with them." ~ Iyanla Vanzant

I don't know if I can do that but it sounds pretty good.
