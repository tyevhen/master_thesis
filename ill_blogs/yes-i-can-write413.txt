I love poetry. I have for a very long time. From the time I was little my mom would read to my sister and I. She'd read EVERYTHING! Fiction, poetry, the newspaper... So before I was even reading books more advanced then readers on my own, I was writing poetry. Soon, I was reading and memorizing poetry. When I was eight or nine I memorized all of The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes, and wowed all of the parents when I recited it at a homeschooling talent show. :-P Last night, my mom and I got talking, and I wondered if I could still recite The Highwayman. I got most of the way through before I stumbled, so pulled out one of my poetry books to see where I was going wrong. And once I had a poetry book in my hands, of course I couldn't read just one! I read all of The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe, which in my opinion is a great read aloud poem with a really cool rhythm to it, and The Solitary Reaper by William Wordsworth. The verse:

"What'er the theme, the maiden sang
As if her song could have no ending;
I saw her singing at her work,
And o'er the sickle bending;
I listened, motionless and still;
And as I mounted up the the hill,
The music in my heart I bore,
Long after it was heard no more."

Is truly beautiful, as far as I'm concerned. I also discovered I still know Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening by Robert Frost perfectly. "Whose woods these are I think I know, his house is in the village though"... By the time I got to bed, it was 3:00 am!

I also wrote a new poem last night, which can be found on my poetry blog as usual. When I read the masters, my poetry just looks so awful in comparison...

Oh, and yesterday my mom cleaned out a drawer, and of course my cat thought that the empty hole created by the lack of a drawer was the perfect place to hang out in. Minni is just so darned cute and lovable! :-)



Peace,
