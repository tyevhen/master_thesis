I found out tonight that the domain name, depressionmarathon.com, which I thought I owned, and for which I have been paying the last three years, is being used by somebody else. It's not a real big deal, but it is frustrating. I reserved the name when I began this blog. I reserved it, and have been paying to keep it inactive, so that I would own it if I ever wanted to move to my own website (i.e. off of Blogger). How it got into somebody else's hands, I do not know. It was supposed to automatically renew every year. They (the hosting company) have certainly been charging me every year! Now I'm not too smart when it comes to stuff like this, but I thought this was pretty straightforward, and I thought I was doing what I needed to do to keep depression marathon mine. Apparently not.

I suppose I should be honored someone thought enough of my site that they went out and stole the name. But I'm just frustrated. I'd hate to have people think that was my site. I certainly doubt they are making any money off of it! Maybe they hope I'll come begging to buy the name back. Nope. That won't happen either. So it's just an annoyance. And I guess it prohibits me from ever navigating away from blogspot.com, but that probably wasn't going to happen either. Obviously, I don't understand this whole domain system well enough to do that!
