I hate writing about this, but my social worker suggested it might help. She thought it might normalize what I've been experiencing. She suggests it's likely many of you experience it, too. I don't know. I hate to admit it. So I hope she's right.

My brain is broken. That's what it feels like. I've been having trouble with my thinking. Violent thoughts, disturbing thoughts, and discouraging thoughts have been intruding on me lately. I'm still doing well. My mood is good. I'm running well. Work is okay. So there seems no reason for the thinking except that it is one of my symptoms which occasionally pops up. And I hate it.

Thinking like this disturbs me. The thoughts are disturbing. I have violent, horrible thoughts about Puck getting hurt and not being able to do anything about it. I have irrational thoughts about a substance spilled on a bridge being some sort of flesh eating acid. I have discouraging thoughts about being inept, not good enough, stupid, lazy, etc... The thought content disturbs me.

Also disturbing, and maybe even more so, is simply having the intrusive thoughts. They make me feel different, abnormal, and crazy. They spur ranting and raving about wanting to be normal. They scare me, anger me, and worry me. I hate them. I just want them to go away.

There, I said it. I guess it would help if any of you can relate. My social worker tried to calm me down today during at least one of my rants. She tells me these thoughts are not as abnormal as I fear. Aren't they? I don't know. I hope she's right.
