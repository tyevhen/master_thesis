Is depression like the flu?
Or maybe pneumonia?
Is there a finite beginning, middle and end?

Are there bouts of illness and periods of relief?
We feel better, but we're never cured.

When is depression over?
Has anyone else considered this?
Or is this another rumination of one ill brain?
How do we know when we're better?
Are we ever cured?
