Today, I have no positivity, no do-better-next-time, and no encouragement for anyone else.  I am questioning everything.  I am miserable.  I am ready to quit.

Is this just a bump in the road?  Is this what they call a setback or growing pains?  It feels like more.

I guess I’ve always known that I would have to struggle with depression and anxiety for the rest of my life.  But these last several weeks have taken a turn for the worse.

I thought I was managing well.  I thought I had coping skills for this kind of thing.  But, nothing seems to be going right.  At least, nothing seems to be going my way.

I know this difficulty is rooted in the fact that I “feel” too fat to be loved and too fat to do the things I want to do.  It’s time to lose weight.  I’ll be happy again when I am thin.

These lies are relentless and I am so tired of fighting them.

How do I know when enough is enough?  What if my symptoms get worse?  Will I know if I should go back on the medication?

I really don’t want to go back to the way I was.

If you’ve noticed, I haven’t been blogging as much lately because, well, I haven’t been doing very well.  Life is tough for me at the moment.  I feel like I must always end my posts on a positive note, with some kind of encouragement, or resolution to do better.  So, I feel like I shouldn’t be posting at all right now.

Hang with me as I go through this - whatever it is.  Hopefully I’ll find it back – whatever it was.

Prayers are appreciated.  I’ll be praying for you too.
