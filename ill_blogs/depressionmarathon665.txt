For whatever reason, on this last day of May, I spent a lot of time reflecting today. And my reflections led to gratitude. It all began with my morning speed workout. I ran 7 x 800 meters. I thanked God for the ability to run as I wished. I thanked him for the lung capacity and the muscles to run fast. I thanked him for the beautiful sun and the trail through the woods. And that's when the reflection began.

I reflected back just 90 days, which was when my recent depression relapse began in earnest. It was only 90 days ago that the slide into suicidal despair started. I reflected on how well I've been feeling lately and thanked God for the night and day difference. I'm grateful today for a quality inpatient psych unit, a doctor who cared, medication, therapy, and yes, even ECT.

It's been less than one month since this recent relapse ended. I'm so appreciative of how good my mood has been over these past few weeks. I don't know why the relapse started. I don't know exactly what caused it to end. It doesn't matter. Taking advantage of the good days, that's what matters now. And that's what I plan to do. I'm grateful for the opportunity.
