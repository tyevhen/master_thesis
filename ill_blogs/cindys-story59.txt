Dedication

For my sister, who has loved me all along.  My sister who I abandoned unknowingly emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually during the years of agonizing depression and darkness in my life.

I don't know if this is what you felt, my sister, but I know I would have felt it for you.  I cried tears every moment as I wrote this, catching a glimpses of the pain and abandonment you must have felt.  I am so, so, so sorry my sister.  The tears you shed for me I now hold as precious jewels near my heart.  I love you  forever.

Your sister, Cindy


Together, and yet apart



Where Are You My Sister
by Cindy Wolf


Where are you my sister
I can't find you, why

I see you hiding my sister
    But you wave your hand bye

How are you my sister
I get no reply

Can I help you my sister
My tears join yours as you cry 

I love you my sister
I don't understand why...

...You hurt so my sister
You've shut down inside

Where have you gone my sister
I see no life in your eyes

Please don't leave me my sister
It's as if you have died

Do you not love me my sister
It hurts me so much inside

God, please bring back my sister
Fill the hole I have inside

God I need you, as does my sister
Only You can give us life


AMEN
