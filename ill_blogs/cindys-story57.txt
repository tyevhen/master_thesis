[I wrote this short piece while I was in a high school English class about playing the piano.  I still find that what I have written can be true.  It is so good to have a way to express feelings, if not through words, then for me it is through the intensity that can come through music notes on the piano.]


Here I am, as a young girl, at the piano with Mom

"The piano in my room is an old and beautiful instrument.  All through the many hours of the day it has been a place for expression where anger and sadness and happiness and pain have pressed heavily and softly against the keys, where the notes have grown loud in the air, quieted, and then grown again.  For no two successive days are the songs precisely the same.

 Not only do the notes get loud and get quiet in their expressive ways, but the tempo of the song is never the same.  It quickens and slows as the happiness comes and goes, as the mind of the dedicated, hard working pianist tires under its load of thoughts, or as the pages in the piano book indicate the speed in accordance with meaning and loudness.  Today a little more feeling may be in the music, tomorrow a little less.  Always the music from the piano remains a helpful and enjoyable comfort."


I am still enjoying the piano today in this grown-up life

[I hope that you are able to find a way for yourself that lets your expression of what is inside you come out in a freeing and heartfelt way, even when you are still unable to speak what is there.]
