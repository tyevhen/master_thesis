I've put on some running and biking miles recently. I ran 15 miles today. It was cold and very windy--not at all like a May day should be, so it was a rough run. My hip, however, felt okay. Good news. It's a bit sore now, but it does feel better than I thought it might.

I rode my new bike for the first time a couple days ago. Figuring I'd fall over at stop lights, I headed out on a local trail instead. No stoplights. No cars. Very few people. I rode 27 miles. It was weird riding in that low, aerodynamic position. I couldn't get used to barely being able to see 30 feet in front of me. I kept lifting my head to get a broader view and ended up with a really sore neck. In fact, it's still sore today! I had a complete fitting, so it's not a case of the bike not fitting well. If any of you ride a tri bike, I'd love to know how you got used to it.

Back to running now; for those of you who've followed the discussion accompanying my post, Having Imprudent Running Thoughts, I've made the decision not to run the inagural Minneapolis Marathon later this month. As much as I'd like to participate, I decided not to run for a couple reasons. First, the marathon course appears to be fairly hilly. I'm not sure I want to put my legs through a hilly course only 3 weeks before my goal race at Grandma's. Secondly, I know myself too well. I don't think I could run in a race and not race. I'd certainly run too fast and spoil my chances to qualify for Boston at Grandma's. Maybe I'll run a foolish marathon a few weeks after Grandma's instead!

As for my mood...still okay. Yippee!
