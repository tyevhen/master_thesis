This makes me mad...  'psycho' costumes

I am one of those who takes offence.  How can a costume making fun out of the worse time of anyone's life be good for entertainment!  With fear of mental health patients, what do we teach our children when mental health stereo types are portrayed in Halloween costumes. Very ANGRY!  I stopped shopping at Tesco sometime ago, if I hadn't stopped I would do now.
