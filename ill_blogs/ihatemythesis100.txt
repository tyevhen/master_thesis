I'm at a coffee shop (independent!) and drinking real coffee (not crap ending in the phrase -ppuccino) from a real glass mug. I just ate a muffin that I knew I shouldn't eat. But it's 1:30 in the morning. I'm actually making thesis progress and I convinced myself it was "brain food" instead of "go straight to my thighs" food.

Soon there is nothing left of the muffin except the burnt part (the downside of buying local) and I start thinking that maybe the coffee was all I really needed to power my brain after all. And as I wonder whether or not I will fit in a graduation gown (those damn unforgiving, formless, black smocks), I realize that I am eating the burnt parts! What is wrong with me?

*That's only for chapter 3, the full thesis is much longer.
