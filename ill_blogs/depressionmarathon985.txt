Perhaps I mentioned this just a few days ago. I know I've written about it in the past. It's disinterest, and it is one of the subtle, invisible symptoms of this illness.

Disinterest, unlike many of depression's manifestations, is quiet and sneaky. It hangs in the background--a backdrop for depression's more visible symptoms. It is noticeable only when I notice the absence of other states--the absence of interest, the absence of concern, the absence of opinion, joy, anger, or pain. Disinterest is not as blatant as the tears of sadness. It doesn't rattle the soul like anxiousness. It doesn't send me to bed like fatigue. Disinterest is more subtle than all that. Absence marks its presence.

Disinterest works behind the scenes. It's the reason phone calls have not been returned. Talking requires interest in what you, or even I, have to say. Disinterest keeps the running magazines closed, the e-mails unread, and the television channels jumping. It's hard to focus or care when one can't focus and doesn't care. That's disinterest.

Life, when disinterested, lacks meaning, direction, or purpose. The body craves relief. Drinking, drugs, self-harm, psychosis, sex...anything which alters the monotony is preferable to the disinterested state. Feeling anything, we think, is better than feeling nothing. The body, the brain need that relief. It may be a subtle, invisible symptom, but disinterest often leads to very visible scars of relief.
