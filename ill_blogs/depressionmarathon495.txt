I'm back at my life and feeling really tired tonight. I think it will be an early bed time for me. It's been a busy week of work, recovering from the marathon, and beginning to ready myself for the New York City Marathon, which is now only 3 weeks away.

I plan to run anywhere from 13 to 16 miles tomorrow. It will depend on how I feel. I ran 7 miles yesterday. My legs were hollering at me a bit. Five miles probably would have sufficed. But I recovered well, and I even lifted some light weights tonight after work. I'm actually looking forward to my long run tomorrow. I hope my legs cooperate.

My mood continues to cooperate. It remains good. I haven't noticed any post-marathon dip so far. Keeping that dip from happening is the main reason I'm anxious to run long tomorrow.

Work has also been going well. I'm feeling comfortable, most of the time, and I think I've actually helped a few patients along the way! My co-workers are great people. We have a lot of fun and laugh a lot throughout the day. I appreciate that. I'm needing to work extra hours in order to stay on top of my budget, but so far that's working out okay, and I seem to be tolerating it well.

That's basically it for today. I'm doing well. I'm grateful. And I'm grateful for you readers. Thanks! I appreciated all of your support on my recent marathon journey. Let the next journey begin!
