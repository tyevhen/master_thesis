I'm feeling so low. Yet I cannot cry. Where do the tears go? They've apparently disappeared with the rest of my soul into the deep darkness, which has yet to abate. In fact, I'm darker and the darkness is deeper. I'm feeling sad, so sad. I've reached a point where I feel tearful, without energy, and alone all the time. I'm numb, yet I hurt. It's a deep, dark ache in the middle of my soul. My heart feels heavy, like a leaden weight in the middle of my chest. It doesn't beat. It just hangs there--heavy and low. I'm numb, yet I hurt. I'm so numb I can't even cry. Though my body wants to stream it all away, no tears will come. Where do the tears go?

Tears seem insufficient anyway. I crave oblivion. Drinking, drugs, food, sleep...name your poison, anything to drive out the pain. I crave whatever will take me there, and it's a scary place to be. Oblivion seems the only way.

It's been quite awhile since I've felt this way. Scared. Craving oblivion. It's harder and harder to hang onto the temporary nature of pain. They say it will pass. They are not here, within, experiencing the despair. The light at the end of the tunnel has grown frightfully dim.
