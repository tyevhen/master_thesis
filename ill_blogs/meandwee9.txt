This spring we planted gardens...there were gardens when we moved here two summers ago but we let it go since we had no clue what was going on. Ha! Neither Chris nor I are gardeners and we know nothing. But, we decided to try and learn and we bought a bunch of seedlings of our favorite vegetables and have been giving it a whirl. Do you garden? What's your favorite thing to grow?





 

 We are cutting our lettuces now (amongst an array of other things!) and it tastes like magic.
Here's to having no clue what we're doing but enjoying it anyway!
