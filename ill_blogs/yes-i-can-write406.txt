I really wasn't sure about starting yet another blog, but I did get an awesome new camera, and I do want to do the 365 day photo challenge , and what better time to start it then the new year? So, every single day I'll upload a picture to my new blog. Here it is!

If you click to enlarge this pic, you'll notice that the time in the corner of the TV screen reads 11:59:59. :-)







I hope everyone had a cool New Years Eve!

Peace,
