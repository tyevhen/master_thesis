Raise your hand if you've cried during a run! (Yup, my hand is up--today.) Things are still really tough, yet I was able to force myself out for my long run today--only the third time I've run all week. I knew I'd feel even worse if I didn't accomplish that one thing, and that run is the only thing I accomplished today. Things are really tough. But I'm still here putting one foot in front of the other. One foot, and then the other foot, and then the first foot...right, left, right, left...
