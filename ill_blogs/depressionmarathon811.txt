I'm in the best shape I've been in since college. I can run fast, ride fast and swim fast. But I've yet to master swimming in open water. After talking at length with my therapist, it's clear that my problem is less about swimming and more about fear. It's also clear that this fear, and it's debilitating effect, took me by surprise and continues to baffle me. I knew I had a fear of the water, but I had no idea it would effect me like this. Scolding myself for having such a fear has also not been helpful. This all leaves me entirely up in the air.

On the one hand, I figure I should just go for it. Start the triathlon no matter how terrified I might be, because deep inside my brain I know I can swim the distance, and I know I can tread water, and at worst I panic and get pulled out. Well, actually the worst thing would be that I drown, but I'm not supposed to think of that!

On the other hand, this is supposed to be the positive culmination of a lot of work. It's supposed to be a challenge not a punishment. If I panic and get pulled from the water, it probably won't feel fun or be a positive experience. Even if I make it out of the water, will it have been fun if I was terrified? Once again, I don't know.

I'm hoping to swim at least two more times before Sunday, but I'm planning to make my decision by Friday at the latest. I don't want to waffle right up until the race. There would be no way to prepare myself if I did that. I think I'm leaning toward waiting for another triathlon, but even as I type that statement the disappointment is enormous. I guess secretly I'm hoping something miraculous happens this week. Realistically--probably not, huh?

And yes, this is dragging me down, so in the end, I think I'll be relieved no matter what I choose.
