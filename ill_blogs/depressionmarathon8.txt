It's a big day today. Twelve years ago today I began my journey into recovery. I've been sober for 12 years. Wow. Writing that down...it's barely believable. I never thought I'd be sober this long. It's truly a miracle.

Twelve years ago I never could have imagined how tremendously my life would change as a result of getting sober. I don't know what I expected, probably a miserable life without my favorite coping mechanism, but that's not what sobriety reaped. I stopped medicating my depression, and my depression got better. I stopped spending my free time drinking, and all my time got better. I became a valued employee, a more faithful friend, a responsible patient, a more respectful daughter, and a compassionate person. Who knew sobriety could reap such rewards?

I feel very lucky and quite proud to be celebrating 12 years of sobriety today. I don't know why I "got it" when so many others haven't. Perhaps it's because I became teachable for the first time in my life. I did what was suggested and took it one day at a time. But I've seen others who appeared teachable, who appeared committed, who said the right things, and they didn't get it. Why me and not them? I don't know. I'm proud of the work I've done, but I feel lucky to be here 12 years later, nonetheless.

This is a big day. I'm grateful for the life I've created, a life which never would have been possible if I had continued drinking. I'm grateful for my job, my friends, my house, my dog. I'm grateful I can handle situations which used to baffle and confound me. I'm a contributing member of society today, and I'm proud of that.

Today I have choices. Addiction does not allow for choices. It also doesn't engender responsibility. I am responsible for creating the life I lead. I know that now. And it's a life I get to choose only because I am sober. That's a gift.
