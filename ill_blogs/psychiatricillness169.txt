I have not been to work today, I overslept as I could not sleep last night. I have been thinking about what I want to do with my life, at every stage a voice comes into my head about what other people will think. I do not consciously think I must do this or I must not do that because other people will disapprove. The voice of disapproval usually sounds like my sisters or my mothers. Life is tough enough trying to make your self happy and content, from now on I am going to climb every mountain, ford every stream, follow every rainbow, until I find my dream!!

For the time being this may mean loosening the ties between myself and my mother and my sister. Not in a way they would notice but I am not going to allow their opinion to influence my mood so much. This is my life no one elses!

I have always had a very clean-cut life, always doing the right thing by other people and worrying what others think. I am going to take a risk, the people I know well may see a change, the thought of loosing their respect or friendship terrifies me. However they do not and cannot fulfil my need for love and companionship! I need others and to do that I need to go out there and let my hair down!!
