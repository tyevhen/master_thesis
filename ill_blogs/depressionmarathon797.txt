I'm feeling ambivalent about writing this. It's been a long day, and I don't necessarily want to focus my energy on how long it's been. But then again, that's what this blog is for, I guess. So here goes...

I'm feeling paralyzed. It's been a very long day. I've done a little here and a little there, but I've also taken to my bed for many hours today. I'm low. My motivation is low. I'm overwhelmed. Little things feel very big. Too big. I'm feeling paralyzed, and I'm so, so frustrated.

I don't want to focus on this, because I want it to go away. Now. I know it will go away eventually. I've been doing this long enough to realize that. But it's so frustrating in the mean time. I hate feeling paralyzed. And that's all I've got to say for now.
