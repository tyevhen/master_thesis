Wow! PsychCentral, one of the most comprehensive mental health sites on the web, has included me in their list of Top Ten Depression Blogs for 2010! Once again, I am honored and humbled by this recognition. I really can't believe it. I dreamt of writing a blog about depression for several years before taking the blind leap and starting this one. I'm now about to complete my third year of writing here. It's been a labor of love, but I never imagined being officially recognized for my work! Thank you, PsychCentral. Thank you.
