After an uneventful flight, I arrived in Dallas. I'd never been to Texas before. So far it looks a lot like Minnesota except it's sunny and 70 degrees! It was below 10 degrees when I left home this morning. The sun and warmth feels really good. Thankfully, it won't be this sunny and warm on Sunday, though. The forecast calls for lows in the 30's and a high of 55 degrees. Perfect!

After I pick up my number at the expo tomorrow morning, I'm hoping to see the Historic West End. It's only a couple of miles from where I'm staying. The area includes the spot where JFK was assassinated. I'd like to see more than that, but staying off my feet is more important.

I actually wish the race was tomorrow. I'm anxious to get going. This will be the largest marathon I've ever run. I think there are something like 22,000 runners! Yikes! It will be interesting to be among that many moving people. I'll let you know what happens. Wish me luck!
