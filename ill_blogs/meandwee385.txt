Wishing you the best this season!!!



Hi friends!
Here is a little photo display of Paige's pre-Christmas celebration with her Nana and Grampa in Maine...her first Christmas experience! We all had a great time and Paige seemed to be thrilled with the day.







Paige loved these Discovery Blocks from Haba that my parents gave her...



Paige also loved her new blocks my parents gave her! We're putting them away until she's a little bit bigger. We let her play with them for a while and she loved them! But she particularly liked throwing them for now. :)


This Lamaze brand Octopus that my brother gave her was a huge hit. He's a music teacher, so it was very appropriate as each tentacle sounds out a note from the scale when you squeeze it! Paige has been enthralled with this and has a new obsession.


And that is the gist of Paige's first Christmas with my side of the family! Thanks Nana and Grampa and Uncle Jason for making it so special! I'll be back soon to tell of Paige's very first Christmas Day!
