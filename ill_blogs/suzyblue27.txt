I adore the Kardashians! Who doesn't right? But recently I've developed a slight obsession with the youngest of the clan, Kylie Jenner. Scrolling through her instagram you are met with just stunning pictures of her and recently her make-up has been so on point I thought i'd try to re-create her look!

Full list of products used detailed below

Fill in brows. Kylie's eyebrows have a slightly higher arch than mine so I just extended the shape up a bit
Contour nose, cheeks, forehead and jawline

 Add a touch of blush and highlight cheekbones/brow bone


 Apply a light brown transition colour between lid and brow bone, then deepen up the crease with a darker brown colour
 Add a soft nude colour to the lid
 Wing dat liner guurl!
 Add lots and lots and lots and LOTS of mascara! Then add more!
Finally, finish with a muted rosey/brown colour on the lips et voila!

Hope you enjoyed this mini tutorial on KJ's look! Until next time...
