I feel really stressed and agitated. I went to Germany for work this week, I have had a good week and am doing well at work. I don't know what has caused this but I feel really shaky. I have just taken one of my quetiapine tablets early as I am shaking as I write this. I have no idea what has triggered it. I don't even know what I feel shaky about. I have just had a lazy day, sat and watched TV. I have not had a lazy day for a long time but I just felt so tired. I wish I was not on my own! I'm not even thinking about much!
