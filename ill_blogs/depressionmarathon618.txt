I'm healing fairly well. I spent most of the weekend inside, sitting, icing, reading, and watching TV. It was beautiful outside, so I hobbled around a bit in the driveway. There wasn't much for me to do out there, and I wasn't sure I was supposed to drive yet anyway. Today I didn't care. I got in my car and took myself to the gym. I spent 45 minutes lifting weights. People were staring at me hobbling on my crutches from machine to machine, but I didn't care. It felt good to move my body. I probably should have gotten myself there earlier.

I stopped into work to say hello. I'm hoping to get back to my job soon, as I don't know how these bills are going to get paid if I don't. Financially, I'm stressed. I hate financial stress, and that's all I'm going to say about that!

My mood remains good, but I do miss running. I'm anxious about my recovery. There's no guarantee the surgery will cure me to the point of running again, but I try really hard not to think about that. Instead, I'm looking forward to being out there in the sun again, running, and painfree. That will be a glorious day.
