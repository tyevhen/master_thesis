I think one of the most difficult aspects of tackling my fears and anxieties is learning to trust myself. Trusting my eyes to see what is there, trusting my brain to accurately interpret the world, trusting that everything probably will be OK, as it usually is. For people with OCD, this can be particularly challenging, as we don't trust what are eyes are showing us. We can look at something 2, 10, 10,000 times and still see something wrong with it, even though we know on an intellectual level that there isn't anything amiss. I am learning to trust myself, but it has not been easy. But if I can't trust myself, who can I trust?
