My ex-boss is either a complete total tosser or he is taking advantage of my low mood and lack of confidence. I like to think good of people so I am going with the first option with a little bit of ignorance on his side. But God I feel vulnerable and unhappy. I did not realise people could be like that and I have never felt such hatred for anyone before. I have never hated anyone so much....

Everytime I talk to my sister she naggs that I m not talkative, that I sound tired and tells me off for not looking after myself. Is this what family support is suppose to be like!!! I want to throw things at her.

I don't feel there is anyone in the world who I can talk to :o(
