I'm just loving the great weather we've been having. I'm enjoying it while we can; before it gets too hot out!
How have you been? I'm good. Taking care of the kiddos and working on my shop in between. Things tend to be hectic lately... I guess I'm not very good at having balance so I need to work on that.
In the midst of all my shop stuff I'm trying to work on pinpointing exactly what it is I want to be making (I'm a bit all over the place) and what exactly my art style/aesthetic is (I'm a bit all over the place with that too.) So, I'm doing a lot of sketchbook work and list-making. I'll get there!
What are you up to?
