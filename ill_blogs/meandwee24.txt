We are thrilled and proud to announce the arrival of our third (and last!) precious baby:
Liam Philip Carty
Born on January 11, 2015 at 8:32 pm.
8lb. 12oz, 22.5 inches long



Quick facts: Born via C-Section almost 2 hours after we got to the hospital because he was transverse breech (sideways in my belly!) and I was totally dilated and ready to go! Also, it turns out his umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck 3 times! (I had a feeling). He is cute, he is cuddly, he is a great eater, he's a good sleeper, and he's a good little fella. *sigh*

More details to come!

We all know you really just wanna see photos...so here ya go!

















This is right before we put him in his car seat to bring him home from the hospital. He'd just spit up all over his going home outfit, so on went the oversized onesie! I love those little kicks.
