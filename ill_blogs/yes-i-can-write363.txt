Home Births 'as safe as hospital' I can't help but think DUH! But it's nice to see an article supporting home births in the BBC, where many of their readers are most likely not supporters of home births...

You Are Being Lied to About Pirates is this a surprise, considering how much mainstream media twists things? I liked seeing a different take on the Somalian pirates.

Amazon.com is homophobic. Seriously. I don't think I'm going to be buying from them anymore...

I'm curious if anyone is interested in this becoming a regular thing? Say, every week I could write a post with a list of the most interesting articles and blog posts I've read over the week? I'd love some feedback on this! Thanks. :-)

Peace,
Idzie
