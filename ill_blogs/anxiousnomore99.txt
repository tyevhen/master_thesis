I apologize to all my feed readers who tried to use the links that I had put in to see the new forum that aren't working. This is my first time administrating such an application and its hard to know what you are seeing vs. what I am seeing. I have had two readers tell me different links are or are not working. So I think I have fixed them on the website, but in order to use them you would have to visit the website. So I will include the link here for you in case you are having problems from your feed reader as well. 
 Here is the link that should work:

If this doesn't work for some reason, let me know. The wrinkles will get worked out soon, and thanks for your patience!
