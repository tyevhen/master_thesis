My big news today is I ran 7 miles this morning. It's below zero here, so I ran it on the treadmill. I focused on running it one mile at a time, with one minute walk breaks at each mile. With a 5 minute warm up and cool down, I was on the 'mill for 75 minutes. And while it was tough, I actually felt pretty good! I was quite pleased.

My right hip did get sore, but it was muscular soreness, which doesn't concern me as much as joint soreness would. I know my hip muscles are weak. I'll keep working on that. My hip joint felt good though, and it still does hours later. That pleases me, too.

I really didn't know what to expect when I got on the treadmill. I worked two long days on Friday and Saturday, and I was totally wiped out last night. I slept fairly well overnight, but my energy as I stepped on the treadmill was still pretty low. Nonetheless, I knew I wanted to run long. I had a plan, and I stuck to it. I'm so glad it worked out well.

I'm grateful to be running again. Starting over after my three month layoff has not been easy. I knew it wouldn't be. I'm trying to stay positive through the tough, heavy runs. Having a quality run like I did today, with my legs churning and my breathing controlled, is medicine for my soul. I am a happy soul right now.
