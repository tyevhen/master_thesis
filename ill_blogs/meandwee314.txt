Hello! I thought I'd try a vlog post today...not for the faint of heart as I look like poo. But, I thought it would be a good way to illustrate how I feel every day in the morning. It's the real reality, baby! woo! If you decide to watch; the topic is about our daily EARLY wakeup and how I hate it and hate feeling alone at that time of day. Anyone out there in a similar predicament with a wee one who is an early bird?
(edit) In the video I say Chris lets me sleep in one day on the weekend. ACTUALLY on Sundays I let him sleep in and when he gets up I go back to bed! haha! So, really, I'm getting extra sleep during the WHOLE weekend and not just Saturday. :)
