  Sometimes I feel so not like myself.  I think that I must have lost myself somewhere in the shuffle.  And I try to find "it" back by doing what I think might return me to a normal state of "myself".  But then I think, "Is this still myself, even when I am not myself".  "If I am not myself, than who am I?"  And then I think, "Am I thinking too much?"
  The last sentence is probably the truest of true.
  I think too much.
  Or do I?
