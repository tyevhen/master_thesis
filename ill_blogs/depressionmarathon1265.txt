As a person with a chronic, life-altering and disabling illness, my secondary goal when I created this educational, supportive blog was to hopefully also develop a home-based revenue source. Being unable to perform my chosen profession on a regular, even part-time basis--despite still paying off the remaining $20,000+ of my original $60,000+ in student loans--I wanted to develop a home-based vocation. Seven years of disability, food shelves, sacrifices and loss have taught me I need a job that I can work vigorously when I feel well, and one that will provide residual income when my symptoms impede my function.
Additionally, I have been writing since early junior high. Growing up in a f'ed up family and suffering through teenage depression/suicidality, writing has always been my outlet. In junior high, I wanted to be a journalist. I took every writing class I could throughout high school and college. I've always wanted to write a book. The combination of these circumstances, likes, dislikes, wants and needs culminated in the creation of this blog.
Why am I telling you all of this? Because a couple of weeks ago, this blog led to the realization of some of these dreams and a start on my secondary goal. As a result of this blog, I was invited to join an up-and-coming recovery website called The Second Road. As of today, I am a professional blogger over at thesecondroad.org. I will be posting over there 2-3 times per week. I will still be posting here as close to daily as possible. I hope you will all take a moment to check out The Second Road, especially if you have any interest in addiction and recovery.

I never dreamed I would get an opportunity like this, especially this soon. I am humbled and grateful. (and scared, of course!) Thank you, all of you who regularly visit and especially those of you who comment here. I appreciate your support and feedback more than you will ever know!
