Yesterday I was talking with someone who has OCD fairly severely. What I found particularly interesting about this conversation is that she easily could "see through" my anxieties and fears to a more rationale, less "anxiety clouded" future. In the same way, I saw through her rituals and behaviors and could point out their disconnect to reality.

Anxiety and fear warp our minds. We lose perspective of what's real, what could happen, and what actually will happen.

I am very fearful of the future, but I'm trying to find ways to embrace a more positive and optimistic outlook. That's hard to do in this economy, so step one might be limiting my access to the news (of course bad news sells). I spend a lot of time reading the news (not because of anxiety, but because I am a "news junkie"), but maybe I'll focus a little more on myself and my wellness next year.

Hmm, time to start thinking about those New Year's resolutions!
