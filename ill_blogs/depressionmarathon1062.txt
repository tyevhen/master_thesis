Sitting in a coffee shop, I'm trying to convince him to wear a suit and tie when meeting prospective employers. The conversation reminds me of my own naivete at age eighteen. He says, "I think I'll ask the other kids what they did when they went looking for jobs." After reminding him that his friends are his age while I am hiring-manager age, I let it go with a smile. Oh to be eighteen again...

He's eighteen going on sixteen, which is an improvement. When I met him, he was sixteen going on twelve. A high school senior, and the product of a really sad alcoholic family, I've been mentoring him for just over two years. Since I have no kids, this relationship has given me opportunities I never thought I'd get. Teaching a teen to drive, for example, was an opportunity I won't soon forget.

He reminds me of myself at eighteen because, like him, I had no clue how to function in the world. I find myself trying to teach him everything I wish I had known, things I learned through embarrassment and shame. Saying 'please' and 'thank you' was an early lesson. Taking responsibility for one's actions was frequently revisited. Shaking hands, holding a door open so it doesn't slam in someone's face, and offering a guest something to drink have all been addressed. He's learned, and I've watched him grow.

He's grown, and therefore I've grown. He's learned, and therefore I've learned. I am so grateful to be a part of his life, as he enriches mine. I'm sure he'd be surprised to learn I'm getting just as much, if not more, out of this relationship as he is.

Two years ago I had no idea this relationship would develop. I wasn't searching for a teen to mentor. I wasn't feeling empty or alone without a teen in my life. Things happened, and we came together. Perhaps a higher power knew what was best for both of us. I certainly didn't have anything to do with it, but I'm so glad I took the ball and ran. After all, prom's coming up...
