I wanted to show you my new work! These are abstract watercolor paintings. And I have one for sale in my shop! It is a small 5 x 7 size which means it takes up little space and is more affordable than larger original pieces. Yay!


I'm definitely going to do more in this style.
The Jackrabbit painting is one of a kind, so snag it if you like it! :)



The bear one is one I'm going to keep for now. Unless someone really likes it; let me know! I can be swayed to sell him too. heee!
