I just got back this afternoon from an alternately stressful and fun week at the cottage, and will have a long post with pictures up in the next few days. However, I wanted to let you know about The Carnival of Unschooled Life, a new blog carnival that published it's first edition while I was away, including one of my posts, under the category of Out in the World. Enjoy, and if you're an unschooler, perhaps you'd be interested in submitting a post for the next edition! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
