I just turned on a baseball game. I've been listening to National Public Radio all day. That's my usual Sunday routine. But unlike usual Sundays, my radio has not been filled with clever quips and laughter today. My usual shows, Car Talk, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, and Prairie Home Companion, have, of course, been preempted today by constant reporting about the tragedy in Orlando, Florida. I can't listen anymore.

This tragedy... this hate crime... this terrorist attack... this murder of 49 people is really affecting me. I've never mentioned this here before, but I used to be a part of the very community targeted in this attack. Like the Boston Marathon bombings, this one feels too close. And I don't get it! I just don't get it.

I can't listen anymore. I feel overwhelmed by the enormity of one person's hate. It sickens me. I'm shocked, horrified and angry. My heart aches for the victims and for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people directly impacted by this small-minded murderer's actions. Why? Why? I don't understand.
