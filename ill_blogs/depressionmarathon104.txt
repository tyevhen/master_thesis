One of my supervisors left me a note yesterday. We've been really busy, and I worked later than usual yesterday. I was actually the last one in the office. When I returned to my desk from my patient's room there was a handwritten note thanking me for "all you do." It was a simple note on plain paper, likely scribbled on her way out the door, but it made a difference in my day. It changed my attitude about being there later than usual and made my drive home a little more serene.

I appreciated her note so much I folded it up and took it home. I'm looking at it right now. Why throw it away? Every time I look at it, the note reminds me of her kind gesture. It reminds me someone appreciates what I do. It acknowledges I'm making a difference. That's pretty cool. I like the reminders. I'm glad I didn't toss it out.

Saying thank you. It's such a simple thing to do. My supervisor's note reminds me I need to pay it forward. I need to make sure I'm thanking others for their kindness, hard work, or friendship. I think I do an okay job of saying thanks, but there's always room for improvement. And when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, which I may be on the verge of feeling right now, it's probably even more important for me to remember what others are doing for me rather than concerning myself only with what I am doing for others. Just a thought.
