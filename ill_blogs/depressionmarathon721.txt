I may be a little light in the wallet (furnace, truck, health insurance), and I may feel like I got smacked in the face (root canal), but the past few days have been better days. I'm functioning and moving forward. My mood has taken a bit of a hit with all the stress I've recently encountered, but right now I'm riding it out okay.

I feel a little low and a lot lazy. I did run my 15 miles today, but now I can barely move. It's part muscle fatigue but larger part inertia. I just want to lie in bed and sleep now. Puck won't allow more sleep, though. He figured a two hour nap was plenty, thank you very much! I needed that nap. Now I don't know what else to do. I've got plenty I could be doing, but inertia sort of gets in the way of that.

Life moves on whether we participate or not, and right now I'm counting on that. I think I need the structure of work to cure my inertia. Until then, I've really got no plans. This little lull will pass. I'm not panicking. I'm not worried. I sort of expected a crash after all of the recent stressors. And this is hardly a crash. It's more like a slow motion thud. I'll let you know when I get moving again. Carry on, friends.
