I had a really good weekend of workouts and relaxation. My calf is still sore. I had a painful deep massage Thursday evening, but I felt better Friday, so I guess the pain was worth it. It feels like my calf is slowly improving.

Yesterday I didn't even attempt to run. I swam 1.5 miles instead. I was really proud of myself. I planned to swim one mile, rest, and then swim another half mile. I felt okay at the one mile mark, so I thought I'd just do a few more laps before resting. Well, before I knew it, I had my sights set on finishing the whole distance, and I did! It was tough, as I haven't swum that far in an awful long time, but I finished it. It was a good substitute for the 10 mile run I had scheduled.

Today I spent the entire morning with friends Bill and Cindy. They just returned from a coastal vacation, so I hadn't seen them in over a week. We hung out in the beautiful morning sunshine, drank coffee, chatted, laughed, and then went out for lunch. It was lovely. I so appreciate them, and I am so happy they are in my life.

After lunch I took a very restful nap. Then I headed out for today's workout. I rode 25 miles on a local bike trail. I rode hard. It's a relatively flat trail. I averaged almost 20 miles per hour, and I was happy with that. It was gorgeous, perfect weather for a ride. I'm pleasantly tired right now, but I still need to take my boy for a walk. That will be a nice end to a very nice day.

My mood continues to be good. The mental health stability certainly is nice. Physically, I think I will be okay for my marathon this weekend, as it feels like my calf is healing. And of course I'm looking forward to seeing D again. We will spend the weekend at his home, as the race is not far from where he lives. I'm looking forward to another good weekend ahead. Have a great week everyone!
