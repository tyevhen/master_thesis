Yesterday, December 28th, I officially hit 8 years of sober living. I haven't found it necessary to take a drink of alcohol since December 28, 2005. That, my friends, is a miracle! And I am profoundly grateful today. Despite all the pain this journey has sometimes entailed, I wouldn't give up my sobriety to change a moment of it. I am humbled by the assistance, guidance, and love I have received over these past eight years by my friends in recovery. I would not be sober, nor alive, today without the people around me or my recovery program. Living in the moment, one day at a time, and taking the next right action are all recovery principals which guide me through my days, whether they be good days filled with friends and love or bad days consumed by depression and isolation. By using the principals I've learned in sobriety I've stayed alive and functional. I'd be dead today had I not gotten sober. It's that simple. I pray for those still out there, still suffering, and hope they, too, find a way to a much better life. Eight years... I'm humbled. Wow.
