There is someone else I like. I think they are probably quite a bit older than me but I don't care. I have met him a few times but just as we started to hit it off the anxiety got the better of me and I left before I realised what I was doing. The flight bit of the fight or flight syndrome got me :o(. I sent him a message yesterday and I hope he replies soon.

Can not really be more specific as it is possible he knows about my blogg. I hope he replies to my message soon.
