It's taken me awhile to get to this post today because it's been a bit of a rough one. I mentioned in my last post that I had a dip in my mood over the weekend. The dip became a gully by Tuesday evening. By Wednesday it was a gigantic, suffocating pit. I could barely move. I managed better today, but things have been tough.

One of the symptoms I struggle with when I'm not doing so hot is screwed up thinking. I get negative thoughts, slightly paranoid thoughts, and/or intrusive scary thoughts about bad things happening to people I love. I hate to even admit I have these thoughts. I guess I'm ashamed. It's hard for me to feel out of control of my own thinking. I know the thoughts are a symptom of my depression, but I still find them distressing and difficult.

I've been working diligently to let the thoughts just pass through my brain, to not put a lot of stock into them or worry too much about them. Thoughts are just thoughts. They only have power if I give them power. But not worrying about them is easier said than done. Like a dip in my mood, screwed up thinking scares me. It's so hard not to wonder if this is the start of something bigger and darker. I'm doing my best not to worry, to let the thoughts be just annoying thoughts, but like I said, sometimes it's easier said than done.

So it's one day, sometimes one moment, at a time right now. I'm working again tomorrow and hoping the distraction gives me a bit of respite. Ironically, it is highly likely this mood disruption is due to the stress of returning to work. Nevertheless, I actually think working tomorrow, focusing on others for awhile, will be helpful. In the meantime, I'll take any extra prayers available.
