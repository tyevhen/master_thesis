Yowza!
We've been squeezing Noah into his Miracle Blanket up until yesterday. Yep, he was squished and jammed into that thing without an inch of fabric to spare. In fact, it was totally stretched to the limit. Well, now, he gets out of it pretty much instantly and I just can't cram him in there anymore. But he slept so well in it!
Soooooo, we sadly moved him into a sleep sack. It's been an epic nightmare thus far...he just doesn't know what to do with himself and his arms flail all around. He rolls over and gets stuck. His paci falls out. Blah blah blahhh.
I figured "hey! I'll just swaddle him in one of those fancy swaddle blankets we got! They are bigger!" I did a good tight swaddle but the stretchy material allowed his little arms to come right out of there. Darn it! He just rolls around the bed and cries as he tries to figure out what to do. sigh. Looks like it's going to be a long few days.
I've decided to just rip this band aid off and continue on with the sleep sack and ween off the paci. He has to learn how to soothe himself and fall asleep on his own. But that doesn't mean it will be easy! There will be tears and screaming and rolling around, and then I'll need to deal with Noah! ha!
Wish us luck. I'm gonna need it.
