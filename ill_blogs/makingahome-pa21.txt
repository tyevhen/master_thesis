I spent some time getting my new space set up yesterday. It's mostly done, yet the walls are still quite bare which definitely will change over time as this space evolves into what I've been envisioning.

In the meantime, it's definitely functional and so much nicer than working out of closets and drawers and bins. It is glorious to feel organized and to have a dedicated creative spot.
