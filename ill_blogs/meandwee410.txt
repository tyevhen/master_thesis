Hi friends!
I'm sorry we've been missing from this space! We've been sick with a horrible cold and it's still hanging on. blech. I thought, in the meantime, I would update you with some follow ups from earlier posts!
I'd mentioned just a few posts ago about my watercolor class...it's so fun! I just had my third class last night and we did a color version of the monochromatic painting I posted about before. Here are my 2 paintings together:


As you can see, I made a few changes to the color version and I like the composition much better. It didn't take much time to make the painting since the teacher was guiding us through steps to complete it.

Also, a few posts ago I'd mentioned our apple-picking trip and my desire to make an apple pie. Well, I did it! And it was delicious. Of course, I scoured the internet and picked a recipe that was very involved (for a first-timer) but it was well-worth the extra effort! You can find the recipe I used HERE. Don't I look excited? hee! I didn't make the crust myself...that was a Pillsbury pre-made one and it was great!





And, just because, I thought I'd show this amusing photo of Chris doing his best Paige impression.
