And so does poo. Sometimes. It finally happened! Paige poo'd in the tub the other night. Chris bathes her at night and we have a big tub where you have to put your feet in just to be able to reach the baby. So, we was standing and playing with her in the water and all of a sudden I hear him say "we have floaties! We have FLOATIES!!" I thought he was kidding around in regard to all the tub toys floating around. Then I looked down and saw the nuggets making their way to the surface. EEEK! He pulled her right out of the tub and off they went. Guess who got to clean it up? It wasn't so bad. I caught most of the offending little buggers with little cups and flushed them down the toilet. I had to clean the tub mats and cups but it could have been much worse. I was wondering when all of this would happen. I'm sort of relieved to have it over with now. haha! I sound calm describing it when it reality I was like "Code BLACK! Code RED!! ALERT!! ALERT!! PANIC BUTTON! MISSILES COMING RIGHT FOR US!!!!!" It's like Poo is the equivalent of toxic radiation and the hydrogen bomb. It never fails to freak me out. My new fear list: Clowns, Spiders and Poop.
