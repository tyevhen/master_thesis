for your benefits, i've had the chance to try both, and I must tell you that cipralex is way better in terms of the side effects, they almost completely dissappear after two - three weeks comparing with seroxat that even after months i still felt strong side effects, including chills, teeth clinching, shaking, breathing wierd and sweat....the worse part was the sweat, cipralex after 10 days all the side effects almost gone completely , so if you ask me i'd prefer cipralex much more than seroxat...
