Dear Little N.,

You turned 21 months old the other day! Just like every other day I cannot stop wanting to squeeze your chubby little bear-cub body. I never tire of you holding my hand (squeezing my finger oh so tightly) or the way you bring me the toys you want to play with.





This month you have been discovering that you have your own opinions about things and now you make it known. Yes, you've started having tantrums. You don't like or want to share. You only like to do things YOU want to do and the way YOU want to do them. You prefer to live on your OWN schedule. I'm so sorry my sweet; but life just doesn't work that way. I'm sorry it makes you cry and stick your lip out. I'm sorry that you feel you have to yell about it and stomp your little feet. You'll get used to things pretty soon; but you sure are trying your Mama's patience!









Despite your newfound independent streak you are still my little fella and I love you no matter what. You are a ray of sunshine and each smile brings me relief, hope, and love. Keep smiling, ok?

 







You are a whirling force of curiosity, wonder, helpfulness, and affection. You are wonderful and I love you to infinity for always.
Love always,
Mama
