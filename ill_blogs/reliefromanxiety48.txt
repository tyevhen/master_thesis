It's 2013 and I'm sat in my therapists chair in the doctor's old room, barely holding myself together, writing a list of the 10 things that make me anxious from least to the most. With only just being able to leave the house, the first on my list was catching a bus, going all the way through to getting a job, driving alone, asking for something, going school and travelling alone amongst many others. 

Sitting down and writing the list made me realise how little I was capable of. How I could hardly walk out the door or even answer the phone in my own house. I knew I would have a long road ahead of me, but I was willing to do whatever it took to turn my life around. 

It's now 2017 and I have done it. I've made it. I've overcome everything on my hierarchy from all those years ago. I was 17 then and I'm 21 now. I've changed and come a long long way. Through medication, various counselling and therapy sessions, panic attacks, and very dark days I am finally here; and its quite emotional to write about it. 

I do still struggle with anxiety and depression and some tasks I still do find difficult. But, I've overcome the main areas of my illness. It hasn't been easy and it hasn't always been
happy, but with time and perseverance you can do it. There have been times of hopelessness and times when I thought I wouldn't make it out alive, but I have and you can too.

Now, it's about continuing to build on my confidence and areas I struggle with and hopefully one day I will be at a place where mental illness is almost non-existence in my daily life.

Best Wishes,
