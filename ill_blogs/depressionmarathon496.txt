I'm still glowing in the aftermath of Sunday's marathon. I'm recovering well. My left calf is the most sore, causing me a slight hitch in my step, but otherwise I'm feeling really good. I planned to swim today, but I rather enjoyed doing nothing for the first Tuesday in an awful long time. Tuesday's are usually my speed work day. Instead of running hard, I practiced napping hard. It worked. I think I took three naps today! It was quite nice.

I will begin some active recovery tomorrow. I have to get back at it, as I am running the New York City Marathon in 4 weeks. On Sunday, November 4th, I get to do it all over again. I'm really looking forward to New York. I've only been there once in my life, and I've never run the marathon there. My mom is coming with me, and we're staying for 8 days. Financially it's going to be a little tough for both of us, but it's a once in a lifetime event, so we're going for it. I can't wait to trot through the streets of New York City with 46,000 other runners! I expect it will be amazing!
