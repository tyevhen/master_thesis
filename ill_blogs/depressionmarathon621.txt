I'm sorry for the long delay in posting this week. I have finally recovered from my illness. I'm spending this weekend with D at the lake. It has been an unbelievably gorgeous weekend. The sun has been shining non-stop, and the temperatures have been in the 80's. The leaves are beautiful, and the smell of fall fills the air. This is exactly what I needed.

Not only is the weather beautiful, things with D are going great. We've spent a lot of quality time together. It's so great that we like to do the same things. Yesterday we returned to the bike trail in the woods, the trail on which we met, and went for a long bike ride. We stopped a few times and took some pictures, chatted with a few other folks on the trail, and generally had a lovely time together. After dinner last night we didn't want to come inside, so we built a fire and sat quietly under the stars before retiring for the night. This morning, the lake was like glass, so we set out in the kayaks for a journey around some islands. Again, it was beautiful. We took our time, took more pictures, and soaked in the sun. Like I said, this is exactly what I needed this weekend. I'm happy.

I return home tomorrow to prepare for my surgery. Tuesday really can't come soon enough. I'm so ready to get this thing taken care of. I'm anxious, of course, as I won't know until I wake up from surgery what kind of recovery to expect. The unknown is always scary. But I'm optimistic everything will work out as it should, and I will be back running soon enough. I'm trying to combat my worry with faith. Any prayers you may offer will certainly be appreciated.
