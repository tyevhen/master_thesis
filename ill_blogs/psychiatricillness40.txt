I had a better day today. I went to work, I got a little work done. My appointment with the psychiatrist is on Thursday. i am also getting my haircut on Thursday, that usually cheers me up :o)

Work is very difficult at the moment and I am struggling to cope. I do not know if I am struggling because I am a little bit depressed or I am a little bit depressed because I am struggling. WHO KNOWS!!!!

A part of me wants to start job hunting but I also want to make certain I have given everything tomy current job. I would be giving up a good pension, a good income, my private health care and lots of security. But nothing is worth getting depressed about!
