Zombie Haiku as suggested by the lovely Arlene Ang--
six unspectacular things about myself.

My skin is oily
though not scarred bad by acne--
that should be "badly."

Frogs are a symbol
of wisdom and felicities.
Oh to hear them sing!

J. Alfred Prufrock
is my little mutt's given name,
prim like a butler.

Fan of the Simpsons,
I collect memorabilia--
worthless on e-bay.

Fan of the Lakers
my television habit
starts November 1st.

I love blackberries.
their purple glistening beads,
exotic perfume.

My shoes are thirteens
but I sometimes doubt about
the correlation.
