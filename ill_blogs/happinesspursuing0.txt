I'm thinking I'll take this up again. A lot has changed with me and a lot has remained the same. You can expect the same incoherent, navel gazing posts as before. Right now I'm just doing some housecleaning; this post is mostly just a test to make sure that everything looks ok. If you happen to notice any problems or have any suggestions for future posts, please let me know.
