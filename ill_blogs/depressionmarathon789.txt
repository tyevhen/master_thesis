Tired. Worked 12.5 hours today, and I've still got paperwork to do. But you know what? Except for missing my softball game tonight, I didn't mind. I like working in home health care so much that 12.5 hours doesn't feel like a long time. Especially since more than 2.5 of those hours came with driving to and from one patient. We cover 10 counties, and today I think I traveled to the furthest reaches of the furthest county we cover. So I'm tired. And it's way past my bed time. I'll catch you up tomorrow.
