Hi there!


I'm excited about a new body of work I'm exploring. My latest watercolor painting depicts Ferry Beach...a well-known Maine beach with shallow water perfect for romping and frolicking children. So many people have cherished memories here. I created this painting to be a jewel on your wall...a small treasure to enjoy whenever you pass by. It is vibrant, colorful, and will remind you of warm breezy days on the beach. It comes to you already professionally mounted and framed; you simply have to put up a picture hook and you're finished! This heirloom-quality piece of original art will delight for years to come as the gem it is. These make wonderful gifts due to their small size and the fact that they are one-of-a-kind.

Here's the details:
-watercolor and gouache painting on aquabord
- measures 5x5 inches
- float-mounted by me on an 8x8 inch acid-free marker board and inserted into a black shadowbox frame.
- The frame measures 8 7/8" x 8 7/8" x 1.5" deep. There is sawtooth hanging hardware on the back for easy hanging on a picture hook.
- The art is titled, dated, and signed in pencil on the mat below the piece.



I am planning on creating at least 10 landscape/seascape paintings in this style and will mount them in this special way. I am even working with a lovely woman who makes hand-made frames using rustic wood in warm tones...I'm excited to share them when they come. These are going to be great heirlooms and great gifts!

I also do custom commissions if you are interested! Mail megan (at) meandwee.com to inquire.
