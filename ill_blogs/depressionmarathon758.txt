Today was the first day of registration for the Boston Marathon, which is April 18, 2011. Registration opened at 8:00AM. I was up at six! Unfortunately, 20,000 other people were awake, too, because the system was apparently overloaded for several hours. It took me about 20 tries, but at 1:30 this afternoon, I finally got signed up. I'm in! No missed Boston this year! Whew! What a relief!

Now I can forget about Boston until sometime this winter when training will begin anew. As for my current training, it's going well. I've got a fairly difficult speed workout tomorrow, 12 x 400 meters, which I'm already thinking about. But I love this three day a week training plan I'm doing. None of my miles are junk. Every run is challenging. Plus, I have four days with which I can swim, bike and/or lift weights. So far it's working great! I think I'm in pretty good shape.

My race this weekend, I guess, will be my conditioning test. I really have no idea what to expect. At the same time, I don't really want to race it all out. I have another race the following weekend, and I don't want to take too much away from my marathon training. But who am I kidding? I'll probably run my little brains out! At least I'm predictable.
