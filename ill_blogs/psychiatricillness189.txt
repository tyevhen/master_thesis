Speed Dating was quite successful for me this time, I did not have any dating matches but got 6 friendship matches. I did not actually tick anyone for dating.

Anyway to cut a long story short one of the people I ticked for friendship ticked me for dating (I think) and we are going out on a proper date tonight. We are meeting near here and going for a meal at Nandos and then going to the cinema.

I'm a bit nervous but I feel more confident than usuall because I don't really care if it goes anywhere or not.

I went to the drama group again last night, it was nice and I have started to join in singing in the chorus. I think I will enjoy it especially as the show gets closer. I'm still the quietest person there by a long long way but I am having fun. I'm no too interested in the Pub afterwards, the people are nice enough but I was just not enjoying it, I think I will just stick to rehearsals in future.
