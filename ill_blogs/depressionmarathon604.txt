trouble, trouble, trouble
I'm in trouble
feeling out of control
feeling so low
depression has me in its grip
I'm not sure what to do
don't know where to go
I'm in trouble
making the effort
taking the steps
the mood doesn't care
getting harder to make the effort
difficult to take the steps
so low

worse than low
unfeeling, unemotional
listless, impassive, indifferent
numb
worse than low
hurts
