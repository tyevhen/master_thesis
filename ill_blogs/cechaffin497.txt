I go to this blog that some say is my blog but that depends on your point of view. If you were a hard nose you could tell me just how I screwed my template up and so on and so forth.

I just want confirmation from others as to whether my blog's narrative appears all scrunched to the left. I'll be grateful if you can corroborate my experience of the reality field.
