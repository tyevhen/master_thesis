It started yesterday. During work, after work? I don't know exactly when it started, but by last night I was on the phone to my psychologist. I went to bed feeling low and with a headache. I woke up feeling miserable and with a migraine. I went back to bed and slept for hours.

The rest of the day has been only slightly better. I struggled through my workout, ran only one of my multiple errands, and took Puck swimming so I wouldn't have to expend any energy walking him. I just got out of bed again. It was another hour and a half nap this time. I'm tired. My head still hurts. And I just can't motivate to do much of anything. It's been an awful long day.

Is this a post triathlon let down? Is this the stress of starting a new job? I'm not sure what it is, but I don't like it. Feeling so low and lethargic makes going to a new job much more difficult. It makes training almost impossible. I don't have time for this. I can't afford to be lazy and stupid right now.

I'm feeling pressure to pull myself out of this quickly. Get over it. Move past it. Now. Now. Now. But I know feeling low and lethargic will only be magnified if I sit here and stress about feeling low and lethargic. I know that, and yet I'm stressed! I need to be sharp at work. I need energy and motivation to train. I'm not feeling patient. I'm not reminding myself that this, too, will pass. I want it to pass now.

Around and around I go. I'm stressed. I'm feeling low and lethargic. I'm stressed about feeling low and lethargic. The more I stress about how I'm feeling, the worse the feelings get. Around and around I go.
