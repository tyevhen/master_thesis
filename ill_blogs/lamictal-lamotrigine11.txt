I promise, I'll stop writing about constipation soon.  Because I think it's finally going away. 

In a post last week, I wondered whether my GI problems might be caused by a minor electrolyte imbalance.  Electrolyte imbalance isn't a common cause of constipation.  Usually the culprit is a low-fiber diet.  My diet includes enough fruits and veggies that this shouldn't be a problem.  I tried eating prunes, and Cheerios, and and anything else that might have a laxative effect, but no luck.

I thought that perhaps the lamictal dry mouth is causing me to drink so much water that I'm pissing away electrolytes.  Over the weekend, I started drinking Emergen-C, which in addition to crazy amounts of vitamin C (which I don't really care about) serves as an electrolyte replacement drink.

And I can report that it helped enormously.  Can't say that I'm back to normal, but I'm feeling so much better.  So if you're having GI issues with lamictal, try drinking gatorade or any other electrolyte replacement beverage.  It might really help.
