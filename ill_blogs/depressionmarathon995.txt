The mountains near Estes Park, Colorado

I'm back. Back from Colorado today. It's always hard to return from vacation. I'm tired. I'm a little sad. Not sure why I'm sad, but I am. I'm not looking forward to returning to work tomorrow. But I am so happy to be reunited with Puck! Boy, I missed him.

Colorado was beautiful, quiet, and serene, yet action-packed. We went whitewater rafting, hiking, and shopping. We ate out, grilled in, built fires, talked and laughed. It was nice. It was fun. I'm enclosing photos. Enjoy the scenery.
