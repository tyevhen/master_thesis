I figure I should write something, even though, truthfully, I don't want to. Just as I don't want to get dressed, go to work, wash my dishes, shower, go grocery shopping, socialize, fix something to eat, exercise, and on and on and on. I've been sleeping on the couch lately because I haven't had the energy to get from the living room to my bedroom. And I don't live in a mansion.

I'm trying my best to keep my appointments. God forbid I should be seen as a "bad patient." However, work has been another story. I attempted it on Monday but only lasted two hours. I called in sick Wednesday because I could not move. After negotiating for some shorter days, I did make it to work yesterday and today. And now I'm exhausted.

Every day I check for signs of progress. Every day wonderful friends ask if I'm feeling better. Every morning I awaken hoping I can say yes. Depression so far has not obliged. I'm feeling isolated, and stagnant, and delayed, and slow, and dull, and muted, and gray. Everything is gray. God I hate gray.
