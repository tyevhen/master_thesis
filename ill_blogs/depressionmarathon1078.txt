still tired...
not motivated to write, or meditate, or socialize, or think...
can't stand what i'm watching on tv
but can't stand the thought of turning it off...
then what would i do?
brain is mush.
mood's okay
but my brain is mush.
and i'm just so, so tired.

i know it will pass.
i hope it will pass.
yet
it can't pass
soon
enough.
