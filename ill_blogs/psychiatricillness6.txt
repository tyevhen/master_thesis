I can totally relate to this post by Alice, (a time-to-change-blogger) particularly about hiding the depressions and feeling shame and embarrassment about the manic.

I would never normally do some of the things which I have done when hypo-manic and things I have done cause me great pain as they do not fit with my concious values although I take full responsibility for my behaviour.  I can get myself into a depression from reminiscing about these things and can get into a vicious cycle.
