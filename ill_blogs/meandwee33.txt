Guess what? I can custom create a 6x6 inch or 8x8 inch abstract watercolor painting with gold or silver leaf details in your own color choice! This is an incredibly stylish and impactful way to add something special and unique to your nursery decor. This is REAL original art that will grow with your child...never to go out of style or too babyish!

NOT just for a nursery! This chic and glam painting style is also a great way to decorate any bedroom for any age. A series of these works great to make a real decorative splash in the bathroom, hallway, or family room! Grouped horizontally or vertically, these will make you smile at any time of day and make your guests say "Wow!"

DETAILS:
-size: 6x6 inch square or 8x8 inch square (the prices vary slightly between them)
-painted on high quality Canson watercolor paper
-paints used are Holbein Acryla Gouache (a vibrant, high-quality, rich opaque paint with watercolor qualities) Faux gold or silver leaf details are used depending on which matches best
-FRAME IS NOT INCLUDED (this saves you money in shipping AND allows you to choose your very own frame designs. The frame pictured is from Michael's craft store)
-CUSTOMIZED to YOUR color scheme!

How it works:
Simply make the purchase at Me and Wee and tell me all about your color requirements in the "notes to seller" section upon purchase. I will then get right to work on your own custom piece. Please allow 5 business days for this to be completed (although it may take less than this!). I will then send you a digital photo of the piece via Etsy Convo for your final approval. Once you've approved, the sale is final and I will ship your painting via USPS Priority Mail, safely wrapped in a cello sleeve, cardboard, and a bend-proof mailer.

I hope you will consider this idea for your own space or as a gift! I'm super-excited to be able to offer these!
