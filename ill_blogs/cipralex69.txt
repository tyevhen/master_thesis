had a meeting with a property owner, new situation - new people , got little bit nourves before, but nothing to compare with what I use to feel before new events like that a month ago, I wonder how i will handle it...


eventually I decided to not give a f$## about it, just flow and see what happens, just came back, it all went good, I talked a lot , I think I controled the situation well, did some NLP stuff which worked nicely - if you have the time - learn it....




Later on went to an art gallery , and to a pub, first few minutes were wierd because I got so used to the anxiety and when it did not appear i was not used to it... but it also went ok, in a cool way... I could be myself again...


Its a shame I drank some beers in the pubs, could hardly finish the 2nd glass...never happend before...I guess its cipralex trying to tell me something....STOP DRINKING...
