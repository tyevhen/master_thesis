So does anyone ever get the feeling that everything that goes wrong in the world is their fault?

Like they can't do anything right?

That is how I have been feeling lately.  Well I have definitely been told quite clearly that I am not good enough, that I don't have the right to rest and relax and enjoy the company of friends.  That I am lazy.

It's been quite clear, I got it.  I also hear that I am a total failure as a human being and as a mother.  I get that too.  The message is clear.  I can't take care of my son that my daughter is obligated to do all the work.  I failed to raise him to become a decent and productive member of society.

Everything is the house breaks or becomes dysfunctional because of me.  I am but a poor substitute for the other parent they once had. She did everything right, I do everything wrong. Rather than getting rid of her, I should have gotten rid of myself.  Things would have been much better for everyone. I decided to be stupid enough to buy a house and subjected everyone to loads of work.  Now every one's life is upside down and gone to hell and it's all my fault.  I wanted to achieve something for me but forgot, I don't deserve to have anything.

It's useless to cry.  Only worthless lazy crybabies cry.  No point is trying to lash out or try to explain.  There is no excuse.  I am a useless human being.  There is no excuse for that.

I have been reading  Louise Hay.  She defines the spiritual meaning of body aches and pains:

If one reads all of my physical issues listed and their spiritual meanings, one sees a pattern.  A lot of guilt, a dislike for oneself, a fear of going ahead and or the future, a stubbornness and inflexibility.  There is also a lot of unexpressed anger, which would be odd considering how much negativity is released through this blog.

I have had requests from wonderful caring people to reach out when the negativity and darkness overwhelms me.  It is very difficult to reach out when you feel unworthy.  I write.  I try to release the darkness through my writing.

Anger.  Yes, there is a lot of anger.  The emotion is eating me up inside.  Only about 10% of my anger is released, the rest is contained by my muzzle.  Anger is not acceptable.

I am angry at my kids, all the time.  Every hour and everyday, I am angry at them.  I am angry at me for my inadequacies.  I am angry at their lack of Independence, at their reliance on me.  I am angry that I feel chained to all my responsibilities.  I am angry that I expect sometimes more out of them than what I could do/be at their age, then I am angry and the things I could do at their age that they can't.  I am angry that I compare them to me.  I am angry that I can't do everything by myself, that I need so much help.  I am angry to always have to ask often to be ignored.  I am angry that I let things pile up.  I am angry that I can't express myself.  I am angry that I am such a wimp.  I am angry that everything I do for myself has such a high price.  I am angry that cheaters and liars and thieves get little consequences but that I always get tenfold.

Sometimes the violence inside of me scares me.  I am scared that one day it will burst free and I will be totally unable to contain it.  I am scared of what I will do it I can't keep the damn closed.
