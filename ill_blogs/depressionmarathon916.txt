One of the most popular posts on this blog is about post marathon depression. I wrote it after I ran Grandma's this year. At that time, I sensed the beginning of a post marathon drop in my mood. I think I'm smack in the middle of that drop right now. Scary.

Like I said, post marathon depression is a hot topic here, so I guess I'm not alone in this. That helps. I am feeling absolutely spent. Boston's early field closure doesn't help, but it's more than that. I'm definitely feeling out of sorts, direction-less, and drained. I guess it makes sense. I worked very hard for 4 months with one, singular goal to keep me moving. Now...nothing.

I haven't run a step since the race. I haven't swam. I haven't biked. Nothing. I've been battling a migraine for the past two days, which hasn't helped. I guess I need a goal to get going again. I'm formulating one. It involves another marathon, but that's all I'm going to say for now. I'm planning to run Saturday, maybe even go long. Sometimes I have to jump all the way in to get going again. But I think a new goal is the answer. Now, if I could just get off the couch!
