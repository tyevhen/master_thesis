I just wanted to report that I did my yoga today so I have accomplished my goal of doing it once a week so far. It helps to know that I am being held accountable to my goals by sharing with all of you. And the yoga felt so good but I know I am going to be sore tomorrow.


Has anyone else made any goals for incorporating relaxation techniques into their life? Anyone else trying to do yoga? If so how often?



If you don't want to share online, share it with someone because it helps to not do it alone.
