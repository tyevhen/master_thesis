It's Christmas Eve and we're having another blizzard!
I love it.

Puck and I walked into the thick of the storm late last night.
It was beautiful.
Quiet.
Deserted.
White.
I loved it.

It's Christmas Eve and I have a job interview today!
I'm excited.
No matter the snow.
Like Santa,
I will make it there!

Merry Christmas Eve, everyone!
