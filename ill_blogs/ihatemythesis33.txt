This was one of my favorite poems as a child. Clearly, I liked it because I was psychic and knew that one day I would need encouragement while writing a master's thesis. I hope this poem helps you too...

Melinda Mae
Have you heard of tiny Melinda Mae,
Who ate a monstrous whale?
She thought she could,
She said she would,
So she started in right at the tail.
And everyone said,"You're much
too small,"But that didn't bother Melinda at all,
She took little bites and she chewed very slow,
Just like a little girl should...
...and eighty-nine years later she ate
that whale
Because she said she would!!!
From "Where the Sidewalk Ends"



Perhaps I have macaroni & cheese taste in poetry, but Shel Silverstein is one of my favorite poets, and I was very sad when he died. Also, he wrote for Playboy, so he can't be that bad.

PS. I really hope it doesn't take 89 years to finish my thesis.
PS2. But if it does, I will still finish.
