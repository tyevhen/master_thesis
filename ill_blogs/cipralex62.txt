there's a storm outside today, freezing here, but funny that usually this kind of weather will bring me down, not this time... note to my self - notice the small changes.

meeting with stranger (work issues) went ok, at night felt very very sick, headaches and eventually I threw up...



feeling better today, the headaches are gone now finally...took the day off work, slept most of it...
