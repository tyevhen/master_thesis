Fall is upon us, or has happened,or something.



I am loving it, the bite in the air. The orange and red colors, drinking lots of coffee and tea. Wearing fuzzy socks and oversized sweaters its bliss. Autumn is my aesthetic.

Starting to read more spooky books and watch some creepy shows. Waiting anxiously for the next season of Stranger Things.





 So I had gotten a lot of books for my birthday. I might have given them a short list.


I am so excited  for these! The only one I have read is Eliza And Her Monsters. I started Stalking Jack the Ripper, and besides it shoveling all the feminism stuff down your throat, I am intrigued.

As for Eliza And Her Monsters , I loved it! 


Eliza was a very relatable character, Who is the anonymous creator of a extremely popular web comic. She is incredibly introverted and most of her life is online, she is basically me. It got deep in parts and I actually cried at one part. The art was gorgeous and I enjoyed the bits of her comic throughout.

All in all, a great read. It has language and kissing and deals with things like suicide.


I also have a few e-reads waiting for my attention.



 I can't wait to read all them!

 How about you guys? Any good books or shows I should know about.
