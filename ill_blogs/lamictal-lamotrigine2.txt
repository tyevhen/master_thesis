In a recent post, I wrote about how my husband and I were kind of stuck in a netherworld of wanting another cat, but of not feeling ready.

Last weekend we took a trip to the SPCA to test the waters.  By that point I felt I was ready, but my husband didn't.  Then, we met our cat.  It was a cat I had seen before but never visited; every time I saw her, she already had a visit tag for that day, so I needed to visit cats who hadn't been visited.  But I felt like I wanted to get to know her better.  I liked the way she looked at me -- as if she knew me.

She's still adjusting, of course, but still seems very different from our previous two cats.  She doesn't say much, for instance, even when she's hungry (our other cats would wail and complain, and when we told them they'd have to wait for dinner time, they'd start nipping our feet).  However, she's a sweet kitty and is already proving herself to be a lap cat.

I knew that cats were an important part of my self-care, but I'd forgotten how much.  Since the arrival of SC, my anxiety levels have plummeted by a factor of ten, at least.  I'm less depressed.  I'm more hopeful.  I don't just love cats, I need cats.
