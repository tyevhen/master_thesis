Paige has taken to wearing my shoes all around. My winter boots are no exception. Here she is doing some fancy footwork after putting them on:




And then she declared (no, not REALLY) "THESE are mah new puzzlin' boots!!!".



Wishing we could play outside more. Our fence and playhouse are officially buried in the backyard. That's 4 feet of snow, my friends! When it isn't 2 degrees, we try to play a bit in the driveway and I also pull her sleigh up the road and back. (Always ending with "more!" and off I go back up the road...no worries; there's no traffic) But it's so darn cold lately, it's just hard to be out there. sigh. When is spring coming?
