It's now official: Eli Gerzon and I are doing a discussion called Untraditional Adult Paths, with the following description:

After all the freedom of unschooling what happens when you're not at all interested in a traditional adult path of college and working in an office? Grown unschoolers Eli Gerzon and Idzie Desmarais will talk about their thoughts, struggles, and triumphs with finding work and a life that pays the bills, is joyful, and contributes to the world.

If you're going to the conference, perhaps I'll see you there! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
