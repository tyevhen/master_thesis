The sun came out from behind the Winter today. Finally. It's been Winter around here for far too many months now! It's late April, yet it's been cold and gray and snowing. And it's been gray and snowing and cold. And on and on and on... It's been just a bit demoralizing.

Running outside, not once since November without maximum coverage of all four limbs, has been challenging. But here I sit, reclined in my chair, sun shining on my face, fresh air breezing through my open windows, hydrating for my 20-mile run tomorrow morning. I'm actually worried about getting out early so I don't wilt in this new-found heat! I'm even going to get to wear shorts!

I'm actually anxious to do my first 20-miler tomorrow morning. The change in the weather will just make it more relaxing and fun. Since beginning the iron supplementation a few weeks ago, my running has gotten so much easier. I've been able to do speed work, tempo runs, and long runs without muscle cramps or breathlessness. Feeling like I'm putting in a hard but appropriately tiring effort sure makes running more enjoyable.

At this point, you might be thinking, "This chick is strange! How can running a 20-mile training run be enjoyable?" Well, I have several friends and coworkers who would agree with you. Running provides me with so many positives, it's difficult not to enjoy it. Just breathing fresh air and soaking in some sun for three hours is a huge motivator to keep moving forward with a smile on my face. Sure I'll be tired afterward, but the endorphin buzz will keep that from being a lasting memory. Maybe I am strange, but I'm okay with that.
