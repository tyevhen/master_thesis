I'm headed to another party tonight. It's a party with co-workers, who I haven't spent much if any time with over the past three months, but I'm still looking forward to it. Of course, if you read my last post, you'll also understand why I'm a bit anxious. I'm concerned about a crash similar to that which I experienced after the New Year's Eve parties. But that concern is not keeping me home.

Speaking of my last post, I wasn't sure anyone would understand it, so I was surprised and relieved to hear from so many of you who totally understood! I'm sorry many of us have experienced the mood crash following a happy, social event, yet it was a relief to know I wasn't weird or alone. Thank you for your comments relating similar experiences. Even if it doesn't make a lot of sense, the crash is obviously not that unusual. We are not alone.

I've been doing better since late New Year's Day. I've slowly climbed out of the crash zone. In fact, I ran 20 miles in the last three days, including a 10-miler this morning, outside, prior to the deep freeze we are apparently about to experience. The running is still more difficult than I would like it to be. It is clear I am still slowly rebuilding, and still carrying extra pounds, but it is getting easier bit by bit. I'm grateful for that.

I've not much more to report today. I'll let you know how the party, and the party aftermath, goes. I'm expecting it to be a lot of fun. I work with a very fun group of people. It will be nice to see them outside the office. Stay warm out there, my friends. And keep putting one foot in front of the other. After all, forward is the only way to go.
