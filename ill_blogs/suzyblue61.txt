If you don't know who One Direction are, then frankly, you must have been living under a rock for the past two years! However, someone who may not be so well known, is the beautiful girl who is often seen hanging off the arm of Louis Tomlinson, Eleanor Calder. Being a One Direction fangirl myself, I pretty much know everything about them-ages, middle names, where they are, and of course, who they're dating-I know it all! Since Louis is mega famous for being 1/5 of arguably the biggest boy band in the world right now, he is pretty much pictured everywhere he goes, and it's rare if he's not seen with Eleanor by his side. Over the past few months, i've noticed that Eleanor has impeccable style. It is often  very simple and she is definitely one for mixing high street bargains with high end luxuries. So, for any fashionista who wants to steal her style, I've sourced a few of her outfits from the past couple of days and put them together in a handy little guide for you...enjoy!

Jacket// Jeans// Hat// Boots


Coat// Jeans// Boots// Bag

Blazer// Shirt// Jeans// Boots// Hat// Bag


Okay, so some of El's items are raaaather pricy, but I hope these little style guides help give you some inspiration and ideas to channel her style and definitely find some cheaper high street copies...

Until next time,
Stay classy
