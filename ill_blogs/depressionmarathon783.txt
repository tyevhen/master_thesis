A big thank you to those of you who left such thoughtful comments on my last post. I'm still unpacking and sorting through things to sell. The big sale starts tomorrow. I can't wait. I never expected I'd feel so anxious to get rid of my stuff, but I can't wait to get it off my hands and out of my soul. Junk. Junk cluttering my house, but it feels like it's cluttering my soul. I'm ready to lighten up.

I sold another big item today--my trumpet. I played trumpet in high school and a little bit in college. I owned that instrument since I first learned to play. It was at least 25 years old, but it was in pristine condition. And now my co-worker's son will learn to play on it, too. I feel good about that.

It's kind of funny, now that I think about it. The people who purchased my car bought it for their 17 year old daughter. It's her first car, but in order to drive it she'll have to learn to drive a stick shift. My stuff is being used for learning left and right! That's kind of cool.

People keep asking me why I'm selling so much stuff. I think my parents are even a little worried. That's kind of funny. Besides feeling overwhelmed with old things and old memories, I want to be able to pick up and leave at any time. I can't do that if my house is loaded with stuff. Maybe I'm feeling a little restless. Maybe I'm having a mid-life crisis. I don't really care. Lightening my load feels good, and I'm going to keep doing it until I'm done. And I'm not done yet.
