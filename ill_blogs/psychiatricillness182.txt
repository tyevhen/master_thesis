The someone else has been in touch, don't want to say too much! I feel a bit better about things though.

We have swapped email addresses now so I hope we will be friends. If anything else is suppose to happen it will! I must not think about it too much though!

I slept in as I could not settle last night. I'm going to get dressed and go to the gym now. This evening I am going to my sisters to watch a film in her home cinema. It has just been built :o)

The guy I met speed dating is still sending me text messages on my phone, I'd meet him as friends as he eemed nice enough but I don't fancy him.
