Off to California today, should arrive in San Diego Wednesday night, Long Beach Friday night (2/24) and then head for parts north before my next child support hearing March 6.

The new (and last) issue of our magazine, The Melic Review, is now online: www.melicreview.com (press ¨current issue¨), in which you can judge the worth of my Eliot tome on Four Quartets, should any have the stamina. It still needs some tweaking, I think, but the webmaster wanted it up.

Now for our escape from Mexico..... can we do it? shudder shudder

¨Pray for us sinners at the hour of our death.¨
