Hi friends!
If you could spare a moment, I was hoping you could vote for our nursery in the Kristina Young Photography nursery contest. Ours is NUMBER 3 ...there are 5 finalists. VOTE HERE.
We're allowed to vote ONCE per day until midnight, March 17th. I hope you will!
The winner will get a free photo session for their baby in their nursery. I'd love to win this and have a professional document Paige in her happy space. Thanks so much for your help!!!
