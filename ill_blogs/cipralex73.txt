Hi,
I personally gave it a try and it was useful but was not enough to deal with my issues, however if you're problem in mild it worth giving it a try, "Cognitive behavioral therapy" google it, and try it.
it can save you a lot of money and time...and more important anxiety and panic attacks. also good for specific problems.


cheers
let me know how it went
