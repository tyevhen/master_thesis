I seem to be able to do anything lately, anything but write a post.

Write some paragraphs in any of my WIP's sure.

Write a book review, done.

Read any of the 38 ebooks or 55 paperbacks that are stacked around me, you bet.

Catch up on the 500 tv shows and anime's I am watching, why of course.

I even did some manual labor, cleaned a chicken coop, cleaned the basement, cleaned my room, organized my sock drawer you know the usual.

Everything but this. Just letting you guys know I'm alive and well. Besides a reoccurring existential crisis. I'm great.
