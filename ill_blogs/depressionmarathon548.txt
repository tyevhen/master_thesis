Surprise, surprise! Despite my vow to rest after Boston and hopefully heal my left achilles tendonitis, I've decided to run another marathon. In fact, my next marathon will be in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, this Sunday! Yep, I'm going to run another marathon just 20 days after Boston.

I actually decided, tentatively, to run this race soon after finishing Boston. After all the training leading up to Boston, I just wasn't satisfied with the run-walk-slog necessitated by Boston's heat. I feel the need to have a better effort under my belt. And that effort will hopefully take place this Sunday, May 6th, beginning at 7:00 AM.

Of course, this could totally backfire and be another slog to the finish line, but if that's the case, so be it. This is a new race. I believe it is only in its third year. It's supposed to be flat and fast, and it doesn't require an overnight stay in a hotel. It will be a small affair, I believe, but I have convinced one of my friends--she also ran Boston--to join me. So I'm going with the intent to run and have fun.

I actually just came in from an easy run. I was supposed to have a job interview today, but it got rescheduled. I'll go on Thursday instead. I was close to quitting my job yesterday, but I didn't. I wouldn't have walked out immediately. That's not my style, nor do I think it is professional behavior. I would have given them 4 weeks notice. I just want my time there to end, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot either. Since I don't have another steady job lined up, I decided to keep my mouth shut and keep working. It may be just a few more days before I can legitimately (i.e. I have another position waiting) serve notice. I'll try to be patient.
