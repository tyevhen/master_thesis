I've mentioned this here before. When my house is a chaotic, I start to feel chaotic. Well, my house is chaotic right now. Outside of work, I'm spending so much time training, which, for me, means extra sleep time, too, that I've been neglecting my home. There is a lot of piling going on. Mail on the table, dishes in the sink, clothes in the hamper...pile, pile, pile. I don't like when I let my house get like this.

It bothers me when my house gets too chaotic, but I really shouldn't complain. After all, I've allowed the chaos by choosing to expend my limited energy elsewhere. Chores have typically taken a back seat lately. Today I worked on cleaning up the table full of mail and paid some bills, but the dirty laundry hasn't moved. It's still waiting for me. But after running and swimming this morning, I needed my usual nap, and now I just don't have the energy. Obviously, my priority is, and has been exercise, not chores.

I think it's important to have priorities when dealing with any illness. Heck, it's important to have priorities when dealing with life! Over the past nine years, I've figured out what keeps me on my feet--mentally and physically. Clean clothes, spotless dishes, and dusted surfaces do help my mood, but exercise and sleep help a lot more. Taking my meds, eating regularly, and spending time with sober friends probably all come in higher than chores, too. Those are the things that keep me sane.

Hmmm...reminding myself of these priorites helps me feel less chaotic already. Something tells me I'll be able to put up with my dirty laundry for a few more days.
