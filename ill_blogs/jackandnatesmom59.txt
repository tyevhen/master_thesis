For all of the other closet smokers out there.....

I quit I quit I quit!!!
quit quit quit quit quit!!!

I even used an app, not that it made it any easier, but here are my stats:
I quit smoking 2 months 23 days 20 hours ago. I did not smoke 828 cigarettes and saved $322.10.
I was a "college" smoker, that turned into a twenties smoker, who quit after I got married.  Two years ago, life SUCKED.  I was in one of the worst places ever in my life, and I picked up an old bad, comforting habit.  Luckily, I eventually became disgusted with myself.  Because, for the first year and a half I kept running through this- hey, don't judge.  At least I was exercising, right?  Anyway, then I hurt my back, and had to take a break.  And I couldn't get going again, because, well, I couldn't breathe. 

So....I quit!  I really don't get tired of saying it, sorry.  But of course I immediately gained 10 lbs.  Like in two weeks.  It was really disheartening.  Sooo....I started the 17 day diet- I am on phase two, and lost all of those 10 lbs.

And I started running again.  I am on week 5 day 3 of a 10 K training program.  And I can breathe.   

I.feel.amazing!!!!
OK, I'm done
