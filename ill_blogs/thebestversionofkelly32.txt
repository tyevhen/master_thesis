If you want a great tasting, easy to make and sugar free spice mix recipe then you won't go far wrong with these Cajun and Fajita ones. 

Cajun Mix



Cajun Spice Mix - Ingredients

·         2 ½ tsp Paprika
·         2 tsp Salt
·         2 tsp Garlic Powder
·         1 tsp Dried Oregano
·         1 tsp Dried Thyme
·         1 tsp Onion Granules
·         1 tsp Black Pepper
·         1 tsp Cayenne Pepper
·         ½ tsp Red Chilli Flakes
 
Fajita Spice Mix - Ingredients

·         1 tbsp Chilli Powder (Yes, I mean tablespoon)
·         2 tsp Onion Granules
·         1 tsp Salt
·         1 tsp Paprika
·         1 tsp Garlic Powder
·         1 tsp Oregano
·         1 tsp Onion Powder
·         1 tsp Cumin

For each recipe, you simply mix the ingredients together. I store them in small plastic airtight pots. They will last for months but mine are always gone in weeks! I always give mine another quick stir before use.







Fajita Mix

There are so many ways to use these, for example:

I use the Fajita one to make Fajitas (no joke).

I use either mix simply sprinkled over whole or diced chicken breast that has been rubbed in a little oil, I then oven bake for 25 – 30 minutes. I wrap the chicken in a foil parcel, I open the foil about 5 minutes before the end and finish cooking it that way. You can also add chopped vegetables to the parcel, such as peppers, onion etc.

I add either to my beef burger recipe.

These Cajun and Fajita spice mixes both make great store cupboard basics. They are quick to make and liven up many foods. They are also sugar free, unlike most shop bought versions. Give them a go.
