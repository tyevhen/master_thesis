I have big news. At this time tomorrow, I will be meeting with a producer from a NYC based website. She and her camera crew are coming from New York to film me! We begin filming tomorrow afternoon, and they will be here filming all day Thursday as well. They found my blog and decided to highlight it (and I guess me) in a video which will be broadcast on their health website. This is a huge opportunity for me to continue fighting the stigma surrounding depression and other mental illnesses. I find myself humbled and honored once again.

This all happened very fast. The producers only contacted me last week. I've been madly cleaning my house and getting ready for their arrival since then. I'm anxious about being videotaped, as I hate my voice and am afraid I'll look like an idiot, but I cannot pass up the opportunity to be a voice for all of us in this fight. I'm trying to embrace the opportunity and leave the rest in the hands of my higher power. Writing comes easily to me. I'm not so sure about speaking. I need to let go of worry and have faith I'll find the right words.

I'll let you know more about the video as I know more. I have no idea when it will be finished, but I'll post a link as soon as it's up and running. Thank you, my friends, for reading along as I've walked this journey with you over the past 8 years. I hope I live up to the opportunity with which I'm being presented.
