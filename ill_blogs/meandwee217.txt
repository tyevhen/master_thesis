Hi friends!
I'm so sorry I've been missing around here; we've been so busy with Baby Noah and adjusting to our "new normal." We haven't really FULLY figured things out yet; my wonderful Mom was here helping us for the first week and my wonderful Mother in Law has been here for this past week. I'll be alone next week and then Chris is taking a week of vacation to be here. I'll get a more realistic picture of things next week when I'm alone all day! In the meantime, my physical recovery has been difficult and slow. I injured my tailbone AGAIN with this delivery; I believe it is broken again. So, it's hard to get up and around but I'm doing fine. My hip pain is relieved though! My sciatica is also gone. HEAVEN!!!!! I can walk! I CAN WAAAAAALLLK!!!!!!!
In other news, my poor Mom caught a nasty head cold while she was here, so that was a bit of a rough week. And this past week? I caught that nasty stomach virus that's going around here. The throw ups plus "other things" if you catch my drift...it lasted 2 days for me. Then, Chris caught it. And then Paige. Now, we are praying the baby can avoid it. It's been such a stressful week to say the least. Thank God for my Mother in Law being here to help!!!! We never could have kept up otherwise since the bug was so severe.
So, it's been hard to get a picture of what real life is going to be like. But, I CAN say that this little fella has been a dream. He sleeps in 3.5 to 4 hour chunks. He eats his bottle and then has some awake time peering around at everything while I sing crazy songs to him. Then, he zonks back out. We love him so. He will be 3 weeks old tomorrow and he is heavenly. I'll be sure to elaborate on him in my next post but just wanted to let you know we are here, we are alive, and we are looking forward to getting into our "new normal." I'll be back asap with more!
