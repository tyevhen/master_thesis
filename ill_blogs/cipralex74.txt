i sleep a lot , still wake up tired , still not feeling good enough, but there is improvement, yesterday i had a panic attack suppressed....still felt it...i will wait until a month will pass , see if there's a major improvement...mean while its up and down, mostly down... my patience is running out, I'm getting restless and i want action now, come on already, I've notice i got anxious and can't wait no more , however i do feel better , or at least stronger and very pissed or angry at this thing that annoys me, very angry about it... so angry that i will start moving things to fix it , face it and deal with it until it will lower its face in shame.
