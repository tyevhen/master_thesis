Its day 124, I feel good, I feel I don't need the pills any more... but i'm still taking them at least for the next couple of months...than we will see.

I now have a girlfriend, I go out alot, I meet new people all the time and I truly enjoy life and not taking everything too seriously.



Panic attacks, anxiety and depression are long gone, some times I don't even remember I had them.

I think I will start working out today. Its been too long.

The bottom line is I feel good, I don't know what life have in store for me, but i'm ok with it :-).

I know my posts became shorter but you know how its like when you're in a relationship.
