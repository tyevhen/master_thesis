Things are coming around. I'm slowly feeling better. I think the assignments my therapist gave me are a large part of this healing process. I've written out two schedules. On one schedule I've got boxes to check if I've done 30 minutes of exercise, taken Puck out for his exercise, and if I've avoided chocolate for the day. Oh yah, I've given up chocolate for awhile. When I feel mentally bad, I tend to over-indulge in the yummy stuff, and then I end up feeling worse! So I get a star if I've made it through the day without devouring chocolate. So far, so good. In fact, knowing I've got boxes to check every night seems to be helping me stay on track and feel better.

The other schedule I've started is a running schedule. I'm thinking about doing The Richmond Marathon in November. I'm following a Runner's World training program rather than using my own--less thinking for me. I haven't yet decided if I am going to actually run the marathon, but I figure having the schedule will help get me out the door and focus my training. It's only been two days, but so far the schedule has nudged me forward. It's working.

I don't necessarily like having a regimented, scheduled life. However, right now it seems to be what I need. Being accountable to my therapist and myself, physically putting the check in the box, and having someone else tell me what to do (i.e. the running schedule) seems to take a little stress out of my day. It's a good thing. I guess I'll keep keeping the schedules for now.
