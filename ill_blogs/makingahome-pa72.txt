No matter how old I get, one of my favorite things to do in the fall still remains. I LOVE raking up leaves and playing in them. The two younger ones and I spent a good portion of our Saturday this past weekend doing just that.

Here's another fall favorite of mine. Homemade caramel popcorn. This recipe makes a lot so I always end up giving some away to friends or neighbors.


Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking soda
6 qts. popped popcorn
Heat butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt until it comes to a boil. Continue to boil for five minutes without stirring. Remove from heat. Add vanilla and baking soda; stir. Pour over freshly popped popcorn. Bake for 30 minutes at 250 degrees, stirring every occasionally to prevent burning.

Ian Update - I had Ian at Children's Hospital yesterday to see the neurologist. His EEG from last week was abnormal, showing seizure activity from the right temporal lobe of his brain. We are now praying for wisdom on which course of treatment we should take for this.
