Hello All!

           I am still fostering.  Many beautiful cats have sojourned under my roof.

Currently I have two beautiful Ragdoll mixes, Coke and Pepsi.

These boys are the absolutely Purrrrfect pets...

They are a mix of a dog and a cat.  They follow you around like a puppy, want cuddles, chat with you....  just amazing....

They are also so so soft!


Silver, purring as usual....
I also have a cute approximately 2 year old silver tabby that we are calling Silver, for lack of a better name.  He is not with the network and the poor thing is restrained to a room as he wants to fight with the other household cats... He needs a home of his home FAST!  He also needs to be neutered  but I have a cash-flow problem, I can't get it done...

This guy is so unbelievably affectionate...  Purrs so loudly and easily...

He just LOVES people.  I don't understand how he could have been thrown out like trash...

He uses the litter box (though smells pretty strong...)

Just an all round GREAT little kitty.  If you live in the Ottawa area and want him... get in touch with me...

Did I tell you all about Katey?  Katey was the sibling of Coco and Charley, such a firecracker and another amazing kitty.  She was adopted to a great couple who was not at all planning on getting a cat but they just absolutely fell totally in love with her on sight.  They just HAD to have her, her picture in the link below.
