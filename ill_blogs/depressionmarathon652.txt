I've been on vacation over the long Fourth of July weekend. I'm back up in the Northwoods of Wisconsin visiting my parents and my new friend, D. The weather has been as gorgeous as the weather could possibly be. I've been boating, waterskiing, biking, grilling out, and watching parades. I've spent time getting to know D. better, and we've had a really nice time. It sucks that we live more than 5 hours apart, but we've both decided to give this relationship a shot anyway. I'm on my way home today. Feeling good. I'll post more once I get back.
