This will be short and sweet because with a migraine and complete lack of sleep I don't have energy for much more.  Met with the advocate this morning and am completely overwhelmed.  With two boys on the spectrum whom you love more than life there is never enough money, enough time, or enough resources.  That being said, this is a step.  I have to find a way somehow for that to be enough for right now.  The advocate has a wealth of knowledge and many ideas, certainly much to add- these are the positives.  The negatives?  I feel completely inadequate as a mother and advocate for my children.  There is so much I don't know, so many directions I am just not aware of.  The boys' IEP's are completely lacking and I haven't known enough to fight for the right things.  Just when you think you are making some progress, you feel like you are told you are 30 steps behind where you thought you were.  It's just disheartening.  It also reemphasizes our need for help.  So help is what we are going to get.
