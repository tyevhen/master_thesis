Things are looking up around here. I'm moving ahead. While I'm not quite back to full strength, I am feeling better every day. I've been able to run, work, do my chores, and meet with friends on a fairly consistent basis over the past 4 days. I'm grateful to be feeling more like myself again. And I'm especially grateful this episode did not last very long. If felt like forever when I was in the midst of it, but I know it could have been a lot, lot worse.

I'm not sure what else I have to report. I'm glad I'm doing better, because work has been long and busy the last several days, including today. I worked 9.5 hours on Friday, 8 hours yesterday, and 8.5 more today. In between I ran 15 miles on Saturday. I'm so glad I didn't have more than 15 miles scheduled, as my legs were really dead. It was a tougher than usual 15 miles, and I was glad to be done. I took a long snooze after that one.

I guess fatigue is the one lingering effect from this depression relapse. That hasn't really gotten better yet. It was really noticeable during and after Saturday's run, but it's been pretty significant every day. I'm tired. Just tired. I'm hoping the fatigue will abate soon. In the meantime, I'll keep sleeping...a lot.

Thank you all for your comments and support over the past couple weeks. I so appreciate everyone who reads my little blog. And your comments really did make a huge difference during this time.
