No crash yet although I have eaten a whole large bag o chocoalte buttons and kept topped upon the diet coke all day.  When I feel better I will start Weight Watchers again.  In the mean time it is party all the way!  Maybe it will triggor a hypomanic period! :-)  By the way, the cat does not like dancing with me, she would rather sleep.

I have spent most of the day working and I am happy with the amount I have achieved. Iam off toTescos to buy Onions to make French Onion Soup.  That should be reasonably sensible after all the chocalate :-)!

I may be happier but still behind on the housework, I need tofind some clothes to wear to work this week!
