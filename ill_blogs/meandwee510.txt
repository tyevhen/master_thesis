Today I'm officially 15 weeks and 2 days pregnant. Not that I'm counting in detail or anything. I finally decided to take my first belly picture since there is finally something to see other than the swelling from my breakfast. It's pretty small as far as pregnant bellies go but I know it's very early. Don't mind the background...I'm standing there in the full-length closet mirror in our laundry room. I also didn't put on any makeup today but I figured you'd forgive me. Tomorrow is my monthly doctor's visit where I'll get to hear the wee one's heartbeat (Knocking on wood all is still ok). Today was the first day in months that I woke up feeling 1. rested and refreshed 2. not sickly or headache-y in some fashion. I actually have had some energy today for the first time in what feels like forever. Good timing too, since I'm working on some holiday card and invitation designs for a lovely client. I hope you are all well and I'll be back soon to show you my very first baby-related purchase! Well, it's more for ME than the baby, but I'm working on my bravery toward getting "just for baby" items. See you soon!
