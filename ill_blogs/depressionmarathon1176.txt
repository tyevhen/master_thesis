Training for a marathon takes a ton of time. A ton of time... Between running, working, meetings, and my feeble attempt at a social life, this blog has taken a back seat for a few days. The good news is I feel better than I did in the middle of last week. The bad news--I feel terrible about not taking time to update this blog. I apologize.

Today, I ran 16 miles. That brought my weekly total into the low 40's. It was tough to fit the run in, as we had a regional AA get-together this weekend. It began Friday night and ended this afternoon. The get-together was amazing. Speakers from all over the world told their stories. Wow. Amazing. But back to training. Like I said, training for a marathon takes a ton of time.

Thinking about it after the fact, I realized that running 16 miles took up at least 7 hours today. SEVEN! No, I am not that slow. The running portion, which was by far the toughest, only took between 2.5 and 3 hours. However, running long isn't that simple. By the time I prepared, ran, cooled down, showered, stretched, ate, and then napped, at least seven hours had passed! That's an entire day! I had never thought about that before. Phew... no wonder training for a marathon takes so much time!

More soon...
