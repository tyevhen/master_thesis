What is the one thing you wish you could convey to "normies" about your mental illness? Do you want to tell them what to say? Or how about what NOT to say? Is there a symptom you'd like to explain? Do you wish people understood exactly how you felt or what you needed? Well, here's your chance.

I've been doing more public speaking lately. As a result, there are many new readers visiting this blog looking for more information about mental illness. Based on their publicly verbalized questions, these readers are eager for information. They want to know what to do for someone with depression. They want to know "why men have a harder time" admitting to mental illness and seeking help. They want to know helpful things to say, or how to convince their loved one to get help. So here's your chance. Please help them out. What do you wish others knew about your illness?

Whether you have depression, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, or schizophrenia, what do you wish people understood? Help my new readers. Help yourself. Join me. Let's educate each other. After all, I certainly don't have all the answers!! Thanks!
