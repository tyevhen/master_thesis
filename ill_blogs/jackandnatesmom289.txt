OK seriously.....ugh.  Today is Natey's last day of ABA- I want to drive him back and forth and give all the teachers their gifts and the kids their special snack.  I fear I might run off the road.  Then Natey and I are supposed to have a video taped "play session" for our More Than Words class.  They have bean bag chairs in the play area in case the kiddos need to crash (throw themselves on something).  It is likely that both Natey and I will be doing crashing of another kind.  Oh and I am also working.   I am not just decreasing leucovorin in the morning, I am going to stop it, wait a few days, and then restart the lower dose again.  I'm not taking any chances.  This is crazy.
