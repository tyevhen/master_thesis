I could be I guess, I find it very hard to know sometimes and impossible to distinguish a natural high from a hypo manic episode.

I was buzzing after going Salsa dancing on Sunday night, I was so nervous before I went in I said the Lord's Prayer to myself over and over again. I am not even religious but it keeps the negative thoughts away and it is a comforting feeling that someone is looking over you.

I guess I was a little high afterwards - I think I was just pleased with myself for going Salsa dancing. I had a lot of energy Sunday night, the guy I was dancing with wanted to sit every other dance out! I could have been a little high?

I don't think I was too high or caused myself any problems; I did loose my routine a bit yesterday and stayed up far too late. I will make sure I get to bed on time today and eat properly. As for blogging a lot I think I was bored more than anything else :o).

Raine; Thank you very much for your concern, I will make sure I stick to a routine this week and take plenty of time out to slow down and relax!
