Power back?  Nope
However, in the past 3 days Nathan has said:
1,2,3 go boom
go bye bye
get down
hug (or the beginning of it)
hi (or the beginning of it)
go puzzle (or go puh)

Thank you God.  I will live without power for another 10 days if Nate says this many more new things.  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart!!!!
