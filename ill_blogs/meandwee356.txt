Over several weeks' time, Chris would come home from the grocery store disappointed in failed attempts to find "Acai" juice. He always found it mixed with other things, but never alone. And when he did, it was always crazy expensive so he would leave it on the shelf. He'd heard it was a superfood and had all kinds of crazy good things in it. Antioxidants. Oh, the antioxidants. Like a miracle elixr of the ages. I heard about it all the time after his trips. It became a "thing." Anyway, he found his beloved juice at Whole Foods market not too long ago and has been basking in the glory of how he will now live forever. (or something like that.) He is psyched about the darned antioxidants.One of those words thrown around a lot now. I've heard that word in this house quite a bit. sigh. I need to research more about what they will do for me if I were to partake. Sprout wings? Discover the meaning of life? Solve world hunger? Become SuperGirl?
Paige has been very sick with this cold, as you know, and I have a sniffle here and there but am still fighting strong! I said to Chris:" This cold Paige has is so awful! I have NO IDEA how you don't have it yet!" As he shoved things into his work bag on his way off to work he grinned and said "It's the antioxidants."
sigh.
