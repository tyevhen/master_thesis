feeling pathetic today.
or maybe it's sorry for myself.
either way, it's ugly.

did yoga.
the only highlight so far.
otherwise,
i've been pathetic.

eating too much crap,
which makes me feel like crap.

sleepy,
but not sleeping.

bored,
but unwilling to do anything different.

so i'm bored, sleepy, and feel like crap.
like i said,
pathetic.

tomorrow is a new day.
i hope.
