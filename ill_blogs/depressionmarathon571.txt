It's been a good week. I'm sitting here relaxing after a very tough 14 mile run. More on that later. I feel like I'm back in the saddle. This is the first week since October, 2011, prior to knee surgery, that I've participated in what used to be my normal routine. It's the first week since my hospitalization prior to Christmas that I worked a full, normal work week, too. So it's been a good week.

I began the week by attending my early morning strength training class. That class requires that I get up just after 4 AM, and I wasn't sure I was going to be up to it. But I did it. And I did it again on Friday. My knee was a bit sore afterward, but I was able to participate fully. It was nice to be doing some good strengthening again, especially since I know it helps my running.

Work was particularly busy this week, so I worked three full days. One day was hectic and a bit overwhelming. I know I wouldn't have been able to handle that day even one week ago. But I handled it this week. That was encouraging. Working my normal schedule will certainly help financially as well.

As I noted earlier this week, I ran well on Tuesday. I followed that up with a nice relaxed run on Thursday. So I went into this morning's long run feeling optimistic. Unfortunately, it was 12 degrees with a fairly stiff north wind when I left my house at 6:30 this morning. After a 2 mile warm-up loop with Puck, I joined my local track club for the remaining 12 miles. Running with the group is great, and it was nice to be back among my fellow running friends, but I ran a bit too fast early. At mile 12.5, running uphill and into that freezing wind, I ran out of gas. But I persevered, and I'm happy to have finished. It was a good week of running. I'm feeling much more encouraged about finishing Boston.

A nice week... It's nice to have a nice week. It's been a while.
