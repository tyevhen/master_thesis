The 2010 Boston Marathon is closed. The 2010 Boston Marathon has reached its field limit of 25,000 runners, and there is no way to sign up for the race anymore. There is no waiting list. There is no entry...period. So there will be no Boston Marathon in 2010 for me.

Talk about a major disappointment... I'm so glad I didn't know this before my race. That would have made it very difficult to keep going when I felt bad. My qualifying time is good for 18 months, so I will sign up for the 2011 Boston Marathon, but a lot can happen in 1.5 years. After working so hard for this one singular goal, I'm still dumbfounded that I won't be able to participate in the culminating event. Dumbfounded and sad...

Oh, and did I mention it officially closed on November 13th--one day before the Richmond Marathon?
