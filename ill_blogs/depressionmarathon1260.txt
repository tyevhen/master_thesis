That's ironic.
I'm sitting here contemplating how the passage of time is all we need to heal sometimes, and "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper comes on the radio. (Hello, God! How are you today? Thanks for the "subtle" cue--of course, if you hadn't "subtly" hit me over the head, I never would have noticed! But you already knew that...)
As I was saying, despite my mood still being unexpectedly low after yesterday's crash, today is a more functional day. My skin fits today. I am less overwhelmed and have more energy. Whereas yesterday I couldn't make it to two planned evening meetings nor out the door for my scheduled run, today I've already done some work and completed yesterday's tough run. Sure, I'd prefer my mood hover somewhere above the toilet bowl rim, but I'll gratefully accept the NON-paralysis and the functionality!
And wait for the passage of more time.
