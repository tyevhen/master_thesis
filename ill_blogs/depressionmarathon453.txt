Brrrr... It is cold here in Minnesota! Shocking, I know. It was barely above zero today. I believe it is exactly 1 degree Fahrenheit right now. This morning, with the 20-40 mph winds, the windchill was something like -20 to -30 (that's 20 to 30 degrees below zero)! I had a 5 mile run on my schedule. The smart thing to do, the reasonable thing to do, I figured, was drive to the gym and get on the treadmill.

But then again, I never, ever claimed to be reasonable or smart. After not too much deliberation, the thought of getting into an ice cold vehicle, with too little clothing, and driving 10 ice cold minutes to run 5 boring miles without moving an inch, was less appealing to me than layering up, slipping plastic baggies over my wool socks, covering most of my head and face in fleece, and stepping out the side door into the crisp, bright, breezy day.

I had a great run! I put on just the right amount of gear, and I was quite comfortable. I tried to avoid running into the wind when I could. The fresh snow made for soft, secure footing. The bright sun reflecting off that snow made the scenery lovely, and I had the local running routes all to myself. Instead of the five miles I had scheduled, I ran eight and a half. I looked like a frosty Eskimo when I got home, but the bragging rights I earned were priceless.

After such a nice run, the rest of my day was a breeze. Work was quite busy and ran long, so I grabbed some Chinese food on the way home and, as usual, ate way too much. I'm expecting a long day tomorrow, too, but I only have a 3-miler to complete and the high is supposed to be a whopping 12 degrees! That should be a cinch!
