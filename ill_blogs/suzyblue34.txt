I'm not even ashamed in the slightest to say I'm a Little Mix fan, they're all gorgeous and i'm a sucker for bubblegum pop! I'm addicted to their new song and upon watching the video, I instantly fell in love with Jade's makeup - she's such a BEAUT! So today's look was inspired by her: a neutral winged eye and a bright fuchsia lip.
