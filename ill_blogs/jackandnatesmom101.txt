I haven't been mentioning Nate's "progress" much lately.  I don't want to jinx myself.  So I am still not going to go into much detail about what we are seeing or not seeing.  Instead I am going to tell you a happy little story:

When Nate was about 19 months old and Infants and Toddlers first came to our home for the initial therapy- the therapist was able to ellicit one word from him- she would say "ready, set", and Nate would say "go!".  Then he stopped.  Then he started.  Then he stopped.  He has done this off and on for the last two years, but it's been about 6 months since I heard it last.

I was feeling inspired to push him a bit this morning while we were outside waiting for his bus.  So I started saying this each time he was "gearing up" to run a lap. I dragged out the period between set and go a little more each time, and it did seem like he was pausing to wait for the word before he started running again.  So the next time we did it, I dropped "go" just to see what would happen.  Did he say it?  He sure did!  This alone makes me very happy, it's always nice to see something click, especially after such a lapse.  But it gets better; as we went on, he kept saying it, but he LOOKED AT ME like "lady are ya gonna say it?" each time before he finally said it.  He was totally checking in with me, and clearly he totally got the concept because he never ran before the word "go".  I know all the parents with nonverbal kids out there are cheering right now- in fact I think I hear them....

Short but very sweet.  Happy Friday!
