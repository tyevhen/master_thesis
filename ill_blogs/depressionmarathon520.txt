I made my mom cry. She doesn't read my blog (my choice), but I sent her my last post in an e-mail. She said it made her so happy, she cried. Apparently, my step-dad cried too. I wasn't expecting that. My mom said it was the best birthday present I could have given her. I'm glad she liked it. It was a bit of a risk for me to send it, but now I'm glad I did.

In other news, my running is going well again. After struggling through my two weekday runs last week, I had a really good 18-miler on Saturday. I had to leave early in the morning again in order to avoid the heat and humidity. I had a couple slow miles as I wiped the sleep from my eyes and worked out the kinks in my muscles, but then I settled into a nice rhythm. I ran a steady 8:55 pace the rest of the way, and I felt good doing it. It's nice to finish a long run knowing I could have run another couple of miles if I had wanted.

Work is also going well. I'm settling in, but I still lack the confidence I'd like to possess. Nonetheless, I think I'm doing an okay job. I like my co-workers a lot, and they facility is nice. That certainly has helped me feel more comfortable. So far, it's a good fit.

Lastly, I'm doing well with my thinking and mood. A couple weeks ago, I wrote about my screwed up, intrusive thoughts. Well, shortly after writing about them, they disappeared. I had one recurrence last week while walking Puck, but otherwise my brain has been quiet. That makes me happy. Likewise, I'm thrilled my mood continues to be stable. I feel good, and I'm enjoying feeling good. I sure could get used to this.
