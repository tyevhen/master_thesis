Hi guys! 

I'm back.. After a long time🙄
So basically after landing myself 3 toddlers all by myself I am now back and active and back on the job 💪🏾😂 haha.

I've had many people asking me when am I going to start blogging again etc etc, so I'm going to try my best and stay active and answer as many questions and help young mums out there!

I feel like I'm new to this again I have a major baby brain it's not even a joke! ANYWAY as requested Ima write about 'being a young mum'


As you know I fell pregnant at 20 with Monaè not too young but young enough.. Everything went well and I love my pregnancy.. Gave birth and all.. 3 months late I fell pregnant with twins! I was just getting into the swing of being a young mum with a new born baby who wakes up every 2 hours in the night as well as managing my daily tasks and trying to sleep etc.. Anyway I gave birth to the twins and before you know it I have 3 babies under 1 all to my self.. All on my own. I was devastated I was down and depressed I was not sleep and eating.. I rarely had any help I had just had a section which went wrong.. And I had to manage a active 1 year old as well as sick new born twins! Up all night and then caring for my daughter as well as them. It was like the worst thing ever I felt like my life had finished I felt so alone everyday for 3 whole months I would cry and cry and cry. Nobody could understand why because i had what everyone wanted.. Yet no one understood how I felt.. I had post natal depression I didn't even want to touch my kids I wanted to just run a mile.

I would beg and beg their dad to help me but he wouldn't he said it's to hard he doesn't want to be doing it. And there's not much he can do. He saw me everyday cry and cry not eat.. Practically in the worst way I have ever been and he could not give me a single hand not even a few hours sleep. To the point I had councilling I had a lot of help from family and friends.

Although it didn't make it 100% better they made it all manganable I woke up one day and just said 'look Paris you are making yourself so so I'll.. You have 3 babies that depend on you.. Although it wasn't planned and wasn't supposed to be.. I was gifted them for a reason.. There is no other way but to step up and be a mum.' And so I did I lost out on sleep for months! But I had them and they made my strength go from 0 to 100. Most girls my age are out drinking living life partying going on holidays etc.. I have never done that in my life even before I had kids.. So it was never a big big difference to me. I just felt so alone because I was with somebody that I thought I was going to be with for life and we was going to have a perfect family but that changed once they came along. And things began to get violent. 

I then said to myself my kids will love me unconditionally more than anybody out their in the world. No matter how hard It is.. It is only temporary and all my hard work will most definitely pay of. I have a house a car and I'm a qualified beautician I have everything I just have to look at it as its a little break for the time being. And I'll be back to the Paris I was in no time.. An even better Paris.

Kids doesn't mean your life's finished.. It's made me want to be a better person even more it's made me see life in a different way and it's still making me want to achieve so so much more. I'm 24 at the end of the year and have done my time in children. It will be a few more years when they are at full time school.. And I can go and have my freedom and go back to work and provide for us all even more and give us everything we need! 

Word of advise having 1,2,4 even 6 kids is hard but it's only temporary get into routines.. Teach them from right and wrong. Take them on play dates spend every minute with them through happy times to sad times and tears because it comes round so quick and there is nobody in this world you need or who needs you more than your children. So when you think life's hard or being a parent is. Sit back and think all they need is you.. You was blessed to have the chance to have a child so cherish every moment and tell yourself everyday you can do it we are made to do it and there is little people watching up to you everyday to be just as strong as you!
