Happy Veteran's Day! I'd like to use this post to honor all our servicemen and servicewomen who have put their lives on the line to protect us and our freedoms. I think about them and that fact every day and am always so appreciative. Thanks, Dad, for your service and to all my other amazing family members and friends who've served or continue to serve. The picture above shows the U.S.S. Canberra...the ship my Grampa had served on in World War II. It was torpedoed during the war off the coast of Formosa and was towed to safety after much drama and loss to say the least!
