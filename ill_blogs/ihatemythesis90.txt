As a way to motivate myself to work on my thesis, I created this start system (a la kindergarten). Unfortunately, I never had the time to buy gold star stickers, so nothing ever came of it. But I'm posting it here, cause you may be more diligent than me. Let me know if it helps you out...

- waking up without snooze
- waking up at 8 am (2 stars)

- at least 5 hours of work in one day
- reach a milestone on project
- in bed by 1:30 am
- say no to unhealthy food temptation/eat a healthy meal
