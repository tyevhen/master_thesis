A great day in Boston for women's running! And a great big thank you to Joan Benoit Samuelson who ran her last marathon today in spectacular fashion. The pioneer of women's marathoning won the first Olympic Marathon Trials, the first Women's Olympic Marathon, and today in her last appearance, at the age of 50, set a new American marathon record for her age. Thank you Joanie for all you have given back to the sport.
