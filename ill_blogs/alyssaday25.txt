On Friday, I'll be part of a massive effort, spearheaded by Mandy Roth and Yasmine Galenorn, for authors to speak out against bullying.  I'll by interviewing my kids, who have both experienced bullying, for a first-hand look at what it feels like to be the victim of such horrible attacks.  Here is a list of participants, courtesy of Mandy Roth.



In other somber news, I was in a terrifying car accident Saturday, in which a MORON driving in front of me on a high-traffic, high-wind, freeway bridge high above a river, hit a bump and his UNSECURED king-sized box springs went flying through the air and straight at my face.  Yes, it smashed into my windshield at 50 mph, and just the sight of it blocking out the sun as it shot toward me, and the instant thought that I was going to be decapitated or plunge into the river, was enough to scare the crap out of me. 

Not to mention the shattered pieces of glass all over my car.  I didn't realize until a couple of hours later that several of them were in my hair and clothes.  So I spent Saturday afternoon and all morning today dealing with insurance and glass repair people and I have to take car to shop for body damage.  BUT NOBODY WAS HURT, THANK GOODNESS--and I'm especially proud that I did not jump up and down on the moron's head.  The state trooper said that the ticket carried a mandatory court appearance for the guy, so I can only hope the fine is huge.

But my kids were not in the car, and as I said, nobody was hurt, so I'm putting this one in the "lucky it wasn't worse" category, although I'm not sure when I'll be wanting to drive over that bridge again . . .

My wish for today is that you all drive safely, surrounded by cautious drivers who do not fling bed parts at your head.

hugs,
Alyssa
