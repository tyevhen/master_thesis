Whenever someone thinks of anxiety, the first thing that usually comes to the mind is 'worry'. Yes, it is true that most of us anxiety sufferers worry, but not all in the way you'd expect. There are so many types of anxiety disorders that people's worries can come in all shapes and forms, whether that's through health anxiety or panic disorder and there may be certain triggers. But, even if this is the case; everyday we are prone to worry and many people have asked me how best to stop worrying, so I have compiled a few tips that may help you:

1. Write down your worries - writing you problems down not only relieves the stress, but if you organise them too, you can start a plan of action to combat your troubles.

2. One day at a time - often when you look at the big picture, you will start to become overwhelmed; I know the feeling! Thus, by taking one day at at time; organising that day and only focusing on what you are capable of doing in that day, you will be in control.

3. Talking - often when you talk to someone else about a problem, they may have a few wise words which may help you see things in a different light. I understand that not everyone has somebody to talk to, but there are charities if you feel you can talk to no one else.

4. Yoga - This may not be for you, but I often find that when you do yoga, you can have some piece of mind for a few minutes. Alongside this, you will be able to relax.

5. Understand - the most important, but perhaps hardest thing to grasp is that worrying doesn't change a thing. A very famous speech titled 'Wear Sunscreen' noted "worrying is as useful as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum". In other words, it doesn't change a thing. There are absolutely no benefits from worry. Thus, it might be better to go with the flow.
