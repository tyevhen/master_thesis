hi,
someone asked me if cipralex feeling can get better and then worse again?
the answer is yes, this means two things:

1. you're in the starting phase or your body is still adjusting to the pill, usually will pass after the first few months...

2. you need to increase the dosage.



but consult your doctor, this is what I would do.
