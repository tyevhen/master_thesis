So much gloominess in my blog lately, I thought I'd add at least one smiling photo from Grandma's Marathon 2012. This was taken by my brother around mile 16, I think. My two nephews (ages 6 and 3) made me smile with their homemade signs that said, "Go Auntie! Faster, Faster!!" I saw them 5 more times over the course of the race. It was great having their support. They were definitely the bright spot of an otherwise disappointing day.
