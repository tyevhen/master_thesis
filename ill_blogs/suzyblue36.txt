Soon after I moved back up to Aberdeen around a month ago, to my dismay I discovered I had left my foundation back home! In a state of sheer panic I jumped on the bus to ASDA and picked up the cheapest one I could find in the makeup aisle. I ended up purchasing Rimmel's Stay Matte foundation, which had just been released at the time. I am a massive massive fan of their Stay Matte Powder, which is ultimately what pushed me to choose this foundation.

I have never been a fan of matte foundations, I much prefer a more luminous finish, and this foundation has reminded me why I vowed never to buy a matte finish foundation again! The first issue I had was the formula was SO thick - as you can probably see from the swatch above, it is an incredibly heavy, mousse like texture, which instantly cakes when applied to the skin. It is also really hard to blend, and clings to dry patches on the face. I tried many different primers and moisturisers on my skin before applying the foundation but unfortunately, nothing seemed to help smooth it out.

However, in saying that, this product did have a few good points. It definitely evens out the skin tone and conceals redness and it also has amazing staying power - this is the first foundation i've come across that pretty much lasts all day!

I mean, if you're a fan of thick, full coverage foundation, you will most likely love this product, it's Rimmel's answer to Dream Matte Mousse. As for me, I am just glad to have my beloved YSL Touché Eclat foundation back where it belongs! If you've tried this product, let me know how you got on, perhaps it's just my skin type that disagrees with the formula? Who knows, maybe it's your holy grail foundation!...
