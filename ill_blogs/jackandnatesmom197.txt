Nate has had a pretty good weekend- as always he is a pretty happy guy, but he went to his first birthday party in awhile on Saturday and did really really well. 


Also, this evening, I finally captured on video his color sorting skills.  This is really big for him.  Go ahead and put your volume on mute to avoid mommy's really annoying voice!


See daddy!!!! Multiple times I have called poor daddy upstairs to see this and Nate has refused...so here you go daddy...I wasn't kidding!!
