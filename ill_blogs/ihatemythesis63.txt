You know that disgusting feeling you get at hour 12 of a cross-country road trip? It's the body's rebellion against confinement, lack of blood circulation and road snacks ... and the byproduct is a queasy, lethargic feeling where everything aches. That's how I feel now. Of course, I'm not in a car, but at my kitchen table studying. I can put up with pain, but the lethargy is hampering my productivity.

So how do I cure this? I don't feel like there is time to do a big yoga session; I should really just power through. But if I'm not going to be productive anyway, then no sense in forcing myself to suffer.
