I've been home for a few days now. I'm not doing very well. I called my mother over the weekend, and she flew into town yesterday. I was lucky. She had a free ticket to use, so she's here for the next week to help me out. We have one month worth of bills to go through, tax information to gather, and general housework to accomplish. It's really hard for me to ask for help, but I'm glad she's here. I was basically a basket case for the last few days. I think things will be easier with her here to help.

I returned to work yesterday afternoon for four hours. Again, I felt like a fish out of water. I feel like I'm barely holding it together. I'm afraid I'm going to crack if someone looks at me cross-eyed. People welcomed me back, but I could barely stand it. I felt all questioning eyes upon me. I was very uncomfortable. I go back tomorrow for another four hours, and I'm not looking forward to it.

This illness has really torn me down this time. I feel totally beaten up. My self confidence is shot. I feel incompetent at work and at home. I have a sponsee calling to continue going through The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, and I feel incompetent to guide her on her sobriety journey, too. I feel worthless and useless. Depression has cut my legs out from under me this time, and I'm not sure how to get back on my feet. It's been a long time since I've felt this beaten. Just beaten...

Somehow I've got to drag myself back up into the realm of the living. I'm not there yet. I've got to get back on my feet, exercise, go to work, socialize, attend to my commitments, and live life on life's terms again. It's easier said than done. I'm praying for a reprieve.
