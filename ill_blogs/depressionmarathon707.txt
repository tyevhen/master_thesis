Last Sunday, 6 days ago, I ran 26.2 miles under sunshine with temps in the mid seventies. Today, 6 days later, I ran 13.1 miles under gray skies with temps at or below zero! Yikes! As the sub-zero windchill froze my face this morning, I smiled at the divergent conditions. Hard to believe I was so warm only one week ago. But at least I was back on the road.

Earlier this week, I suffered a bit of let-down following The Austin Marathon. It wasn't too bad, just enough to make me nervous. I felt low. I was eating a lot of crap, and I took one more day off than I had planned before I was able to convince myself to get back to it. I'm back to training, but I'm still not happy with how I'm eating. I don't feel good about myself when I throw junk down my throat, yet I continue to do it. Baffling. Tomorrow I start a new Weight Watchers week, and I hope to get back to my sensible eating program then. That would be the final step in reversing this let-down.

I'm glad I'm back on the road because last night I realized Boston is only 7 weeks away. For some reason, I thought there was more time between the two marathons than that. It's not a big deal. It just means slightly more accelerated training than I had planned. That's why I ran 13, rather than 10, today. I just wish the road was a little warmer! And sunnier... Is that too much to ask?
