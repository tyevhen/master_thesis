Happy Monday friends!
I hope you had a great weekend! Ours was lovely. We went on a little roadtrip to visit Chris' parents in Connecticut. It's always so special to see the kids with their grandparents as they make lasting memories. Like this one where P's grandfather (she calls him "Rico"...not his name, but a long story) is reading her bedtime stories in the "transformer bed" as she calls it. He's great at making the stories come to life!


It was so nice to see them. We had yummy lunches, a little shopping, and watched "Moneyball" on Saturday night. It was awesome and I'm not a huge sports fan.

Road trips are fun for Paige when she gets to watch movies. The choice this time was "Tangled." I played servant while sitting in the backseat on the way. You know the drill...fetching drinks, snacks, picking up dropped toys, entertaining crying baby, feeding said baby the bottle they obviously are begging for, etc.





That nap wasn't nearly long enough. hee!
Paige is back to school this morning and Chris is back to work. I miss them, but Noah and I are holding down the fort just fine. Have a great week everyone. Let's choose the happy path ok?
