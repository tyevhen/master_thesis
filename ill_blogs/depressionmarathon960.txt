So I got myself a tri bike this spring with the thought of one day trying a triathlon--maybe. I'm not a great swimmer, and I'm a little afraid of the water, so the swimming portion of the tri scares me. With that in mind, you'd think I would jump at the chance to try a duathlon, right? Well, apparently not.

You see, there is a duathlon (run, ride, run) right here in my back yard this Saturday. It is a 3.3 mile run, followed by a 21.6 mile ride, followed by another 3.3 mile run. The distances aren't overwhelming. I know how to run. I know how to ride my bike. What is the problem?

The problem is I'm afraid. I don't know why! It's silly. Why am I afraid to try this? Yes, I've never done this before. Yes, it would be uncomfortable being a newbie. Yes, like most people, I do not find bike shorts particularly attractive. So I'm afraid because I'd have to run 6.6 miles in big-butt bike shorts? I guess so...

I'm writing this here in hopes of inspiration. I hope to be so embarrassed by my fear that it will force me to confront it. After all, I really don't have a good reason to be afraid. Doing a duathlon would be new. It would be different. I wouldn't be a comfy veteran of the sport. I guess those are all reasons for my fear, but I don't think they are particularly good reasons. I should do the duathlon despite my fears, big-butt bike shorts and all...right?
