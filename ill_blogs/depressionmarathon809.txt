I did it. I finished my first outdoor triathlon. The swim (1500 meters or 0.93 miles) was as ugly as it could get. I believe I was one of the last 3-5 people out of the water. But I made it around the lake, twice.

The bike (24.8 hilly miles) was great. It felt fast. I passed a lot of people. The run (6.2 miles) was tough, but doable. I passed a lot of people on the run, too.

I was as grateful as grateful can be to finish, especially after the ugly swim. I had lots of people there supporting me, which was very cool. And of course I thought of all you blogosphere fans, too, especially when I contemplated dropping out during the swim. It was nice to feel all of the support. Thank you.

My final time was under 3 hours, and that makes me pleased. I think that's not too bad for a first attempt.

I'll write more about the whole experience later. Right now, it's time for a nap.
