Apologies for the lack of blog posts recently and for the disorganisation, but I promise they will be back to normal soon - published every Sunday! However, as I have an important announcement I am publishing one today.

In July, I will be holding a Relief From Anxiety meetup in London - a chance to meet me and other readers to share mental health stories and give advice.

If you would like to attend the event and find out more details, then please contact me via twitter or email so I can send you the link and the password to the event page.

I hope to see you there!
