I'm back on the road preparing for my next marathon, The Twin Cities Marathon, in early October. It was nice to run for fun over the past couple of weeks, but there's something about training that feels right and good. I think the structure of training gives my life direction, meaning, and order. I actually don't do well with too much free time, so having a schedule keeps me on track and helps me get things done. And as a lifelong athlete, the physical and mental challenges of hitting paces, conquering hills, and logging long miles are all quite gratifying.

Yes, marathon preparation is under way. Despite thinking, perhaps out loud, that I would never, ever go for a marathon personal record again, which was my thought at mile 25 of Grandmas Marathon a few weeks ago, I have begun to think about the possibility. Of course I have! After all, I was sick at Grandmas, and I still ran a personal best! You all knew this was going to happen, didn't you? Well, I also function better when I have a specific goal.

I haven't set that goal yet. I had a great 14-mile run in the warm rain at 5 AM this morning. I am going to wait a few more weeks, see how my overall training goes, before I make a decision as to whether I will aim for a fast time at Twin Cities or not. I am excited by the prospect of running well. That excitement fuels my desire to follow my schedule and keep training hard. It's nice to be "officially" back at it.
