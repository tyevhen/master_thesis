I've taken lots of pictures of Jet over the past 4 months. He's 8 months old now, and he seems to be going through a bit of a growth spurt. He's also a nut! He's incredibly curious and playful. And he rarely tires. He can entertain himself for hours by tossing a toy, a stick, or even a leaf around the room or yard. After tossing it, he chases it, pounces on it, grabs it in his mouth, shakes it side-to-side, and then starts the process all over again. It is hilarious to watch. He's quite the clever comedian. He makes me laugh out loud multiple times each day. I am so grateful we found each other four months ago. Here are some recent pictures.

 Looking handsome in my kitchen.
   Stalking who-knows-what in D's backyard.
   "I'm not doin' nothing!" I interrupted Jet while he was burying his bone. Notice the dirt on his nose.
   Wrestling with Jet on the Milwaukee waterfront, as D tries to get a good picture of us.
  I lost the wrestling match, but the kiss more than made up for it!
