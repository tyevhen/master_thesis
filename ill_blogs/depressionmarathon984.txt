I don't have much new to say. I'm still disinterested, and I'm a bit tired of complaining about it. Instead, I thought I'd share with you a gift I received from my friend, Cindy. The flowers above are all from her yard and were arranged by her. When she gave them to me she wished my current struggles away, and she hoped the flowers would help. They did. Thanks, Cindy. Aren't they beautiful?
