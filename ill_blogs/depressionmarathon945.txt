It's hard to believe it is the end of September already. I've been so focused on training, I've hardly noticed the start of fall. That is until today when the temperature dropped into the 40's with a brisk wind! I ran a brisk workout of 6 x 800 meters with 400 meter recovery. It went well. Actually, I felt fairly comfortable, which is always nice during a speed workout. Puck ran my warm-up and cool-down with me, and we both enjoyed a long nap after we got home.

I'm looking forward to this weekend. It is Twin Cities Marathon weekend and many friends are running. I hope they have better weather this year than we did last year. Since I'm scheduled to run 20 miles, I'd love to run it along the marathon course, but I don't think I can figure out the logistics of getting back to my car once I finish. It's so much easier to do the long runs with company. Oh well, it will be fun and motivating to watch all of the local runners cross the finish line.

I'm feeling a little off today. Think I may be coming down with something. My stomach isn't quite right, and I'm a little achey--hence the extra long nap. My knee was sore during the slow sections of my run today, but oddly felt fine during the speed work. I think it is slowly getting better, but I don't think I'll be playing much more golf this year. My mood has seemed a bit lower, too, but that may be the result of worrying about my knee. I hope so. Nevertheless, I'll be paying close attention to how I'm feeling over the next few days. Here's to everything getting back on the right path.
