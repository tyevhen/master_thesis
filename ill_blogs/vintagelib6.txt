5 Red Flags of Endometriosis that Every Doctor and Patient Should Know
Seriously. Read this. It's the most comprehensive list of symptoms of endometriosis I have ever seen. You might recognise these symptoms in yourself, your sister, your partner, your daughter.

I'm on a dystopia/sci-fi kick at the moment (The Handmaid's Tale started it - Where'd You Go, Bernadette was before.) It's happened to me before - I've read and loved 1984, Divided Kingdom, The Trouble with Lichen and The Day of the Triffids. I'm still halfway through Brave New World and I'm thinking that next I will read The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin or Only Ever Yours by Louise O'Neill. (Also, how had I never read The Giver or The Handmaid's Tale before??? Way overdue.)
