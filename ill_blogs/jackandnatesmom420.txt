I have said before that fine and gross motor development have been a challenge for Jack.  He walked at 16 months, used to stand at the top of slides and look at me like "lady are you nuts?", and jumping was a really really big deal (and he has never stopped :) ).  We have been working on pumping FOREVER.  It's frustrating for a kid to learn this skill because for the longest time they feel like they are doing nothing, until something finally clicks and they realize they have to lean into it and really work to get moving.  Over the past 2 years, I have tried many motivators, the most popular being "flapping his wings", and being an airplane (legs out= taking off, legs in= coming in for a landing).  This has at least helped him get the concept down, but we have never before had actual movement like this!!!!  I have to try and calm myself down during these developments.  Luckily we do not have the first time he pedaled his tricycle up and down the street on video because it would have consisted of mommy sobbing and screaming "go, go, go" while daddy laughed at me  and said shhhhhh......you're distracting him!

On that note, please put your computer on mute or at least do your best to disregard my shrill voice on this video.  I was too excited not to share!!!!
