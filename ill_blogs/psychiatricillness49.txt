I am sick to death of this awful illness!  I can't work, I can't concentrate and I can't do nothing.  I think I will take  walk in the rain!  I can't diet cos eating is my only source of comfort and I am rapidly expanding around the waist!  I want out, I just want to be normal, accepted and feel a part of the world rather than an on looker who watches life pass her by.
