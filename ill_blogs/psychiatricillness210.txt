I have been feeling a bit lonely recently but today, My ex bought my cat around to live, I asked if I could have her back. He has had her since we split up but today I got her back to live with me.

I am not really suppose to have pets in my flat as Iam renting but I don't care as I have someone (even if they are feline) to talk to, play with and cuddle. She has only been here a few hours but she is starting to make her self at home already and she has been purring and having a good fuss too.

I am trying to work out if she remembers me, I moved out 15 months ago but she is still responding to me calling her and is quite happy with me picking her up
