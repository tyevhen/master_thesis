I challenged my fellow blogger, Kaloo, to a duel.  The idea is that our readers will vote for which of the following MS paint creatures would win in a battle to the death.  
This week we have Fire-breathing Spiky Unicorn versus Kung Fu Chicken.  
When voting, please take into account each creature's strength, agility, size, intelligence, special powers and basic awesomeness.   
Okay.   The power is in your hands now.   Will it be Kung Fu Chicken or Fire-breathing Spiky Unicorn?  Go!
