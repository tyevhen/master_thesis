To add insult to injury, my softball team got whipped last night, 20-2. It was cold and raining--a perfect ending to a miserable week. Oh, wait, it's only MID-week. It's not over yet! Damn...

It's been that kind of week. I wish it was over. I wish it had never begun. It's Thursday, and I've yet to run one mile, bike one mile, perform one minute of yoga, or do anything other than sleep and eat! I hoped softball would be the key to unlock my gate, but I'm still fenced in. Stuck, I am, behind heavily barred walls with the ceiling falling in. My space is shrinking. I'm suffocating in the absent air. Worry...panic...setting in. It's been that kind of week.

Is it over yet?
When will it end?
