Never would I do this if I wasn't contractionally obligated. I hate being on camera. Too many imperfections and too much to judge. Every month I have to post a video on The Nitty Gritty of Anxiety. So even though I cringe when watching it, I decided since it goes along with the monthly challenge, I might as well share it here as well. I learned that I am no where near drinking the amount of water that I am supposed to. So the first thing I am doing this month to get healthier is to drink more water!

Joe Barry Mc Donagh from ezine articles says this,
"Nearly every function of the body is monitored and pegged to the efficient flow of water through our system. Water transports hormones, chemical messengers, and nutrients to vital organs of the body. When we don't keep our bodies well-hydrated, they may react with a variety of signals such as anxiety, which we would never think are related to our poor drinking habits."


And only for The Reality of Anxiety readers, here is where I got my information about the dangers of caffeine for anxiety suffers, and a diet to help eliminate anxiety.
