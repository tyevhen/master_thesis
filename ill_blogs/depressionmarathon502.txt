Things are going well. I'm feeling fairly good. I'm probably not back to normal yet, but I'm much closer than I was. I have occasional intrusive thoughts which creep into my brain, but today those thoughts are more annoying than they are frightening or worrisome. So things are moving along.

The one symptom I am still struggling with is fatigue. I'm flat out sleepy! I'm making it through work, but I sleep for at least an hour immediately after I get home. I spend many hours sleeping, after I finish running, on my days off. Fatigue always seems to be one of my lingering symptoms, so this is nothing new, but I'll be happy when it passes.

Other than that, I have little to report. I'm in the first week of my three week taper for my upcoming marathon. I had a great workout yesterday, and I'm generally feeling ready to go. I think it's going to be a long three weeks. I'm anxious to get to the starting line.

That's it for now, my friends. I'm living life on life's terms, and right now the living is getting a little easier. I'm very grateful for that.
