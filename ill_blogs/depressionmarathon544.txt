The potential new job is now my job. It took a couple of days to negotiate my salary package, but in the end we got it worked out. I am taking a bit of a pay cut to take this position, but as my readers pointed out, the old job was going nowhere whereas the new job has tons of potential upside. And like everything else in life, the new job will be as temporary as I choose it to be.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hesitant to take the new position. I was. Fear almost got the best of me. But again, your comments made a difference. Several of you talked about unhappily taking the easy way out, rather than facing your fear. Staying in my current position would have been the easy way out. I'm already unhappy and stressed there, so I had to face my fear. Not doing so wouldn't have made any sense.

Now it's time to really hit the books and bone up on my outpatient skills. Doing so will certainly help decrease my discomfort and fear. Currently, I'm afraid of the reaction I'll get when I give my owner my resignation notice on Monday. I'm not expecting it to be a pleasant experience. I'm sure I'll at least receive a hefty guilt trip. But that's his problem, not mine. I'm giving three weeks notice. I'll begin my new position on June 4th. Thank you all for your help as I traveled through this decision making process.
