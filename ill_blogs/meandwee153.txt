Isn't he cute? I'm in love with this Tigger onesie. Chris got it for him at Disneyland when he was there for a conference he was presenting at. My favorite part is the tail design on the butt.

I just got back from having the last part of a root canal done. Good times! I'm all numb and drooly which makes it hard to eat or drink. I can't really feel anything, so I'd probably chew my cheek off or something if I tried. Why is it you always want to eat something desperately when you know you can't? Delicious left-over ravioli, I'm talking about you.
