If you've looked recently, you'll notice that there's a new page, Speaking At... This is because I, and/or my family, have been asked to speak at several different places!  Check out the page for more information...

Also, as of today I've posted my comment policy on the right sidebar, which reads:

I love love love comments, love reading what you have to say, your experiences, opinions, stories. However, I also hate debating, and much prefer to share instead of argue, so I'd appreciate it if you refrained from trying to start debates (I don't consider sharing opposing views to be "trying to start debates". I just ask that people please respect my desire to not get involved in arguments!  I love respectful discussions.  I'm not so fond of arguing!). Please keep all comments respectful! Remember that there's a real person behind those words on the screen, be they mine or another commenter, a person that can be hurt by unkind words. I do not delete comments expressing differing or opposing views, but I do delete comments that are overtly sexist, racist, homophobic, or otherwise hateful in nature. Thanks for your understanding, and I'm really looking forward to hearing what you have to say!!

I want to add that this has NOTHING to do with comments I've received recently, so if you're worrying if I posted that because of something you said, don't worry, I didn't. :-) It's just something I've been meaning to add for a while, as I get an ever increasing amount of traffic on my blog, since I figure it's something that's going to prove useful...

If anyone has any other ideas for blog improvements, I'd love to hear them!  Just comment here, or drop me a line at open.eyed.slave@gmail.com.

Peace,
Idzie
