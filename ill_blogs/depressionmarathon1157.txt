I've received some really thoughtful, positive, and kind comments from you, the readers of this blog, recently. Thank you all so much. I am humbled by your interest in my writing and the generosity of your words. Thank you.

Jeannie's visitation is today--this evening. I am attempting to accomplish all my duties today prior to 4:00 PM so that I may be fully present at her visitation. That makes for one busy day. You see, even though the marathon is Sunday, I am leaving for the Twin Cities (1.5 hour drive) early, early tomorrow morning. I will be attending to my P.T. licensure requirements by participating in Twin Cities Sports Medicine Conference, which is run yearly in conjunction with the marathon. The conference will run all day tomorrow and half of Saturday at a hotel within a short distance of the starting line. In order to maintain my license, a certain number of continuing education credits are required per year. So far, I have zero. What can I say? Sometimes I procrastinate.

Unfortunately, Jeannie's funeral is tomorrow, mid-morning. To attend, I'd have to drive to my class, spend two hours there, drive back for the funeral, spend 1-3 hours there, and then drive back to my class. Not sure if I'd get credit for the class if I miss several hours of it, but I'm not sure I want to miss Jeannie's funeral, either. I'll have to make a tough choice, I guess. If any of you have any thoughts, I'm wide open...
