I got a ridiculously small amount of sleep last night (there was a minor crisis, but everyone is still alive and no one ended up in hospital so all good!). I cleaned more. We picked my dad up from the airport. I had a short discussion with him about the machinery at the mine he was at, watched a bit of news... And now I'm going to bed. Will write more tomorrow.
