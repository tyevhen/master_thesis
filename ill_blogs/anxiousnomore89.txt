First off I want to say that I got my book today in the mail and I can't wait to start!

I'm very pleased that the Reality of Anxiety was handpicked to be featured on the Top Psych new Blog links. Here is what they have to say:

"...AlleyDog.com - a popular psychology-specific websites for students and teachers launched more than 10 years ago. We recently launched a new feature called Top Psych that aggregates the best psychology-related blogs, news, and stories from around the web. It's similar to Alltop, but focused 100% on psychology.

Top Psych does not list every blog, only the ones we believe provide high quality information and perspectives. In other words, we hand pick the blogs and sites for Top Psych, and we're quite selective.

"I'm pleased to let you know that your blog was selected as one of the very best and is included on Top Psych. Please visit http://www.alleydog.com and click on the "Psychology News & Blogs" links to see your blog (located in the Mental Health: Anxiety section). Please keep in mind that we're just launching this new feature, so there are still some bugs, some areas that have just a few blogs, and some kinks to work outâ€¦but we're off to a great start."
