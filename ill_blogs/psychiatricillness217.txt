Yesterday morning a beautiful little girl called Livia was born by c section at 7.30 am, she weighed 7lb 9oz. Livia is doing very well but mother very uncomfortable. If my friend is feeling better tomorrow I will meet Livia tomorrow evening :o). I have a video clip of her just a few hours old and she is adorable.

I have just had a good cry as I want to be loved and I want a baby.
