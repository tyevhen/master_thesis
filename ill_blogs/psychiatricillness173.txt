(see comment on post below)

I have had a chat with Mr. Apparently Creepy Guy and made it clear we are just friends, It has un nerved me a bit that people in the real world read my blogg. It is not that bad but it the idea takes a bit of getting used to.

I think I will start telling my old friends (non cyber friends) about my blogg. It was never suppose to be a secret.

Mr Apparently Creepy guy has made me think more about my blogg, from now on I am going to be a lot more careful about what I post to ensure no one would be able to predict my movements and stuff. I have also removed the link from the Social Anxiety Website. it is a shame but I am feeling a bit exposed right now.

Paranoid or careful - it will make me feel happier?

oh well.....
bloggs go on.......
