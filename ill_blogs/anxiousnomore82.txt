For those that are interested, I am going to be on a live tv show that airs on the internet at http://www.healthyplace.com/. You can check out the preview here. The show airs tomorrow, Tuesday the 20th at 7pm CST. The topic is living with Social Anxiety Disorder. And with it being live, this may be a chance for you to see me anxious in real life! Talk about a hundred reasons to be nervous about this! But I want to get the word out and help those who are struggling so I'll do it.


Wish me luck!!!
