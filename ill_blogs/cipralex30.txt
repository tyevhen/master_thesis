Some quesiton you guys asked in the comments: Hi doll khan, when to stop...? thats a good question... I guess the answet is when you feel that you can... wait couple of months more and gradually you can stop... but ask your doc. thats why you pay him anyway :-)




rose khan - "awsome blog just tell me some times i feeel numbness and lightness in my head does the same happens to u??" yes it does but I hardly notice it anymore..with time it will go away totally...


Hi Melissa P, Its great to hear you're doing something about it, thats a big thing, good luck and update us on how it goes...I'm sure you're already started to feel the change in your life... Hi Susan, I realy think you should consult your doctor, I think 40mg is a big dose of cipralex... maybe too big... if cipralex doesn't work for you, you should over-dose it just switch to another pill that will work. do not take so many pills without consulting your doc... did he recommended that? Stay tuned... soon a new post will come :)
