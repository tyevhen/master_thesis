Most of my friends know me as one who drinks here and there on occaisons etc', I know its not recommended to drink alochol while on cipralex, but at this time I prefer to keep the fact I'm taking cipralex to myself...so I had no choice and I had to check it out just in case I'll run into a situation like that in the future...



So I did, I drunk one glass of whisky and...I did fine, I was stoned abit but nothing I could'nt handle, I also checked this with my Doc,
She said as long as its in proportions there is no problem.
So there you go...
I'll bring more information about this soon...
