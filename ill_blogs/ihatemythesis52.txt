The Highlight of My Day:
My roommate's girlfriend is from a foreign country. She brought some exotic sheep cheese from her homeland. I tried a slice. It was a little weird. Now there is a strange taste left in my mouth.

That is the best thing that has happened to me all day. Am I depressed? Or is my thesis depressing me?

I think I am depressed. This whole delay in graduation is really bringing me down. I could barely gather the energy to type in the tags for this post. It just seemed like too much effort, but in the end I pulled through and even created a new tag. If only I could do the same for my thesis.
