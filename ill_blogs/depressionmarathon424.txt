I just returned home from a weekend in Milwaukee where Jet and I visited my boyfriend, D. As usual, it was really nice to see D, spend time with him, walk along the lake with him, run with him, talk with him, eat fabulous meals with him, and enjoy Jet with him. The four hour drive there and back, especially back, tires me out, but it is so worth it.

We were particularly close this weekend. There was no particular reason. I think it's just the natural growth of our relationship, which is so wonderful. I'm pleased with how comfortable we've gotten with each other, and I'm really pleased with how much he enjoys Jet. He even kissed Jet goodbye today. I don't think he ever pictured himself doing that to a dog!

Soon it will be time to go up to his lake home in Northern Wisconsin, which unfortunately is five and a half hours from here. He's going up there next weekend, Memorial Day Weekend, to open everything up. Meanwhile I will be here running a marathon.

The last 20-miler in my Grandmas Marathon training schedule is next weekend. It coincides with the local Med City Marathon, which is Sunday, so I plan on running the first 20 miles as a long run. If I'm feeling well at the 20 mile mark, I'll go ahead and finish my 21st marathon. If not, I'll just step off the course and walk the 10 blocks home. It's a win-win situation, and I'm looking forward to it.
