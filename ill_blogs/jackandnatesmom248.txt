I got the "draft" copy of Jack's "new" IEP today in his school folder.  The meeting is in a week, and parents have to get the materials ahead of time.  Fine.  I didn't want to look- the fact that it even came with the disclaimer that "not much will be different because Jack is going to be reassessed" should have tipped me off.  And this is true, next Thursday I will be signing consents for this reassessment- his "label" thus far has been developmental delay, and this will be changed to autism.  OK fine.  But I looked anyway.

Really?  After all I have heard and been told this year, the talk of the weakness of his grip and his sensory issues, he still only needs 3 30 minute OT sessions a month??  They did increase his special education time, which was an hour a week.  They increased it to 2.5 hours a week.  Out of 35 hours in school.  When I already know that he has been having an aide an hour a day and this is not adequate- this per his teacher.  So this increase doesn't even cover what he's getting.  How does this make sense??? Someone please explain this to me....

Once I sign consents for assessments they have 6 WEEKS to complete them.  And then when they draw up the new IEP they have 4 weeks to implement the changes.  I am not a mathematician, but doesn't that take us almost to the end of the school year?
