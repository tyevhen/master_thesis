I got to sleep in this morning! Whew… After weeks of 4:25 AM, getting up 4 hours later feels luxurious!

It’s been a few days since I’ve written here. I apologize for that. I’ve been busy, uh…meditating! Well, not really, for I still suck at meditation. I made it 10 minutes yesterday, but that was the first time I actually attempted meditating this week! Do any of you meditate? If so, I’d love to hear how you got started or what works for you.

I’m supposed to be doing this twice a day, ten minutes each time. It’s a requirement of this 40 days of yoga course I’m taking, and I’d really like to learn to do it. I just need to get over my reluctance to start, I guess. Discomfort–mental discomfort–is never my favorite state to explore. I realize I need to quit avoiding the initial discomfort if I hope to bring meditation into my life. And I do hope to bring it in. I am now convinced it will only improve my state of being. Like I said, if any of you have suggestions, I am all ears! Thanks!
