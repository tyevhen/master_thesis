Today I climbed to the top of a large mass of rocks protruding almost straight up from the earth. It was a beautiful, blue sky day in northern Colorado. We scrambled, hiked, and even crawled our way to the summit where the view was clear and uninterrupted for miles. I had flashbacks to happier, younger days; days spent exploring the shores of Lake Superior--scrambling, hiking, and crawling over very similar rocks. It felt great to test my balance, strength and agility in that old familiar way. I was free. Freedom and exhilaration, sweat and scrapes, smiles and laughter, and it all culminated with a push-up on the top. Don't ask me why. I just had an urge.
Climbing is so satisfying. My journey to the summit bears no resemblance to my journey with mental illness. For example, when I climbed today there was a defined beginning, middle and end. The end was exhilerating, mostly because I knew when I was there. My reward was tangible, visible, beautiful; which reinforced every step I took to reach it. But along the way, each step was also its own precious reward, and not one of them was pre-determined. I was free to step, hop, jump, or crawl wherever I chose. There were no hoops to jump through, no papers to fill out, no one to judge if I chose the right path. I was free. I was free.
I'm pleasantly exhausted now. My lungs are filled with crisp, cool air. And best of all, my brain is refreshingly vacant! What a treat!
