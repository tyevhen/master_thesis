I woke up today in an extra tired way. I looked at the clock and it said 5:20...I heard Paige making her calls for me (loud "MMMMMMMMMMMMM" sounds) and off I went. I didn't sleep well and haven't much of the week. Lots of insomnia and trouble with my chatterbox brain. Anyway, I grabbed little P and gave her the milk and off we went. It turns out she woke up on the wrong side of the crib too. She spent the whole morning fussing, crying, whining and generally making me nuts (I guess I felt bad for her too but this is about ME right now. :) ). I can see that several soon-to-erupt teeth are giving her issues. Geez. Why can't the teeth just grow the hell in already and be done with it???!!! I even burst into tears a few times. Tiredness really gets to me. I get so frustrated when she's in a constant fuss. I yell "what do you want me to dooooo???!!! What the helllllll???!!!" I know that's not nice. I just couldn't help it. She hates being cuddled and my attempts at soothing just piss her off. *sigh*
She is quietly napping in her room right now and I'm enjoying a brief respite from the fuss monster. I think she'll feel better after her rest, fingers crossed. She's had her teething tabs and painkillers and whatnot. Despite it all, I miss her while she sleeps and I still feel lucky. Let's just say I'm going to bed early tonight. Just don't tell HER that or she'll sabotage it in some way, ok?
