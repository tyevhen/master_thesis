Ever flip open the Bible and land on a verse you desperately needed that moment? Happened to me today. I want to share it with anyone who's struggling or suffering. It's helped me many times.

When the storms come, I eventually quit praying for them to go away, and I starting praying for peace in the storm. It seems to help.

My heart is with my friends who are hurting today. Friends I know and friends not yet made. May you find peace in the storm. 

"Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." 

James 1:2-4
