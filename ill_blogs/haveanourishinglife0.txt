Anxiety and depression are a part of life on earth. Even though one can be cured of anxiety and depression, he/she can never be completely immune from it or its effects.

Everyone goes though times of anxiety, stressful situations, fear and worry, money problems, etc. No matter how mentally "healthy" you are, you will still experience anxiety. "Life is pain, highness, and anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something!" to quote the classy Wesley of the classic movie Princess Bride.

In the same way, everyone goes through depressing times. Break-ups, losing a job, failed expectations, and so on.

To the degree at which it interferes with your life, determines whether you could be diagnosed with "Anxiety Disorder" or "Clinical Depression", for example.

But once you get help for these mental illnesses, dealing with the "normal" stress and discouragement in life is much MUCH more productive. This is where coping skills come in.

Some people don't get help for anxiety and depression because they think that's life....which it IS! But the difference is, when you have a mental illness, the depression and anxiety are always present or debilitating at the worst times.

It's very hard to realize you have a mental illness. Usually, your loved ones will let you know something is not right. HOPEFULLY, your family and friends can help you get through this life-threatening disease.

You are not a wimp if you get treatment for a mental illness. Sure everyone goes through depressing circumstances or stressful situations. But not everyone HAS anxiety and/or depression.

Listen to and trust your loved ones. Don't listen to the disease...it just wants you dead. We want you here for a long LONG time.
