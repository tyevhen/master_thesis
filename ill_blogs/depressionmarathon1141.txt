Reality TV couldn't have hoped for more irony than this...

On the way back from the vet, moments after he and I discussed allowing Puck to play ball again despite my wariness (terror, actually), I stopped at a park to give him a few tosses. On the first gentle, short toss my beautiful, happy, energetic dog, Puck, ruptured his other anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

His second ACL surgery in the last 4.5 months is scheduled for tomorrow.


My sponsor says God wouldn't give me more than I can handle. C'mon, God, isn't this piling-it-on a bit?
