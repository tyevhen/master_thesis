Hi friends! The nursery is basically done! We're still waiting on the area rug but only God knows when that will come in. :)
In the meantime, I took some shots of the space to share here. Sorry for the long post, it's lots of pictures! You can also view the slideshow of the nursery at my flickr page here.
We had our $9 Salvation Army thrifted swivel-rocker chair custom-fit with a yellow/white slipcover and we're pleased with how it came out! I added some fabric in embroidery hoops to the wall by the chair to add more warmth to the space. It's a fun and inexpensive way to add art. A favorite detail of mine is the "hooray" banner above the shelving unit...it's a word I love and it adds to the goal of making the room cheerful. I got it from Caitlin at her Etsy shop called Nice. Check it out, she's got some lovely things there. If anyone has any questions about where things came from, please feel free to leave a comment below and I will be happy to leave a comment below in return. I hope you like it! More importantly, I hope Little P will like it! Much love to you!
