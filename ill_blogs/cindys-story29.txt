Nairobi, Kenya

Dear Family,

Jambo.  Hi, how are you today?  I am doing well, and about ready to go back to Muthyoi(the village) tomorrow morning.  I have packed all my things back up, though my bags are a bit tighter because I seem to collect things every time I come into town.

I had a lot of fun this morning.  A group of six of us "white foreigners" went to the city market in downtown Nairobi.  This is always interesting because as soon as they see white people the African sellers quickly gather around us saying, "Friend, friend come look...don't buy, just look.  It doesn't cost to look."  Then, as soon as you go into their section to look, it becomes difficult to get out.  They try so hard to sell things to us.
I remember the first week I was in Nairobi, and we went to the market.  I was so overwhelmed by it all, so many things to buy, and so many people surrounding us and pestering us.  But now I have gotten used to it, and I feel quite comfortable going there.  I am not bothered by the many people trying to sell me things at high tourist prices.  I think I got some good deals in my bargaining (an African dress, a purse, a belt, etc...).  I found myself laughing at the whole process and the things some people do to try to get us to buy their things.

I thought that you might like to experience a snippet of what it is like to live here in Africa.  Love you all.

Mungu Akubariki,
