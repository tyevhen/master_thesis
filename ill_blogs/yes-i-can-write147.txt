There are two interviews coming up soon on this blog:
A text interview with a grown unschooler, Tim, who unschooled in the 70's (and even knew John Holt).
A video interview with my mother, Debbie, so you can hear the story of our unschooling journey from her perspective.
Why am I telling you this?

Well, since these interviews are for you guys, I wanted to compile my list of interview questions with your input!  What do you want to ask these two people?  What are the burning questions in your mind?  Please make sure to specify in the comments if the question(s) you'd like to ask are aimed at Tim or Debbie!
