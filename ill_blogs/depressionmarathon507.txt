I think depression is unique among illnesses. Depression is so gray. There is no signature cough, no tell-tale physical pain, no excessive bleeding, and no abnormal blood test. It leads someone like me to question whether or not I am truly ill. Is this a relapse, or am I just sad? Is depression rearing its ugly head, or do I just have a defective character? Is this me or my illness dragging me down? In the midst of feeling so low, these are horribly tormenting questions running through my head.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a lab test which proved when depression was active? I feel bad, I go to the doctor, the doctor orders the test, and yup, there it is in black and white--I've got another case of depression, or I've had a relapse of my illness. It would be as clear as day. There would be no shades of gray. There would be no stigma, no questioning, no shaming, no guilt. What would be would be, and we'd treat it accordingly.

Wouldn't that be nice?
