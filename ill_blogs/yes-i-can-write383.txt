When we were away at the UWWG, my mom attended both of Kelly Lovejoy's talks. One of them was a kind of 'ask Kelly anything' one, and my mother brought up the issue of finding an unschooling community. My mom said how as far as we know, there are virtually no unschoolers in our area! Kelly's response: "Montreal?? There's tons of unschoolers there! Start a group, and I guarantee you'll have at least 30 family's". Well, what could we say to that? So we're starting a Montreal unschooling group! It may not be a success, but at least we'll know we tried. :-)

So for now, we're simply gathering info. Finding what other people did/do with their groups, thinking of how we can publicize it, what activities to do, where to meet... If anyone has experience with an unschooling group, or even if you have no experience but ideas, I'd love to hear them! :-D

I'm very excited about this, and hoping it works out. :-)

Peace,
Idzie

P.S. I'm still looking for unschooling articles for Homeschooling Horizons! If ANYONE who unschools is interested in writing something, I'd love to know! Thanks a bunch. :-D
