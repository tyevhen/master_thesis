I had a good day today.

I got up quite late (7.45am) this morning, I went back to sleep after my alarm went off at 6:30. I do that a lot. It took me nearly two hours to get to work because of the traffic and it was raining. I love the rain, I put the hand brake on sat back and listened to the radio with the window wide open and the rain comming in on my face, it was bliss!

I got to work about 10am and decided to do some of my more interesting tasks. The day flew past and I feel like I have achieved something, I have crossed several things off my very long to do list.

I came home when I had enough but that's when I started to feel a bit low. I am going to make myself a fish finger sandwich for dinner and then sit back and watch TV. I get to sleep until about 9am tomorrow as I am going to see my Psychiatrist.

I want to write about what I remember about having selective mutism, it was never diagnosed at the time but my Mum said she thinks I had it. It is quite rare and little known anxiety disorder in young children. I want to write my experiance to help people raise awareness and help carers understand. If you are interested look back here later!
