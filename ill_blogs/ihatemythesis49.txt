Seriously. I cannot clear this sickly incense smell out of my room. It is making my stomach churn; it feels like I've swallowed a hippie and said hippie is now trying to burn his way out of my belly just like the biblical dude who was swallowed by a fish. ... Jonah. Yes, Jonah the hippie is trying to burn his way out of my belly. Well, at least the patchouli stench and accompanying nausea is distracting me from my depression.
