I just found out my AA sponsor relapsed about 3 weeks ago. Apparently I am the last to know. I haven't been to my usual AA meetings for about 3 weeks, mostly because of my running schedule, but she could have called, don't you think? I don't like being the last to know. I don't like that she didn't call when she was having trouble. Sometimes sponsees can help sponsors, too. It's been that way for us in the past. I'm not sure why it wasn't this time. So I'm hurt.

But my being hurt is a small issue. The bigger issue is she relapsed. I think she had 16-17 years of sobriety. Not someone you'd expect to relapse, but that's the nature of alcoholism, I guess. Now what do I do? Suddenly, I don't feel all that safe. My sponsor is my safety net. But can I call a woman who just convinced herself it was okay to drink when I feel like drinking? Can I ask a woman about moral decisions when she's been deceiving everyone around her for quite some time? What do I do? Can I keep this woman as my sponsor? I don't know.

I don't know what to do. I told her I'd have to think about it--whether or not I want her to continue sponsoring me. I really don't want to start over with another sponsor, but do I still trust this sponsor? Do I believe she is currently seeing life clearly enough to give advice? And will I feel that advice is valid now that I know of her deception and ultimate relapse? I don't know.

I guess that's what I have to decide. Can I trust, and will I feel safe going to her for help? Or will I worry about her state of mind and question her wisdom? This is tough. Why did she have to go and relapse? And why am I so surprised? I mean, this is alcoholism at it's finest. She's just behaved exactly like an alcoholic. Perhaps I need to just forgive and move forward. But with whom do I move forward--her or someone new?
