I don't have the energy right now to write a proper post. The cold I had is completely gone (yay!) but I feel grey and gloomy today. However, a few days ago I took pictures of the snow and ice and dogs, and I wanted to post them here.

I'll try and write a proper post later on, since there's been a million different ideas and thoughts flitting through my brain these last few days, and I really want to get some of them written down!

Peace,
Idzie
