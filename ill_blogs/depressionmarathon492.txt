It's Sunday afternoon, and D has just departed for home. I'm a little sad. And I'm very tired.

D arrived Friday around 6:30 PM. I was anxious prior to his arrival, but once he was in my house, I felt better. We ate out both Friday and Saturday nights, went to a pumpkin patch for some Fall activities Saturday afternoon, visited with my parents, and visited with my good friends Bill and Cindy. In between, I ran 13 miles (he ran 6) Saturday morning. We drank coffee, read the paper, walked Puck, talked a little politics, and just hung out. The subject of my depression didn't come up, and that also felt totally okay. It was a nice weekend.

Now I'm sitting here watching football and wishing we had more time. After all, he wasn't even here for 48 hours. It was too short, one week would have been better. But that's not realistic at this time. We're both busy with our lives. In fact, it may be mid to late November before we even have a chance to see each other again. That's a long time. Life. It is what it is.

The real news is we had a nice time. Everything went well. We were comfortable with each other. December, 2011, was the last time we spent a weekend together, and this felt just like old times. I'm happy.
