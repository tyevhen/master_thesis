“Your life, time, and brain should belong to you, not to an institution.” Grace Llewellyn

“I am learning all the time. The tombstone will be my diploma.”  Eartha Kitt

"I realize that if I wait until I am no longer afraid to act, write, speak, be, I'll be sending messages on a ouija board, cryptic complaints from the other side." Audre Lorde

"The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses." Utah Philips
