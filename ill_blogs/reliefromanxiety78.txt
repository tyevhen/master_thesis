Hello guys,

So this post is very different to what I usually do, but I thought that some of you may be interested. I have recently been contacted to see if my readers would like to be involved in a competition for the chance to win £150 to spend at brand attic. 

For those of you who don't know, Brand Attic is a fashion company. So, you'd get to spend the £150 on a lovely new wardrobe for yourself, whether you're into men's or women's fashion.

All you have to do, to be in with the chance to win this £150 is to enter the competition, by clicking here.

Have you entered? Let me know!

Best Wishes,
Amy Xx
