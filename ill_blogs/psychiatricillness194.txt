Today I suddenly understood why so many people don't like change. My boss told me a colleague was returning from maternity leave in November. Things have been going so well since she left, I have taken on loads more responsibility and I now love my job. When I was working with her I felt very stiffled and held back career wise as I had to do as she asked. I now have my own studies and have built good relationships with our customers and I am really enjoying work.

I felt really worried after he told me and my mind went quite blank. I stared at the screen for about 20 minutes, the idea of the change really worried me and frightened me. In the past I have always always been excited by change and looked at things as a bit of an adventure. I never really understood peoples fear of change. I think you have to be happy with what you have to fear change! I think this is one reason why I have never connected with people in the past.

On the way home from work I kind of realised I have never been this happy before. Although a part of me hates being on my own so much I feel I have more to loose now than I have ever had in the past.

I did not feel sorry for myself or sad but I felt really tired like I was about to fall asleep and I had no energy!! I just felt like I wanted to go to sleep.
