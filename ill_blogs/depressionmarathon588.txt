It's been a couple of really tough days here. My mood is again in the toilet, and I'm still in the hospital. The current plan is to dismiss Friday after ECT #9. I feel like I've been here forever, yet I'm still so low.

I'm worried and scared right now. I've had 8 ECT treatments with little to show for it. My mood doesn't seem to be responding, and that drags me further down the darkened path. I've been very tearful and sad. I spoke with my regular psychiatrist last night. Both she and my social worker recall that I didn't respond well last spring, either, until I had the 9th and 10th treatments. I hope they are correct. It's the only hope I have to hang onto right now. Hope is hard to come by.

I've not had the energy to get on the bike or treadmill for a few days. I'm trying to be okay with that. Focus on healing one thing at a time, I say. But I do feel better if I move my body, so I may try some gentle spinning tonight. I hope.

The days are long and dark right now. I'm saying my Serenity Prayer and asking God to take away the pain while shining a little light into my soul. As I see it, if ECT won't work, divine intervention is the only option remaining. I'm hanging in there, but I'm tired. I need a way out soon.
