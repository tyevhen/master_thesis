working wipes me out! wait, let me start again.

I am really enjoying, and grateful for the renewed (i.e. normal) energy I've had lately. however, working wipes me out! just 4 hours yesterday required an immediate 90 minute nap. today, my 60 minute nap didn't even dent the exhaustion following a 6 hour work-day. it's hard to imagine that I used to work 40+ hours per week and run 30-40+ miles! now, exercise is totally out of the question on work days, and 6 hours slams against my upper limits of functionality. I wouldn't be surprised if I turned into a pumpkin, or something equally useless, at hour 6:01. it's weird. it's frustrating. another reminder that I am not "normal" anymore. another cue to redefine "normal" so it more accurately reflects my life today. how convenient... unfortunately, redefining the word does not erase the memories of my previously "normal" life.

did I mention how grateful I am for the renewed energy I've experienced lately?
