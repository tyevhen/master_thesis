My gratitude list:

--I am grateful for my health, yes even my mental illness and alcoholism. After all, both diseases played a role in creating the person I am today, and today I'm pretty okay with who I am.
--I am grateful for my friends. Even though I tend to be an isolative person, I do have some incredible friends who make me smile, and laugh, and support me no matter what.
--I am grateful for my mom and step-dad. They also support me no matter what, and I enjoy spending time with both of them.
--I am grateful for the rest of my family. Despite our dysfunctional moments, they are still my family and I love them.
--I am grateful for my job. In these tough times, I have a job I love, and I work with people I really enjoy.
--I am grateful to be a runner. I am grateful for the motivation, strength, and ability I possess, as well as the opportunity to compete.
--I am grateful for my dog, Puck. What else is there to say? I don't know what I'd do without him. He completes my family.
--I am grateful for my home. Especially on days like this--colder than cold outside--I am lucky to have a warm, comfortable place of my own.
--I am grateful for the ability to care for myself. I think those of us who've temporarily lost this ability are the only ones who'd even think to add this to a gratitude list.
--I am grateful to be sober. Without sobriety, I wouldn't be able to effectively take care of myself, or more likely, I'd be dead.
--I am grateful for my sponsor, my social worker, my doctor and my psychologist. Without their expertise, kindness, and care, my life likely would have ended long ago.
--I am grateful for this blog and my readers. This space has routinely kept my illness at bay, propped me up when I was down, and opened my life to a world beyond typical boundaries.

I'm sure I'm forgetting a multitude of things for which I'm grateful. This list will likely grow. It will change as I change. Gratitude is a very fluid thing, and I appreciate the ability to feel it.

Today is a great day to reflect. I'll spend the day with close friends, in a warm home, eating delicious food and watching football. What could be better than that? I'm grateful. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
