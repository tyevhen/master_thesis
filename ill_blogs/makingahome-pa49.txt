Decorating for this wonderful, crisp season. Well, I'm definitely not one to go all out and completely redecorate. I used to. Before homeschooling, that is. {At which I smile.}



Rather, I like to tuck little reminders of the season here and there. Little glimpses into nature and the beauty of this autumn season. Many things brought in from nature itself.



And I'm really enjoying this very autumn-ish scent by Bath and Body works ~ Marshmallow Fireside. Oh, it smells wonderful! It was perfect this morning as I worked on some early morning crochet after my Bible reading!





These little touches warm the soul and bring coziness into our home.



And I find much enjoyment in making our home cozy and warm. A refuge for my family. A place to come home and find rest after a long day out in the world.

And this morning, as I get ready to start a new day, I'm planning on some warm chicken soup with crusty bread for dinner tonight. (It's a rainy, rainy day here; a perfect day for soup.)



And also in the plans is another round of applesauce. The first batch was unbelievably yummy. I'm so thankful to have a farmer's market so close. Fresh picked apples really make a difference in taste!




Be encouraged in the Lord today. Be encouraged in His love for you. Be encouraged because He cares for you. Be encouraged as He displays His beautiful creativity in these beautiful fall days.

Have a most blessed day!
