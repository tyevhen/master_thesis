One Year Later...

Hello everybody, I can barely find time to write to you guys, been busy with setting up a new house and raising a 6 month baby :)

all is well, had some good days and some bad ones, but i'm still off the pill...

it been just few times i felt like i need it, but didn't took it, trying to deal with life in other ways...

I'll be posting more soon,
