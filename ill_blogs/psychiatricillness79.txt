Yesterday I had my 6 month check up with my psychiatrist. He has suggested that I change my seroquel medication to abilify. This may help me loose weight and is not such a strong sedative. There is a possibility of a side effect of stiffness or jerky movements which sounds very scary. I am sleeping so much I am struggling to put my hours in at work so I have to change something. My weight is also bordering on obese. I am waiting for his written letter and advise before I mke my final decision.
