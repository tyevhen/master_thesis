I'm writing this post from my parents' kitchen table. The sun is physically and metaphorically shining, and I can look out the window on the beautiful city skyline below. I got a good pep talk from the fam, and I am revived to go and reconquer the thesis.

To my dear friends who live in this city: I'm sorry that I was not able to hang out. But the next time I come back, I'll be in a mood to celebrate.
