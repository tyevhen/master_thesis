Just a brief post this evening, as I am wiped out from a busy last 3 days. I am back in the swing of things. The knock down I experienced at the end of last week only kept me down for a couple of days. By late Friday evening I was feeling lighter, and I was back on course by Saturday.

In fact, I ran 20 miles Saturday morning in absolutely perfect, beautiful weather. That certainly helped begin the weekend on the right foot. I stayed busy with errands and chores the rest of Saturday, as I had to work Sunday. My mood was good, and I had the energy to get done what needed to be done.

After working 9 hours Sunday, I took an hour to put my feet up and enjoy Jet's comedic antics, and then I ran 8 miles. Those were very tough miles. My legs were tired! But I persevered and then got to bed early before another 9 hour work day today. My kettlebell and suspension training class tonight was tougher than usual. I was fatigued, but I did what I could.

Now I've got my feet are up. I'm watching my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins, and enjoying a cup of decaf, as I gather my thoughts and prepare myself for tomorrow's schedule. I've got 10 miles to run before heading off to work mid-morning. Hopefully I'll have enough energy after work to attend my evening AA meeting. I think I'm due. But I'll worry about that tomorrow.

I'm doing well. Thank you for your kind words of encouragement. I'm grateful to be feeling better.
