Today I am grateful for:
My happy dog, Puck, laying here by my feet in front of the heater, content, and in no apparent discomfort despite his recent injuries
Unconditional love
My health
Running and the continuing motivation to train and compete
Mom and Bruce
My warm, comfortable home
The giddiness of a new relationship
Bill and Cindy, Dr. L., Deb, and Shawn--I wouldn't be alive without them
The Morning Show on Minnesota Public Radio
My ability to work at a job I enjoy
My ability to work, period
AA and the local recovery community
My sponsor, Kim
