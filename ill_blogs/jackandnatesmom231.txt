Have you been the recipient of an amazing act of kindness recently??  Our family has.  I posted last week about Jack's school issues and the administration's suggestion that we get him familiar with a keyboard, namely an ipad.  About 30 minutes after I posted about this I received an email from one of my oldest friends, who lives in North Carolina these days.  She said, we have an ipad and we hardly use it.  How about we send it up to you guys?  I was FLOORED.  I don't care how long you have known someone, or how many experiences you have been through together- this is an extraordinary thing to do.  So first of all, I want to say thank you to her, you know who you are :).  This is a tremendous thing that you have done for our family.

One of my favorite bloggers, Lost and Tired (see my blogroll) posted a challenge today about random acts of kindness:

I wanted to pass it along to my readers.  I feel the need to be kind, I feel the need to pay this amazing act of generosity forward.  We should all do this every single day- or at least regularly.  I remember one morning I was in the Starbucks drive through (shocker, right?) and I pulled up to pay for my drink- but the person in front of me had paid for it.  So of course I paid for the person behind me's drink.  The cashier smiled at me and said thanks for keeping it going- turns out we had created something like a 20 car chain at this point.  We need more of this in the world.  Have a great day!
