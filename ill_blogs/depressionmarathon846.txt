I took these pictures while organizing my meds the other day. Why? I guess it was a reminder. Without my medications (including my allergy meds), I wouldn't be doing as well as I am today.

I do a lot of things to keep myself healthy--physically and mentally. I go to bed early. I get up around the same time every day. I exercise a lot. I eat well...for the most part. I work on my sobriety and attend my AA meetings. I spend time with friends. I try to keep balance in my life. It's a 24-hour-per-day job.

Unlike some others on the web, I'll never reject the need for my medication. A few may call this sad, stupid, or "brain-washed" (one of my favorites). I call it reality.
I am alive and well today because of all the work I've done, including the work I've done with my psychiatrist, and my willingness to take my meds as prescribed. It's been a team effort, and it's worked well for me.
