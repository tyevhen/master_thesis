I've been awake nights worrying about saying the perfect thing. I invited all of my professional treatment team to my Cake Night tonight (see previous post), and almost all of them are going to be there. Now I'm worried about what to say. I want them to know how important they were, and still are, in my recovery. I feel so strongly--my gratitude is so great--I don't want to leave any words on the table. But I'm realizing there's no way to say exactly what I feel. I'll never be able to say enough. Webster doesn't contain words powerful enough to convey my feelings.

So there's about an hour to go before Cake Night, and I've now got three pages of various versions of things to say. Yet I think I may throw it all away once I hit the podium. None of it is good enough. I'll let you know what happens.

I had a busy day today. I began the day with a 7:30 AM breakfast with a bunch of runners at my friend Renee's house. Renee is a famous cook-extraordinaire, so of course everything was delicious! I attended my 9:00 AM AA meeting where I got to see my sponsee get her 6 month sobriety chip. That was cool. Then Renee joined me on my last long run, 15 miles, before The Austin Marathon. It was a warm day and a good run. After that I rushed to a nearby town to get my haircut. I didn't want to look shaggy for tonight's big event. After Cake Night tonight, we plan to go out for pie. I love pie! And that will be a great finish to a busy day. It started with food with one crowd, and it's going to end with food with another crowd.

I feel incredibly blessed. I am so lucky to be surrounded by so many wonderful people. Today I'm grateful for all of the people in my life. Hmmm...maybe that's all that needs to be said.
