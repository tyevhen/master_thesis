Sometimes 
I look in the mirror 
And I don't know who I am
At that time when death called my name
I ended
This life had not been my plan

I looked down 
The red flowed from my wrist
As my mind shut it's door
With that decision I died that day
But somehow you saw me
As I sank to the bathroom floor

Tick, tick, tick
What is this that I am moving through?
Its was not supposed to be.
God, you've done it now!
Who am I?
What do You want me to see?

My hands move
The blood is not my own
Someone else had died instead
He brings me back
Touches my scars with His
He saved me just as He said

Sometimes 
I look in the mirror
And I don't know who I am
But He knows me
He is my life
This life is a part of His plan

I look in the mirror 
And I see His face
I stare straight in to His eyes
He looks right back
With love and grace
And I no longer need a disguise

I turn from the mirror
I bow my head
To the One who goes before me
His arms wrap around this war torn body
As He says
I am with you 'till glory!
