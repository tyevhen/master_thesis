After an hour of soul squeezing yoga, I walked to the campus Chick-fil-a and replaced all the toxins that I had just down-dogged out of my body. I surfed the internet while dipping fried chicken in polynesian sauce (i.e., pretended to work on my thesis), and because nobody had anything to say to me on myspace at 2pm on a Friday, this blog was born.
To give you a little backstory, I quit my "dream" job about a month ago to finish my master's thesis and finally finally graduate. So now I will chronicle my daily moral struggle and failings to finish that damn paper by May and get out of bed before 9, no 10 a.m.
