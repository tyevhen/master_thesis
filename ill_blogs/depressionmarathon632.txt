I've not got much to report. Things are going well. I noticed a slight dip in my mood early this week, following my DNF over the weekend, but I was able to right myself relatively quickly. I just had to let go of the disappointment and focus on what my reader, Maggie, mentioned in her helpful comment. DNF means Did Not Fail. I like that. Thanks Maggie.

I'm off to the lake again this weekend. It's supposed to be nice, and of course I'm looking forward to seeing D! I'm hoping to run 13-15 miles with D and his son on Saturday. His son is training for his first marathon, which unfortunately is the same weekend as my next marathon, so D will be far away with his son on that day (as he should be). I've had a refreshingly good week of training so far. It will be nice to run through the quiet woods, with someone whose company I enjoy, to finish off the week tomorrow.

Nothing more to report from here. Have a safe, enjoyable, healthy holiday weekend!
