went out a bit with a friend went ok, need to do this again tomorrow.

i think things get better cause slowly slowly I'm doing things to change my focus on what i want.still couldn't get my self to get out of the house



i woke up ok, a little tired, had weird dreams too, but good ones i think, had a good visit to the toilet and started the day ok, i marked this day as another small step up in my feeling, i still wait to see if there will be any major development in the way i feel and act...side effect almost totally gone now...
