Yesterday, Chris and I decided to go out for ice cream as our dinner. Then the plan was to have a piece of cake at home afterward. Why? Because, we are adults and we can. I was remembering back to childhood when I had great plans for when I was "grown up" and could "eat what I want." Well, after many a healthy meal we decided to throw in the towel for one night and indulge our inner children. I'm so glad we did! In case you are wondering, I had a chocolate frappe and Chris had a Sundae with hot fudge and peanut butter.
And, just because, here is a picture of Paige from yesterday.
Here's to crazy dinners and chubby cheeked babies!
