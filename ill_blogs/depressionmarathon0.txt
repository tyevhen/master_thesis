As I mentioned in a few previous posts, I've been having some discomfort and locking of my right knee, typically the day after a run. It hasn't interrupted my running. The discomfort has not been terrible, but it's been concerning, especially when my knee intermittently locked up. The locking made me believe I had a medial meniscus tear. For that reason I had an MRI earlier this week and saw my orthopedic doctor on Friday. We were both surprised my medial meniscus looked great.

The medial meniscus may have looked great, but the bone spur on my femur didn't look so good. There's not supposed to be a bone spur on the end of the femur. There's especially not supposed to be a bone spur right beneath the patella, a spur which is literally carving a matching groove in the underside of my patella. Apparently, that was the problem.

Since the bone spur is carving up my patella, it's fairly important it be removed. So I'm having arthroscopic right knee surgery this Thursday. It should be a fairly simple procedure, especially since the rest of my knee anatomy looked so good. My doc will take a burr to the spur and file it off. I'm hoping to be back at work by Monday and back to running within a few weeks. And I'm looking forward to a pain free right knee. Onward and upward, my friends!
