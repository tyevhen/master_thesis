Yesterday, a former sponsee killed herself.
She was maybe 22 years old.
We worked through the Big Book of AA together.
She graduated from her halfway house with pride.
She got her apartment.
She held down a job.
She was sober.
And then she got drunk.
And disappeared.
And now, one year later, she's dead.
She hung herself in detox.
Clearly she was still struggling with her disease.

Why couldn't she get it?
Why did she go back out there again and again?
Why did she struggle so much?
Why her and not me?

I'm so grateful to be sober today.
So grateful.

Rest in peace, Maria.
Rest in peace.
