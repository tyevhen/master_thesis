I have been thinking for a while that I need a new challenge and a new focus in life. I have joined a social group and been out with them a few times. It is a really nice group and they do all sorts of activities. I have been out with them three times ow and I am going to go for a meal with them tomorrow evening.

I have applied for a new job. I had two telephone interviews last week and I have also done some psychometric tests online. The tests were really difficult though so I am doubtful I will get further. I really want to though as this sounds like the perfect role for me.

I am also seriously considering doing a trek to Everest base camp for charity next year. My Mum has offered to help me with the fundraising. I think it will be a great focus for me and take my mind off of work for a while and give me something to get fit for. I had a good work out at the gym this morning thinking about how I am going to to try really hard to get properly fit now.

I do feel a lot better now, I really need to enter a new phase of life. I was starting to feel fed up and bored. I would not say depressed, I just had nothing that made me want to jump out of bed in the mornings.

I plan to start posting regulary again too.
