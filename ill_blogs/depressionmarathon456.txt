I got a phone call early Friday morning. It was D. He asked if I wanted some company for the weekend. Of course, I said yes! What a great surprise! He's an accountant, and this is his busiest time of year, so we weren't sure he'd be able to come here again until after tax day, April 15th. But he had an unexpected lull in his schedule, and he was able to get away. I was so happy! I had absolutely no plans for the weekend, and I had been feeling a bit sorry for myself.

D's visit cured my woes. He arrived around 6:00 PM Friday night. It was so nice to see him! He got to meet Jet for the first time, and Jet won him over in no time at all. Jet really loved D, too. All three of us had a great weekend!

Yesterday we went to the movie Silver Linings Playbook with my friends, Bill and Cindy. I was interested in seeing it because the main character had bipolar disorder. After seeing the film, I understood why it was nominated for several Academy Awards. While it was a somewhat predictable feel good story, the acting was quite good. We all enjoyed it very much.

As usual, it was difficult to say goodbye to D today. He had to leave earlier than usual due to the unpredictable stormy weather we were experiencing. Prior to his departure, we went out for a nice, romantic brunch at one of the finer restaurants in town. It was really nice.

I'm still smiling as a result of my unexpectedly eventful weekend. It was so great to spend time with D. It's never enough time, but I don't worry about that. I'm grateful he made time for me, not to mention the 4 hour drive, despite his busy work schedule. Our relationship is going well. Slowly but surely we seem to be building something good. I'm grateful for that, too.
