After my long weekend off I was worried that I would have lost some readers and would have had a hard time picking it back up. However when I checked my email I saw some amazing developments. What a surprise! I received an email telling me,

"...we have selected The Reality of Anxiety as one of our Top Site Award recipients! We are honoring the top Anxiety blogs and sites on the Web, as picked by our experts. Your blog delves into the issues surrounding social anxiety with candor and compassion. We applaud your efforts to keep the Anxiety community informed and involved."
How awesome is that! I am so excited about it. You can go to their Top Sites Award Page to see the other blogs that won the award. Many of them I link to and some I do not but have looked at before. All are great sites in my opinion for more information on anxiety. So I have posted the award on the side of the blog but here it is for you all to see in all its glory... (drum roll...)


Tah Dah! (trumpets play, confetti thrown, red carpet rolled out)



Also my traffic has gone up tremendously and its not because of Brinn in Beaumont ;) Its because another web page has linked to one of my previous posts about my Top 10 Resources that I use to help me with my anxiety. You can see it at Psych Central under August 5th's post entry if you are curious. Other websites are also posting this article such as iVillage.

Its so nice to see people taking notice of my goals and hopes for this blog- a place where people can find information to help them with their struggle with anxiety and a place to find some support. I really appreciate all the support and can't wait to see what happens next.
