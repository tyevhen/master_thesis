The sore throat and aches I was experiencing on Monday have strangely hung around this week. It's weird. I feel better overall. I have more energy for running and work, but I have also been having attacks of fatigue that knock me flat. And every time I think my throat is no longer sore, I feel soreness. I don't remember having any soreness when I got up this morning, but my right tonsil is swollen and sore now. It's weird.

I saw my psychiatrist today. We talked about the fatigue, but she's hesitant to change any medications. I understand that, and I agree with that. Neither of us want me to go through another depressive episode anytime soon. We also talked about work restrictions. I've been handling the 4-hour shifts pretty well, so I'm going to begin working 6-hour shifts now. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work more.

I signed up for my local marathon yesterday. My 20-miler went well over the weekend, and my runs this week have been good, so I figured, why not? I'm going to use it as a training run for Grandmas Marathon in June. The 20-mile mark is just down the street from my home, so if things aren't going well, I can always walk off the course and come home. If I'm doing okay, I'll go ahead and finish. The race is Memorial Day Weekend, so I'm officially tapering again. I'm hoping for good weather and a good run.

I don't have anything else going on right now, and that's a good thing. Quiet and drama-free is exactly how I want to live. I so appreciate when my mood is good and life is moving along smoothly. I'm living gratefully today.
