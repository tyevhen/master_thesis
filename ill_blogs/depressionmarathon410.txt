Things are improving around here. I'm physically feeling better. I've still got quite a deep, annoying cough, but overall I'm much better. I got out of the house today and back on to the road. It felt so good to run once again! I covered 6.5 miles, stopping near the end to take in a few minutes of a disc dog competition, before returning home. My pace was good, and my lungs survived. I'm pretty wiped out right now, but it was worth it.

I may run a bit longer tomorrow. My friend, T, offered me a spot next to her on her 13 mile run, and I just may take her up on that. I like running with her. It keeps me a bit more relaxed and out of "training mode" when we share the road. I'm not ready to get back into training mode quite yet. I'd like to take a few more relaxed, fun runs prior to getting back on schedule. The Twin Cities Marathon, in early October, is up next.

I spent a fair amount of today's run re-living my Grandmas Marathon performance. It's funny. Today I felt nothing but joy and satisfaction, and none of last Saturday's strain and discomfort, during my mental re-cap. It's another beauty of marathoning. When I run well, the pain and discomfort quickly fades. I guess it's one of many reasons I keep going back for more.

I'm off to dinner with a friend now. I've been a bit couped up with this virus, so it will be nice to get out and socialize with someone I enjoy. I'm looking forward to next week. I have just 2 days of work before Jet and I will be off to spend 5 days in northern Wisconsin with D at his lake home. D and I haven't seen each other since mid-May, so I'm really happy we'll have this time together. Maybe I'll get back on my training schedule after that.
