I spent the day getting prepared to leave for Austin tomorrow. I have to leave my house bright and early to get to the airport on time, so I am all packed. I'll be totally ready as soon as my last load of laundry dries. I also cleaned all day in order to leave my home in decent shape for my new dog-sitter. It was a busy, but exciting day. I'm anxious to get going!

Puck didn't like all the packing and cleaning. He knew something was up, and he got quite nervous. At this point, he's not willing to let me out of his sight. I'm worried about leaving him with someone new, but I think everything will be fine. Of course I can't convince Puck of that. Thankfully, I can count on Bill and Cindy to help out if needed. It's good to have good friends.

Speaking of my good friends. I spent last night with them. Bill made a steak dinner. Cindy and I made Toll House chocolate chip cookies. And our mutual friend Tim brought morel mushrooms. It was quite a feast. Satisfied, we sat at the table munching cookies and laughing long after dinner was done. I left there much later than planned, but I left with a warm feeling of gratitude. I am so grateful to have such wonderful, comfortable friends.

Well, time to finish the laundry and get to bed. I've got to be up early. I'm so ready to run this marathon, I can't wait! Usually I feel a little trepidation this close to race day, but not so far this time. I hope the race turns out as good as I feel. We shall see...
