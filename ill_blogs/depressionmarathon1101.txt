I'm thinking this morning of us.
mentally ill,
like me.

Mental illness.
a unique affliction,
dreaded
difficult
debilitating.

stereotyped
scary
stigmatizing.

No Hallmark or flowers.
No visitors or gifts.
No casserole or hotdish!

Are you the black-sheep
in your family, too?
Are the whispers you hear
always about you?

Our invisible pain
more painful still,
as nobody asks,
Hey, how are you?

Please
Allow me.
How are you?
How are you?


On this day of blessings, may each of you know peace, grace, and serenity.
For this, I will pray.
Merry Christmas, Everyone.
