Perhaps it was your enthusiastic and supportive response to my last post. Perhaps it was not having to work the past couple of days. Perhaps it was just a matter of time passing. Whatever the reason, I am feeling a little bit better. My apathy has declined while my energy has improved. In fact, I was able to do some housework yesterday, which was a pretty big deal. It's been awhile since I've given a damn about or had the energy to do housework. I'm grateful to be feeling well enough to be somewhat productive again.

Today my mood was helped by the completion of my third and final 20-mile training run in preparation for The Boston Marathon on April 21st. It was a gorgeous day! Finally! I had a conversation with God about gratitude off and on throughout my run. I thanked God for all the people and things I have in my life. I am a lucky woman. Despite this awful illness, I have a lot for which to be grateful. I probably don't think about that often enough. Today, while running for 3 hours, I had plenty of opportunity to say thanks.

What's on your gratitude list today?
