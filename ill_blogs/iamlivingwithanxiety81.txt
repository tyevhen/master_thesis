My counselor recently shared with me three core tenets of AA: honesty, openness, and willingness to change (HOW). These are essential building blocks for overcoming anxiety disorders:
We must be honest with ourselves and admit that we have a mental illness.
We must be open to trying new behaviors, techniques, therapies, medications, and support groups.
And we must be willing to do hard work, challenging ourselves to confront and overcome our longstanding fears.
I was not always in a HOW state of mind. For too long I just suffered and clinged to any moment of serenity I could come by. But now I'm ready to have the "courage to make mistakes" and ready to abandon my "passion for self-distrust"(1) in order to achieve recovery and a more mentally healthy life.
