I just returned from Grandma's Marathon weekend in Duluth, Minnesota. I have friends and family in that area, which is good, because this year I was a spectator and visitor rather than a participant for the first time in years. Despite my Achilles injury, I decided to go up for marathon weekend. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tough. It was tough not to be a runner this year, but on the positive side, I got to spend a lot more time with family and friends than I otherwise would have. I even stayed out way past my bedtime, twice! I lead a pretty sedate life around here, so staying out past my bedtime laughing with friends was really nice. I'm glad I went.

Now that I'm home, however, I'm feeling a bit out of sorts. I'm a little overwhelmed, a bit lonely, and somewhat anxious. I'm tired. I've got a list of chores to accomplish before work tomorrow. And I'm at a loss when it comes to exercise. That's probably the biggest problem. I have not yet done any aerobic exercise since getting my boot. Other than a few push-ups and sit-ups, I haven't had the gumption to do anything.

The boot, it turns out, is not only a pain in the butt, it's exhausting! I'm about 4 inches taller on my right side than my left, and just walking around like that wipes me out. Work, especially, was exhausting last week. By the time I got home all I wanted to do was nap. My motivation was lacking then, and it's not at all improved now, I think I'm really going to have to push myself to do something, anything aerobic, this week. If I want to stay well I can't continue to be a spectator.
