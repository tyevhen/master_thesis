Hi friends!
Phew. I'm ready to pass out. I just finished a whole boatload of new work for the shop! There's lots of stationery and I've introduced custom silhouettes to the mix!









My silhouettes are unique because I've added a painted floral background that makes it look sort of rustic and hipster. I can do pets, kids and babies, adults (brides and grooms?), families, or other animals. I have a choice of 4 different backgrounds to choose from and 5 different "name banners" that can go on the bottom of the silo. Custom silhouettes make for a special gift since they are personalized and made just for you. You can check out the selection at the Me & Wee etsy shop. There, you'll find lots of choices for animals ready-made. I hope you'll keep the silhouettes in mind as we head toward the holidays...or they're great for birthdays and anniversaries, baby showers, bridal showers and all that jazz.








The monogram custom stationery:
This is a luxurious set of customized stationery featuring a hand-painted watercolor floral wreath and monogram. Set of 8. These are professionally printed using fade-proof inks on ultra-thick, soft cotton Crane's Lettra paper. These notecards are flat and tea-length...they make a unique impression on the recipient! You simply choose your letter and I do the rest. I'm selling them in sets of 8. You can find these at the Me & Wee Etsy shop too...










Finally, I've converted some of my previous illustrations into stationery options. This whimsical stationery is great for kids and adults alike. Great for thank-you notes or for a letter in the lunchox. Find them here!

 

 


So, that's what I've been working on and where I've been...I hope you like them!
