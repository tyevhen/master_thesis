It's almost 8:00pm on Sunday night, and I'm finally sitting down! I had a class yesterday--all day--about 100 miles away. Today, I worked. In between I watched my Twins look terrible and get knocked out of the playoffs. Tonight, I ran a 5 mile tempo run on some pretty dead legs before heading to my least favorite place to spend money--the grocery store. I'm finally home now, but I've got little else to say. I'm tired. I'm hungry. I need to get ready for work tomorrow, and my body is screaming for bed. I promise I'll be more verbose once I'm rested. Good night.
