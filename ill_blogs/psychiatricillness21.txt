I am beginning to have had enough of the short days now. I feel ready to do a little more work and hate being stuck at home when I am feeling well. I refuse to work longer hours when they are not paying me to do so. I just need some hobbies to make time at home without Mr R more interesting.

I think I will start preparing for a Christmassy Christmas. Still I feel quite excluded from the world as I am not allowed to work proper hours.
