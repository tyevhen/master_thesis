Wow. It's the end of November already. Kind of a big month for me. Had that little marathon deal a few weeks ago. That turned out okay, I guess. Ha! Briefly had a plan to run another one next month, but now trying to cope with not running while I heal from injury. I think the rest and cross-training are helping my leg.

Yesterday I lifted weights and spent 66 minutes on the elliptical. God bless those of you who do those machines on a regular basis! I don't know how you do it! I thought swimming was boring! Even with a TV right in front of my face, I can't stand doing the same thing in the same place over and over again. But I did it. Like I said, I'm trying to cope with not running. I'll be back in the pool tomorrow.

Puck's trying to cope with me not running, too. He's not any happier with our 30 minute walks than I am. Plus he's got all sorts of excess energy. I can't sit still for one minute without him bringing me one of his toys. He's used to 20-40 miles a week, too. Half hour walks are a pretty significant drop in activity. Hopefully, he won't have to wait much longer to run with mom again.

On another totally unrelated note, I'm stressed about having to confront one of my assistants at work. She's been making some questionable treatment decisions lately. Unfortunately, she's also very defensive. So rather than allowing for a learning experience, which is what I'd prefer, she will likely defend her decisions to the bitter end and fail to hear any constructive feedback. I'm afraid it's going to be a totally useless and unpleasant interaction. It's too bad.

Here's hoping December brings healing, happiness, and joy for one and all.
