I especially love writing online to convey ideas, share opinions, etc, but I also like vlogging on YouTube, and I have a very different audience there, an audience made up largely of those who aren't, themselves, unschooling, but want to learn more about it!  However, I rarely vlog.  Mostly because I often have trouble thinking of good things to vlog about (I find coming up with vlogging ideas to be much harder than coming up with posting ideas).  So I made a video asking people to ask me about unschooling, and give me ideas...



It's aimed mainly at the aforementioned YouTube audience, but I'd welcome questions from blog readers as well!  My YouTube channel: Catzie690

Peace,
Idzie
