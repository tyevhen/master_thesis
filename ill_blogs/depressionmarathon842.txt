I did it. It's done. I didn't drown. I survived the hilly bike ride. And the run went well. I finished my first triathlon (1/2 mile swim, 13.1 mile bike, and 3.1 mile run) in 1:29:58. And you know what? It was fun! I guess I'm going to do another, and training (as well as my new job) starts tomorrow. Phew...I just looked. Tomorrow's schedule is REST.

I'll have pictures and a more thorough recap a bit later. Stay tuned!
