There are some nights where I need inspiration.  I turn to pinterest, like any modern women, ha.  I found some good statements that I thought I would share....they brightened my mood, and maybe someone else out there could use a little light tonight too



Ahhhh....there I feel better now, anyone else?  Sometimes, believe it or not, I can't find the words to express how I am feeling.  This helps
