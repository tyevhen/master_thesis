Hello!
I've had a few emails and requests as of late to show the rug we chose for the nursery last year. I did a post about it here back when it happened, but here is the photo again. It's a shag rug from Crate and Barrel and we've been happy with it! It doesn't slide around...we got the pad to go under it.


And, here's some new photos of Little P in honor of St. Patrick's Day. I spent a lot of last weekend working on our family tree and there's several lines (particularly the ones for my maiden name of Cassidy and our current last name of Carty) that trace back to Ireland for both Chris and myself. And lots of other places too!

See? She's clapping! And pulling herself up! She must really like this holiday.
