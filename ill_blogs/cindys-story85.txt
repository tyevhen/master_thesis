This song by Sara Groves, "You Cannot Lose My Love," gave me hope and comfort as I slowly came up out of the pit and darkness in my life.  The truth in this song is something that I hold on to and carry with me in the depths of my soul.




God loves us so much. It says in Romans 8:38 & 39 (New Living Translation):

"And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from His[God's] love. Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away. Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
