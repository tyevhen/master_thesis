Another surprise blog post, but another really important announcement!

I will by cycling 20 -35 miles every day, for five days in Germany for Mind Charity. This will be for the second year running, and last year I managed to raise almost Â£200 to help people like you and I going through similar mental illness experiences. I will be doing the cycle at the end of June, starting in Munich.

Mental illness affects 1/4 people in any given year, including those closest to you. Mind charity are here to support and raise awareness around mental health. 

I would be so grateful if you could sponsor me - any amount is appreciated. If you wish to sponsor me, you can do so by visiting my Just Giving page:

Thanks!,
