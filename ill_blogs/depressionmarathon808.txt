I feel like I should say more about the triathlon, but I'm not sure what to say. The truth is I have mixed feelings about my performance. I know I should be happy to have finished. I know I said finishing was my ultimate goal, and it was. I didn't drop out of the swim because I wanted to at least finish. Right there in the lake, I told myself, "You started this. Finish it." Unfortunately, that was only about 50 yards into the lake--hence the mixed feelings.

The fact is, I am happy I finished, but I'm really disappointed with the swim. I knew it was going to be tough. I knew I would be scared. I knew it would take me longer than swimming 1500 yards in the pool. What I didn't expect...what was truly humbling, was being one of the last people out of the water. It took me 41 minutes to get out of the lake. Like I said, it was humbling.

I knew the swim would be scary and hard, but it was worse than that. And that was the problem. I CAN SWIM!! Yet every time I put my face in the water I couldn't stand it. I ended up either floating on my back or doing the backstroke almost the entire 1500 yards. I don't think I did more than 100 yards of freestyle. I was so pissed, but I couldn't seem to do anything about it.

Maybe I bit off more than I could chew. Maybe I shouldn't have started the race. Maybe I shouldn't have done the long course. Maybe, maybe, maybe... Yet I'm glad I started. I'm glad I pushed myself. And I am proud of the fact that I finished. Yet, I'm disappointed, too. Mixed up...I'm not sure what to feel, or what to write, or what to say.

I guess I'm still digesting the whole experience. I'm trying to be humbled, yet grateful. I'm trying to focus on the positives. I'm trying not to be too hard on myself. I know, I know...it was my first attempt. One thing is for sure--disappointment drives me to do better. I foresee another triathlon in my future, if for no other reason than that.
