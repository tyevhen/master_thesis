Well I got married to Mr R.

Life just feels more complete, I feel settled and content.  I got married at the beginning of July and after a 2 week holiday in the US of A I started work at the University of Oxford.  I am only working 4 days a week and it is definitely more manageable however I have had a significant decrease in pay.

To compensate for the reduced pay, I have started cooking. We use to eat out 2 or 3 times a week but I am 'playing house' at the moment.  I am doing a weekly meal plan and a weekly grocery shop.  I think I'm doing well with my new routine.

Life is wonderful and I am very very happy!
