My beautiful motorcycle is now gone. I watched it drive away yesterday. Tough. Having a bike represented some sort of freedom, I think. I didn't ride it often, but when I did, there was nothing more mindful I could have been doing. I could daydream driving my car, but on my motorcycle, a squirrel could have killed me. It was a great way to rid my mind of whatever was weighing me down. I'll miss that. I'll miss that freedom. But it didn't make sense to hang onto something I wasn't using, either. I think the freedom of lightening my load will outweigh hanging onto unused toys.

And that brings me to today. I've spent the day preparing for a huge garage sale, which I'm having this Friday and Saturday. As I mentioned here last week, I have too much stuff. I moved into this house 6.5 years ago, and I've got stuff I haven't even unpacked yet! Lots of it! Obviously, if I haven't needed it in the last 6.5 years, I don't need it at all. Don't you agree? There is also a lot of mental baggage among that stuff, which I also do not need. I'm looking forward to the freedom of being rid of the baggage and the stuff.

It's been a long day of lifting, hauling, sorting and pricing. My back is killing me! This is the most exercise I've had since the triathlon a few weeks ago. Once again, I've hit a lull in my motivation. I've got so many things going on right now, I just don't feel like going out for a run. Fortunately, following Weight Watchers is keeping me from suffering the consequences of my inactivity. I miss racing, but I'm otherwise doing okay with my lull. I know I'll eventually get back out there.

I'm tired and ready to hit my bed now, so I'll leave you with a quote I found during my hours of sorting today. Goodnight.

The will to succeed is important, but what's even more important is the will to prepare. --Bobby Knight
