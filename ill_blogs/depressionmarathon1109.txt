UGH...
I've
got
the
flu.

It began on the way to work yesterday morning. An hour later, I was on my way home from work--stopping half-way to puke out my open door. Not fun. It's been a long time since I've been this physically sick. I sure as hell hope it will be a long time (or ever!) before it happens again.

Now, back to bed.
