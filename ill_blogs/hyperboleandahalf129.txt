So I was playing around on the internet (I'll explain later... maybe in a third blog entry for today?) and I came upon a site that uses state-of-the-art technology to match your face to the celebrity you most resemble.  It made me realize how amazing it is that we don't have a cure for cancer yet and also that I must have an invisible mustache.

Anyway, I uploaded a photo and excitedly wondered what celebrity it would tell me I looked like.  Maybe it would tell me that I look like Kate Moss, or Suzanne Sommers or Heidi Klum...

This was my first result:

 


Okay... I thought.   At least the computer thinks I'm hot!  Well... at least it thinks I am 70% hot.   I decided that I'd check out who else the computer thought I looked like.  

So I hit next.....


... and I got this result.  I immediately hit next again because I thought "this has to be some kind of mistake...



...but no.  There was not a mistake.  I really must actually look like a man.  Still, I thought I'd give it one more shot...



I was discouraged by this result, but decided that maybe next time...



Nope.  But at least I didn't have a mustache in this one...


This is about where I started needing a hug.  

What am I going to do with my life??
