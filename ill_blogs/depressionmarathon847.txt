It was a strange day in my little corner of the world. Things started great. After Puck awoke at 5:15--he is a creature of habit--I went back to bed and got an extra hour of sleep. I saw my psychiatrist and told her how well I was doing. I swam 1800 yards without much difficulty. I discussed remodeling my basement with a contractor. And then...crash.

I've had a hard time lifting my head off the pillow, more figuratively than literally, the rest of the day. All of a sudden I lost all of my oomph. Shortly thereafter, I noticed my thinking was a little off, and then the sadness set in. Weird. It was another precipitous dive into gray.

I'm feeling okay now, just okay, but I'm a little leery. I don't know where that little dip came from. I don't know if it's done. If it's done for now, is it coming back? Like I said, it was weird. It's still weird. I'm not sure what else I can even say about it. But now that I'm feeling "okay," I think I'll try to cross some of the other items off of my to-do list.

And I'll leave you with this thought by Aristotle. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act, but a habit.
