Although I'm slaving away trying to work through my final semester at uni, and wearing 3 jumpers because it's still bitterly cold, I just can't stop thinking about spring and all the pretty things I want to treat myself to once the weather picks up!! Naturally, the colour palette is pretty simple, but hey, neutrals are my thing!!

I hope you enjoy perusing through my wishlist,
