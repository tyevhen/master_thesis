A sleep study--that's what my doc and I decided today. We were discussing my increasing fatigue. Of course, I want it to be caused by anything other than depression! (Something fixable, please!!!)
I inquired about sleep apnea after noting a couple recent experiences. While napping I've been nearly awakened by my own gasping for breath. The gasping was accompanied by significant anxiety--the kind of anxiety you feel when you can't breathe. The gasping-anxiety cycle repeated until I finally woke up, frustrated and unrested. Fortunately, there is a sleep expert in my psychiatrist's office, so I will be having a sleep study soon. Is it wrong to wish for a diagnosis???
