I saw my doc yesterday morning, complained about feeling bad, tired, lethargic, blah, blah, blah... She was her usual quiet, patient self with me. I knew, as my psychologist told me the night before, it would pass with time--it always does. That's so hard to remember when you're in the middle of it, isn't it? Well, long story short, despite my worry, negative thinking, fatigue and lethargy, I made it to my appointments yesterday. Then I made it out for a run. Then I began feeling better.

I made it out for a run before work this morning, too. That was amazing! Work went okay. I tried to focus on feeling better, which I was, rather than on feeling tired, which I also was. I am feeling better. Perhaps the depression reprieve is back. I'm glad it wasn't gone too long. Sixteen miles scheduled for tomorrow...good thing I'm feeling better. Here's to all of us meeting our goals this weekend!
