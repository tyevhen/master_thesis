Last week we were all eating dinner together as we do every night. Toward the end of the meal, Paige looked up at us and the conversation went like this:

Paige: "Mommy, how old are you?"
Me: I'm 35
Paige: "Huh. Daddy, how old are you?"
Chris: "38"
Paige: ***pause*** "Wow guys.......those are some big numbers. Those are some biiiiiiiiig numbers!"

Sigh.
(remember when she had a speech delay?)
