I'm off for another weekend at the lake with D. I'm looking forward to seeing him. I'm looking forward to our long run together tomorrow morning and grilling a great dinner together tomorrow night. I'll see my parents, too, while I'm there. I'm hoping to take them out on the water with us, and maybe we'll even get in some waterskiing. Puck will be there, too, of course. Did I tell you Puck was the first dog ever allowed in D.'s lake home? I told D. from the first day that we (Puck and I) were a matched set. Apparently he heard me, and now Puck's charmed his socks off anyway! It's all good. I can't wait to get going.

I'm only two weeks out from my next marathon now. D and I will run 12-15 miles tomorrow morning and then the serious tapering begins. I had a great week of running and working out this week. I'm feeling really good, and I think I'm ready. I have no plans or goals for this race. I'm going to wait and see. If the weather cooperates, and I'm feeling good in the first few miles, then I may go for a good time. If it's hot and humid, a distinct possibility, or I'm not feeling great those first miles, then I will focus less on time and more on enjoying the experience. Either way, it should be fun. D is running the half marathon, so we'll be there together and spend the rest of that weekend together, too.

I'm off now. I hope you all have a great weekend. Take time out for yourself. Find some fun. Focus less on illness and more on moments. And enjoy each moment to its fullest. That's what I'm going to try to do. I'll let you know how it goes.
