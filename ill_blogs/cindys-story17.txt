Once upon a time I felt the way this poem expresses.  Just a simple question was asked of me, but there was too much within the answer to even make a truthful attempt.  

ARE YOU OKAY?
by Cindy Boersma

"Are you Okay?" you ask.

What do you want me to say?

I could tell you the truth:
I feel lousy 
I just want to scream
I can't get anything right.
I feel like I could explode.

But that's not what you want to hear.

So I will tell you.

Am I Okay?

"I'm fine thanks,
And you?"

Knowing that I felt this way back then, I think I will pause and listen for the real answer when I ask the question, "Are you Okay?"  I do want to hear the truth.  I do want to be the one that hears.
