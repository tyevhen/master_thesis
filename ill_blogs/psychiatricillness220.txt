Blogging is finally back, I have really missed it!

I have had quite a good week, I have worked sensible hours and got a lot done, I have also managed to stick to a routine. I have even been to yoga twice this week and tonight I even went shopping and cooked proper healthy(ish) meal. I had chicken Fajita's!

The weather here has been lovely with warm sun and long light evenings. It does not get dark until about 10pm this time of year. If the weather lasts over the weekend I intend to go to the park and read my book.

I am going to post some thoughts I wrote while I was quite sick last year, I was panicking for days before my best friend realised how sick I was and took me to my parents. I wrote several notebooks in the space of three days it was a release for my panic. Before I bought the notebooks I was typing and I found the documents earlier this week. I have not shared them with anyone before.
