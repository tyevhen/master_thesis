Hi friends!
Well, we finally got an area rug in the nursery. I'd mentioned a while ago while we were planning the room that we were going to use this rug.

Well, after being back-ordered for several months it finally came in. (You can get it here.)
It was gorgeous in person, but it was very thin. I wouldn't call it a rug. I'd call it a mat. Or a tapestry. I'd pictured it to be more thick like a carpet-type of thing. So, I was concerned about the constant slipping and sliding that would happen on it even with a rug pad. I don't want to trip on it while holding Little P, that's for sure! My other issue: it had too much going on. The colors in the rug are all used in the nursery, so it matched. But it was just TOO MUCH. Once in the room my eye had no idea where to look because there were patterns all over the place. I'm a believer that a room should have one major focal point (and maybe 2 if they work together) but no more than that. If the room were simpler in color and pattern, it would have allowed for the rug to be a hero and it would have worked. Anyway, we sadly returned it to the store and we picked up THIS 3 x 5 foot shag rug at Crate and Barrel. It was my original plan to use a white shag rug way back when I started the whole process of planning, so I didn't have to get used to the idea. I'm thrilled with how it looks in the space and how it feels on the feet! Even with a rug pad below it was cheaper than the other rug. I now feel the room is as ready as it will ever be for Little P. Even Maren the Wonder Dog is a fan...she sinks in so deep when she's walking on it...right up to her belly. My feet disappear into it. I'd never do a rug bigger than the 3 x 5 foot in a shag; it's a lot of lint and it's such a particular look. So there ends the thrilling tale of the rug saga. I have to find some other small silly thing to obsess over now. Happy Tuesday!
