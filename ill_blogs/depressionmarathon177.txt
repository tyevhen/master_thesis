I've had many people come and go in my life. It's fair to say that, good or bad, I've learned something from each and every relationship. Yesterday was a particularly difficult parting. My friend, KMC, who I wrote about recently, succumbed to a brain tumor last week. Her memorial service was yesterday. It was a difficult goodbye.

KMC and I spent many, many hours together throughout the early and middle years of my sobriety. She was my sponsor and friend. She took me through the steps of our recovery program. She taught me how to live life on life's terms. She gave me the tools to live in this world without fear, anger and resentment. Instead she imparted faith, gratitude and serenity. Somehow I missed those lessons growing up, and if it wasn't for KMC, I might still be miserable, or worse, dead.

The church was filled to the rafters yesterday. Women, especially, were well represented. That made perfect sense to me, as KMC had a tremendous impact on countless women in this community. In working her program, she was a role model. She had her share of struggles, as have we all, but she eventually came through them, standing tall, and in the process gave us all more to contemplate and to emulate. The representation of grateful, sober women at KMC's service yesterday was a testament to a life well lived.

I will miss my sponsor, my mentor, my teacher, my friend. I have no doubt I wouldn't have the life I have today had KMC not spent those countless hours teaching me. I will never forget her. She is with me every time I speak up in a meeting, every time I sit down with a newly sober woman, every time I share my experience, strength and hope. She is part of my journey. In passing on her teachings, KMC will never be far from my heart. Rest in peace, my friend.
