So, Paige had her haircut and then we were able to get Noah's hair cut (it was getting long and covered his ears). (boo hoo!!!!) We took him to the same barber Chris goes to. They were great! (Thanks, Yankee Clipper in Acton!) Noah did great; not a cry or fuss from him. He just sat there curiously and I'm sure he wondered what was going on. ha! And note his spiffy Spiderman haircut cape. coooooool. My baby looked so much more like a little boy after it was done. Yes, I cried a little that night.

Here are the pics and a video. It's all going too fast, I tell ya!











Getting your hair cut can be tiring!
