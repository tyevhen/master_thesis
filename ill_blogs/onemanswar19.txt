Happy Halloween, blog friends!

For the first time in a long time, I'm looking forward to this zany holiday.

Something about being somebody I'm not for a day appeals to me. Maybe others can relate. I'm still learning to be happy with who I am.

I think that's why Halloween is so popular: We can all dress up and act silly while we celebrate our differences.

A big part of recovery is learning to have sober fun, which I've never been great at doing. I did it tonight though, if only for a little bit.

The local CrossFit gym where I'm the newest newbie had a "Halloween WOD (Workout of the Day." I almost did what I often do during sober social situations and punted. But I went for it on fourth and short anyway. And I had a great time with good friends. I even made some new ones who I will always remember by the super hero names instead of their real ones.

You followers who aren't crazy in Alabama might have a more difficult time guessing my costume...so check out the photos  and leave your reply!

 

My hope is those who are struggling who might read this will have fun on Halloween Day.

If it's a full day, an evening or even a good hour, I hope you find a way to have some fun.

War Damn Halloween!
