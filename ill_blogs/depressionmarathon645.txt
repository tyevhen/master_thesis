I've had a successfully productive weekend. It started at 4:45 AM yesterday morning with my 20 mile long run. As I predicted, it went well. I did hit the wall at mile 19, but until then the hours clicked by relatively quickly. It was a bit steamy outside. I was soaking wet. Even my shoes were soaked from the sweat running down my legs. They squished with every step. Regardless, I tolerated the humidity and ran well. It was a good training run.

Today I hit the pool and cleaned up my yard. Puck woke me at 5:30 AM, even though I had planned to sleep in. I swam for 35 minutes. It felt good to stretch out in the pool. Then I mowed my yard and pulled weeds for what felt like hours! I had monster weeds growing up through the cracks in my sidewalk. I'm still trying to clean the dirt out from under my nails! At least my house looks presentable from the curb now.

My mood has been good, but I'm a little anxious today. I actually had to take a prn medication to calm down. I've been thinking and worrying about next weekend, which I will be spending with my new friend D. We've got a long weekend scheduled, and I'm excited to see him. I'm trying to stay in the moment now and stop the worry thoughts. I think it's going to be a long week leading up to the weekend. I'll have to really work hard to take one day at a time. Wish me luck.
