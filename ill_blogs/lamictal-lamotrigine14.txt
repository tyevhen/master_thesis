Daily Irony Supplement: Staying up until 2 am reading John McManamy's Living Well With Depression and Bipolar Disorder. Sigh.

Since titrating up to 50 mgs of lamictal, my mood has definitely been better.  I'm not experiencing as many mood dips as I was even last week.  I had one day (Day 17) where my mood was low to neutral.  I had a low day a few days after starting lamictal too (Day 5), so maybe there's something about getting used to the dose that causes a temporary slip in mood.

On Friday, I noticed that my late-afternoon mood shift has gone in an agitated direction.  This is a change from baseline -- my tendency over the last few years experience a trough of some kind around 4 or 5 pm.  When I'm doing well, this is just slight sleepiness or trouble concentrating.  When I'm not doing well, I'm into The Pit.
