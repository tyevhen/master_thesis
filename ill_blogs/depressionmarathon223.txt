Getting around, etta is. I find myself humbled and honored once again today. The website, The Mighty, is featuring one of my recent posts on their site. The post titled, Dear Friends and Family, published in January, caught their eye, and they generously offered to post it on their site. I'm always surprised when my little blog is discovered or recognized by a much larger entity, but I am proud to have this post out there where it might be seen by a larger audience. I'm hopeful it makes a difference in the life of someone. And I'm very grateful The Mighty gave me the opportunity.
