I want the someone else, I don't think I have ever felt like this before but I hardly know him. I'm trying not to think too much but I hope I see him soon.

I hardly know him so I have to stop thinking about him.

I never really loved my ex. in this fancying way. I was infatuated with him, I loved him yes and I still care for him but I was not in love with him. You can not love someone else until you love your self, I'm learning to love myself and it isopening up a whole world of new emotions.

I just want to talk to the someone else, even if nothing happens I feel like I could connect with him on a level I donot connect with other people.

My heart is aching but I MUST stop thinking!

He probably does not like me anyway but I wish I just knew, the more I think the more hurt I will be when I find out he does not like me.
