Here's a vlog I quickly put together regarding my antepartum depression because I just couldn't fathom typing out the whole story! Lazy, or genius? I'm sorry this post is so late! I have much to update you on, so I bet more vlogs will be coming your way asap! (It's so much faster than typing and much more fun!) Excuse my messy bed. Making it wasn't a priority today. Too bad! :)
