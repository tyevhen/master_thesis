Calls

Though repeated over and over
they sound equally urgent

as if a mad ventriloquist had placed a hand
in each feathered back, egging them onward,

desperate to pierce air the way
the meadowlark embroiders wind.

Some may be calls for mates, yes,
and some for territory, but I swear

most call because they are birds
and for no other reason.

The birds are mad with joy
but they don't know it.

It takes a human mind to parse
delight behind these repetitions,

each as urgent as the last.

***********************************

Perhaps if I only wrote about things outside of myself, perhaps if I concentrated only on what is joyful, my mood would be better served than by the long analytical posts about how stuck I am. So I'll give it a shot, starting with today's little poem.
