Just a little brief of what sort of things you need, as a first mum you always pack enough for a whole months stay in the hospital. So these are roughly everything you need obviously you need to make sure there is enough clothes I.e baby grows and vests etc pack more than 4.

You don't really need to pack anything else I haven't mentioned in the list other than food and drink for yourself 😂😍
But that is basically it!
