Found 16 cents during my easy 3-miler today on my first official day of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program. Check out the Found Money File in the right sidebar of this blog. I've decided to keep track of all the cash and coins I find this year while running (or walking for exercise). At the end of the year, I'll donate the proceeds to my local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) organization. If any of my readers know how I can make this an interactive project--a place where you guys could input your found money, too--please let me know. Might be kind of fun!
