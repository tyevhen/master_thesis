She asked us, “What if you said YES to everything? What if, instead of taking yourself out by saying, ‘I can’t,’ you kept yourself connected by saying, ‘I can, or at least I’ll try?’” We were in the midst of a very difficult balancing pose at the time. Our forever hopeful, helpful, and happy yoga instructor was coolly pacing about the room of sixty sweaty, breathy bodies. She was encouraging, cajoling, and inquiring as she passed. “What if you said yes to everything?” And I thought, “Hmmmm…what if?”

What if I said yes to everything? What would happen? Or as our yogi-extraordinaire inquired, “What is the worst that could happen?” What, indeed…

If I said yes to everything, I would try more and fret less. I’d have more trials and less tribulations. I’d work more and worry less. I’d accept more risk, exert more effort, experience more failure, and enjoy more success.

If I said yes to everything, I’d explore opportunity more and fear calamity less. I’d champion challenges. I’d take advantage rather than feel disadvantaged. I’d protect my ego less and open my heart more.

If I said yes to everything, I’d love more and with more vigor than ever before. I’d be less reserved, avoidant and constrained. Life would be beautiful and bountiful not ugly and empty. Rather than reliving the past or predicting the future, I’d find this moment more than enough in which to live.

If I said yes to everything, I’d demonstrate faith rather than fear. I’d trust beyond myself and allow higher power a space within. Instead of no, never and can’t, I’d open to yes, always and can.

If I said yes to everything,
I’d know happiness,
develop serenity,
and find peace.

If I said yes to everything…
