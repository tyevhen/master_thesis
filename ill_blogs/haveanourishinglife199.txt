Prayer Against Depression

By St. Ignatius of Loyola

O Christ Jesus,
when all is darkness
and we feel our weakness and helplessness,
give us the sense of your strength.
Help us to have perfect trust
in Your protecting love and strengthening power
so that nothing may frighten or worry us,
for, living close to You,
we shall see Your hand, Your purpose,
Your will through all things. Amen.
