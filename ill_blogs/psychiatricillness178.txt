My car is sick, I have a little smart car which I bought new. I noticed that a brake light had gone so I bought a bulb, before I had time to fix it the head light went.... I bought another bulb and fitted them on Saturday.

While I was fixing those I noticed a side light had gone. I just wiggled that one and it came back on. But to change the front lights you have to take the front pannel of the car off, when I put it back together I did not tighten a small peice under the window so I lost that.

When I was cleaning the car on Saturday I noticed the carpet in the foot wells was wet. This happened last year and Mercedes charged me about £600 for new seals when it was only 3 months out of warentee.

Last night on the way home from work I drove into the back of someone on the motorway. I was in a traffic jam for over an hour and my attention started to wonder. Does not seem to be any damage to my car and I have protected no claims so no huge deal. I was only doing about 5 miles an hour.

My car is only three and a half years old and it feels like an old banger :o( !

I took my car in this morning, I rang the garage this afternoon and they said they needed to keep it for a few days, I'm on public transport for now and I am working from home on Friday as I am going to the orthadontist. I will probably have to get a taxi there though!

God knows how much all this is going to cost me. I asked today and they said they would ring me before they do any work I will have to pay for. I am hoping they will do most of it on good will as they only fixed the seals last year!

I'll keep my fingers crossed!

thursday...
My car is going to cost £1400 to fix (that's $2672)!!!
