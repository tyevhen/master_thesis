Ok so quinoa is like my new favorite thing ever! It’s a type of seed although it can be prepared just like rice. Quinoa is a complete protein, containing all eight amino acids and has been recognised by the United Nations as a supercrop for its health benefits. Whats even better is that it is so versatile that it can be eaten with almost anything!

Being a student, i’m always trying to come up with cheap, easy and QUICK meals to avoid grabbing the supernoodles or cheesy pasta out of my cupboard, so the other day me and my flatmate decided to play chef and see what tasty dish we could come up with! 

We ended up creating a sort of pepper and tomato warm quinoa salad, which actually tasted pretty nice, although next time I think adding some chorizo along with the chicken and veg would give the dish a little extra flavour! But the great thing about this recipe is that you can change it to suit you! So easy, so quick, so yummy!

Happy cooking!

(Ps, the lack of blogging was due to having no wifi for ten days, but i'm back for good now..yay!!)
