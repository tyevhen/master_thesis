I just flushed away the pills I bought the other day. I had to think about it for a little while tho'. I know you can not buy more than one box at the time. I was going to collect one box at the time until I had enough. I thought I would just start a collection incase one day I want to do it. But today I am in a good place and the depression has once again passed. I may collect some again in the future but today I don't want them in the house today...
