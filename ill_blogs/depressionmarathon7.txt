So I was minding my business the other morning, New Year's Day morning to be exact, sipping my coffee and perusing my favorite websites, when I reached across the table and dumped my coffee onto my laptop. I've been sipping coffee while perusing the web every morning for years. More than once I've thought about the possibility of doing exactly what I did, but I never changed my behavior. Perhaps I'll change it now, as I've been without a computer for the better part of a week. So I'm wishing you all a Happy New Year just a few days late.

With my luck over the whole of 2017, I figured my laptop was ruined for sure. It was an inauspicious start to the new year. I quickly soaked up the coffee with one of my super absorbent dog towels and then took a blow dryer to the keyboard. Surprisingly, when I left for work a few minutes later, my computer was working. I thought maybe my luck had turned! Unfortunately, by the time I arrived home later in the day that was not the case. I couldn't sign in. My computer was toast.

But perhaps my luck has turned. I can in no way afford a new laptop, so I took my computer to a repair shop. Of all the possibilities, up to and including my computer being toast, the diagnosis was relatively simple. I just need a new keyboard! Cleaning up the coffee immediately and thoroughly saved the important inner workings. For once, I thought, something went my way!

I'm hoping this is a sign of bigger and better things to come. Maybe my luck will turn around this year. A coworker sent me a text just after midnight, New Year's Day. It was a picture of a sign which said, "I don't make resolutions. All I want is for 2018 to be better than 2017." She thought of me, she said. It's always nice to be thought of, and I couldn't agree more! Please, 2018, be better than 2017! That's what I'm working toward today. Happy 2018, my friends!
