Hey friends!
Hope you guys enjoyed your weekend! Ours was filled with swimming, fun, and visiting family. Paige learned to jump yesterday...so she's officially walking, running, jumping, climbing and dancing! It's all happening too fast; it seems like yesterday she was a little worm in her Miracle Blanket. She's been pretty sassy today, but I love her anyway.

I wanted to share a pair of silo portraits I did recently...they were printed on fancy paper and the client framed them and hung them side-by-side. You can see the resemblance between the baby brother and his big sister. Fun!
