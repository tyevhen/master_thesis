It's been tiring, but it's also been fun to write about a new topic related to health every day, and read about other conditions that I didn't know much about before.  I'm looking forward to reading some more of the posts now that I don't have to blog every day. There are some thoughtful, well-written blogs I have discovered through this challenge - so if you want to check out posts from other people participating in the challenge, go here.

Since I didn't actually end up blogging every day about endometriosis, I've got a few good prompts saved up. So look out for posts on travelling with endometriosis, the history of endometriosis (hint, vibrators and "wandering" uteruses were involved), the pros and cons of surgery, progesterone intolerance (or why some women go crazy on the Pill) and some discussion on the perception of "invisible" illnesses by society in the coming weeks!

If you're interested, here are some other endometriosis related posts that I have written in the past that were not part of the NHBPM challenge:

Explaining Endometriosis
Pain scales: what it's like to have endometriosis
Endometriosis and feminine hygiene products: my campaign

Thanks for reading and I hope you stick around :)
