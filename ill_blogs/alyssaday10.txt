 ACAMH (Actual Conversation at my House):

Me, to Navy Guy: So, have you ever seen UFOs when you were flying?
Him: Not yet.
Me: But if you really DID and you're just lying to be part of a government conspiracy to cover it all up, you'd say no, wouldn't you?
Him:
Me: If I ever find out later that you saw an alien and didn't tell me, you're in SO MUCH TROUBLE.
Him: How would you ever find out?
Me: *dark look* I Just Would.

Happy New Year from my crazy family to yours!! xoxo Alyssa
