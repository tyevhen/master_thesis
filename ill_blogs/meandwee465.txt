She's here!
PAIGE ROSALIE CARTY

arrived yesterday on April 28th, 2009 at 2:20 pm (afternoon) after a wonderful labor (once the epidural came!).

She is 20.5 inches long and weighed in at 7 lbs. 4.5 ounces.
She is absolutely perfect!!! And she looks exactly like her daddy and has been calm, quiet, and cool as a cucumber! I'll enjoy that since it likely won't last long! (we can dream, right?)
I'll be back in a few days since I'm still at the hospital...and I'll be sure to post more photos and give you her whole birth story. Again, I LOVED that epidural!!!! I'm already married, but if I weren't, I'd consider marrying the epidural. Here are a bunch of photos from her first day so you can be properly introduced. Cheers friends! We are so grateful and thankful for your kind thoughts and loving words. We are truly SO lucky!!!!!!!!

Here I am just before we got in the car to go to the hospital...hee hee


Here I am as Paige was placed on my belly right after she came out. Sorry, it's a little bloody arm there!


Our first family portrait while I was still finishing labor (ugh).


Her first feeding with Mama!


Her first feeding again!


Family portrait!


Daddy and his little girl


She loves her Daddy!


And finally, her face (sort of) Yummy hand!!!


She's trying to focus and was looking all around. She went off for her first sponge-bath not long after this!


I hope this helps tide everyone over and that you enjoyed the photos. We took a million but wanted to show you some favorites. As for her hair, she's business in the front and party in the back with light brown fuzz on top and then it's much longer and brown in the back and sides. Very cute! And I'm biased, I know. :)
See you soon friends! And thank you again for all your love.
