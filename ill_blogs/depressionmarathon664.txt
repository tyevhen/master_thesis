Is it June already? Unbelievable!
I had orientation at my new job today. I liked the feel of the place. I begin working there in a couple of weeks.
Late next week I am going to visit my parents in Northeastern Wisconsin. They are staying at a campground there for the entire summer. I'm really looking forward to fishing with them!
I love fishing!
Puck has a bad tooth and needs to have surgery early next week. I hate putting him under anesthesia, but the tooth seems to be bothering him so it's got to be done.
I put Puck on a new anti-inflammatory called Metacam. He was hobbling a bit on an arthritic right wrist and dropping behind while we ran. He seems to be moving with more ease and comfort already, and it's only been 4 days.
Grandma's Marathon is only 16 days away.
I had a difficult run this morning. My legs were really dead. I think I'll take tomorrow off. I have to run 15 miles this weekend before the serious tapering begins.
A large group of local runners are going to run Grandmas together at a very sensible pace while honoring our fallen friend, Paul. I'm torn, as I've trained hard with the intent of running it fast. In memory of Paul, we are all wearing shirts with his picture as well.
I've been thinking about making myself available to speak about depression, running, and/or depression and running. I'd advertise my services on this blog. Not sure there would be any interest...just thinking for now.
The hospital and its aftermath were not kind to my waistline. I've gained back about 4 or 5 of the pounds I had lost since last fall. I'm working on losing again.
I have no idea how to end a post like this.
Thank you for reading.
