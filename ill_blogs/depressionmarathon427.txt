I've got a few questions for you. I half-jokingly suggested in a previous post that perhaps my 12+ year ordeal with depression had ended. I don't really believe that, but it got me thinking. What would the end of depression look like? What would it mean to be healed? And how would I know it was over?

I've been feeling well for a few months now. I saw my psychiatrist today, and we had little to discuss. That's always nice. Life is moving forward. Work is fulfilling. I have energy to spare. Running is fun and satisfying. I have meaningful and enjoyable relationships with others. I'm connected to my community and to the world. Does a few months of things going so well mean it's over?

I have no idea if it's over, of course, and truthfully, I spend little to no time thinking about it. I live each day as it presents itself. Worrying about the past or fretting about the future are endeavors on which I cannot afford to waste valuable energy. I figure it would take a few years of feeling well before I'd be comfortable claiming I'm cured. But it is an intriguing question, isn't it?

What would it take for you to feel free of your illness? How would you know it was over? What would it mean to be healed? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
