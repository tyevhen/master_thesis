 HOL-Y-CR-AP LADIES LISTEN UP! This is a beauty revelation you are not going to want to miss!

Around a week or so ago I popped into Boots to pick up some makeup wipes and, as usual, I got distracted and ended up having a wander up and down the makeup aisles. I usually refrain from going over to the  "high end" makeup section as I am weak, the girls are persuasive, and I end up spending a fortune! But I noticed an unmanned Benefit counter so decided to go over and have a look myself. At first I thought about treating myself to a new bronzer, but then remembered a girl from work telling me how amazing their Watts Up! highlighter is - and as soon as she mentioned it's a favourite of celebs such as Millie MacKintosh, I knew I had to get my hands on it!

 Watts Up! (£24.50) is a champagne hued cream-to-powder highlighter that’s designed to work on all complexions. Now, i've tried many highlighters over the years but NOTHING compares to this one! It glides on effortlessly and is so easy to blend thanks to the little domed sponge that comes on the opposite end of the stick. It sits well over makeup, not looking thick or cakey, as well as looking great on bare skin. The glow this product gives to your face is unbelievable - it just adds that little something extra that you think your face is missing but can never figure out what! You can see from the swatches above how nicely it sits on the cheekbones without making the underneath makeup separate and look "bitty" on the skin (like I find High Beam can do)

I could rave about this product for hours on end, definitely a 10/10 and my new makeup staple which will be taken with me wherever I go!
