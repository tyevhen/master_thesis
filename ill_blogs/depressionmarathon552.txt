I have an interview with a director today. The director is in New York City, and he's looking for people to cast in a video about depression success stories. Can you believe that? Me. I have a chance to do exactly what I intend to do when writing this blog, speaking publicly, or running a marathon. Educate. Educate. Educate. Depression is an illness like no other, but it is an illness, and it is possible to live life fully despite it. This is the chance of a lifetime. I couldn't be more excited!

This opportunity came about because of this blog. I received a comment from one of the people working on the project right after I returned from running The Boston Marathon on Monday. She had recently discovered my blog and thought I might be the right person for their project. I was honored by her comment and anxious to hear about the project, so I called her immediately.

The more she told me about the video, the more excited I became. She was a little disappointed I didn't live in the NYC area, as was I, because I couldn't go in for casting, which I think is taking place right now. Thankfully, she was willing to talk to her director about doing this first step over Skype. If I make it through the first cut, I'll have to fly to New York to continue forward with the process.

Like I said, this is a huge opportunity, and I couldn't be more excited! I hope I have what it takes to participate. I don't know what that is, exactly, but I hope I have it. I'd cherish the opportunity.
