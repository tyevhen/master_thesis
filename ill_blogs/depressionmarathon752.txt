I went snooping around on Facebook the other day. Bad idea. I discovered my ex apparently has twin baby boys. The ex and I had talked about having kids. We had planned to have kids. At this point in our lives, we would have had kids together. If only all had gone according to plan.

As we all know, plans don't always work out. If they did, I wouldn't have spent the last ten years of my life battling mental illness. I would have been pursuing multiple dreams instead, including the dream of having children. But the best laid plans...

I don't have kids. I'm too old now to tempt fate, and I don't have a partner anyway. So children are likely not in my future. It's my biggest regret. The fact that my ex continued along the path we had set, without me, stings.

This discovery has me suffering industrial strength sadness. I've cried more tears in the past few days than I have in the past year. The depth and intensity of my sadness caught me off guard. I'm sad. Very, very sad.

There is a hole in my heart. It is a hole which will likely never be filled. Perhaps it's been there all along, and this discovery brought it into my awareness. I feel like I am grieving. I guess I am grieving. I'm grieving for what will never be--children, my own children.

There is a hole in my heart, and I am sad.
