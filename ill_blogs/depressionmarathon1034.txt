so, so tired today. not sure what's going on...nothing probably, although i do have a bit of a sore throat. in bed by 7pm last night. in bed a lot of the day today. supposed to run a speed workout today, but besides therapy this morning, i haven't been able to get out of the house. i think my mood is okay. i think. my body just won't go. it just won't go at all. i'm still hoping to get out for maybe a short run this evening. if i don't run, i think puck may go nuts! of course, if this continues i'll be right there with him!
