It's funny. Looking at my triathlon training schedule for the week, I'm not overwhelmed this morning. In fact, I'm thinking, "Oh, this isn't so bad." That's when I started chuckling. My classmates and I are scheduled for nine hours of training this week. Two weeks ago, we had our first nine hour training week, and I was overwhelmed. Last week I trained for ten hours, and I was overwhelmed. Now I'm scheduled for nine hours again, and I'm relieved. It's all a matter of perspective, isn't it?

Interestingly, I've found the same with depression. Depression's pain is also subject to my perspective. At the top of a downhill slide, I tolerate less pain less well than I do once I'm climbing back up. If I'm used to feeling well, a little discomfort can feel overwhelming and scary. Yet that same level of discomfort may feel joyous and relieving if it occurs after a long period of hopelessness and pain. Once again, I find my athletic experiences uniquely correlate with my mental illness. That's interesting.

I wonder if that correlation helps me deal with training, helps me deal with depression, or both? I think it's probably both. Sometimes when I'm running through a tough spot, as I was during the Richmond Marathon in November, I think surviving depression helps me persevere. Knowing I've survived through hopelessness and pain in life has helped me put one foot in front of the other when running. At the same time, although I probably call on it less often, I think persevering through tough runs has reminded me to persevere through hopeless moments of depression. It seems silly, but it's true. I think we have to use whatever we can to get us through. I use training to get me through life, and I use life to get me through training.

I wonder. What do you use to get you through your tough days?
