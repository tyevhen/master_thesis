Several days, no post. Oops. I don't really want to do a post for every day, so instead I'll just make a random list of things I did in the last few days:
Wrote the reviews that were due for the magazine I write for
Discussed (online and with friends and family) anarcho-primitivism and direct action
Discussed (online) education, the educational system, and how it could be improved, with an education specialist
Watched a fascinating video of a lecture by this anarcho-primitivism guy called Derrick Jensen, who's books I am now reading (http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=derrick+jensen&sitesearch=#)
Listened to lots of music with tin whistles in it
Found out where to buy tin whistles and made plans to get one
Sat and soaked up the beautiful outdoors
Took a series of photo's of a spider in it's web
Watched lots of stuff from the Olympics
Greeted a friend who just returned home
Went for brisk (and pretty long!) walks two days in a row
Wrote a poem, which can be found at my poetry blog www.art-is-expressions.blogspot.com
Pulled a million burs off of the stupid dog
Danced around excitedly
So, a pretty good week. I'm still super exited about life in general, I'm still uber exited about camp, and that's about all I feel is important to say right now!
