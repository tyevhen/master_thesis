I've been awake since 3am and got laods of work done. I think my mood is finally turning! I hope it lasts.

I know it's not a very sensible thing to get up at 3am and this maybe the start of a hypo period, but who cares!!! I feel better!!! That is the important thing as the depression was getting me down!!!

I'll tell my psychiatrist tomorrow.
