After about two years of being miserable at work I have finally found the courage to move on.  I will be leaving a job which for the first seven years I loved.  It is quite scary but I am convinced I am doing the right thing.

On the morning of the interview for my new job I was feeling extremely low and did not want to get out of bed.  I forced myself as I had been head hunted by a former colleague and I did not want to let him down.  I am so glad I made the effort. I am comfortable with the decision I have made this time and I have no nagging doubts.

I have handed in my notice and since I have done so I feel lighter and happier.  I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  I am now working my notice. My last day will be 24 December.  On New years eve I leave on holiday for three weeks and on my return I start a new job.

The only downside is I am likely to have to find a new psychiatrist.  At the moment I see my psychiatrist privately through insurance provided by my current company.  Although my new contract includes private medical care it will not cover psychiatric care for any condition lasting more than two years.  I will have to try the NHS.

I don't want to be ill in my new job!!!
