Sometimes I have to be sad
In the dark
In a ball on my bed crying

Sometimes my breath is all I am sensing
In my chest
In the moments between nothing

Sometimes the quiet becomes haunting
Yet whispers
To tell of my soul's wanting

Sometimes I think how sad follows loving
And I sigh
To know the deep down feeling

Sometimes when the reminders keep me hurting
I stop
I feel the loss and stop thinking

Sometimes a softness envelops my being
I relax
And for a moment I am dreaming

Sometimes a light breaks in shining
For a second
And reminds me that it is ok to keep living

Sometimes I find courage and start moving
I hesitate
Then take a step forward again toward hoping

And

Sometimes I have to be sad
In light of my love
To honor that which I will always be missing

Sometimes I have to be sad
