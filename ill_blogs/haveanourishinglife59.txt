Feelings can be very deceptive.  In the troughs of difficult feelings, it can be challenging to stay grounded in reality.  When my anxiety is high or my depression unchecked, I have very low self-worth and often let the verbal abuse run rampant in my head.

In order to defeat the lies that seem like the truth at the time, I post positive phrases around my house or memorize them in order to repeat their truth over and over again.

Right now, some of my favorites are:

“Today a little work; tomorrow eternal rest.” – from the book, My Sisters the Saints, by Colleen Carol Campbell.

Feelings are NOT facts.

I am loved despite my faults and failures.

“Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.” – Mary Anne Radmacher

Lots of people struggle with depression like I do.  I am not alone in my pain and suffering.

“I do not have to do great things, only small things with great love.” – Mother Teresa of Calcutta

I can’t hate my way into loving myself.

“No one can make me feel inferior without my consent.” – Eleanor Roosevelt

I need love the most when I feel I deserve it the least.

It’s OK to ask for help.
