So, I've been busy with some smaller crocheting projects. Actually they were both projects that started out of necessity.


1. I started crocheting playfood to give as birthday gifts a few months back. I love handmade gifts. I know that not everyone appreciates them, but I find a gift made by someone's hands and with their precious time is often a gift filled with love and thought.


2. My dishcloths were in such a sorry, threadbare, stained state that I really felt the necessity to replace some of them.


Hence, I started crocheting the playfood and found it so much fun that I made some more for Lily as well as for some of my friends' children.


And then I started having fun making all kinds of different colored dishcloths. Did you know that it's so much more fun to wash dishes when you're using a pretty dishcloth? Really, it is!


Anyway, I've been trying to tuck some time for crocheting into my days here and there. Admittedly, it's going to become more difficult to find the time as it gets nicer outside and the outdoor work consumes most of my extra minutes. But until then I'll happily stitch along. It's therapy for my soul! (And I've also been fighting the crazy idea of opening an etsy shop. You know, with all the extra time I have! ) : )

Have a great weekend!
