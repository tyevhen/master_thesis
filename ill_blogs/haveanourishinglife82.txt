Considering it’s that time of year when we count our blessings, it’s worth noting the main things that have helped me get better this past year.  In a short answer...I have to say, Craig.

I am so Thankful for my husband.

I was talking with him recently and we both came up with a several key components that have aided in my recovery.  He had a few things that helped him, helped him help me, and helped our marriage.

So, whether you are personally struggling with depression and anxiety, or you want to help a loved one, maybe you will be able to benefit from his advice.

Craig’s Points:
Communication, Communication, Communication:  We talked about everything – and I mean everything.  We still talk on a regular basis.

Helped get the ball rolling with the initial step to find a counselor

Talked with and got guidance from a man whose wife deals with the same issues

Doing own research online and gaining a fearful respect for the disease

Wanting to see things get better

Prayer and sacrificing own wants at times

Learning to recognize when to just listen – it’s not about the nail

Realizing it can’t be “fixed”

Continued patience and sacrifice

Recognizing that this will always be a struggle to some extent – there will be good days and bad days.  It is a long journey, have to be in it for the long hull.

Being committed to our marriage in good times and in bad
