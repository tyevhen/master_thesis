I've had some people asking for an update. I know that I am not the best at posting on a regular basis. Its not that I don't care, but rather I don't want to put lame posts up that were created just so I can say I posted. I want the quality of posts to be better than the quantity if that makes sense. This means when my anxiety is up, usually I have more posts, and when my anxiety isn't really bothering me much, than my post count goes down. Just more proof that anxiety comes and goes like a roller coaster.

Lately, I haven't been having many issues with my anxiety. I think I am in a good place right now with my pregnancy. The beginning of the pregnancy didn't help out with my anxiety like I thought it would, but I think by the second trimester eventually my hormones leveled off to a good place :) I am due in about a month and it will be interesting to see if I continue to do well while nursing or if the anxiety returns.

Some of the best life lessons can be found in simple childrens' stories, songs, and poems. So here are a couple fun quotes from the best children authors to help you through the day:

 “Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.”
-Shel Silverstein
 "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind." - Dr. Suess

Hope everyone is doing well!
