Yes, well apparently the wild things are in my house.

The kids found a baby cottontail rabbit in our back field yesterday. One of our dogs had gotten a hold of it. Besides being covered in saliva, it seemed to be all in one piece. We couldn't locate the rabbit nest so my kids brought it into our nest.

Of course, the kids were elated at this opportunity as we just finished reading The Green Ember last week!

I did some research and found that if they still have the little white "blaze" on their forehead, they are too young to be left alone in the wilderness. I could not, in good conscious, let this little furry ball of cute be put back out in the frigid temps (it snowed here again, people) and especially knowing that it was absolutely too young to make it on its own.

So I found a recipe for milk replacement for wild rabbits, and we mixed some up. Thankfully, I had a syringe that I had washed and saved so we used that to feed the rabbit the milk.

Lily has taken on the role of surrogate mother, and she is fulfilling her duty quite well. She's feeding it, massaging its belly (that is supposed to help its digestion), talking to it, reassuring it, making sure it stays warm (we filled a couple of old socks up with beans and are heating them up and putting them under the towel in the box to keep him/her warm and cozy.)

Oh, she's in her element, this daughter of mine.

And, of course, Brad and I didn't argue with any of this. Why would we? We're past that by now.We just chalk this things up to wonderful learning experiences and wonderful ways to teach our children to care for God's creation.
