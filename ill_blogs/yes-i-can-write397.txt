I never thought I'd say this, but I'm not sure what to blog about! I seem to go in stages. For weeks I'll blog only about day-to-day stuff, only lightly touching on political beliefs/causes. And then all I'll write about is politics for weeks on end! So I'm asking my few readers (I know I don't have many, but you guys keep me writing regularly, so thank you very much :-)), what do you think I should blog about? Keep blogging about political stuff? More photography? Should I talk more about my day-to-day life as an unschooler? Something entirely different? If no one has any ideas or particular preferences, that's cool too. I'll probably think about something I want to write about in a day or two. But if you do have some ideas, that's awesome! Thank a bunch. :-)

Peace,
Idzie
