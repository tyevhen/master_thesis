I just found out I made another top blog list. The site onlinenursepractitionerschools.com included Depression Marathon in their list of Top 100 Recovery Sites. Specifically, I am number 3 on the list of top 10 alcoholic blogs--i.e. a blog written by someone in recovery from alcohol. I am, as usual, humbled and honored to be included in any list of top blogs. Thanks to the editors of onlinenursepractitionerschools.com for including me in their list of some very fine blogs. Use the link above to check out their other selections.
