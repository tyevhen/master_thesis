A while ago now, I asked the people of twitter what their mental illness journey has taught them. The responses are as follows:

"Taught me that I'm stronger than I ever realised. Fought my way back. I'm not 100% ok but I'm a long way from where I was."

"My mental health has taught me to understand myself and be patient with myself. Not to judge by others standards."

"To accept that is is ok to not be ok and to not rush through recovery but allow time to heal you."

"There is nothing 'wrong' with me and I don't need to be 'fixed'. Support and time helped me so much."

"Never give up because things do eventually get better, it will take time, but you will have happy days eventually."

"Take it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. It's okay to feel this way. It WILL get better."

"I've become a more sensitive, caring and patient individual."

"Used to think people with mental illness were just in need of attention. Now I know for sure it needs attention!"

My mental illness journey has taught me resilience; that although we feel that we cannot live for another moment, the strength we all hold is immense. It's taught me that a support network is key, and  who really is there for me in my times of need. It's taught me that getting help for mental health is hard, but the continued search is definitely worth it. I am not alone and attitudes are changing on a daily basis, to an outlook that is more positive.
