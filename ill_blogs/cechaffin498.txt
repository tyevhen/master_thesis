It's hard to be aware of what people come here for. For the narrative? For a poem? I've looked at traffic and I can't figure it out. I don't blog in response to traffic but I wonder if I have a steady readership that skips the narrative for a poem or vice-versa. I should think more come here for the narrative as few delight in poetry. I don't write for poets either. I write for the discipline of writing. If I practice no other writing today, at the least I can blog.

I don't think therefore that curiosity is over and experiments no longer in vogue. So here's my experiment, begun at 9 PM August 30. I'm going to post what I think is a very good poem and also timely in view of the morass in Iraq. With three hours left tonight, only 16 have graced this site today. Let's see what happens, shall we?

I'll report tomorrow.

At the Vietnam War Memorial

Black granite stretches its harsh, tapering wings
up to pedestrian-level grass
but sucks me down, here, at the intersection of names.
I forgive, I must, though I wish something
could heal this wound in the earth.

Behold, all theorists, the price of theory:
extreme unction by napalm and blood,
vets shipped home whole or in pieces:
The VA grants prostheses
but not minds free of horror.

In jungles tumescent, through villages
of straw, by the Mekong where catfish
sleep in mud-heaven, we tramped,
disarming mines and flushing tunnels,
killing women and children
for potential collaboration,
smoking Thai-stick until stuporousâ€”
still, the sound of Charlie
played on every frond.

Beat against this polished rock, America,
this vast projective surface for your sins,
wear your bloody heart out.
It's not how many died
but that they died in vain, achieving
nothing except our grief for them.

It's said you cannot write a good poem
until recollected in tranquility.
Let this then be a bad poem, bad as the war,
dividing author from reader and reader from page.
Let it drive a wedge between fathers and sons.
Let fathers mistake rebellion for disloyalty,
let sons mistake honor for stupidity,
let senators mistake appropriation for commitment,
let mothers confuse waste with sacrifice,
let sisters turn to prostitution to forget.

Let teachers suicide in public in partial recompense,
let preachers castrate themselves for passive assent,
let everything in America that breathes
hang its head in irrefragable shame.
Here is the legacy of your assumptions,
here the necropolis of your dark-suited wisdom:
A city set in a pit cannot be hid.



OK, the experiment begins now. We'll check again in 24 hours.
