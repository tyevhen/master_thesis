I have a news addiction.


OK well maybe addiction is a strong word, I just really enjoy reading the news, I enjoy more the comments sections for the stories online.

Lately I have been seriously disturbed by various news stories.  Maybe the world has always been like this and we were just blissfully unaware.  Or maybe it is actually getting worst.

It seems like our society is loosing it's sense of compassion.  A a group we seem to be reverting more and more to our animal selves, where need and greed wipes out our humanity.

Having studies criminology and the history of crime and our legal system, I know that humans have always been able of horrible acts of depravity.  Throughout history there have been specimens of humans which do unbelievable things, such as Elizabeth Bathory, Ted Bundy, the doctors who experimented on concentration camp prisoners and so many more, but generally these were individuals, or group directed by an individual.

Lately I read these types of stories:

* Stories about a swarm of people beating a pregnant woman on Toronto streets. Toronto Sun Story

* Stories about people walking over a man who had died in order to get some good deals on Black Friday. Glenn Beck Story

* A child run over by a truck and no one assisting.  New York Post Story

* A heroic homeless man, stabbed after saving a Queens woman from a knife-wielding attacker, lay dying in a pool of blood for more than an hour as nearly 25 people indifferently strolled past him. New York Post Story

Really?  Ignore a dying man in order to get the latest Harry Potter movie at a great price?  Having the latest gizmo and gadgets for a good price is more important than a human life? 

This explains a great many things in society.  This explains "unfriending" someone because they are depressed rather than offering assistance.  As a society we are ill, truly ill if these are our values!

This disturbs me greatly!


Well thanks for reading...
