This just in: One of my friends texted me with an invitation to go out and see a band play tonight. Do I go? I know I shouldn't, but I'd really like to. I will consider the temptation by evaluating my thesis progress.

Chapter 1: COMPLETE
Chapter 2: Need to make adviser's revisions
Chapter 3: written 1 of 40-50 pages **** DUE in 7 DAYS*******
Chapter 4: unwritten

So, seeing that I'm more or less screwed. Maybe I'll study for a couple hours and then go out?
