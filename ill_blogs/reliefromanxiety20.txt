I have been writing this blog anonymously for over four years and I do often think about revealing a picture of myself, but I can't just yet. I have absolutely no problem in talking about my mental illness. I have told employers, the whole internet and people who want to know. Of course, I don't just go up to people and tell them but only if they ask or if it were to come up in conversation. The depth of detail that I go into also depends on the circumstances. However even after four years of sharing my journey with the world, I still haven't shared a picture of myself or a youtube video. This is not because I am ashamed of my illness - far from it. It is because of my planned future job in which I am disclosing my mental health and have done in work experience in the field. The job I am applying for cannot be associated with being known and recognised by many people. Perhaps if I am given the all clear to do this, I would be more than happy to do so but until that point, in spite of my dream career and giving it all that I've got I will have to remain anonymous for now. I'm hoping the big reveal won't be too far away!
