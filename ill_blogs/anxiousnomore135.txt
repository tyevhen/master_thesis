I needed to hear this so maybe someone else will benefit as well:

You Can't Please Everyone
by allinspiration.com
You may be generally an amiable and pleasant person. You may generally get along well with most people. But somehow, there is that one family member, that one friend, that one colleague, who doesn't take to you very well.
This might disappoint you, sadden you, or even disillusion you. Don't allow it to.
Every single person is unique. Every single relationship is different. Somewhere, somehow, there will be people who don't quite get along.
If you allow yourself to adjust your personal values, to change the person that you are, just to win over that one person or few people, you run the risk of adversely affecting the good relationships you do have.
Be positive. Focus on your happy relationships. At the same time, accept that there will be ones that don't go so well. Whatever you say or do, whoever you are, whatever character or personality you have, you won't be able to please everyone.
