500


This is my 500th post on Depression Marathon. Wow. I began writing a little less than two years ago. I never envisioned this thing getting this far. I feel like I should say something really profound or symbolic, but I don't have anything like that in mind. Maybe simpler words are good enough. Wow.

I'm pleased, proud, and grateful. I started this blog to educate and support others about mental illness. Instead, I've received so much support from my readers, it's no wonder I'm feeling better than ever. Thank you. I'd like to continue as long as you'll continue to read. I will continue as long as I have something meaningful to say. Thank you for the opportunity to be a tiny part of your days.

By the way, I do have some profoundly good news. Puck's biopsy revealed a benign gingival (gums) tumor. It will likely come back, and if it does so aggressively, it will have to be more completely removed. Right now, I'm just watching the spot. If it comes back, I pray it will be a slow, non-aggressive tumor. I really don't want Puck to go through another surgery. He's been through enough. I'm very, very thankful he doesn't have cancer. Thanks for your prayerful thoughts.
