Just been to the pub. I had to come home because I could not stop shaking. I'm definitely unstable and I do not think I will ge to work this week. I am sitting next to my mother and she has no idea how shaky and unwell I am. She still denies there is anything wrong with me.

I am not sharing my blog incase I decide to end it all. No one will take that decision from me! I will not allow it! I have no definitive plans at the moment!

NO ONE WILL TAKE AWAY THE LITTLE CONTROL I HAVE!! I WILL NOT ALLOW IT!!!!
