We won the nursery contest! Thanks so much for all of your votes and your time! I've never won anything before...it feels great! I'm so excited that Little P will have a photoshoot that will commemorate her first year of life and in her own happy room.
Thanks again for your votes.
Many hugs!
And, just because, here is a photo of Paige in her most relaxed mode. Must be nice!
