Hi friends!
Happy Monday! Chris let me have most of the weekend "off" so that I could get out and have some alone time. It was fabulous! On Saturday, I started my first sewing lesson. I've been dying to learn to sew and a wonderful woman who lives in the next town over teaches classes. We're making a basic skirt. I learned a lot but am still wondering how I'll ever remember how to thread the darned machine...the bobbin part is confusing to me. It doesn't help that my short-term memory is HORRIBLE. I see a lot of practice in my future. I'm excited though!
Sunday was spent getting a massage and then off to do some shopping to replace clothes that no longer fit. On your advice, I hit up Forever 21 for some trendy things and then my favorite Banana Republic and JCrew for jeans and basic shirts (things were on big-time sale, so that was a good reason too). It was a nice break to go out and about and not worry about rushing home for nap time or worrying about anything. Thanks Chris! You're the best!!! As always, I was happy to come home to you both.
Here's a photo of Paige and me at the start of the weekend; I look like poo, but it was first thing in the morning and Paige was smiley. :)
