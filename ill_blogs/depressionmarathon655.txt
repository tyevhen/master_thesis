Yesterday was my second official day of work, and it went better than day number one. I treated more patients, which is always easier. Patients don't change much from job to job. It's the paperwork that's always tough to digest. I did have more paperwork yesterday, too, but it seemed to go slightly better than Wednesday. I'm still worried about stuffing all the information into my resistant brain, but I'll just have to keep cramming.

The bigger issue yesterday was my confidence, or I should say my lack of confidence. And I think that is directly related to my depression relapse. I don't feel confident that I'll learn everything. I don't feel confident that I can handle the stress of working. I don't feel confident in my PT skills. I worry I won't know how to treat my patients. I worry working will knock me flat. I worry I'll never understand all the policies and procedures. I didn't feel this lack of confidence prior to the most recent relapse. It makes for a stressful day, and I can only hope that it gets better with time. I think it will.

One area where my confidence isn't lacking, however, is my running. I returned to the road on Thursday, and I felt great! I ran a 6 mile, fast, tempo run Thursday afternoon. I was thrilled to feel so good after running a marathon just a few days before. Today, I got up early and ran a 13 mile long run. Again, I felt pretty good. My legs got tired near the end, but not bad after running a marathon only 7 days ago! I think I'm still basking in the glow of Grandma's. I think I'll hang onto that glow as long as it continues to drive me forward.

March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path.--Khalil Gibran
