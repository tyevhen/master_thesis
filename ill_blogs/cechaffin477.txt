Yesterday I posted this as a proem, or prose-poem, something I generally avoid. With the help of those who commented, today I recast it as a poem with the former version below it. If you have the time, can you tell me which version you think is better?


Sensing Trees

A redwood’s autumn is not as dramatic
as that of a deciduous tree
if you prefer color to sound--
which brings to mind
the old question of whether
it’s better to be deaf or blind.
Blind is the answer a wise man gave me.
Does that mean communication
is more vital than safety?

The redwoods ply the edge
of an expanding continent
like icebreakers. When wind strikes,
their spent fronds fall
like missiles pelleting the roof,
each frond a lost church
with needles for pews.

Dead fronds lace my deck
like fish skeletons gone pale rust--
rigid millipedes with neeedles for legs.
Though acidic and hard to mulch
the needles are members in good standing
because they never desert the frond.
Remember the blind vs. deaf question?
Would you rather hear or see the redwoods?
Easy one. What about as an infant with your mother?
