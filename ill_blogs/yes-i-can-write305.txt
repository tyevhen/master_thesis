I've been asked fairly frequently for links to other teenage and grown unschoolers blogs, so I decided to put a bunch of links together in one post!  I try to keep this list updated with current blogs, so I add new ones as I discover them and remove blogs that are no longer active.

Eli Gerzon's Worldschooler Blog Eli is a grown unschooler from Boston who blogs about unschooling, worldschooling, and travel, as well as leading Worldschool Travel Tours.

Follow That Dream is a blog by Elisha, a grown unschooler who blogs about a variety of subjects, including unschooling.

College Rebellion is a website and blog by Jessica, a grown unschooler, who writes about uncolleging, travel, goal setting, finding employment, and similar interesting things.

Brighter Than a Buoy is a blog by grown unschooler and terrific songwriter Carsie Blanton.

If you're a teenage or grown unschooler who has a blog, or if you know of a teenage or grown unschooler who has one, just let me know and I'll add it to the list!
