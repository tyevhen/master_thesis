I'm in trouble.
I'm tired.
I'm lethargic.
I could care less
about running
or goals.
I couldn't go yesterday.
Today doesn't seem different.
And I don't care...that's the trouble.

I don't care.
Not a good place for me to be.
Trouble.
I don't care is unsafe.
I don't care is frustrating...no it's not.
Frustration would require caring,
and I don't care.
Trouble.

I don't care is unsafe.
I don't care is heavy and stuck.
I don't care is sleep and sleep some more.
I don't care is restricting.
leaden
shackles
binding
my
feet
I can't move...that's the trouble.

I can't move is trouble.
I can't move is sickening
fattening
frustrating.
I can't move is frustrating.
Frustration is trouble.

I'm in trouble.
Trouble is trouble.

Trouble drinks.
Trouble cuts.
Trouble thinks.
Trouble hurts.
Trouble sinks.
