I find it fascinating that anxiety affects everyone in different ways and everyone has different triggers to which their anxiety is at its worst. As a way of trying to break the stigma, I thought I would share a list of things that triggers my anxiety the most. Luckily most of these won't result in a panic attack like it used to, but my anxiety can still rise:

1. Anything with a severe risk of failure! (i.e. a job, a club)

2. Eating out at restaurants

3. Being on stage

4. Food (In particular food without sell by dates, or best before, most cooked foods)

5. Loss of control (i.e. an upset with friends or family)

What are yours? Please let me know in the comments!
