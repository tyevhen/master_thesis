I thought it only fitting to end the wild month of April with an actual photo, taken April 6, 2008, of two actual deer in a backyard in Togo, Minnesota. Togo is in the northeast part of the state near Duluth, MN. The deer, and everyone else in Togo, recently received 32 inches of snow!
Hmmm...Does anyone else recognize this feeling? Or is it just me?
