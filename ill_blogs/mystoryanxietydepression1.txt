I am sad to say that the lady that helped me, who touched my life, gave me hope and spent so much time helping me died suddenly a few days ago. She was too young to be taken... I remember our last conversation a week ago, we were talking about life and I was mentioning sometimes I don't understand the purpose of life etc.. and she said with a smile we are here for the experience to enjoy and love. I remember her calming office with candles, water fountain and pictures and quotes on her walls. It was not like any other office soon as you walked in you felt calm and at home. It just felt amazing to be in her company, I always looked forward to seeing her and sitting on her comfy chair and Jan in hers and just talk over tea, she was an amazing lady who taught me so much and gave me so much hope.... I am sad that I had a thank you card for her and never got to give it to her....I will always remember her there isn't too many people that give so much and love helping people like she did. I am sure she has left many people who she has touched she was just that type of person, our angel.
