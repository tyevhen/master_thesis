I'm feeling tired today. I am right in the middle of my triathlon training program, and I'm scheduled for 9 hours of workouts this week, 9.5 next week, and 9 more the following week. From that point, the workouts decrease as I get closer to triathlon day. So I'm feeling tired.

As my time working out has increased, fitting the workouts in around work has become more difficult. Yesterday I biked before work, at 5:30 AM, and did the strength circuit at 8 PM. I got a quick nap in after work. Tomorrow will be similar. I have an hour of swimming intervals before work and then the strength circuit again afterward. The current schedule calls for at least 1.5 to 2 hours of training each day. No wonder I'm feeling tired.

Fortunately, all this training does seem to be making a difference. I'm re-discovering muscles I haven't seen since college volleyball! My jeans fit better, and I believe I can see some abdominal muscles again! I've also noticed I'm tolerating the workouts better. That is, I can go faster and longer while using less energy than I did a few weeks ago. This all makes feeling tired right now a little more tolerable. The training seems to be working.

So far my work has not suffered from my workout fatigue, but I'm getting a little nervous that it will soon. Getting up at 4:30ish, working out, driving 50 minutes to work, working 8 hours, driving 50 minutes home, and then working out again is getting a little overwhelming. Yet, I'm doing it so far. That continues to surprise me. Hopefully, I can maintain until we start tapering. Boy am I looking forward to that!
