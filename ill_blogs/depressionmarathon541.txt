Go figure. Since I announced I was leaving my current job, the previously crabby, self-absorbed, negative management team has been nothing but kind and cooperative. In fact, yesterday, the owner even complimented me on my evaluation skills and thorough documentation. He's never said a kind word about my performance in the past! He's never said a negative word either. I had no idea he was paying any attention whatsoever. It's all very weird. I'll still be happy to get out of there, but it does make me question why now? I didn't think they had it in them to be kind or cooperative. At least their new found behavior will make my last two weeks there slightly more tolerable.

Perhaps not coincidentally, my mood has been good. This is in spite of lowering one of my meds a couple weeks ago, and despite lots of new activity in my life. I do have a lot going on right now - dating, a new job, an upcoming marathon. I'm happy to be handling the extra stress, albeit good stress, without a major dip. Life is rolling right along, and I'm happy to be on the ride.

I'm looking forward to my marathon on Sunday. I ran an easy 4 miles today. My normal route took me onto part of the marathon course. Miles 22 and 23 were already marked on the path. I took the opportunity to visualize and mentally rehearse feeling good during those miles. It was pretty cool. I hope I feel on Sunday as good as I felt today when passing those mile markers.

Unfortunately, the weather forecast for Sunday is anything but cool. The last I looked, the projected temperature was 88 degrees with a 15 mile per hour south wind! It may be Boston all over again. I'm praying as hard as I can pray that the forecast will be incorrect. Please, God, not again! Like so many other things in this universe, weather is out of my control, but I'm going to keep praying anyway. Join me, won't you?
