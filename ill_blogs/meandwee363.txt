Each day Paige likes to go around the living room and take out all her toys and spread them all around. She has to dump out every single board book too. This photo is just one little spot. I can promise the rest of the room looked just like that. It can get dangerous for me at certain moments...I find myself tripping or slipping on the debris. She sure does love her books! She loves coming upon one and trying to turn all the pages herself. It's definitely what she spends the most time doing. Soon I'll do posts here and there about what her favorite books are (and they aren't what I thought they'd be!)
