I'm supposed to be at work right now. Unfortunately, I spent much of the night awake with a sore throat, headache and body aches. I do believe I am getting sick. I hate being sick. I especially hate being sick one week prior to my next marathon. Hmmm...perhaps God really is trying to tell me something.

Speaking of sick, my orthopedic doctor called in sick on Friday. Therefore, I did not get to have my knee evaluated. I'm pretty sure I have a torn meniscus in there, but I need him to confirm that and to get the ball rolling to recovery ( i.e. cut it out). Fortunately, I was able to reschedule the appointment for this Wednesday, so I don't have too long to wait to see him. I'm going to see what he says about running vs. not running the marathon next week.

My friend, Kate, will be coming into town for the marathon. This will be the fifth marathon we will be doing together in the last year and a half. I'm looking forward to seeing her and showing off my home state. I just wish I was in better shape myself. Oh well, whether I run or not, I know she will enjoy herself.

Well, my head is pounding. I guess it's time to lie back down. I've gotta get my rest. I've got no time to waste!
