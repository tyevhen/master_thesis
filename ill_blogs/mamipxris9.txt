Mona√® is 16 weeks (tomorrow) and I have always co-slept.

So many people have different views on co-sleeping, but personally I love it.
I think I began to love it because I was breastfeeding and it was easier to just pop her back into my bed once she had finished.

I also found that she sleeps so much better when I'm next to her, I can put her crib next to my bed and lay her in it and she just won't settle. I definitely think that if you breastfeed your baby becomes very attached to you and always want to be around you and as close to you as possible.

It's 50/50 with co-sleeping.
Some say you will seriously regret it as it will be hard to get them out of your bed when they're older but I don't see the stress I mean they're only this small for a short time so you may as well cherish these moments and memories. Because before you know it your baby girl/boy will be at the age they don't want mummy cuddles anymore!
