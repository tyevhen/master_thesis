I said something the other day, a bit in jest, but realized later that it had some truth to it, actually more truth than I'd like admit. But admit it is what I am about to do. I've become aware that I approach relationships from a position of defect. That is, I feel I am defective. I feel I am a defective person, because of my illness, in comparison to you. And to you, and you, and you... Internally, I feel less than pretty much every person I meet and with whom I interact. Ouch.

That wasn't an easy paragraph to write. I am not proud of this fact. This has been a hard realization at which to arrive. But I wonder if I am alone. I wonder if others can relate. And if you can relate, what have you done about it? This is not an attitude or feeling I want to continue. I'd much rather approach others feeling as if I were an equal.

As I've noted, this is a fresh observation of an underlying belief. I don't think it is obvious to those around me. I think others would be surprised to learn I feel this way. I don't think I act as if I feel less than my friends or coworkers, but feel that way I do. I don't totally understand it myself. I'm not even sure how it impacts my life exactly, but it probably does, right? It's something I'll have to work on, I guess.

Feel free to discuss.
