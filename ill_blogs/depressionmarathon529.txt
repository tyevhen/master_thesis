I found out this afternoon why I've been feeling like crap for 8 days. I've got pneumonia. It makes sense. I've had this before. I have to admit, when I went for that nice run last Thursday only to have my health decline over the next several days, I began to worry. That's exactly what happened the last time I had pneumonia. I felt well enough to go for a run but then felt worse afterward. Oh well. It is what it is. I have pneumonia. Actually, it's almost a relief to have a diagnosable condition. Now I don't feel so guilty about stepping out of work early yesterday and today. And I'll certainly give myself more permission to nap as needed from now on. Of course, I'm hoping to get over this as quickly as possible. I worry a little about my mood. And I do want to get back to the roads and the gym as soon as I can. But for now, I'm going back to bed.
