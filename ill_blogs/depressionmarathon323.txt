It says, "loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities." It's one of the official symptoms of depression.Yup, got it. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to write. I don't want to go to the store. I don't want to visit. I don't want to talk on the phone. I don't want to cook or prepare even simple things to eat. I don't want to clean. I don't want to change my clothes. I don't even want to open the door to get my mail! It's all too big, or too overwhelming, or just too uninteresting. And it all takes energy. I don't have any of that right now.

Sleep. That's the only thing at which I am currently proficient. The funny thing is I'm not interested in sleeping either, but I can barely keep my eyes open most of the time. Despite my hyper somnolence, I've been able to keep a few commitments. This is how it goes. I sleep, work for a few hours, and then collapse in exhaustion. I sleep, struggle through a run, and then I sleep some more. I sleep, go to an appointment, and then collapse in a heap. It's painful and exhausting to leave my house. I'm battling just to maintain some semblance of normalcy.

I'm trying my best not to worry. Of course I am worried...waiting for the other shoe to drop. But I can't do that. I've got to stay in today. I'm doing my best to keep moving forward, even if it means sleeping more than my fair share of the day. I'm trying to do what my body will allow when it will allow it. I wish it wasn't painful and exhausting to leave my house. I wish something, anything, held my interest. But that's not the case right now. Despite the apathy, I feel I've got to keep pushing. And that's what I'm attempting to do. It's hard. This illness is hard sometimes. I hate it.
