I feel like these awards are a good place for those interested in homeschooling but not necessarily aware of unschooling to discover blogs that can help them understand the later life philosophy...  I just see it as a good way for unschooling to get a bit more publicity in the homeschooling community.  The more the better, in my opinion!
