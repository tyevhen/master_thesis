  Broken, A Poem

 
I am not stick thin,

life is not worth living.

I am broken within

and finished with giving.

 
What I think in my head

cannot be true.

Things left unsaid

are left to brew.

 
Our mentors have failed.

We have nowhere to turn.

 Onward weâ€™ve sailed

with beliefs to burn.

 
What hope have we

for acceptance and love,

when all we see

is killing the dove?

 
I want to save you;

it starts with me.

I know what to do.

Bring all to the tree.

 
Nothing to comprehend

apart from the cross.

Suffering to lend

is a terrible loss.

 
Try again, He will say.

We have nothing to fear.

Try again, He will say.

I am here, I am here.
