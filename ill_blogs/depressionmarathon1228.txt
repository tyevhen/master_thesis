things are improved today. I'm emptying out that pity pot. it's stuffed full from yesterday's dive, but I'm extricating myself from the muck nonetheless. my hip is better, though still not right. my worst fear may be true. I may have re-torn the labrum for a third time, but I know there is nothing I can do about that now. less pain today. I'll try a couple miles tomorrow after arriving in duluth. heck, if I determine it'd be too dangerous to run (yah, RIGHT!!), I can help my friends sell running shoes at the expo again! they own a shoe store, and I helped them hawk running shoes last year--my dream job! I love high tech shoes! I had a blast! I'm sure I'll run...and I'm feeling better about that today.

I'm home alone tonight, which I hate. my parents are watching Puck. it's so quiet in the house without him. but he loves them, and they love him, so I'm sure he's quite content. wish my mood was a bit better going into this race, but such is the nature of this illness, huh? another reality over which I have little control. on my way to bed now. long drive in the morning, and an unexpected road closing in duluth could make for a very interesting journey for thousands of runners and fans. hope to avoid the mess by getting an early start.
I'm rambling now. I guess that's exactly how I feel. not up, nor down...happy, nor sad...excited, nor apprehensive... I just am. I just am. I guess that's okay...

good night.
