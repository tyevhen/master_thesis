I'm sure for all of you who have experienced taking any type of medication, missing a day or two can really mess with your system, especially when it comes down to medication for your mental health, so this is your reminder to take your medication!

I have been on my mental health medication for around three to four years now and I can definitely tell when I have missed a day, or two, or three...the problem is I often forget to leave it somewhere that I regularly see in the morning. Really, I should put the medication in a place where I will know that I will take it and I advise you to do that also! For example, in the bathroom, near your hairbrush or even by your car keys. 

When I miss my medication for a few days I experience dizziness, the feeling of being spaced-out, lack of concentration, sickness and headaches. I don't feel that my mood changes that much unless I have missed my medication for a few days, not on purpose, but just out of forgetfulness. After a few days I do notice a change in my mood, which can be quite severe. I'll often face increased anxiety and depression and even suicidal thoughts. I remember the times when I have been extremely irrational and it has been scary because you feel completely out of control. I won't go into detail of the exact experiences, but just remember to take the medication! I think if I was to come off my medication more slowly, I would be able to control the reduction rather than going cold turkey and I think that is what causes the problems when medication is missed. 

If this post reminds you of anything, please remember to take your medication as there is nothing to be ashamed of and missing medication for a long time can have adverse effects. However, I am aware that certain medication itself can cause increased anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts, but even so it is never advised to go completely cold turkey. Remember to follow your doctor's advice. 

What are your experiences?
