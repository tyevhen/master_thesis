Sometimes it is in the most difficult places that we realize what we really need.  I wrote this during a time when I was struggling in high school.  It is hard sometimes when we can't actually physically feel the touch of our God.  That is what I wanted.  Like a little girl who wants her loving daddy to wrap his arms around her and keep her safe, that is what I wanted from God.


DADDY GOD, I NEED YOU
by Cindy Boersma

My God I know...

If I could just crawl into your lap
Snuggle up inside your big strong arms
Feel your love as you hold me
I could keep safe from all that harms

If I could stay as long as I needed
As if time were standing still
If I could rest as you watch over me
And know that you always will

Then maybe I could take it
These trials I'm going through
They are wearing me out and breaking me down
I don't know what to do

Daddy God, I need you.
