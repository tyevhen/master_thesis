I’m unhappy.
I should lose weight.
Everyone is doing it.
Why can’t I?
I’d like to look like that.
I’ll start a diet.
This one looks good.
It worked for her.
OK, good food and bad food list.
I feel better already.
This will be fun.
Opps, I ate some bad food.
Today is ruined.
I must try harder.
I’m not a quitter.
I won’t give up that easily.
I’d like to wear that dress and those pants.
I guess I’ll start again tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow is a new day.
I’ll eat everything tonight for the last time…last time ever.
I’ll wake up early and run.
Right, I’ll make up for it tomorrow.
I feel sinful eating all this bad food.
Now, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of all the bad food I just ate.
Wake up late after multiple snooze buttons.
I’m such a loser.
Better skip breakfast.
I’ll do better today.
I must do better today.
I’ll show myself that I am not a weak loser.
It will make me feel better.
Avoid food…avoid food.
Late at night.
I’m hungry.
I’ll just have one cookie.
It looks so good because I didn’t eat dinner.
What harm can one cookie do?
Oh no, that was a bad food.
I feel ashamed.
I must have no discipline…no will power.
I’m a bad person.
I feel awful.
I’ll start over tomorrow.
Right, I’ll get a do-over tomorrow.
Better eat all the bad food tonight.
This is the last time.
Wake up.
Groggy.
Sick to my stomach.
Headache.
Now, I’m really a loser.
I won’t eat at all today.
It’ll be a good jump start to my diet.
Yeah, you know, like a detox.
That will make me feel better.
I must lose weight.
That will make me happy.
Today, I’m moody.
I’m irritable.
I’m focused on not eating.
Nothing else matters.
All I can think of is food.
Late at night.
What harm can one graham cracker do?
Three full meals later, what have I done?
I want to die.
I am the most disgusting person on the face of the earth.
I won’t eat tomorrow.
I will exercise like crazy.
If I eat, then I will punish myself.
Get up.
All I can see is fat.
All I can feel is the food in my stomach.
All I can think about is how much of a loser I am.
I can’t eat today.
Just drink water.
I didn’t eat today.
I’m proud of myself.
This feels good to be in control.
Next day, I started eating at breakfast, and I can’t stop.
I’ve been eating constantly this whole day.
I thought I was on a diet.
I won’t eat tomorrow.
I’ll get back that good feeling of accomplishment.
Remember, I have to be in control of my body.
I can’t trust myself to eat.
Oh, and I’ll run until I drop.
OK, now that I got a plan, I can go to sleep.
Everything makes me cry.
I am miserable.
Losing weight will make me happy.
That’s the only thing that matters.
Good day.
Bad day.
Good day.
Bad day.
Bad day.
Bad day.
Bad day…
