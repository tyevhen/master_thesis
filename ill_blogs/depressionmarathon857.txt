It became clear last week that the mental health system in America remains desperately broken. Three families are mourning and trying to heal this week in the aftermath of violence, injuries, and death; apparently the results of untreated mental illness.

The family of Patrick Bedell, the man who opened fire on two guards at the Pentagon last week released this statement: "We are devastated as a family by the news from yesterday. To the outside world, this tragedy is the first and only thing they will know of Patrick. To us, he was a beloved son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. We may never know why he made this terrible decision. One thing is clear though - his actions were caused by an illness and not a defective character." --from The Gilroy Dispatch. The guards were injured in the shooting while Bedell was shot and killed.

Halfway across the country, another mentally ill man was found guilty in the murder of an Iowa football coach. Mark Becker believed his former coach, Ed Thomas, was Satan and thought he was protecting the community by killing him. He had been released from a three day stay at a local psychiatric facility the day before the murder.

From The DesMoines Register: The defendant's mother, Joan Becker, who had testified about her son's disturbing struggles with mental illness, thanked the jurors for serving on a difficult trial - even though she disagreed with their verdict."Our son Mark would never have taken the life of another person in his sane mind," she said. "Ed Thomas was a victim of a victim. Although Mark and we as his parents attempted to go through all the proper channels to get Mark the mental health treatment he desperately needed, the system failed miserably."

One has to wonder, if mental illnesses were treated with as much respect, knowledge, and priority as other life threatening illnesses, would these families be mourning today?
