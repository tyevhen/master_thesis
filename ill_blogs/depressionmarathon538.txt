I'm not sure it's directly related, but it feels like I've sunk into a bit of a dip since my marathon on Sunday. I've experienced post marathon dips in my mood in the past, so I'm always watchful for changes. But I've been feeling so well lately, I'm a little surprised by this tumble.

I don't think the dip has anything to do with my performance. It wasn't that important. Perhaps it has more to do with extending myself physically and mentally. I don't know. But I've been sad, tearful, overwhelmed, anxious and fatigued for the past two days. Something is going on.

I've contacted my doctor. I'm getting extra rest. I'm going to work, exercising, and seeing friends. Well, I'm seeing some friends. I did skip a meeting, and work has been particularly challenging. But I'm doing what I can and fighting the urge to isolate. The last thing I want is for this dip to become a drop. I liked the way things were going. I want to get back to feeling fabulous as soon as possible.
