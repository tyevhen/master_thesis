As we say up north, Uff-Da, we've been getting dumped on. It's been raining for at least 24 hours, I think, and there are no signs of it stopping. Basements are filling up. Rivers are swollen beyond their banks. Major highways are closed due to flooding. There is water everywhere!

Fortunately, my basement is DRY! That 6K I spent on the waterproofing system apparently was well spent. This has definitely been the biggest test my basement has had since I fixed it after it flooded 3 years ago. So far, so good. I'm so relieved. It's so dry down there, I even spent time painting it today! I would have been devastated if it had flooded again!

The weather forced me indoors for my run today. Yuck! I hate running on treadmills. Treadmills feel so much harder than running outdoors. I know some people find them easier, but not me. I always feel more tired on a treadmill. Nevertheless, it was raining so hard and so consistently, I couldn't stand the thought of doing 7 miles outdoors. I ran my tempo run on the treadmill instead.

The good thing about the treadmill was I didn't have to worry about maintaining tempo pace (8:30/mile). I set the treadmill speed, after a 1/2 mile warm-up, and took off. I did have to bargain with myself all the way through the run, though. Feeling tired, I told myself I could stop after 4 miles, and then 5 miles, and then 6... I made the entire 7 on pace. Whew! I was pooped.
But of course I felt good--physically and mentally--after I finished. That's the beauty of exercise for me. Even if I don't enjoy it in the moment, I know I'll feel better when I'm done.

I felt so energized after my run that I began painting again. Now I'm sitting here waiting for the paint to dry so I can continue on my basement renovation journey. It's still raining. It's gloomy outside. But it was another good day, and life moves on...
