I'm still sick. In fact, my cold got worse over the weekend. My chest is so congested, I'm gurgling! I've had pneumonia before, and this doesn't feel like a repeat episode, but it's no fun, nonetheless. I'm feeling better today. Work went well until I talked a lot or laughed. Either of those things set off a coughing fit. But at least I'm not so achy today.

The combination of illness and full-time puppy training have left me totally unmotivated to do much else. With the exception of two days, I have not run since returning from Mexico. And since I didn't run in Mexico, it's been a long, long time since I've done any training! I'm feeling a little guilty, a little disgusted, and at the same time, a little apathetic. I've got to get back on the horse soon, or I know my mood is going to suffer.

My home is already suffering. I'd like it to be cleaned, but I've not been able to bring myself to do it. Well, I did pick up a tiny bit yesterday, and I took the vacuum out of the closet, but that's as far as I got. I do feel better in a clean house, so I know I need to get to it soon. Hmm... that sounds familiar.

Eating is another thing I can't bring myself to care about. Oh, I'm eating, but it's not all that great. I have no desire to cook anything! Even the microwave has been impossible lately. Instead, I've eaten a lot of toast and cereal. I went to a local Mexican place last night and again tonight for identical take out orders. That's how uninspired I am. I couldn't even bring myself to order something different.

Despite this abundance of lethargy, my mood seems to be okay. It's not good. It's not terrible. It's just okay. But I'm worried the lethargy and lack of inspiration may indicate the beginning of something more sinister. That's why I need to get back at it. I need to do more than go to work and train a puppy, even though doing more seems beyond me at this point in time. Oh well, at least I know what I need to do.
