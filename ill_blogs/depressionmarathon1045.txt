I'm physically falling apart!
Okay, not really, it just feels that way at the moment.
I think it must be the running.
Tuesday: I ran a great speed workout of 7 x 800 meters. Then I went to the doctor and ended up having my left shoulder injected. Ouch!
Thursday: I ran a very nice 7 miler with Puck. Then I went to the dentist and ended up having my tooth pulled! Ouch!
Common denominator: Running prior to my appointments!
Perhaps I should think twice the next time I plan to run before a doctor visit.
