Today my blog is one year old. I still often can’t quite believe I’m a blogger at all never mind that I’ve been doing this for a year now. I still feel very much a newbie, this year has passed so quickly. Yet 2017 has been an amazing year in many ways and they are all thanks to this blog.




As you maybe have figured out, I started this blog as a new year’s resolution. If you read my first post, you will know I started this blog to motivate me to make many positive changes in my life in a quest to improve my mental and physical health. 

I haven’t made as much progress as I would have hoped with my health. Partly as I set my expectations too high and partly as life threw me a few curve balls I wasn’t expecting along the way. Yet I am proud of the progress I have made, and I am immensely proud I have stuck with my blog. It’s the first resolution I have ever stuck to!

So how have I done in each area I planned to improve upon? Let’s score my efforts.

• Healthy Eating: 5/10 – 2017 was a bumpy year for me diet wise. I initially tried to simply eat healthily, whatever that means, most of the time. The problem with that is that I am not good at simply cheating occasionally, if I know I can cheat then I will and often. I find I am better with rules. So back in May I decided to try a vegan diet. I managed three months, but it wasn’t suiting my health, so I sadly gave it up. Since then due to stress and a lack of motivation my diet has slipped for the most part back to my old ways. I have learned many lessons this year diet wise though and in finding what doesn’t work for me I have also gotten closer to working out what will work for me. I have also discovered many enjoyable healthy recipes. 



• Exercise – 1/10 – Appalling effort. This is and always has been my downfall. Ever since the days of school PE I have hated exercise. If I can avoid it I will and in 2017 whilst tackling many other of life’s hurdles I failed to tackle this. 

• Facing Fears – 9/10 (This one needs sub-categories!)

Starting this blog faced my fear of judgement head on. I put myself out there for the world to see and shared it on Facebook with my friends and family and these posts were also seen by friends of friends and of course complete strangers. 
Back in March I attended my first bloggers event, I went alone and in doing so overcame a huge fear. I have gone on to attend many more events.
Also in March I accepted an invitation to appear as a guest on BBC Radio Leicester, I could have never even guessed twelve months ago I would be typing that. I would have thought I wasn’t good enough to even be invited on and would have run a mile even if I was. Yet I accepted the invitation, faced up to my nerves and enjoyed the experience. I have gone on to appear six times and will be on again this month.
In May I completed the Pretty Mudder Race for Life. This was a challenge I had long wished I could achieve but was always adamant I would never mange it due to fear, yet I did, and I enjoyed it and I plan to do it again this year.


I have also worked with my therapist on facing other anxieties and fears such as walking over bridges. I have only tackled one bridge so far yet that was a great achievement.
Sadly, I was majorly set back in my fear of driving after an accident in August, yet I still fight this one and am hopeful of getting back the confidence I had achieved before the crash.


• Relaxation/Tackling Stress – 4/10 – In the summer I started a Mindfulness class, my progress is slow, and I don’t dedicate enough time to it, yet I am very slowly starting to see what I am learning be of benefit to me and am excited to explore this more.

Now for the stats. I aimed to publish 100 posts over 2017, I managed 65. I am still very pleased with that number as life didn’t always make blogging easy for me. Page views are it seems often the measure of success to many bloggers so how did I do there? Initially I did very well, the numbers blew my mind, excited me and made me so proud. Sadly, as my posts diminished in frequency my page views as you would expect also dropped. This is how the year panned out (as per Google Analytics):

That being said, I had a total of 5,539 unique visitors to my blog this year and that is something I am so very pleased with and so immensely proud of. To think that many people chose to view something I have created is over whelming.

So, what about my blog content? Overall, I am very happy with the content I have produced. I am very proud of many of my posts. However, I have also made mistakes. I committed to writing several reviews, mainly for toys. I did it for my children’s sake, yet I regret it. I thought at the time the reviews would just be an occasional post dropped in amongst my usual content but because of how the year panned out they became my only content for several months. That wasn’t fair on my readers as it was not the type of content people expected from this blog and it wasn’t content I was proud of.

I have learned many blogging lessons this year including that I don’t want to commit myself to a niche for example food or fashion, my niche is me. I also know I only want to accept review posts for things that are a good fit for my blog.

The best thing I have gained from blogging is meeting other bloggers. I have met some amazing people and I hope many of them will go on to call me a friend.

I may not be ending the year any fitter and I might not be practising daily meditations as I had hoped I would be by now, yet I am very proud of what I have achieved this year and I feel that 2017 has laid the groundwork of a journey that is just going to be a little longer than expected. 



I am truly excited to see what 2018 will bring and hope you will come along for the journey. This feels a fresh start for my blog and I can't wait. 

Thank you to everyone who has read my blog. It means the absolute world to me.
