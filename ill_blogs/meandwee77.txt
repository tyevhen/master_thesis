(note the lobster hats...so cute!)

Paige had her preschool concert yesterday and it was filled with cuteness. This is what it's all about.
She was front and center and did a great job! She was so excited to see us in the audience she kept pointing to us and yelling "I TOLD you Mommy and Daddy would be here!!!" Everyone chuckled. I felt my heart bursting with pride during that show. It's so great to see your little one flourish.
A nice woman in front of us told us about how Paige, in the morning concert, helped her little friend up who was sitting on the floor and afraid to sing in front of the group. They said she reached down and consoled her; patting her, and helped her up. Isn't that sweet? They complimented us on how sweet Paige is and it was my first experience seeing Paige through someone else's eyes. Very cool! (We made sure to praise her profusely later that night).
