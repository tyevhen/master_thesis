We have a small house by today's standards in America. Up until last fall, the livable area of our home was 1600 sq. ft. We finished 1/3 of our basement, putting in a bedroom, laundry room, and bathroom so that Sergei would have his own room just this past fall.

I used to think that the small-ish size of our home really limited me in doing things that I liked to do such as entertaining friends and having company over.

Then about three or four years ago, I got a grip. God brought me face-to-face with my problem. My problem was discontentment and an unrealistic understanding of what hospitality meant. I was comparing what I had to those around me, and then, subsequently, feeling insufficient to entertain.

I don't remember exactly how God spoke this to my heart. But when He did, I sprung forward in researching what exactly Biblical hospitality was supposed to look like, and I found out that it had NOTHING to do with the size of my house.

I did a whole series on Biblical hospitality last summer. But I never touched on small home hospitality so I just wanted to share a few of my thoughts regarding that this week.

Tomorrow will start the first post in this series. I will begin by answering the question, "Can I really extend hospitality in a small house?" During this series, I will also discuss having dinner guests, hosting small parties, and hosting overnight guests. And sometime in the near future I plan on expending this small home series by devoting some posts to embracing the delights that come along with living in a smaller home.

So, won't you join me over the next few days as I discuss the topic of small home hospitality?

See you here tomorrow!
