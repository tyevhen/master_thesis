By overwhelming margins, both the US House and Senate voted to override President Bushy's veto of the Medicare Reform Bill (HR 6331). The Shrub suffered perhaps his most significant pruning yet on this one, as seniors, doctors and mental health advocates apparently flooded congress members' offices with mail and voice messages urging the override. I was a bit concerned after The Shrub followed through with his veto threat. You just never know what's going to happen in DC, you know what I mean?
Thankfully, the concern was unwarranted. I am extremely relieved this bill is now law! Doctors will be paid. Private insurers, who have been overpaid for years, will have their payments lowered. And most importantly, people like me with mental illness will now be covered equally! We won't be totally "phased in" to equal insurance coverage until 2014, but at least the long-standing, discriminatory 50% coverage will finally become extinct. Thank God!

In fact, I'm so happy--Let's sing!
