When I last left you I was feeling heavy and lazy and bored. Now I'm feeling sick. I've had a sore throat and a headache for the last couple of days. Feeling achy and sick certainly doesn't combine well with heavy and bored. For instance, I promised myself I'd get out and bike...no, okay swim...no, okay run today. None of the aforementioned occurred. Oh well, at least Puck and I got out for a 30 minute walk.

I'm trying to be kinder to myself and not fret too much about my temporary lack of motivation. I'm trying. But I am just a wee bit concerned. I think I need to make myself another training schedule, even if I don't yet know what it is I'm training for. Maybe I'll get to that this evening...

By the way, I'm going on my annual trip to Colorado this week. I'm going with friends Bill and Cindy to their cabin again. We're leaving Wednesday night, and since we're driving, Puck and Puppy (their dog) get to come along! Yippee! It will be Puck's first foray into the mountains. We will be gone 10 days this year. I'm really, really looking forward to it. Below is a picture of Bill, last year, with his morning coffee in front of the cabin.
Of course, when I'm gone I won't be able to write as often, but I'll try to keep you up to date as best I can. I'll also try to get my butt in gear and get some exercise while I'm there. I guess I better get to writing up that schedule right now.
