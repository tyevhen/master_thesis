Yesterday was wonderfully sunny and a warm 72 degrees! Brad was home so we packed a lunch and headed to the park and a local "beach." Thought I'd share some pics from our lovely day out...




Don't you all just love this time of year? Spring will soon arrive bringing warm, breezy days and daffodils and tulips. We're already hearing the lovely tweeting of birds outside of our windows in the morning. I love to wake to that sound, don't you?!

Spring is such a refreshing time of the year. It feels so new and exciting. And I'm feeling refreshed and invigorated. We'll be starting some landscaping in our backyard this weekend. Plus, we need to go bicycle shopping soon. I'm the only family member without a bicycle. We even have the bike trailer to pull the kids. So, we're going to get me a bike and do some family trail-biking this spring. Can't wait.

What's your favorite thing to do this time of the year? Take advantage of the warm, sunny days. Make the most of each moment. Pack those picnic baskets and head out to your own backyard. Find a shady spot and enjoy your lunch in the fresh air. Grab the bubbles or the kites and head out for some fun. Don your hiking shoes and magnifying glass and head out to the woods to explore and learn.

Have fun making the most of each moment! Remember that every day is a day that the Lord has made! Be glad and rejoice in it!
