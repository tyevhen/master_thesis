here's a review of what i wrote in that day

* today I had meeting with a stylist girl, went ok, i think she's a very nice person, very accepting and understanding, I think i've made good impression on her, but i also know she's like very accepting from her side too , she made good impression on me too. later the same day went to see a movie - jackass 3D...



OMG....this movie is sick....funny but very very sick... considering the fact that in the past(like couple of weeks ago) meeting someone new used to cause anxiety and panic attacks, it went kind of cool.
