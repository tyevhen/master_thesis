Here's what week three of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program looked like:

Week Three: March 24 - March 30, 2008
Ran: 5 days
Miles: 28.5
Long run: 7.8 miles
Speedwork: 2 pace runs, total of 6.5 miles at tempo pace
Found Money: only skunked on one day, but found only $0.05 this week--the street-sweepers have arrived!

Good week. Legs a bit tired, but pace improving while heart-rate maintaining.
Have a swell week everyone!
