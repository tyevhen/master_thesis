Look at the size of this medal! And that was just for finishing! I can't imagine what the winner's awards looked like! This was easily the nicest, and heaviest, medal I'd ever received.

My mom was right. This was at 18.5 miles, and I look a hell of a lot better than I felt! Remember, at this point, I was thinking I'd walk the rest of the way if I made it to 20 miles!

My friend, Kate (in white), also had a tough day. She said by this point, 18.5 miles, she was concentrating on just putting one foot in front of the other. I think you can see that in her downward gaze.

Grimacing as I approach the finish. I think that grimace came out around mile 3, and it never went away!

And here I am coming into the finish line. I'm running hard because I know it's almost over!!
