While billing a patient this week, I noticed she had a previous diagnosis of depression. "Wow," I thought, "she didn't look like someone with depression." Almost immediately, I began chastising myself! I was shocked to have had the thought! How could I, a person with depression--a person who speaks, writes, and educates about the invisibility, stereotypes and stigma of mental illness--how could I automatically assume that a young, healthy, attractive person didn't look like she could or should have depression? I was surprised at and disappointed with myself.

I guess it proves, once again, how pervasive the stigma is, how ingrained our attitudes are, and how hidden this illness can be. This incident was a powerful, not so subtle, reminder for me. How are your thoughts today?
