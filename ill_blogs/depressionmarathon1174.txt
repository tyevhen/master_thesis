I've been having a really difficult time motivating to do anything or caring about anything other than running and sleeping lately. I began noticing it a few days ago. I sat down to write several times only to get up and walk away. As I stated in my last post, it's not unusual for life to get a bit unbalanced at this point in a marathon training program. This seems different, however. Yes, I am a bit out of balance--necessarily so--but is that the reason for my lethargy? I don't know, but I don't want to do anything, and most of the time, I don't even care.

I don't care too much about how I look. I don't want to shower. I don't want to cook. I haven't cleaned my house--not pretty when you have a shedding dog! I don't want to go out. I've missed some of my meetings. I don't want to write, and worse, sometimes I don't even care about this blog. My brain tells me to forget about it. What's the point? It's just another thing I
don't want to do. Lack of motivation scares me. Lack of caring...that's terrifying.

Disinterest scares me because lack of motivation usually signals impending doom, i.e. depression. If I get to the point of not caring, well, that's worse. So I'm choosing to interpret my recent disinterest as a result of running lots and lots of miles. But I am worried, and worried doesn't do me any good either. That's why I'm writing it down. Often saying this crap out loud turns things around. Let's hope that's the case this time, too.

I'll let you know.
