I apologize for not writing as frequently as I usually do. Things are still tough around here. My brain is broken. At least that's how I like to think of it sometimes. Thinking like that makes this damn illness less personal. It's not me failing. My brain is failing. (I suspect that type of thinking only makes sense to those of you who've experienced depression.) Right now my brain is failing all over the place!

Things got so dark and deep yesterday, I called my doctor. She suggested I increase one of my meds. I'm never a fan of changing meds, especially if the change is to add something. My little medication cocktail has been working so well for so long, I only like to mess with it if we're decreasing or discontinuing something. At this point, however, I don't think I have much choice but to change it up. It's a small change we're making, and I'm looking at it as temporary. Hopefully, it will help lift the darkness.

I think it's the right decision at this time. I've not been able to motivate or change the current state on my own. I'm frustrated and overwhelmed. I'm tired. I've got no motivation to do anything. Being around people is painful, and I'm feeling empty and dead inside. There's no time like the present to try something different.

I know this will pass. It has to. It always has before. It's been a long time since I've been in this place, and for that I am truly grateful. I just need to hang on, and that's what I'm trying to do. It would help if I could cut myself some slack, rather than beat myself up for being tired, lazy and useless, but I can't seem to get the hang of that. Eventually, whether I practice serene acceptance or beat myself up, this ride will end. Hopefully, my med change will speed up the process. In the meantime, I'll just keep hanging on.
