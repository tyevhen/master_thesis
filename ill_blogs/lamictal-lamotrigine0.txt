Two weeks ago, I dropped from 300 mg to 250 mg. In the past few days, I've noticed that I'm feeling a bit sharper, mentally. I've begun craving healthy food again, after several years of craving salt, fat, and sweets (normally, I'm one of those lucky people who can normally look at a plate of cookies dispassionately; not so on Lamictal). Best of all, there's been no drop in my mood whatsoever!

The downside: I've had some GI issues (constipation and gas). My muscles are stiffer. I've also been really tired, but this might be my body's way of telling me it's OK to lower my Ativan dosage as well :)
