Hello!
So, I've been looking at myself in the mirror lately (in the morning after my shower) and I can't help but gawk at my stomach and how it protrudes out in all its glory. It's like it's stretching out to get some sun and yells "I've finally arrived! This is MY moment dammit! Let me through, bitches!!" Sometimes I think "I look so huuuuuge!" But then I remember that I'm only just getting started and I have 3-3.5 more months of growing to do. I don't mind it. It's just strange to see on ME. I kind of feel like a kangaroo (minus all the hopping around). I've also noticed that while I work at the computer during the day I get so overheated in my lap area and realize that MY STOMACH IS RESTING ON MY THIGHS. Part of this is from slouching in my chair, but still. Never had I contemplated that I would one day sweat under my belly and on top of my thighs, etc. ugh. At least it's winter and 5 degrees outside so I can chalk this up as my own personal space heater. Without the extreme fire hazard. And since I've been sick for 2 weeks now, I've now been introduced to a fun and frisky pregnancy side effect: Stress Urinary Incontinence. Woo! Yeah, not something people talk much about. Let's just say that you add up pregnancy with a full serving of ALL -DAY AND NIGHT COUGHING and you've got yourself a situation where you might as well buy stock on, ahem, special underwear or the like. Never thought it would happen to ME, but isn't that what we all think? Thank God my cold is finally ending! Before you get all grossed out and yell "too much information!!!" just remember: Everyone pees. It's ok. And what's a little pee amongst friends? right? RIGHT??!!
