I finished my Saturday long run today, as I have a class this weekend. It wasn't pretty, even though the day was beautiful. Actually, I'm being too hard on myself--shocking--as it was actually a decent run. I had to take a couple of breaks along the way, and I developed a side ache around mile 14, but I finished. I averaged a bit over 9 minutes per mile, too, just as I had planned. Those last few miles colored my perception of the entire run, I guess. It was a good run.

Like I said, it's a gorgeous day today. I love fall. It is my favorite season by far! The air is warm and dry. The breeze is cool. The changing leaves are beautiful. And the smell of fall is the best. I love the sound of the leaves tumbling in the wind, too. I spent a large part of my run trampling through leaves in the parks and along shady lanes. The scenery certainly added a bit of serenity to my effort today.

Now I'm resting, watching baseball (boo, hoo... my Twins lost last night) and enjoying the fresh air streaming through my windows. I don't think I'll have the energy to accomplish much else today. I'm hoping for dinner with some friends and a Twins win tonight. Life is back to a little bit of normal now that the stress of the last week is past. I'm very grateful for that!
