This time it was an athlete. Denver Broncos wide receiver, Kenny McKinley, died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. This young man was only in his second year in the NFL. He played in 8 games last year, his first as a pro, and is the all-time leading receiver at his Alma mater, South Carolina. Obviously, Kenny McKinley was a talented young man with seemingly everything going for him, and yet he took his life.

Suicide, like mental illness, knows no boundaries. Black, white, rich, poor, educated or not, nobody is immune. I don't know if Mr. McKinley suffered from untreated depression--the most common cause of suicide--but one has to wonder. Regardless, it's tragic.

This is the second time in the last few days I've been reminded of suicide's pervasiveness. As I ran my twelve-miler on Saturday, I ran smack into the middle of the Out of the Darkness walk. For two of my twelve miles, I ran side-by-side with walkers raising awareness.

The families and friends of suicide victims were obvious, with their coordinated memorial t-shirts, and they were everywhere. The path was lined with numerous memorial placards--photo montages of those no longer here. Among the pictures, all ages were represented from very young to very old. There were students, nurses, bartenders, and more. There were pictures of graduations, weddings, beaches, and friends. There was loss everywhere. It was a powerful event.

It was odd, being a survivor of a suicide attempt, to be among the families of those who've been lost. Suicide's lasting effect on those left behind was palpable. It was good I was there. It was good for me to feel that effect. As I ran, I quietly thanked God for the reminder, and I said a prayer for each survivor I passed. Perhaps it was no accident I happened upon that scene. I won't soon forget it.

Suicide is permanent. Its effects are devastating. If you are considering suicide--I get it. But please, if you are contemplating suicide, call someone, tell someone now.
