I know that's an overused cliche. But I really am. And bees ARE busy little workers. I should know. Ian's been studying bees and filling me in on all the facts!


Wouldn't you know that the week of VBS would also be the week that our garden is in its prime. Green beans. Cucumbers. Zucchini. Banana peppers. Broccoli. Blueberries. Basil. That means I'm up to my knees in veggies. Oh, but as busy as I am, I love having this abundance of fresh organic produce to preserve and use throughout the fall and winter.


So in the midst of directing Crocodile Dock, I've also been spending copious amounts of time with my vacuum sealer and my canner. This time of year is always exhausting for me because of all the preserving, but I just keep reminding myself of how glorious it is to pull a bag of organic homegrown veggies out of the freezer while the snow's flying outside. It makes it worth the work.


Oh, and I found this pic of Lily while browsing past garden pictures. This was Lily two summers ago. She would have only been about 17 months old. My how time flies!
