I'm excited tonight. I just finished packing for a short weekend away from home. I'm going to be spending the weekend in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St.Paul) with some very close friends. I haven't done anything remotely resembling an outing for a long, long time, so I'm due.

It's a working weekend for my friends, but we're planning plenty of playtime, too. We'll be meeting a couple of other friends for dinner, going to an NHL game (Go Wild!), and enjoying some warmer weather for a change. I've got my running clothes packed, as I love to explore new places by going for a run. And I'll be home in time for my football team's championship game on Sunday evening. Go Vikings! I'm really looking forward to getting away.

This weekend couldn't have come at a better time. We've been in another long, deep freeze for the last week, so I've been cooped up inside too much. It's been a bit of a stressful week at work as well. I don't usually feel stressed, and I don't like it. I think spending time with friends and having fun will be the perfect antidote.

I'm looking forward to starting next week fresh and energized. I think this weekend will be a a great opportunity to reset. I'm planning on taking advantage of the opportunity. If I do, I'll go into next week with improved patience and a better attitude. Gotta keep things simple. I'll let you know how it goes.
