I have run across a number of sites revisiting 9/11, most recently a poem reviewed by Rob Mackenzie by a Mr. Armitage, and thought it behooved me to share one more.

The link to it is incorporated in the title of this brief note. The site features features an early draft of my poem, "World Trade Center Kaddish," which I wrote within the first month of the tragedy for an anthology. It has the virtues of being raw and fresh, the deficit of being unpolished.

Yes, that's two posts in a day. Forgive.
