Life is crazy!

In my last post I could barely manage my day at work because of my low mood. My mood has been slowly getting better, but it has been so poor that I've not even been living at home. I've been staying with friends (in lieu of going into the hospital). I've been lower and more dark over the past 2-3 weeks than I'd been in the past two years.

Previous to my mood difficulties, I told you about basically losing my job due to a lack of patients. Our agency had not been able to garner enough business to keep two physical therapists occupied. Because of that, I went out and interviewed for two new jobs.

Then life turned on it's head! On Monday, I worked 12 hours because we were swamped with new patients! On Tuesday, I was offered both jobs for which I had interviewed. Yesterday, I was perhaps busier than I had ever been at my current job, again because we'd suddenly been inundated with more patients than we could handle. My mood has taken a back seat to necessity. While still struggling, I've really not had time to deal with it. Life is crazy!

It just goes to show...you might think you are headed in one direction. You may not even be able to see another possible direction. You may think you are doomed, down, or even knocked out. But God has a sense of humor, I think, or at least a sense of irony! Just when you've determined life is particularly unfair, something turns around. Or, as is my case, everything, at once, turns on its head! I'm hanging on for the ride.
