I don't feel like reading my book. I don't feel like watching TV. I don't feel like listening to my usual weekend programs on NPR. I didn't feel like exercising, but I did lift some weights. I don't feel like writing this blog post. Besides sleeping, I don't feel like doing much of anything. I'm concerned.

Disinterest in my normal activities is a concerning sign for me. My mood today feels sickeningly familiar, and disinterest is often the precursor to a slide. Of course, right now I am hyper vigilant when it comes to signs of a potential slide. I dread the thought of going backwards. I don't think I could handle it again.

I've written about this before. It is so difficult, I think, to avoid panicking when we have these lower than normal days. Perhaps this is just a normal day with a normal dip in my mood and a normal dip in my interest in activities. Perhaps I'm just bored. I hope so. But how do we know? I certainly don't want to wait to find out.

I'm trying to battle rather than wait. I am using some of the tools I just learned in my mood disorder program. I used a tool called Opposite Action when I went to the gym to lift some weights despite wanting to stay inside and slumber. I did go to my meeting this morning, and I will go to my track club banquet tonight. I've let my friend, Wendy, and my doctor know what's happening. I am scared, but I pray taking the next right action and continuing to move forward will keep this damn, dreaded illness at bay. Please.
