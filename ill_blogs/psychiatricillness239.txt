I was back to work today, I came home to a whole load of things to do, workis parachuting in from all directions at the moment. I even bought work home tonight and I have only just finished it atgone 10pm.

I spoke to a friend of mine yesterday and we are planning to go to New York for a few days in June. I have booked the days off work and I will be away or my Birthday :o)

I am going to wash up and go to bed now!
