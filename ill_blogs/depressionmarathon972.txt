My friend, Renee, in her continuing quest to domesticate me, invited me to make bread and jam with her yesterday. Renee enjoys cooking, baking, and eating. I enjoy only one of those three, and it isn't either of the first two! Nevertheless, I took her up on the offer, as I figured eating may be involved! That's me, using all of my Girl Scout skills, measuring flour and mixing dough.
Renee had to teach me how to knead the dough, which I confess may come in handy the next time my depression has me frustrated. That dough would be no match for a disgruntled etta!

While the dough rose, we made blueberry jam. It was another foray into domestication I never thought I'd take. It turns out making jam is not nearly as difficult as I imagined, although one does need the correct tools.
Stirring boiling blueberries...even I could do that!

Pouring boiled blueberries into jars...hmmm, really not so tough. Look at those delicate hands work!
After about three hours, Renee let me take home this beautiful loaf of bread and 4 jars of blueberry jam. Ummmm, ummm good! Thanks, Renee!
