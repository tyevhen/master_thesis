Yesterday I had a blind date with this cute girl, all I can is that it was a very good practice for me, and I could be at ease and just have fun and conversation most of the time, eventually it didn't work out but the fun part is, that I didn't care much :-) at least not too much, and now I have another date, the thing is that usually in the past I would worry and focus on myself too much , that will make look like a freak, and this time I was cool, I mean there were couple of seconds here and there of something that reminded the social anxiety but it lasted only few seconds and went away...


well don't know if that aspect of cipralex interest you much, if it does I can shade some more light about it, let me know...


take care!
