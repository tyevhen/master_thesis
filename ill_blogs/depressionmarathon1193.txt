life still goes on.
even when we feel like crap
the world continues around us.

i learned long ago
the world didn't stop for me.
good knowledge to have
don't you think?

so even though i feel like crap
today
yesterday
and the day before that,
expectations must still be met.
that is the definition of expectation
after all.

expectations must be met
or i fear i will fall
away

where is away?
i do not know.

can there
be any worse
than
here?
