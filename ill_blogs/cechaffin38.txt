The way things are, if I don't post more pictures here I won't have as many options when I notify friends on FB that I've blogged anew.  So now for a brief exodus into visual notation.  Above, our friend Gordon Black cheering for the Lakers in the finals last year.  Then, my beautiful Kathleen.  Next, my grandson, Jacob, now 8.   Then a picture of me with my wonderful Martin Dreadnought Rosewood, "Rosie," lost in a song at my brother's house.  Then me looking mysterious on the Mendocino headlands.

All for tonight.

Namaste,

Craig
