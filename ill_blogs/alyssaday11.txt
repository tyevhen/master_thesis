Whee! My new publisher, Penguin Teen, made a Christmas tree of books and there's a whole layer of my upcoming Lucy Connors release, THE LONESOME YOUNG!!  Right underneath a layer of Laurie Halse Anderson's new book, which is thrilling, because I'm a total fangirl of her writing.  wow!

I can't wait for you to read THE LONESOME YOUNG (or recommend it to everyone you know who enjoys contemporary young adult novels with a dark, gritty feel), because so much of my heart and my own teen past is in this book.
