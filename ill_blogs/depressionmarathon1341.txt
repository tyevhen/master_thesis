Seems irony has been a common theme for me the past few days. Yesterday, ironically, almost immediately after writing my sob-story post about becoming a non-runner, I went for a run. Not such a big deal except that I actually felt pretty damn okay! It was snowing and sunny with an intermittent brisk wind. (Haven't seen the sun around here much lately, and the temp rose above 10 degrees, I think!) I kept the pace slow, stopped to walk a few times, but actually ran faster toward the end of my run than at the beginning. That is almost always a good sign, as it was yesterday. Yes, my heart-rate monitor was still screaming at me because my heart-rate was too high, but I didn't feel like I was going to die this time. And apparently, I didn't die, because here I am.
I went for a run yesterday.
I finally allowed myself to contemplate becoming a "non-runner" and then immediately proceeded to have a pretty damn okay run!
Freud would love this!
