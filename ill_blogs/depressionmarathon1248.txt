What a strange week. Ran great and easy Tuesday and Wednesday, but then attacked by fatigue mid-run on Thursday, which reduced me to a long, light-headed walk home. Fretting about miles after incapacitating fatigue and no run on Friday. Volunteered at a kids race Saturday and decided to sign up for the Sunday half-marathon because I knew there was no other way I would get my scheduled 12-miler done. Expected nothing. Planned to use it as a glorified training run, and it was; but I was able to race by the end! Felt good. Recovered well. Seem to be right where I need to be to achieve my goal time in a few weeks.
But now, incapacitated again... my dog, my boy, my buddy...blew-out his ACL (knee) today, and I am blaming myself. I am so, so sad. And I don't feel like doing anything. But, I need to get back on the roads tomorrow--solo...
Here is the summary of my strange Week Eleven of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program:

Week Eleven: May 19-25, 2008
Ran: 5 days
Miles: 37.4
Long Run: 13.1 miles (race)
Speed: 10 x 1:00 intervals hard with 1:00 recovery
Swam: 1/2 mile+

Here's to a week of joyful miles, lighter legs, and sunny days!
And if you are so inclined, please say a prayer for Puck, my dog. Hopefully, he'll be able to have surgery tomorrow. Come to think of it, say one for me, too, please...
Thanks.
