The impromptu trip to visit my parents was followed by a slightly insane "study retreat" to the next college town over.

Total time spent running away = 5 days

Now, I am back home. Today, I collect the baggage that I tried to discard at various spots around the nation. Today I claim it as mine. Today, I unpack it and one by one fix it all. Today, I take the next steps to finish my thesis

Note: I took this photo from my camera phone while I was traveling this weekend.
