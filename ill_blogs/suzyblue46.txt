guess who's blonde...
So last week I did something i'd been planing on doing for summer for a while now...ditch the extensions and go blonde, VERY blonde! It was around this time last year that I went darker with my hair, but even then, my hair wasn't as blonde before as it is now...IT'S AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN!! Anyway, I love it! Its a great change for the summertime and even though I loved having long hair, it's a relief not having to clip my extensions in every morning!

Yesterday was exam results day, and i'm so happy to announce that I passed...EVERYTHING! *yay for no resists* I can't even begin to fathom that thats me half way through university already!! WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE?! It's so strange to think that I will be starting my third year in september! I feel SO old!! Gosh before I know it i'll be mortgaging a house and paying taxes! SLOW DOWN LIFE!

Lastly, as most of my lovely readers will already know, google friend connect will be no more in around two weeks time, which means if you want to continue following my blog, you'll have to do it through bloglovin. The link to my bloglovin is on the right of my blog above my instagram feed (the little button that says "follow this blog"). But if you are completely new to bloglovin, here is a nice little post which will tell you everything you need to know:http://www.thekimmiechronicles.com/2013/06/replacing-google-friend-connect-with.html
 Its super easy right?

See you all over on bloglovin!

Until next time,
Stay classy
