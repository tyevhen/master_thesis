I'm feeling a little guilty today. I was asked by my local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter to assist with an upcoming 10-week course. I am a trained instructor for NAMI's Professional Provider class. It is a course for professional health care providers taught by people with mental illness and their families. It's a very cool class, and it routinely gets rave reviews from its participants.

When I was asked to be one of the four teachers, I immediately wanted to do it. The chance to teach mental health professionals, some of whom have likely treated me in the past, has always been one of my goals. I wanted to say, "Yes, I'll do it," but my gut was telling me no, don't.

I typically listen to my gut. I sat on the decision as long as I could. When last week I was asked for my final decision, I listened to my gut's hesitation, and I said no. It was the ten week commitment, I think. Three hours, one night per week, for ten weeks, is quite a commitment. Bottom line, I was worried it would be too much.

Now I feel guilty that I let my worry (i.e. fear) get in the way of supporting my local NAMI chapter. I care about NAMI. I care about this class. I've been feeling well lately. Why couldn't I commit? Why couldn't I push a bit out of my comfort zone on this one? My gut told me no, don't do it, but now I feel guilty. I feel I've let people, including myself, down. Ick!

What's done is done, but now I'm questioning if I did the right thing. And feeling a little guilty...
