As it gets steadily colder and more Winter like (well, not steadily, but generally colder), the cats start sleeping even more, and being adorably cuddly. Minni (orange-brown tabby) and Henry (black-tabby and white) truly are marvelous critters...

I've been spending a lot of time on the computer lately. Probably too much. But part of what I've been doing is researching... I want to know what I want to do! The thing that appeals to me most is an herbalist, or natural healer of some sort. I don't want to be a naturopath, because all that really is, is a doctor without prescription meds, and that's not what I want. I envision a much more earthy approach, if that makes sense. I want to apprentice, not go to university for four years. The thought of spending years in a classroom makes me shudder. I've also been looking into midwifery, but again, that needs four years of university. What ever happened to apprenticeships?!? I'm feeling slightly discouraged. I think I might know what I want to do with my life, or at least I know that I want to try and do certain things with my life, I just don't know how to go about doing them. ARRGH!

Peace (*takes deep breath*),
Idzie
