Maren wants attention too. She was telling me that she feels shoved aside since the kids came along. Probably true. So, I told her I'd take her picture and put it on the blog. She told me to take 2 pictures. She then proceeded to give me her best poses and here they are for you. Happy now, Maren? Diva.
