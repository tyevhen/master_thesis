Anger, fear, disappointment, resentment, frustration...negative emotions such as these seem to be doubly difficult for me to handle as a result of this illness. I'm not talking about jumping off a bridge or anything, but I've noticed recently that any negative emotion can trigger a steep, precipitous slide into the abyss. Darkness and despair seem to be ever present just beneath my surface. It makes feeling angry, fearful, frustrated or disappointed quite dangerous for me.

I wonder if anybody else has this experience? Am I unique in this? Have you noticed? I'd love to know.
