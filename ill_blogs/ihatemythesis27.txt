Maybe a complete and utter disregard for personal hygiene proves to my professor how much I care about my thesis. I am so absorbed in the abstractions of deep thoughts that I cannot be bothered to lower myself to the trivialities of mere mortal bodies. Will he buy that? Or should I just douse myself in perfume and call it a "French" day?
