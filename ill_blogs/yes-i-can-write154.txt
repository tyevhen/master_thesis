This blog isn't a 101 site.  So for those just discovering unschooling, I've created an Unschooling 101 + Comment Policy page (see it right there at the top right, easily visible to everyone who stumbles upon this blog?)!  I've attempted to cover all of the most common initial reactions/thoughts people tend to express, as well as making it clear what type of comments will not be accepted on this blog.  I hope this will serve as a good primer to those just discovering unschooling, as well as hopefully cut down on some negative comments on this blog!

I'd love to get your feedback, so comments are temporarily allowed on the 101 page, though in the long run comments on it will be disallowed and existing ones hidden.  Thank you!
