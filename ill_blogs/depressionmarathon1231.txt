Wow...hard to believe it's here, the beginning of my last week of training. The race is on Saturday, June 21. I just finished a pretty good week, so it's big-time taper time. I actually finished my week with a 5K race. I like to run a short race the week before a marathon or half-marathon to speed up my legs after all that long slow training. It also gives me an idea where I'm at, which was particularly crucial this week after my last two weeks of fatigue and stress. It went well. Averaged 7:15 per mile, and I think I may have had a little too much left at the end. I could tell I had missed some mileage and tempo runs, though. I've also been having some hip pain--the hip I've had surgery on twice--which is a bit disconcerting, so I may have to swim rather than run this week. But overall I'm feeling pretty good about my preparation, and I'm looking forward to the race. Here's the rest of the summary for Week Fourteen of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program.
