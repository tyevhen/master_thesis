woke up stretching with good feeling, but could continue to sleep more, feel bored...was very tierd slept in the afernoon, but havent done nothing today....cant seem to get the motivation to get my ass out of this house...at night i felt bit better, but still not where i think i should be considering....i should probably focus more on the minor/big changes that do happen, the way i communicate and less give a #@@@ about things that are silly to give a @@@ about...optimizem is king...
