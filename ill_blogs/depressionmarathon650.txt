I can't sleep. I'm awake with worry. Specifically, I'm worried about disclosing the fact that I have depression to my new male friend, D. When exactly is the best time to tell someone that you have depression? Even though I've been relatively stable for more than six years, with the damn exception of a few months ago, I'm scared to tell him. It's the stigma. Even though I've been relatively stable, he doesn't know that. He might hear the word depression and run the other way. Yet I don't want to lie. I won't lie. But when do I have this conversation?

I haven't told him yet. I want to get to know him better, but more importantly, I want him to know me better. I figure he'll have a harder time running away if he knows the real me, but is that fair to him? Am I lying by omission?  

It is hard for me not to worry about this. And I have reason to worry. I've had other suitors run after discovering this blog. This blog, it's another thing I'm concerned about. It's one thing to tell D. I have depression, it's another to have him scour this blog for all the gory details. Do I tell him I have depression yet omit the fact that I write a blog about it? I just don't know what to do.

I'm awake with worry. I wish I wasn't. I'd much rather be peacefully sleeping. It doesn't pay to worry, as I have no control over how he will respond. But I don't want to be hurt either. I don't know what to do.
