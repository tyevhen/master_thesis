Just a brief note tonight to let you all know I continue to be busy, and things continue to go well. My mood is good. I have to keep myself from wondering when the other shoe will drop, and just enjoy the ride. I'm working hard, 31 hours per week the past two weeks, and surviving. My puppy, Jet, is as hilarious as ever. He makes me laugh, as he plays by himself, racing, rolling, and jumping around with his toys in my house, as he is right now, or in the backyard. Our crappy weather has made running challenging, but I've been getting my miles in nonetheless. And I just returned from my new, twice weekly, strength training class. We had a tough workout tonight, and I loved it. I think I may be sore tomorrow, and that's okay. Life is good right now. Depression seems relatively distant. And I kind of like it that way.
