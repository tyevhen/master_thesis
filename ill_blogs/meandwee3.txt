My friend's son Jack (15 years old!) recently worked with me to create my artist profile video...it explains a bit about why I create and how my purpose has been revealed to me. I hope you like it! Thank you Jack; you captured my personality perfectly! Follow him on Instagram! (@j.vo)...I think he's got a bright future!
