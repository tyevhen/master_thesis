Started the 15 MG today, lets see how it goes...
I'm also invited to a barbecue at friends place - was fun and went very well, I actually had fun and had some nice conversations with people.



Bought a new jacket and some awesome shirts, also went out to the beach, visited a restaurant, chat with the waitress went ok, than met a friend on the way home, invited her over with her boyfriend, sat and chatted for a while, than went out to see this show with friends was nice too.
