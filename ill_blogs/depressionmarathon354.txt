I have discovered that when one is away from home for 10+ days, there were a lot of things awaiting completion once I returned home. I've been a bit overwhelmed with the amount of items on my to-do list. Just opening my mail required half of an afternoon! And some of it is still sitting on my counter waiting to be filed or addressed. It seems every task results in two or three additional tasks. The more items I cross off my list, the more items I add! Yikes! I'm not sure I'll ever catch up.

It may sound like it, but I'm not complaining. I may be overwhelmed, but I'm overwhelmed at home! And that is an improvement. So far I'm doing fairly well. I've been spending my days at home, running errands, completing paperwork, paying bills, and running! My late evenings and overnights are still being spent 20 minutes away at my friend Wendy's home. It's a lot of traveling back and forth for Jet and I, but it is still the safest option, and I think being around others, especially at night, helps maintain my mood. It is what it is, and so far it's working.

I mentioned running. I ran the last 3 days in a row, and I have a long run, 10 miles, on my schedule for tomorrow. I'm officially in my first week of training for the Boston Marathon. My runs of 5, 4, and 3 miles have all been tough with 10 extra pounds on my frame, so I'm not sure what to expect tomorrow. I think I'll run two 5 mile loops just in case I'm not yet up to the task of ten. It may not be easy or pretty, but I'm happy to be out on the road. I'll try to be patient.

That's all for now, friends. I've got this to-do list staring at me. Thank you all for the support I received from you over these last three months. It's hard to believe I felt that bad for that long, but I'm hopeful the worst is past. That's all I can do, right? Keep the faith. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow will hopefully be better days.
