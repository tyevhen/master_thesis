I've literally been thinking about how to write this post for 2 weeks but never got around to actually writing it. I'm just going to blurt it out- S.A.D is getting to me! If you don't know what S.A.D is, it stands for seasonal affect disorder. In tash terms, it's how your mood is affected by the seasons and generally people with anxiety and/or depression will start feeling more down in the winter time. However, I'm no doctor so you can read more about it here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/

About two weeks ago I noticed my mood was starting to feel different. I was more sensitive to everything and overall just more agitated. The confusing thing about anxiety in general is that so many factors can contribute to your mood that it's really hard to really identify what the cause is.  I never realized I was affected by S.A.D. until a few years ago. Even to this day I wonder if I really am. Is it all just in my head? Ha, well that's what anxiety is anyways right? As you can tell I'm still trying to figure my stuff out.

Looking back I realized that although winter is my favourite season, a lot of my down moments happened in the winter time. It would make sense, giving that it's just overall gloomy and dark. Even people who do not have depression or anxiety feel that it's just overall gross out.

Here are my personal goals and what I'm trying out to deal with S.A.D and anxiety currently:

- Use my happy light!

- I'm trying to read more. My coworker recommended this book called Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself by Joe Dispenza. It focuses on breaking the mental habit our mind gets into. I'm still treking through it so I will have to write a review once I'm done, but I'm super excited because it was a major breaking point mentally for my coworker.

- Reading also ties into meditation. I've downloaded apps and podcasts that I try to listen to whenever the anxiety gets to me. I'm also trying to incorporate meditation into my daily routine, but I'm not there yet.

- Meditation brings me to Yoga! I'm trying to go to yoga weekly.

- Making sure I take my meditation and preferably in the morning. This is such an important factor to my mental health because missing even one can affect the chemistry in the brain. (More on medication another time).

- Making sure I don't miss my therapist appointments.

That's all I have for now.

Anyone else feeling the S.A.D.? And if so, I'd love to hear how you're coping.
