At home, with the three of us (my dad was out of town), and lots of good organic food. :-) I'll let these photo's tell the story...


Vegetarian patties


Beautiful (and natural) decoration :-)


Emilie's plate


Mom's Plate


My plate

Fresh dinner rolls


Beautiful organic onion, perfect for roasting


Organic white sweet potatoes, orange and red carrots (the red ones look orange when cooked)

Seasoned organic potatoes


I'll try and get a post up tomorrow of the beautiful Fall day I enjoyed (and photographed!) a couple of days ago.

Peace
Idzie
