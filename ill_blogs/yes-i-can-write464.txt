Well, since we hadn't seen her since our vacation, we went to visit my Grandma yesterday. We stopped at the library on the way, and I took out a couple of books by this guy called Derrick Jensen, who writes books supporting his anarcho-primitist views. Very interesting... I also tried to get the Communist Manifesto just out of curiosity, but I was in a rush and picked up Capital instead. Oh well...

The last several days, I've been having lots of debates with my mother and sister about such topics as anarcho-primitivism, anarchy, "direct action" (destructive action) and similar.

I'l l try and write tonight...
