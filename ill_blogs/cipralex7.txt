Hello my friends, first of all I’m truly sorry for the delay, I was busy up to my neck in all the wedding arrangements, work and my personal to do list… I’ve also got some bad news… seems like we’ve lost the baby after couple of weeks…the doctors say it’s a natural abortion and that sometimes it happens for unknown reasons…
so we will try again soon enough, but that meant that besides work, life and the wedding I also had to deal with this…which was not that pleasant but I must say I kept my coolness and focus and we’ve passed it ok. I think my fiancé was really proud of the way I handled it.



The wedding is approaching, mean while I don’t feel too nervous about it, at least nothing I cant handle, I still take the 10 mg cipralex and over all things are good. However a thought came to my mind to increase the dosage to 15 or 20 just for the wedding day, it’s still a lot of pressure,

but I’m not sure about that, would love to hear what you guys think. Wow, I need to read a lot of comments now… :)

Take care will post more soon.
