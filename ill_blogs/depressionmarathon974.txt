I'm at work. Slow day. Having random thoughts. My co-workers all went out for a lunch buffet. I'm scared of buffets. Luke warm food picked over by hoards of coughing, non-hand washers is just not appealing to me. For some reason I lose my appetite.

I saw my doctor yesterday. She's quite pleased the new, anti-fatigue med appears to be working. I checked my pulse a couple times yesterday and it was 68 and 72. That's not stellar for a runner, but it's better than it was on the old anti-fatigue med. Despite the average, rather than high, pulse rate, I'm still concerned the med is what made my race last weekend so tough.

Speaking of racing... I have a race tomorrow. It's a local 10K. Ten kilometers (6.2 miles) is not my favorite race distance. I'm more suited to the 5K--run fast and hold on--or the half marathon (13.1 miles)--run steady and hold on. The 10K falls somewhere in the middle. It's too long to run fast and hold on. It's too short to run steady and hold on. I'm never quite sure how to attack the distance. I'll let you know tomorrow if I figure it out.

Back to that new med... I'll let you know tomorrow how the race goes. If I feel like I'm running into the wall way too soon and much too hard, I'll be very worried about that med. It would reinforce the idea that it is affecting my ability to run fast. I hope that's not what happens, though. Since beginning that med, my mood has risen while my fatigue level has dropped. I don't want to have to decide, again, about taking a med which helps my fatigue but injures my running.

Does anyone out there watch the TV show, Dexter? I've been going through the first two seasons on DVD. I love it! Check it out if you have no idea what I'm talking about. And with that random thought, my lunch has ended. Good day, everyone!
