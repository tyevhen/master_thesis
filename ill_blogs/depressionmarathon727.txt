I called my sponsor this evening and asked, "So what's God's message in this BS?" The BS of which I was speaking was the recent piling on of unexpected, emergent, financial stressors. First, I found out I have an infection in a previously performed root canal. I don't have dental insurance. I had to go see a specialist on Tuesday. She described the procedure and detailed her financial policies. The up front, cash cost will be over 1300 dollars, and that's if everything goes perfectly. That was Tuesday.

Today I took my truck in to have some free work done on it, as Toyota had recalled a part. Unfortunately, the mechanics later informed me that my water pump, timing belt and rear brakes need to be replaced very soon. The grand total for these repairs? Around 800 dollars...! I felt my anxiety climb on the spot.

Financial stress is more stressful, anxiety producing, and worrisome than any other type of stress for me. I can hardly tolerate it. I was already trying to figure out how I would pay for my root canal repair. When told about my truck, my mind immediately began to race. Oh my God, I thought, how am I going to do this? If I pay for these things, which I have to do, I won't be able to make my house payment. If I can't make my house payment I'll get late fees. If I get late fees... It didn't take too many more thoughts such as these before I had thought myself into homelessness! It's called catastrophizing, and I drove myself crazy doing it all afternoon.

Finally, I called my sponsor. I explained what was happening. I told her how scared, overwhelmed and frustrated I was. I detailed my worries. I inquired, "What's the meaning behind this? What is God trying to tell me?" "Oh Honey," she said, "this isn't God testing you. This is life. And sometimes life sucks!" Strangely, I felt better.
