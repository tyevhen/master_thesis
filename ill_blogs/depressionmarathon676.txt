I was supposed to leave last Friday, but I wasn't ready. On Saturday I felt ready to go, but the doctor disagreed. So I didn't leave. I planned on leaving Monday after ECT #5, but my treatment team decided it felt too rushed. My mood was still too low. They encouraged me to stay until at least ECT #6. I reluctantly agreed, and here I am. I will leave tomorrow. I will leave tomorrow at 3:00 PM to be exact! And I do think I will be ready to go.

It will be day 14 of this hospitalization by the time I walk out the door. I will have spent three of the last four weeks in an inpatient psychiatric unit. It wasn't my plan. I think back to early February, to my sobriety anniversary party, and to how great I was feeling then; to how great I had been feeling for months! It was only a few short weeks later when this depression episode, this relapse, began. Ironic. And amazing. It just goes to show how rapidly this illness can drag a person down.

I do feel better today. The mood dive that began last Thursday seems to have lifted a bit. I felt lighter after my treatment yesterday, and despite not sleeping well last night, I still feel lighter today. I am freaked out by how much fitness I am losing lying around in here, but even that makes me think I'm getting better. I didn't care enough to be freaked out about it last week. I am going to try to run on the treadmill today, but I can't wait to get back outside!

Tomorrow. I will be back outside tomorrow. And the next time you hear from me, I will be free; free of the confines of this healing place, and hopefully free of more of the darkness of the past 9 weeks.
