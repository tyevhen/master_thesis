This illness never ceases to amaze me. Things have been going well. I've been feeling well. My mood has been stable. It's been good. Until today. Today I awoke deep in the pit. Just like that.

There's no reason for the plunge. It's just part of the illness, I guess. I know that. But it still never ceases to amaze me how fast things can switch.

I awoke feeling low. Not sad, not angry, not frustrated...just low. And hopeless...that's how I knew it was my depression acting up. The hopelessness was the clue. My energy level matched my mood. I felt like a wet dish rag with nothing to offer anyone.

I tried to go about my day. I had set my alarm early in order to make it to the gym before work, but I couldn't get out of bed. After getting up I dragged myself around my house, worked a few hours, and then hit the gym at lunch. Once again, I just couldn't go. My 45 minute bike ride ended after only 25 minutes, and my effort was poor at best. I made it to a dental appointment before dragging home and climbing into bed. My day, as far as I was concerned, was done.

Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), Puck doesn't understand depression. He woke me up for dinner by wagging his tail against my bed. Depression or not, my boy still needed to eat! So here I sit. My head hurts. My body aches. My energy remains low. I plan to finish my bike ride even though the thought of it is overwhelming. If nothing else, I'll take Puck for a slow walk. I don't want to, but he needs care despite how I feel.

I feel like I need to attack this with whatever energy I can muster. I'm scared of it lasting beyond a day. I know it may last longer, but I also know it will pass. It will pass. I can't tell you how many times I repeated those three words today. It will pass. Damn, I wish it had never arrived.
