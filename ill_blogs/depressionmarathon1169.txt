I had just arisen. It was a beautiful, fall, Tuesday morning. As a full-time PT who worked four ten hour shifts, I always looked forward to my Tuesday's off. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, as I opened the back door to allow Puck to escape. Wandering sleepily back into the kitchen, I clicked on the counter top TV. I had just straightened up after fetching Puck's rations from a bottom cabinet when something surreal flashed before my eyes. "What the," I asked aloud? I turned up the volume. The Good Morning America hosts--apparently I hadn't taken the time to flip to SportsCenter yet--were similarly dumbfounded. I stood there frozen, Puck's food in hand, as we all tried to figure out what we'd witnessed. They, horrified in a New York studio, and me, horrified in a small Midwestern kitchen, hungry dog yipping at the door; we all waited and wondered. It was 8:02 AM central time.

The replay came, and it was all too clear. A plane had just flown directly into the south tower of the World Trade Center, live, on national television. Horrifying scenes of Columbine, which also occurred on a Tuesday, flashed through my brain. Sirens, screams, gasps, and silence followed--TV hosts silent, without words. Tears filled my eyes. I couldn't leave the TV. There I was in my bright, sunny, serene kitchen holding my dog's food in my hands. It was a beautiful, fall day, and I was witnessing over 2000 people from 80 countries dying right before my eyes. It is a moment I will never forget.

Today, I am flying my American flag in honor and remembrance of the tens of thousands of lives needlessly shattered by hate. Join me. Pray for compassion. Pray for tolerance. Pray for peace.
