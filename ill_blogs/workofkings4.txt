A long long time ago, I had a vision of how things ought to work in the world. I'd been working on the implementation of ancient Hermetic experiments in the pursuit of the accomplishment of the Great Work.

I reached a particular phase of the Work, found liberty and joy, and I understood in that moment how to create a life worth living, worth enjoying within the time we have here...

But I also saw the crippled state of my fellow humans upon the Earth. What a sad lot we are. Jealous, angry, bitter, broke. Confused and distracted by hormones and hate, we build ourselves up one minute and tear ourselves down the next.

It hurt, a little. I understood in that moment the reasons behind the boddhisattva vow, the Rosicrucian injunction to heal the World, and why the Philosopher's Stone is the panacea.

So it's time I started the Projection phase of the Great Work. It was time to leave behind the "Head for the Red" blog, which I had started to track my pursuit of the Stone. It's time to move onward into the future, to do what needs to be done, to set my hand to the work it found, and to accomplish my Will and to speak my Word.

And that's what this blog will be all about: my Great Work. Spreading some truth that I hope sets some people free. Spreading some means and methods to be a little better than we were before. Spreading some ways to make a pile of cash so you don't have to worry about money anymore. Spreading some technology that brings your heart some peace in healthy relationships.

We'll wander away from the occult vocabulary here, and into frank and clear statements that are meaningful and useful. We'll be cutting the crap, and getting to the meat of the matter here, transformation of the self, self-awareness, and all that resembles it.

My Great Work is the Work of Kings.
