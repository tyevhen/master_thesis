I am writing from D's house in Milwaukee. I just arrived here after a full day of work. We are off to Mexico first thing tomorrow morning. I am so excited! I can't wait to spend 5 full days with D. I think that will count as the longest streak of consecutive days spent together in our entire relationship! I am looking forward to warm sun, warm sand, and warm ocean water in which to relax. I don't really care if we do anything else once we get there. I'm just looking forward to being there together. Of course, I did bring my running shoes, but so did he, so we will even be able to do that together. I will try to update my blog while there, but if you don't hear from me, have no fear. I will fill you in as soon as I get back! Take care, my friends!
