I don’t know why but in a way today is a special day for me. What made it special is you guys that visit my blog, read, write and interact. I've read the latest comments from you guys, seems like we're all in this together, it made me feel even better, it made me go back in time and think about how much I've been through… and it’s a lot, its amazing, If you would told me that this is where I'll be today before I've started treating myself with cipralex I wouldn't believe you for sure.


Taking cipralex was a very hard decision to make. But what convinced me most was something that an old man once told me…no guys he wasn't Chinese…sorry :)


Anyways, he said, sometimes "…to solve a serious problem – you have to think outside of the box… " – sounds good but how do you get outside your own mind? How can you trick yourself? At the first time I actually agreed (with myself) to go for it and try this drug, this sentence was echoing in my head… this is exactly how you think outside the box, get out of your ordinary routine way of thinking about things and change it.


I know not all of you know what I'm talking about, I want you guys to watch this lecture,
It opened my mind to many things…
It by Joe Dispenza, the video titled: "Evolve Your Brain- The Science of Changing Your Mind"


I know you'll enjoy it and learn a lot.


In terms of side-effects...I truly have none...feeling good since I've switched to 20 mg... doc said to keep at it at least for the next three months...than we'll see what happens...


Talk to you soon guys, thanks for what you write!
