It’s been one full year since I started this blog!  (On November 15th)  I’m pretty proud of myself, I’m not gonna lie.

If you didn’t know, I started this blogyish thing last year because I was wigging out about the upcoming holidays.  For many reasons, the holiday season can exaggerate the symptoms of those who struggle with mental illness – and make normal people do crazy stuff.

Looking back on those inaugural posts, I am surprised by my sarcasm.  I felt so insecure about publishing my writing on the internet.  Who am I that other people would read me stuff?  I still feel that way, but I am less sarcastic because I have so much I want to say.

This whole year, I’ve just wanted to scream on the rooftops that mental illness is real and it hurts – but it’s beatable.  You don’t have to settle for a mediocre life – you can have a nourishing life.

I’ve tried to bring you with me on this journey.  And that’s why my posts are as different as my changing moods.  I’ve tried to make you cry with me, laugh with me, rejoice, or rally with me.

I think, on the whole, I’ve really just wanted to empower you by giving you information.  I believe knowledge is not only powerful, but self-awareness is sanctifying.

Anniversaries are a good time to take a step back and assess how far we’ve come, what has changed, and how we’ve grown.  Even though some days I feel like I’m at square one, I can still look back and acknowledge all the progress I’ve made.

Below are five (so difficult to choose!) of my favorite posts from this year.

The post that started it all!!!
  The post that I published when I stopped counting and decided to be in it for the long hull

Milestone, not to be confused with Coldstone…yum…

For all you Lord of the Rings fans out there…oh wait…that just me: the “Smeagol” post

And, to end on a humorous note, the “funny thing and the forum” whatever post
  I hope you have a nourishing week.
See you again soon!
