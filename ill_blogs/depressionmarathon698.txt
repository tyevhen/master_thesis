Life is moving forward for everyone, it seems, but me. I am stuck in a holding pattern. I've been able to do little over the past several days. My mood remains quite low, and my thoughts quite dark. I've been in constant contact with either my sponsor, my social worker, my psychologist or my doctor. They've each lent a hand. I've talked with my sponsor almost daily, and we've gone to a couple of AA meetings together. My doctor adjusted my meds. That seems to have helped the thinking just a bit. My social worker came and sat with me on a particularly dark and scary afternoon. That was helpful. And my psychologist has reassured me more than once over the phone. But mostly, I've spent my time curled up and covered up on my sofa with Puck lying at my feet.  

I've got friends offering to take me into their homes. I haven't gone, not out of stubbornness or self-pity, but because I'd have to put on that slight smile and be minimally sociable, even though they know I feel like crap. That prospect is overwhelming, so I've stayed at home. At least here I can just be. I am in familiar surroundings with no expectations. That's about all I can handle for now. I can't cook. I can't clean. I don't want to talk on the phone. I can barely shower. Sleep, right now, seems my only respite.

I'm holding on. That's all I can do. I'm working with the people with whom I need to work. I'm grateful to have trustworthy people who are willing to work with me, too. Together, we will get through. I know that. But for now, I'm just holding on.
