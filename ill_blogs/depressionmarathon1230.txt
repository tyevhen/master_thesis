I got knocked flat
by memories
Memories I didn't want
to recall

Tearful feelings
kept me down
Feelings I didn't want
to feel

Familiar voices
in my head
Voices I didn't want
to return


Thoughts. Thoughts.
I should have...
If only I...
She could have...

Questions. Questions.
What if...
Why not...
How come...

Overwhelmed.
Mournful.
Sad.
Confused.

Grief. Grief.
