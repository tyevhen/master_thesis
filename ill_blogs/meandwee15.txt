Yep! I'm working on a whole lotta paintings of baby animals and pets! I'm doing a whole series of 5 x 5 inch acryla gouache paintings on Aquabord in fun colors...the plan is to also include a little easel for each painting to stand on. So cute for nurseries! Any animals you wanna see? I've got a huge list I'd like to do.
I'm also plotting and planning a series of large calming coastal-inspired landscapes with seabirds. Those I plan to paint quite large and in charge. It's gonna be a busy April!!!




 This one is in progress...
