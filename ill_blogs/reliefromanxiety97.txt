It's the beginning of a new year and lots of people are setting goals. Below, I have shared some of my goals for this year including some of the items on my bucket list. Here's a snippet:

5 goals for this year

I have hundreds more on my list, but these are just some I have shared with you. I hope you've managed to take some inspiration from this. I've always thought that by setting yourself goals, it provides you with the courage to keep on going and to complete things that truly make you happy.

What are your goals? Let me know in the comments.

Keep fighting,
