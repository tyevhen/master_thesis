Internet, help meeeeeeee!!!!
YUCK.
As I mentioned last time, Paige has a bad cold and cough. Every little sniffle and cough seems to trigger a throw-up session. No, not just a little gag or spit up. It goes like this:

"My name is Paige and I'm cute. Oooh, I seem to need to sniff. *sniff* ahem. ahem. cough. COUGH. COOOUUUUUGGGGGHHHH. GAG. gaaag. gaaaag.
-1, maybe 2 seconds pass-

*little barf*
*barf*
*BIG BARF* pause
*BIG BARF* pause pause...maybe I'm done
nope. *BIG BARF* *BIG BARF* *BIG BARF*

*Pathetic whimper*"

All of this happens without much warning or time to run for cover and it's usually when I'm holding her. She barfs ALL OVER herself and me. No joke, my glasses were covered, my entire outfit soaked through to the skin. And Paige...well...you can't even recognize who she is under the goo. She looks like Carolanne after she falls out of the weird ghost warp hole as a slimy mess in Poltergeist. So, I run to the kitchen where the floor is easy to clean and I peel off her clothes and then mine and I jiggety jig around the house to the bathroom upstairs where we both shiver as I give her a quick bath and I jump in the shower for 2 seconds to wash the mess off (after her bath of course) and out of my hair. Jiggety Jig Jiggety Jig!!! I then run all twinkle toes trying not to fall on my bare saggy butt as I try to find clothes for the both of us...all the while leaving a wet footprint trail.
I think this is so far a once per day occurance. At least on the weekend it happens to Chris. (hee hee.) Sorry honey. At least I'm there to help you when it happens to YOU. So, it's fair that I can make a little joke. :)
Will this vomit fest ever end? Will Little P starve? Will she keep her antibiotics down? (minor ear infection). AAAAGGH!
