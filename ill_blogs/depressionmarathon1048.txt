She says my expectations are too high. I expect too much from myself. I don't think so. She says feeling frustrated and distressed when depression holds me down is normal. But my psychologist doesn't think most people get as distressed as I. Maybe so. I know feeling distressed about feeling depressed is not helpful. I can't help it. I do expect...I've already compromised enough to this fucking illness. I don't think expectations are bad, but today I think it may be her expectations which are too high.

Depression has me pinned. She wanted me outside by noon. It's after one o'clock, and the world outside my window feels a million miles away. I need to rest. I need to run. I need to sleep. I need to eat. I need to convalesce. I need to clean. One appointment already gone, cancellation of another will be next. Each failure adds to the distress. Depression has me pinned.

to be cont...
