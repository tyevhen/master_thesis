I've decided I'm going to go ahead and run my local marathon this Sunday. My running has been going fairly well. I think I'm fully recovered from Boston. And I'm feeling good. Why not run it? I'm hoping to run better, and feel better, than I ran and felt in Boston, but I also don't want to over do it. I'm focusing on having a good effort at Grandmas Marathon in June, so I don't want to run so hard I jeopardize that. I'd like to use this as another long training run. At the same time, I know myself, and if I'm feeling good on Sunday, I'll likely go for it despite my best laid plans. It will be an adventure either way. I'm looking forward to it.
