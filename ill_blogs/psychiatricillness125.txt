I spent Â£200 on new clothes last weekend, I bought a suit and some new tops to go with the suit. It is a good job too as when I went to work on Monday it became apparent that I would need to go to Paris for the day on Thursday.

I am in a lovely hotel and have a view out over the city. I can see the eiffel tower from my window!
