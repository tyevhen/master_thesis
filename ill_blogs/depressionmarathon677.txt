You know what they say about the best laid plans... I had planned to go home yesterday. I was packed and ready. Then the doctor came in. She didn't like how sad I had been. She was concerned about my thinking. She didn't see the need to rush out the door. She didn't let me leave. Instead, I am here until at least Monday, when I will have my fifth ECT treatment. I say "at least" because I don't know if I'll be allowed to go tomorrow either. My mood has really been in the tank since Thursday, and that seems to be of great concern. I guess that makes sense.

Despite it making sense, I'm not happy to still be here. My low mood is greatly concerning to me, too, but I still want to go home. Fortunately, the MD gave me a pass yesterday to go for a 45 minute run outside with a friend. Passes are rarely allowed these days, so I felt very fortunate to be outdoors, freely running, breathing fresh air, and sharing time with my friend. I can't wait to get out of here and do it again!

I hope to get out of here tomorrow. I'm not sure what else I can accomplish here that I couldn't accomplish as an outpatient. Yes, as I was sobbing myself to sleep last night, it was nice to have someone sit with me. But I can sob myself to sleep without a sitter as well. If I have to sob myself to sleep, I'd rather do it in a comfortable bed.

Like I said, I am sad. Just plain sad. I wonder when this episode will end. I worry this episode will have no end. I am trying to stay positive; trying to stay present, but it's tough keeping those negative thoughts at bay. I pray for a boost in my mood soon. As more and more time passes, I feel more and more disappointed and discouraged. I want to be better. I want to get back to my life. I want to feel like me again. I don't want to feel so sad. I don't want to feel so sad...
