So what if it's 45 degrees, gray, blowing, and soon to be very wet! I've got the first of four golf lessons tonight. Because I don't have enough to do, right?! Well, it will be fun. I'm going with my step-dad. Until last year, he hadn't golfed in 20 years. Me? I'm a beginner. I had some lessons about 6-7 years ago, but then I didn't play until last year, so I forgot most of what I'd learned. I'm looking forward to learning the correct way to play, despite the weather.

I'm feeling better. Still a little off, still need lots of sleep, and now I have a nasty cough, but my congestion has cleared up. Yesterday I overdid it. I rode a really hilly bike workout for 50 minutes. Immediately afterward I crashed! My muscles ached. I felt feverish. I got a stabbing headache. I guess my body wasn't quite ready for that level of effort yet. I went straight to bed--after taking some Advil--and that helped so much that I was able to go for a slow 20 minute run later in the evening. Puck was thrilled with that.

Puck still has me concerned. I wonder if he doesn't have arthritis in his feet. Over the past week, he limped on one leg for a few days and then limped on another for a few days after that. I've upped his arthritis med, and today he seems to be walking equally on all four. But he's not himself. Any exercise leaves him sore, yet he goes stir crazy without exercise. I just don't know what to do. Damn, I wish he could talk!

Work went well today. I'm getting used to all the paperwork, but it's still a lot to remember. My mood seems to be okay, too, despite the stress of being sick and learning a new job. I'm hanging in there. I hope you are, too.
