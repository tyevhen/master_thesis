Just got in from a 5.3 mile run here in the mountains. At 8000 feet, 5.3 miles at 9:30 pace feels like 10 miles at 8:00 pace. It may be beautiful, but it is all work. This is the third day in a row I've gone running, which makes me feel good, but like I said, it's tough up here. The first time I went, I made it almost 4 miles, but I thought my chest was going to explode! Yesterday, I did 6 hill repeats of about 150 yards each. I'm not sure what got into me! So today was a "long" run. Ha! Oh well, at least I've been getting out there. I do feel better once I'm finished.

I'm hoping to do a little hiking with Puck today. There is a nearby peak which takes about an 1.5 hours to summit. It's a fairly simple hike, so Puck should be okay. He sure is loving it out here. He's doing very well. No injuries. In fact he almost seems stronger than when we first arrived. I love watching him romp around freely. I love hiking with him, too, so that should be fun.

My mood has been better the past couple days. Hmmm...do you think the fact that I've been running daily has anything to do with that? We've been very mellow and relaxed around here. Bill's family has left, so it's just the three of us (and the two dogs) left up here. There's been a lot of chatting, napping, laughing, eating, napping, walking, reading, and napping going on. The days have been cool and sunny. The nights have been clear and the stars incredible. I think it's going to be tough to go back home!

That's all I've got for now. After all, I think it's time for a nap! Have a peaceful day.
