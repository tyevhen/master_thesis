...We finally (after much fussing and setting up the tripod and figuring out how to do timed photo's on my camera and setting up an extra lamp for more light and taping a piece of paper over the lamp to soften the light and squabbling with each other) got a photo of my family that we were all actually reasonably happy with!



Yay! And yes, I look weird because I had to squish in really fast 'cause I'd just hit the button on the camera and it was counting down! :-P Trust me, it's better then the others, which were almost all blurry...

Peace,
Idzie
