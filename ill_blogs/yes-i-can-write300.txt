Leaving for NBTSC tomorrow morning, and will be back on the 26th, hopefully with cool pictures. Feeling draggy, clogged up, and like just curling up under a blanket with a warm cup of tea and not going anywhere. Yes, I seem to be coming down with a cold. I've already had loads of very sweet suggestions for cold-fighting things to eat and do (zinc, vitamin C, garlic, honey, no sugar, no greasy food, drinking lots of water, etc. etc.), so hopefully this will pass fast!

Have a good week everyone!

Peace,
Idzie
