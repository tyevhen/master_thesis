I'm still here. It's been a week since I checked in. That's longer than I prefer to be away, but life has been incredibly tough lately. Depression has me. It's holding on so tight I can't slip free. I'm confined. I'm constricted. I'm struggling. I'm exhausted. I could care less about anything and everything. I'm sad, and overwhelmed, and barely functioning. Functioning? I'm barely moving.

One thing. That's all I've been able to do. I have continued to get to work. That's it. My house. My body. My exercise routine. My chores. My errands. All of it, other than work, has been totally neglected. It's getting ugly around here. The uglier it gets, the more overwhelmed I get, and the more suffocating my depression gets. I can't breathe. Fuck depression! Fuck it.
