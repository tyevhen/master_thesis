Hi friends!
I finally got around to editing some of my favorite pictures from our recent fifth wedding anniversary trip to Acadia National Park in Maine. I took 500 some-odd photos! Crazy.
Here are a tiny few; I can't say enough good things about that place. It's just gorgeous and so wonderful to hike. So much to see! I hope you enjoy these images and that perhaps they inspire you to visit!
