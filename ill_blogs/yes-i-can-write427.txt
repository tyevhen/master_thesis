Ages ago, like the beginning of this blog ages ago, I started a collage on my wall and put pictures of it on here. When I got home from NBTSC, I added a painting I had made there and that I'm now getting around to showing on here. Actually, I believe in my Not Back To School Camp post I actually have a picture of the painting in progress... It's abstract, and nothing special really, but somehow it just really appeals to me. *Shrugs*




I also took pictures of my family today. Below are Emi fresh from a shopping trip today, and wearing her brand new gloves which she loves, and my father. They are both made of pure awesomeness. :-)


Peace,
