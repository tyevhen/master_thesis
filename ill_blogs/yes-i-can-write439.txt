It's a bit of a hobby of mine to read baby name books. I love words, and I really love names! I have an ever changing list of awesome names I wouldn't mind naming my kid someday, as well as names that I really like, even though I don't like them quite enough to actually use them... Here is a list of some names that start with A or B (if I did all the letters, the list would be miles long!) that I currently think are awesome. The ones with a * are my absolute favorites.

Boys:
Aaron
Adrian*
Aidan*
Alaric
Ash*
Azra
Azure

Birch*
Blaze*
Bracken*
Briar
Brown
Byrd*

Girls:
Acacia*
Aeryn
Amara
Amber*
Amy*
Anais
Anouk
Ara
Aria*
Ariadne*
Ariane
Arrian*
Ash
Asha
Aspen*
Atara
Auburn
Autumn*
Ava*
Avari
Ayla*
Azure

Batu
Belle
Blaze
Bliss*
Blue
Blythe*
Bracken*
Briana
Briar
Brook*
Brynn*

My sister strongly disapproves of many of these names... She seems to be a bit more traditional in terms of names she likes than I am. *Grins* But doesn't a name like Adrian Byrd or Autumn Brook sound just marvelous? I really hope my kids don't hate me for whatever names they end up with!

I'd love to hear some of your favorite names, so please do comment!

Peace,
Idzie :-)
