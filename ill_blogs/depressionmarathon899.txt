I was shocked this morning to hear of the death of a local musician whom I liked very much--musically and personally. He was a past member of my church. He was also familiar with several of the topics covered in this blog. (I am purposefully being vague, as I don't know how open he was about his personal life.) According to news reports, he was found dead in his home over the weekend. One may speculate, but at this point it is unclear how he died. He was only 51 years old. Talented, gentle, kind--yet, from what I knew, a bit of a tortured soul. Hopefully, his soul is now resting peacefully.
