We arrived in Colorado yesterday afternoon after about 15 hours on the road. It was an uneventful drive, and we took our time doing it. As the sun comes up this morning, I am looking out over snow capped peaks and "purple mountains majesty." What makes them appear purple, I wonder? Actually, this morning, very early, a whole lower range appeared orange. It was strange and incredible. It certainly is beautiful out here.

Puck is loving the freedom of roaming the rocks, prairies and meadows. He's on a leash or tie-out at all times at home, so being free to roam is quite new to him. He's growing so old so fast these days, it's nice for me to see him gallivanting around. His ball days have been over since his second ACL repair two years ago, and I think his running days are coming to an end, too. (He injured his right wrist one month ago, and it hasn't been the same since.) I'm so grateful Bill and Cindy allowed him to come.

We've got no plans for the day. I really like that. Probably, we'll get in some fishing. I'm going to try to go for a short run. We're at 8000 feet, so 20 minutes up here can feel like 20 miles. I'm going to set my sights on 20 minutes and allow myself the freedom to be satisfied with that. If I do a little bit every day I'll be happy.

That's all for now. I'll post pics as I take them. Have a restful day!
