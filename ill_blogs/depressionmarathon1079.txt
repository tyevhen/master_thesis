Silly, silly woman!
Who did you think you were anyway? Thought you had gotten rid of me? HA! Never!
You thought all that yoga and mindful eating was going to cure everything, didn't you? You were playing with those thoughts, weren't you?
Heh, heh...Actually, I was just playing with you, as I think you are now aware.
I was just having some fun at your expense. Allowing your mind to entertain the possibility...the remote possibility that all this happy, goody, loving, spiritual crap was going to make it all go away.
You were getting a bit carried away! I had to come back and reign you in!

Ahhh, c'mon! Don't be mad!
This is our relationship. Tit for tat, remember?
I let you have a little energy, enthusiasm, and hope. In exchange, I get at least a few days of you flat on your back--wiped out. That's the deal.
Besides, it was fun for you, wasn't it? I know you enjoyed that energy, that hope. I know you did! Hell, you even "forgot" your meds more than once! (Didn't think I noticed that, did you? I did.)

Boo, hoo...you're frustrated and discouraged. Cry me a river!
What about me? How do you think I felt these past 4 weeks? You were running around all happy and shit. How do you think that made me feel? Miserable, that's how! Did you ever think of that? Think about me for once! I sacrificed so you could feel hope!
Well, that's over now. It's my turn again.
This is our relationship--your bliss is my pain. Your pain is my bliss. I don't care that you never agreed to the arrangement! It is our arrangement, nonetheless. Accept it!
You'll never be rid of me! Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Now, shut-up and go back to bed!
