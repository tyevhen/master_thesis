Trick or Treating was postponed until last night in our town; due to Hurricane Sandy. The kids (Paige) was crazy-excited. She'd decided to be a Peacock long ago. I decided Noah needed to be Yoda because the costume was beyond cute. I was proud how she wasn't afraid to go right up to each door and yell "Trick or Treat!" in her best voice. She even said "thank you" after each treat. Score! And I'm not the least bit worried about what to do with all the candy. We're going to eat every last bit of it. Boo-yaaaah! Here's a slew of photos; you can tell what's happening in them so I'll spare you the play-by-play! See you here soon!
