A Story


When life becomes too much, the act of living too suffocating. 
I would read, reading was my therapy. I like to think of myself as an escape artist.
I made the best of a terrible situation, by pretending it away.
Pretending, I was better and more than I am; being a dragon slayer or heroine in some story. 
Was a far cry better than the weak, unassuming floor mat I was back in reality. 
Somewhere along the line, words started meaning more to me than people.
Words didn't hurt or berate me, people did.
I got realities confused.
I became a story.
A jumble of words, that nobody ever bothered to read.
