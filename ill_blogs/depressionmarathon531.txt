I seem to have come down with something post marathon. Sunday evening, one day after the race, my throat began getting sore. It's only gotten worse, though not terrible, since then. It feels like a lingering, low-grade cold or flu. I'm glad it's not worse than it is, but it's still no fun. I haven't done a lick of exercise since the marathon, which is actually okay. I needed a break. I have made it to work both days this week, but I spent my off day yesterday down and out.

I'm hoping to wake up tomorrow feeling better. My parents are in town for one week, and I'd really like to spend some quality time with them. Hmmm...that's the second thing I've written that I never would have written prior to my growth and change, which has been a direct result of sobriety and surviving this illness. Prior to this illness and prior to getting sober, I would have stayed home from work for a stubbed toe! Likewise, I doubt I ever would have expressed an interest in spending "quality time" with my parents. But I've grown up over the last 12 years.

Dealing with depression has changed my life. I've lost a lot. This illness is relentless in its consumption. It's been no picnic. My life looks nothing like it used to. Yet, I am a better person because of it. It sounds so cliche, but in my case it actually is true. I am a kinder, gentler, more forgiving, more responsible, grateful soul. Go figure. Something positive has come out of the darkness. I'm grateful for that.
