Tonight was the big night. I spoke at my AA home group tonight. I was so nervous it was rather ridiculous. I spent more hours than I care to admit typing up my life's path this afternoon, but I'm glad I did. Being prepared helped tonight.

I think it went well. I was anxious about talking about depression in conjunction with my AA talk, but I did it anyway and received a lot of very positive feedback for doing so. I also gave a shout out to my mental health treatment team. Psychiatrists and psychologists are often derided by hardcore AA'ers who think AA should cure everything that ails us. Again, I received a lot of positive feedback from others who admitted to using "outside help." So it was a success, and I'm relieved.

It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, and the positive feedback felt really good. Like I said, I'm relieved. I'm so grateful to have found a community of wonderful, sober, healthy and fun people. I never would have thought any of this possible just a few short years ago. If you're struggling with alcohol, I encourage you to seek help. If I can do it, anybody can.
