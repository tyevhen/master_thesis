This horrifying picture is of an apparently obscenely drunk 28-year-old male killing one athlete and injuring 10 others as he drove head-on into a bicycle race just south of the US-Texas border Sunday. The man, who reports he is a US citizen from Brownsville, TX, stated, "I must have fallen asleep."
I have an idea how to punish this man, but I try to maintain a civilized blog, so I'll keep it to myself (for now)...
