Inevitably, the habits that transform a diligent grad student into a miserable grad student are the very same ones that turned me into an errant blogger. So, I apologize to all of you who have missed their preferred source of procrastination for the last few weeks. But I'm more or less back. I don't promise you anything. But here I am nonetheless.

I can't say that things have been particularly good in the interim. Somewhere in the drudgery of it all, I lost my sense of humor. And while problems viewed through a fun-house mirror are hilarious and entertaining, those same problems when viewed through a department store dressing-room mirror are a burden for all to witness. That's probably why I stopped writing. But for the sake of all involved, I will try to re-find my sense of humor. If I can find my glasses after losing them under my bed for a year and a half, I can certainly find my missing humor. If nothing else, I'm sure I can buy one used on Craigslist.
