what can I do? i know the instructions say you should not drink alchol while on escitalopram (cipralex) but how can you live in today society without an occaisocal beer with friends, anyways yesterday I had to drink some beer with friends,



and since i've drank only one glass it was ok, however I became very tierd and a bit out of focus(more than i would normally be after beer) and my stomch hurt a little, but after couple of hours it was manageable and i'll do it again, but you can't drink too much and wine is out of the question, if you can choose, got with the ones with the less percentage of alchol in them.
have fun!
