2 days ago Paige randomly would stand up and take several steps at a time; much to our surprise and delight. She does it more and more through the day now and I managed to capture one of those random moments here! This is one of the longest stretches of walking for her yet (not holding anything, that is). She seems so nonchalant about it. I can't get over those little spindly legs.
