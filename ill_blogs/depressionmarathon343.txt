I'm transitioning back to my "normal" life today. Yesterday was the last day of my two week mood disorder program at Mayo Clinic. It was a good program. I liked it. It helped. I was very lucky. My fellow group members and I meshed quickly and easily. There was a high level of trust, disclosure and support between us. With the assistance of our excellent group leaders, we did an enormous amount of work with each other. It was a very good experience.

That being said, I am happy to be home, sitting with my feet up, sipping my coffee this morning. I am getting prepared to run, in the morning hours, as I usually do. My running was definitely affected by the 8-hour per day programming over the past two weeks. Besides not being able to run in the morning, as I typically would have done, the mood program was mentally and physically exhausting.
By the time I returned home in the late afternoon, going for a run was difficult. I am proud I was able to stick to my running schedule, but I am looking forward to some easier, more comfortable runs now that I will be more rested.

Things are generally going well. My parents are here visiting right now, as my step-father's granddaughter is getting married. They are not thrilled with the below zero temperatures, as they spend the winter in the warm, southern U.S. I am not thrilled with my mother chattering in my ear as I try to write this, so if this post is a bit disjointed, blame my mom! I'm kidding. I am glad they are here. It's nice to see them in the middle of the winter, as I usually don't see them for many months between Fall and Spring. They are pretty happy to see me doing so well.

Well, it's time to run. It's cold and snowing, so it looks like I may be forced indoors onto the "dreadmill." It takes a lot to force me indoors, but today that's probably where I'll be. Regardless, it will be nice to be back on my normal schedule. That alone should make for a good run and a good day. Have a great day, my friends!
