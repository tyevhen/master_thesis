Today.

Twenty-four years ago
today.

it was the end.
and I was so, so relieved.

I can still feel that
relief.



Today.

Twenty-four years ago
today.

I didn't end.
and yet, I was so relieved.

I can still feel that
relief
too.


Happy
re-birth-day
to
me



...if you consider suicide an option
I get it.
please, call someone.
anyone.
now.
