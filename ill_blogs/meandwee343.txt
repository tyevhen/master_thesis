I am in LOVE with this post by SouleMama. As someone who formally studied art, I'm really looking forward to the time when Paige shows an interest in coloring, drawing, and art in general. She still has a hard time using her hands to pick up small items so now isn't the time to introduce it. But, that particular post really inspired me on how to get things rolling when the time is right...it will be such a great opportunity for fun, confidence and pride-building, and for making choices (not to mention the development of fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination).
I had to share it with you and I hope you enjoy it!
