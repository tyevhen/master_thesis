Lately, it seems that many people have been surprised when I say I'm shy... Because I'm always very open/honest, people seem to think that that somehow cannot go along with introversion! And that assumption that I'm not shy, because of my openness, is not a good thing, since my shy behavior is then interpreted as me being aloof, distant, bored, or not liking the person in question, none of which are true!

Because I've recently discovered that multiple people have mis-judged me in this way, I've been thinking about it a lot... It bothers me, since I'm a very social person in many ways, and really do love people in general, so I want to come across as friendly, not bored! Sometimes my natural shyness annoys the f**k out of me.

I've also been thinking of how my honesty/openness relates to my shy side, and I've realized that it's kind of my attempt to balance things out. Since people can't usually figure me out simply be meeting or talking to me, and can often get the wrong impression of me, I'm very, very truthful when I talk or write about myself. I explain why I am the way I am, why I behave in certain ways, how I really feel, in the hopes that I can be understood better.

By the way, having recently taken the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality thingy (thanks to Michael for the link! :-)), and having come up with INFJ, I blame everything on my rather unusual personality type. ;-)

Hope you guys don't mind my mini-rant/explanation/this rather pointless post. :-P

Peace,
Idzie
