Another tired, tough day. Except for the time spent in the doctor and dentist offices, I spent most of the day in bed. My first appointment of the day was with my psychiatrist. Guess what we discussed? Yup, fatigue. I'm so tired, I even agreed to give another anti-fatigue med a try. If you've been following along, you know that I quit taking the previous stimulating med because it elevated my pulse and made running virtually impossible. I quit that drug in December, and by spring my resting pulse rate had dropped from 90-100 bpm to around 60 bpm. It's no coincidence that my running improved significantly this year as well. My doc and I are hoping this drug, a cousin of the original, will cure the fatigue and won't have the same side effect. Please, God, let that be so!
