"This is when you must have faith," she said. "Even though it doesn't feel better in the moment, the cumulative effect of getting out and exercising will be positive." I had just explained how painful it was to go to my favorite state park and feel nothing, which is exactly what happened on Saturday. I made the effort. I went to a place I love. I expected it would help. It didn't. Nonetheless, my therapist encouraged me to continue getting out despite this unmet expectation of relief.

It's so hard to get out when getting out is not reinforcing. If I feel no benefit from something which used to bring multiple benefits, how can I continue to do it? Why would I continue doing it? Isn't that a bit like banging one's head against a wall? Except instead of BANG--OUCH, BANG--OUCH, I get BANG--NOTHING, BANG--NOTHING. The whole point of forcing myself out is to feel something...anything, please! Right now, I'm feeling nothing. Nothing is not reinforcing.

As usual, my therapist is correct, I think. On some level I think I know that. Yet, I don't trust it to be true. How do I know for sure that getting out--exercising--will eventually bring relief? How do I know it will ever feel good again? Why can't it feel good now? Why do I have to wait? How can I be expected to continue pushing when pushing yields no results? I want to believe her. I want to have faith, but faith is a leap.

Positive steps should yield positive results. I know I have to keep pushing myself. I know I have to trust in the cumulative effect, just like she said. I have to take that leap of faith--one day, one moment, one action at a time. Unfortunately, the hole of nothingness has swallowed me whole, and positive reinforcement feels a long, long way away.
