I am just back from a good treadmill run at my gym. Although my left knee continues to bother, the pain is much improved. On Thursday, after applying Kinesiotape, I was able to run 10, 2 minute segments with one minute walk breaks. I iced it down immediately following that run, and I recovered nicely. Yesterday I rode my recumbent, stationary bike without difficulty, so I decided to try a bit more challenging run today.

This morning I ran 5, 6-8 minute segments with one minute walk breaks for a total of 5.1 miles, and I felt good. My knee was a little sore, but I was able to run without altering my gait. I'm hopeful I am on the mend. If I recover well today, without any increased soreness, I will try a longer, slow run outside tomorrow.

We're finally going to be out of the deep freeze tomorrow, so it will be nice to spend time outdoors with Jet. It's sunny and crisp today, but too cold to spend much time outside. By the way, my mood continues to be sunny, too. I feel better and better everyday. The darkness of January hasn't been forgotten, but it's getting further and further from my mind. I'm enjoying the freedom of feeling well. I have enough energy to work, exercise, get to my meetings, and even socialize a bit. I feel like I'm mentally and physically mending. It's nice. I'm grateful to be back living, not just surviving, life.
