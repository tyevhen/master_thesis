If you are a regular visitor here, perhaps you've noticed I've had less to say recently. I've been struggling with writing, and I feel bad about that.

I'm still soooo tired--can't seem to sleep enough. It's very frustrating, and it's negatively impacting the rest of my life. One of the areas this sleepiness seems to have most affected is writing. I either haven't wanted to write, or when I've wanted to, I haven't had anything to say. I apologize for that.

I do feel an obligation to keep up with these pages for those of you who visit. Whether it's knowledge, fun or curiosity that keeps you coming back, I want to keep up. I am still here. I'm here battling the sometimes subtle symptoms of this illness, yet my mood is still okay. I guess that's one thing for which to be grateful. Thanks for visiting.
