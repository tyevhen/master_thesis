This week is a week of rest for our family. I'm sneaking in moments of homeschool planning as we are officially starting our new school year next Monday (a later start than usual, but necessary with all of the many things that have been going on in our family) as well as much-treasured moments spent with my yarn and hook in preparation for the upcoming festival I am scheduled to have a booth at in a couple of weeks. 

We celebrated Ian's 10th birthday yesterday. He was quite happy with his new dart gun and a whole set of Rangers Apprentice books. This boy of ours really loves to read. We celebrated with a doughnut stack lit up with cool Lego candles after a dinner of his choosing (roasted chicken and macaroni and cheese.)

Today, despite two cups of coffee, I'm feeling quite sleepy and low on energy. Despite that, I'm feeling blessed with the calling of motherhood that God has placed on my life. I often lose sight of the greatness of this calling, especially in the midst of sleepless nights, sickness, and the general busyness of life. 

But really we have such a great opportunity as mothers. God is using us to raise His next generation of soldiers and world-shakers. The moments we invest into our children are eternal investments. And when I think of my role as a mother in light of this, I find much encouragement and strength to press on through the moments and days that are long, monotonous, frustrating, and exhausting.

Despite how this world makes us feel, motherhood is THE most important calling we have as women. We may not have as much time as we used to have to invest in others or our own interests, but the time we sacrificially invest into the lives of our children is heaping up eternal rewards and dividends.

So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and steady, always enthusiastic about the Lordâ€™s work, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless. ~1 Cor. 15:58
