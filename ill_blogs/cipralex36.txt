Hello my friends, and thank you all for the feedback and comments and all the experiences you're sharing with me, keep doing that - I'm reading all of it and appreciate it.


As I've mentioned in early posts, I keep the fact that I'm taking cipralex to my self... Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm sharing this information with you guys,
In a way you're all my best friends :)




Taking cipralex for people that know what it really is - is no big deal, and this pill is so popular that sometimes I think half of the world is on it :) ,
however I don't know if I've mentioned it before but I'm an CEO of a small company and it will really make the people I'm "leading" feel weird if they knew I'm on cipralex.
and its hard to keep a secret... so I've just decided to keep that info for my self.


I know..I know...the best thing is just to be open about it and not give a @#$@ , but I can't do that, because most of the people that never tried it...
have a certain look on people that did...or do take it.
and they do look or think about you differently once they know that... so for the time being I think this information will stay only between us.


My girl and I are back together for couple of weeks now... but sometimes it feels as if we were always together...
she got some problems too... she gets sad sometimes or nervous... the funny thing is that I'm the one that always cheer her up and help her get back on her feet again...
which makes it even harder for me to reveal the "Secret" :), think about it for a sec, one minute I'm telling her how she should take things easy...
while I got the help of cipralex...my shrink...and you guys...
