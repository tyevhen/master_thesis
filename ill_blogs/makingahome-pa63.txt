I always appreciate a good, solid children's Bible. And this Bible fits that ticket exactly!




The Family Illustrated Bible (formerly known as The Children's Bible) is a beautifully written and illustrated children's Bible. The Bible is on the larger side, measuring 9 1/2 x 11 inches. It is a hardcover which adds to the beauty of it. This is one of those children's Bibles that you'll want to take care of and pass on to your grandchildren!

In addition to the many wonderful Old Testament and New Testament Bible stories, the Bible also has several pages in the back listing exciting facts about people from the Old and New Testaments. It also has a large, thorough index, a comprehensive map of the lands of the Bible, timelines, and other tidbits of information tucked in here and there.

This is a beautiful Bible! And it covers all of the usual children's Bible stories, as well as more uncommon ones that typically aren't printed in children's Bibles. It contains approximately 87 Old Testament stories and around 76 New Testament stories.

I received a complimentary copy of this Bible from New Leaf Publishing in exchange for my honest review.
