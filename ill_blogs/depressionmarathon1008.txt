It's true. We've all heard it from our doctors, families and friends. "Exercise and you'll feel better." Now researchers have gone and proven it. Researchers from the University of Vermont evaluated the overall mood of two groups of students at several intervals: one hour, two, four, eight, 12 and 24 hours. The questions addressed tension, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion and depression. The students who rode a bicycle for 20 minutes at moderate intensity scored significantly higher than the non-exercise group at every interval up to 12 hours.

This newly discovered long-term effect was one of the reasons I noted this article in my Running Times magazine. Previous research had shown a mood boost immediately following exercise. Nobody had ever proven this long-term benefit before. Knowing I may have 12 hours of relief if I can get myself out on the road may help get me out the door on rough days.

The second point to note, which again will help on rough days, is that I don't need to run myself into the ground to get this benefit. The students rode their bikes at "moderate intensity." Granted, moderate intensity may feel like maximum intensity on bad days, but it is nice to know I can boost my mood without having to torture myself. If we remember this study when our moods interfere with our plans, when moving feels impossible, maybe we'll be able to move anyway.

What do you think? Have you been helped by exercise? Did the benefit last?
