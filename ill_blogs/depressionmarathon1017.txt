It's been 3 nights of C-PAP for me, and so far I can't say I feel more rested. Maybe the sleep I'm getting is of higher quality, but I think I'm actually waking up more. That's been annoying. I'm wearing a nose mask, which is comfortable if I stay on my back, but I sleep on my side. The straps which hold the mask in place are uncomfortable when I lie on them, as I do when I lie on my side, and that discomfort awakens me. I also wake up every couple of hours--or every time I change position--because the mask shifts and causes leaking air to blow on my face. That's not a pleasant way to be awakened, and it's frustrating. I'm also disappointed I don't feel miraculously better. At this moment, I'm just annoyed.
