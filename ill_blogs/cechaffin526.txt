I’m a confessed Christian but sometimes I go through phases when I wonder what use it is and subsequently feel attracted to another path more than usually. Still, other religions don’t satisfy my hunger for realism. The history of the Jewish people and their rejected messiah, given to the Gentiles, seems too good to be true. But one thing that makes me think the Bible true, or inspired, is its incessant need for material reality in order to confirm spiritual things.

Circumcision, crucifixion, animal sacrifice, the remnant of which is the Eucharist. Judaism is very concrete.

Another reason: If the Bible were propaganda why would it so painstakingly include all the failures of its heroes? David was a murderer and adulterer, who in his dotage let the royal house go to pieces, which led to a national schism. After Christ repeatedly told the disciples he would die in Jerusalem, all his disciples deserted him after his arrest save the youngest, John. And these pantywaists became apostles. Further, whoever described the foibles of the disciples in detail must have been pretty close to the action.

Compared with other traditions, the stories in the Bible smell of reality, like the straw of a manger--not just spirituality.

I thought I’d write about something other than myself. And I did it in under 500 words, amazing.

BTW, I'm absent a poetry student right now for the first time in a long time, so if you know anyone who wants a poetry tutor, check out the course description.

In the new Poet's Market they speak of "poetry coaches." I just learned of "life coaches!"

I think the need for coaches is a fine example of a service economy.
