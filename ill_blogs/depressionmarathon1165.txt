Big News!!
Puck's running again! He's had trouble gaining full flexion in his reconstructed knee, which means he's also had trouble re-building the muscles in that leg. Last week, I thought he'd finally gained enough muscle (from consistent swimming) that he'd be able to handle running again. He was SOOOOO excited when I grabbed his leash! I could feel him smiling the entire run. He was especially happy to see all the squirrels were still scampering about the neighborhood! Now, if only mom would let go of the damn leash...just for a second!

We've run together 3 times. He's not in the shape either of us are used to, so I'm limiting him to 2-3 miles for now. He gets pooped, but his leg seems to be holding up just fine. He's happy. I'm happy. It's so nice to be running with my boy again.

I am forever grateful for my vet's skillful intervention. I am grateful Puck is able to resume living the life he was accustomed to living. And I am grateful to all of you for your encouragement, prayers and support. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
