I went to see the psychologist today, that went well! He has given me some ideas to try and make conversation with people.

I saw the psychiatrist last week and we discussed a possible seasonal effect on my mood. He reckon I tend to be high in May/ June and low in July/ August. It fits!

I have just booked a weeks holiday in Dubai with a friend, I go in September.

Work is getting quite stressful

I have made some new friends through meets organised through Social Anxiety UK, I am organising further meets myself.

I have been invited to go camping in the peak district and go hiking with my new friends. Even if I can not get the time off work it feels really good to have been invited.

I ran 5k (3 and a bit miles) on the treadmill on Sunday, it took me 41 minutes. My sister and I are going to enter a run, I have looked at times on the running club website and the slowest people do it in about 30 - 35 minutes; I think this is achievable!

I have been invited to go and stay with my cousin for a weekend after she has moved at the end of this month.

Baby Livia and her parents are coming around for dinner one day next week.

Life is ok but loads of stress at the moment!!
