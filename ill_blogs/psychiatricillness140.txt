Last Years Resolutions

- lots more friends, some friends I can ring and say, hey, do you want to go to the pub tonight!!
I went out or New Year for the first time in years. I think I have a lot more friends now, mainly to pass the time of day with. There is still no one I can call and ask, 'Would you like to go to the pub tonight?'.

- loose weight, my medication made me put on a stone so I am going to have another attempt at shifting it!
Well my weight had gone down quite a lot however, I have been eating a lot of chocolate over the past few weeks. When I went out last night I felt really fat. I think I will loose it again quite quickly.

- be happier
yes - I think I am definitely happier, last Christmas I was biting myself, overall I have enjoyed this Christmas!
