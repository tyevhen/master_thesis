No, it's not Thanksgiving. I try to tell this to Paige, but she just can't let go of this book. She never tires of the fun cartoons of the turkeys in this fun countdown from 5 turkeys to 1. Each page has a shiny "feather" attached that seems to give a lot of enjoyment too. A great book!
I hope you've enjoyed this week of Paige's Pages!
