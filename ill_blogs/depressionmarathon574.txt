Sorry I've been away for a few days. I didn't go anywhere. I've just been getting back into life. I've been working more and more. I worked Sunday, Monday, today, and I'm scheduled to work tomorrow. I'm still a little overwhelmed at work. Thankfully, we've been a little slow lately. That's helped.

I've been getting back into my running as well. It's been very hard. The long layoff after knee surgery combined with a one month hospitalization left me back at square one physically. It's been really tough getting going again. I ran an interval workout yesterday, and I seriously thought I might die from the effort! The sluggishness of the depression has yet to leave, and it is most evident when I'm running. I know it will improve. I just have to continue putting in the effort.

I have to continue putting in the effort around my home as well. The little things are going undone. It's still easier to come home and fall asleep, and that's often what happens. Before I allowed myself to nap today, I got one load of laundry done. It's not a lot, but at least it's something. I'm going to continue focusing on just getting one thing done at a time. Eventually, the little things will get done.

I saw my psychiatrist today. It was nice to make it through an entire appointment without sobbing uncontrollably. It's nice to be feeling a bit better. As I told her, things still aren't perfect, but I feel less hopelessness than I did even last week. One foot in front of the other, that's my focus today. Thank you all for joining me on the journey.
