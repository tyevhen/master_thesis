The Wisdom of Hunter-Gatherers is a wonderful, short article on how children in hunter-gatherer societies learn.

Whatever Happened to Mother? Is an absolutely WONDERFUL story of the vanished mothers of old. Not wonderful as good, since it's incredibly sad, but wonderfully written. I love how it's literally written as a story. There are actually multiple 'Chapters', but since they seem to repeat a lot of the same material, I'll only link to the first one I read.

Look on the Bright Side is an article on the good things, environmentally speaking, that are happening right now, as well as a call to action.

Atrocious Advice From "Supernanny" The title says it all. It's horrifying to me that people actually watch this crap, and even think that's it's the "right" way to parent! That bothers me on such a deep level, and makes me incredibly sad.

The Hand That Rocks The Cradle Rocks The Boat: Life Learning as the Ultimate Feminist Act Again, the title says it all.

UPDATE:Forget Shorter Showers is the newest Derrick Jensen article from Orion magazine.
