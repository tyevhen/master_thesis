It’s been a while now since I’m off the pills… to be accurate it been exactly five months…
It took most of my energy to stay focused and pass this transition time until today…
During this time there were ups and downs… even couple of times I thought I needed an anger management program J lol…
But as the time passes I seem everything is stabilizing and slowly I and my brain or body gets used to the new situation…
I want to apology for “disappearing” on you guys for a while but I also sure you understand how it’s like when you can’t even bring yourself to stay focus and post something…
I want to address some of your comments and feedbacks in this post…and once again thank you all for sticking around…
So, where were we?
Right,
I’m 5 months off the pills now.
As you already know I’m married…
And my wife is pregnant (week 12)…
And I’m buying a house… so I had to take mortgage and loans to make that happened.

You can imagine that buying a house, take loans, quitting the pills and having a baby all at the same time is…time consuming and also brain power consuming… J
So that’s what I’ve been up to…
