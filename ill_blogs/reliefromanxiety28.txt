As you may or may not know I've taken the next step and started a YouTube channel to go alongside my blog. I have been writing this blog for around four years now so I felt it to be the next natural step in the progression. By the time this post is published, I will have had my Youtube for around 2-3 months.

As to content on my channel, it's all related to mental health and lifestyle in the form of short films. If you think that this will interest you, then please do subscribe. In the meantime, here are a few of my videos below:
