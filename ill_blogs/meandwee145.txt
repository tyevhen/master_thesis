Happy Friday! It's another weenimation...another little scene of babyhood that I wanted to capture and remember as it is.
Today has blessed us with beautiful weather! I took Noah for a little walk across the way to the pond and here's a little image I took on the way. Fall is pretty, isn't it?



I hope you have a great weekend! Next week I plan to show our new master bath...it's finally finished! Until then! Hugs...
