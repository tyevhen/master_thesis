Hi friends!
This is how Noah spends part of his morning while Paige gets ready for school:


I wish I could do that.

And when Paige goes to get on the bus, she always looks for slugs. And bugs. Even if it means making the bus wait! She likes to talk to them and say "awwww, cute little bug."
It's the little things. Literally.
