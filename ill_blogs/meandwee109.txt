I love this video. I'm not Mormon, but this video really resonated with me. Our children really depend on us so faithfully for everything they need; knowing we will provide it. What a gift it is to be that person! (the message in the video is obviously that Jesus is our Father and we can know he will provide (and is providing) for us as well.) The video also paints such a lovely portrait of family life and how sacred it is. And even if you don't have your own children, you can be a loving spouse, a doting daughter or son, a loving sibling,a caring friend, etc.There are so many ways to contribute beauty to the world and make your own imprint on it in your own sacred life. This notion helps me in the day-to-day rhythms when I feel so small and invisible.
