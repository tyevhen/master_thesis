In a few hours, a woman I watched win local races as a girl will line up with a very real chance to win the Boston Marathon. It's been many years since an American woman won this historic race, and I'm quite certain a native Minnesotan has never won it--although Dick Beardsley came awful close. So I'm rooting for Kara Goucher today. She's worked her butt off, stayed healthy, and deserves every success she achieves.

Go, Kara, go! Win Boston!
