Hi there!
Today's nursery art print was inspired by a favorite fable...The Lion and the Mouse. I imagined how they are good buddies now and take turns pulling each other in the wagon. Of course, the lion doesn't have quite as much fun when it's his turn to ride.
This affordable art print is 8.5 x 11 and the image fits well in a mat with an 8 x 10 opening.
Are you looking for an art print for boy? This fits the bill. Looking for a great gender neutral art print? This fits that bill too. AND if you want a fun art print for a girl, this works too!
Lemme know what you think!  Feel free to leave a comment if you have an idea for a fun animal illustration I should try.
