Wayne Gretzky
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Try not to become a man of success but a man of value.

If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.

Experience is the child of thought, and thought is the child of action.

Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true.
