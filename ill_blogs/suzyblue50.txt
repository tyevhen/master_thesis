I'd like to apologise for my lack of posts recently, my life is just all systems go at the moment! It seems uni, studying for exams and starting my new job, has just made my stress levels soar! Not to worry, by the 11th of May all my exams will be over and done with, and summer will finally be here yaaaay!! I promise as soon as my exams have finished I will be back to posting regularly again! Until then, you can follow me on twitter for all my day to day life ramblings, or instagram for my life in pictures.

Until next time,
Stay classy
Suz x
