Hello again, Its been a while since I posted so I decided to post something, just so you'll know everything is alright and ticking the right direction with me.



I have a girlfriend now, but I haven't told her about cipralex yet...its too early for me to share that with her... so for the time being I will keep that information for my self, I feel so alive, and everything's great, we're going out a lot and I'm dealing with so many situations and things I thought were impossible three months ago... so its amazing how fast things can change.

I have no side effects at all, but it does take me a lot of time to get to an orgasm but I don't mind, its fun to take your time... :-)

Anyways, just wanted to update you that I'm already feeling that I don't need the pills any more, but my Doc advised me to stay on them for the time being...so I will.

I promise to post more soon.

Take care
