It's a very gray, wet, cold day here. I spent the morning outside in the cold, gray, windy, rainy weather running on some hilly country roads. It wasn't pleasant. But at the end of the run we all took part in a pancake feed. That was pleasant. It was a fundraiser for juvenile diabetes. One of the local runners has a child with diabetes. I love pancakes, but hours later I'm still warming up from the soaking, cold run.

My mood matches the weather today. Physically and mentally I'm not feeling so hot. It's been a low energy week for me. I think the toxicity of my work environment is really sucking the life out of me. It takes so much mental fortitude to do my job in that environment. It's exhausting. The urgency to get out of there is ever-present. Until then, I'm doing my best to stay positive, or at least neutral, and I'm doing my job.

The low energy doesn't feel good. I have lots to do around my house. I'm getting none of it done. I can't even motivate to clean myself up, never mind my house! I have to work tomorrow, so the time to get the laundry, vacuuming, dusting, and cleaning done is now. Bummer. That list is overwhelming. I think I'll be happy with finishing off one or two of the items on the list. Now, it's time for a shower. Perhaps that will get me started.
