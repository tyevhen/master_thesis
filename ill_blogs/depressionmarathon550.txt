Things have been tough at my job. It's hard going to work. The atmosphere there is toxic to emotional health. It's hard not to be swallowed up by the toxicity, and the toxicity comes right from the top. I'm doing my best to stay afloat. I'm keeping my head down, doing my job, and trying to stay out of the muck. But this week things have been said and done around me that I've not been able to avoid or let go. I've woken up at night thinking about the situations. I hate that! I hate bringing work crap home with me.

Bringing the muck home is not good for my mental health. I don't have enough energy for that. Likewise, I don't have enough energy to get my job done when I'm feeling smothered by the environment.The end result is I'm feeling the urgent need to get out of there. Now.

Fortunately, I have a few options at which I'm looking. I'm so grateful to work in a field which is in demand. I'm lucky. I know. But changing jobs is always stressful, too. I wish the situation was different. It's not, and I'm having to deal with it. Though I'd like to run away, I'm trying to be patient and let what may develop materialize. I'll let you know how it goes.
