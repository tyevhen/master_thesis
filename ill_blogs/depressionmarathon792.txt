My brain has been feeling less broken lately. In fact, this morning I was detailing feeling better to my doctor. We were both pleased. Unfortunately, by early afternoon, I was tired, sad, and hopeless. So very weird...

This morning, I ran my errands, did some laundry, and met the electrician working on my basement renovation. By the afternoon, I was in bed. Despite sleeping for 3 hours, I could barely drag myself out of bed. I forced myself out the door for a bike ride, which went okay, although I couldn't wait to be done. I ate dinner and e-mailed my doctor--something to the effect of WTF?

I hate when my mood shifts so quickly. As I said to my doctor, it makes my head spin. It is so strange. How does one go from feeling okay in the morning to feeling like crap in the afternoon? Shit, I don't know. It's just another one of the joys of this illness, I guess.

On another note, I've joined Weight Watchers online. Now people who know me are thinking, WTF? You see, I don't look overweight, and I'm not. But I'm heavier than I've ever been. I don't like the way I look or feel. And being a runner, heavier equals slower, too. I'd like to lose 14 pounds. I know I'll feel better physically and mentally if I do. And I'll still be well within normal weight limits for my height. My doctor and therapist approve, and the program has already paid off. It's what motivated me to get back out the door to exercise. With Weight Watchers, eating uses points and exercising accumulates them. I like to eat, so exercise is necessary! I'll keep you abreast of my progress. So far, I'm really liking the program.

That's all for now. I'm getting ready for my relay triathlon this weekend. More on that later.
