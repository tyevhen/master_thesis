My brain is broken again. It's been going on for a few days. I've got broken thoughts. I've been dreaming broken dreams. My mood is a okay, but my brain is broken.

The catalyst, I think, was discovering the ex's kids. But I'm not sure about that because the last few days have really been the roughest. I'm having strange thoughts, repetitive thoughts, racing thoughts. Some of them scare me. Some of them make me feel unsafe. Some of them are just stupid. They're all annoying. They're all disconcerting.

I hate writing about this. It bothers me to have these thoughts. I don't like to admit to them. But maybe this makes sense to some of you. Maybe some of you don't like to admit them, too. So here I am admitting to my broken brain.

I'm working with my doc to fix my brain. A med we recently decreased may need to be restored to it's previous level. Of course I want to take as few meds as possible, but if that's what I need to do, I'll do it. Other than that, I'm trying to stick to my training schedule, work when I need to work, sleep when I need to sleep, and battle with my brain when it gets out of line. I'm making it sound easy. I wish it was. It's not. I hate my broken brain.
