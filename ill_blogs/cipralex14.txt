Hello again, It been couple of days now that I’m trying to get myself to post something…
Finally, here it is:
As I’ve posted before, I’ve decreased the cipralex dosage from 20 mg to 10 mg that happened 29 days ago…
Since I’ve decreased the dosage, I’ve had one anger attack (I’m not sure what it was, maybe it was just arguing or yelling…don’t know but I haven’t started it, anyway…)
I became very tired and sleepy…or at least I think I sleep a lot…
My sex drive went really down and then really up…

Had some annoying thoughts but nothing too serious…
And I find it a bit harder to focus.
But, now 29 days after, I feel good, maybe it was all part of the “migration” process…
Anyways I’m not too worried about that.
Had a meeting with the doc couple of days ago, he said to continue taking the 10 mg, and I’ve talked with him about sex drive issue, he said to try skipping a pill in a day I’m planning to have sex… lol I always plan on doing that…
The wedding is approaching, I try not to think about that too much and not complicate it.
Soon I’ll be in Italy, on vacation for two weeks…I’ll update you soon about that too, also I’ve read all your comments and will address them all in the next post.
Keep fighting!
Love you all, and talk to you soon.
