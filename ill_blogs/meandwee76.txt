Does saying "I love you" in French make it mean more? You know, you don't have to wait for an anniversary or Valentine's Day to write a sweet note for your loved one. Sometimes they need a pick-me-up or reminder at other various times too.


Chris often brings me flowers, or he leaves me cute notes on my "to do" lists, or sends me loving emails. I especially love when he brings me home a Snickers bar at the end of the day because he knows it's my favorite and it's been "that kind of day." I need to do more sweet things for him. Hmmm.
