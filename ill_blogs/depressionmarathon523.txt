I feel a little bit bad, as I don't think I have much to report. Sometimes, like right now, I worry about continuing this blog when I'm doing well, as I don't think my life is all that interesting. Who am I to write a blog, anyway? I'm not any more or less special than any of you currently reading this. That's for sure!

So I don't have a lot to say. I'm doing well. I'm feeling well. My mood has been good. Even my job went well this week. It's nice. My workouts have also been good. I ran fast and hard on both Tuesday (5 x 1000 meters) and Thursday (6 mile tempo run). I suffered through them, but I felt great when I completed them. I'm now gearing up for my 20-miler tomorrow. Things are just, well, good.

Good is a little boring, but I'll take boring and short blog posts over misery any day of the week! It's hard to believe I was absolutely debilitated and miserable just a few months ago. I'm so grateful to be feeling well. I'm unbelievably grateful for the energy which allows me to run as I wish. And I'm grateful for readers like you. Whether I have little or lots to say, keeping up with this blog, through the good times and the bad, keeps me moving forward and allows me to survive this illness rather than suffer from it.
