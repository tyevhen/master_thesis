On Friday I leave for Boston, to visit Ty and hang out with various cool people. :-) I'm excited! I will have internet access there, and I'll try and update a couple of times, but I won't really be posting much until the 11th of May when I get back home. I just got a brand new 8 gig memory card for my camera, so I'm sure I'll be taking lots of pictures! :-D

Peace,
Idzie
