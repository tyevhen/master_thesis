Perhaps it's because I've been sick the entire month. I'm tired. I returned to work this week, and it's been a long, busy week. By yesterday my brain and body were screaming for a nap prior to lunch time! Unfortunately, I didn't get that nap, but I just woke up from a two hour nap I enjoyed today. Like yesterday, my body was screaming at me to lie down. I love napping, but I'm not used to being so tired.

I am still recovering from my illness. It's now 24 days and counting since I got sick. I'm still coughing a bit, and I can talk, although not yet normally. I appreciated being well enough to go to work this week, but other than that I didn't get much done. My evenings were spent vegging rather than doing chores or exercising. But I allowed that to be okay.

I vowed to get some exercise this weekend. I ran a nice interval workout this morning on the Alter-G treadmill. I ran at 70% of my body weight for 50 minutes with five, 3-minute intervals. Although I felt good during my run, I may have been a bit too aggressive. The fatigue set in shortly after I finished. I was whipped! It was all I could do to eat some lunch and finish my laundry before I gave in and took my delightful 2 hour nap.

With Christmas on the horizon, I have a couple more days to heal and rest prior to returning to work. I have no plans for Christmas, which is okay, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel a little sad. It's a big family holiday, and I just don't have that. My brothers all have their own families with children, in-laws, and grandparents. My parents live in Florida. It will just be Jet and I for Christmas here. No worries, I've got a couple of movies to watch, a couple treats for Jet, and perhaps I'll take a couple more 2 hour naps.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays, my friends.
