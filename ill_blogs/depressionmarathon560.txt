How fragile am I? That's the question I've been asking myself over the past few days. I'm frustrated and angry because I've been sliding a little bit. It's not a big drop in my mood, but it scares me nonetheless. And I immediately want to know why. Why am I sliding? What's going on? That's where the fragility question comes in.

As I asked my treatment team in an e-mail yesterday, "Can I not handle any stress in my life? Is the prospect of a new job with the possibility of increased hours that overwhelming? Can Social Security Disability Insurance really wreak this much havoc in my life? Am I that fragile?"

The possibility of a new job and the SSDI nightmare; those are the two things causing me stress right now. Those are the causes on which I think I can blame the slide. But am I that fragile? I am going to encounter stresses like this, or stresses worse than this, for the rest of my life. How the hell will I handle life if these two current events are enough to send me tumbling?

This illness makes me feel so vulnerable. Whereas "normal" people have the luxury of seeing themselves securely carrying out their future plans, I'm never sure those plans will come to fruition. I'd like to look into the future with an air of certainty. An air of certainty that it, and I, will be there, get there, live it... I'm tired of not knowing if, or when, the other shoe is going to drop. I'm tired of being vulnerable to the whims of this illness.

How fragile am I? Have my job interview and SSDI nightmare begun a slide without end? Will I handle the stress without falling off the cliff? Or is this the beginning of another end? I don't think so. I hope not. I don't know. That's just it. I don't know. I can't know. I have to accept the vulnerability this illness forces upon me. And I have to accept the fact that I may never be able to look into the future with an air of certainty.
