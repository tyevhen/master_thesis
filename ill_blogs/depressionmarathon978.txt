It's been a long, strange month. July started with beauty and serenity in Colorado, melded into eternal days of disinterest and gray, before it crawled slowly up the slopes of relative normalcy. The peaks and valleys of July replicate the peaks and valleys of depression. Depression is not a straight line illness. It is a sine wave illness. Considering that fact, I guess July wasn't so strange after all.
