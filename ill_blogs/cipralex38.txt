Hello my friends, I've been asked lately what really piss me off, because some people that know many more and some less said I keep a constant poker face all the time, and They don't see me angry or too upset or too happy...I wonder why? :-)

Maybe its just the way I always been or maybe its cipralex, honestly? I couldn't care less. Inside i'm happy and everything is 100% under control, I have no panic attacks, no anxiety and no depression from months now...so i'm feeling good.

I haven't told my girlfriend about cipralex yet, I'm meeting my doctor in couple of days and I'll ask him again when can i stop taking the pills, not that I mind - I have no side effects at all, its just that I hate the fact that i'm hiding this from everyone around me.



So many things have changed...and I like being numb...because my numb state is everyone's else normal state :-)

I've read some comments asking about caffeine and cipralex, I can tell you that I drink a lot of coffee(I love coffee) and I had no problems with it, but than again, in the first months you should lower your coffee consumption.

Ok, just wanted to update you guys about how I'm doing...

take care and we'll talk soon...

oh, and happy holidays!
