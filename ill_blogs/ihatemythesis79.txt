No, it's not finished yet.

I managed to stay productive until 5 a.m., after which point I was just sleeping sitting up. So I allowed myself to go to bed a couple hours. I set three alarms, slept for three hours and pushed snooze for two hours more (to the certain chagrin of my roommates). I've been working all day, but to no avail. On the bright side, the 10-minute thing has been a lifesaver.

I apologize if this blog is not up to my normal level of witty banter, but I actually am more concerned about my thesis than blogging today.
