Recently someone left a social media comment on a post I made about depression which began with, "We've all been depressed... " The person who left the comment went on to explain that she/he was currently dealing with this and that and therefore depressed. While the commenter was trying to empathize, and I realized that, the statement, "We've all been depressed..." really irked me.

My post was about depression, an illness, which everyone has not, in fact, experienced. The writer was referring to feeling depressed, not an illness, which most people have likely experienced. Feeling depressed is not the same as depression, and others mistaking the feeling for the illness is one of the many difficulties of living with depression. Depression is an illness. Depressed is a feeling.

When I speak publicly about my illness, I always talk about the difference between depression and depressed. The problem is everyone has felt depressed. Therefore some feel they know what depression is and what needs to be done to cure it. After all, they were depressed once.

This confusion is the root, I believe, of the unhelpful advice we sometimes receive. Advice to "just smile more," or "think happy thoughts," or "just get out of the house and you'll feel better," is not helpful because those of us with depression know there's more to it than that. We have more than an unpleasant feeling to deal with. We have symptoms to manage.

You'll never hear me say, "I'm depressed." When I speak about my illness, I always refer to my symptoms. I say things like, "When my depression symptoms are more prevalent..." Just as cancer patients do not say, "I am cancer," and people with MS do not say, "I am MS," I very purposefully do not say "I am depressed." After all, I am not depressed today, but I still have my illness, and that illness is depression.
