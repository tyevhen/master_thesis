Hi friends!
I was perusing the Anthropologie website today during my "lunch hour" and saw this lovely outfit. I thought of how I could pull this off with a kid; which most outfits I see would never work. Although, the necklace would get ripped apart pretty quickly, huh?
Since having Paige, I've needed:
1. Easy to clean garments
2. Garments that have no stretchy V neck (unless I'm wearing a cami).
3. Scoop necks are out too.
4. I need long shirts
5. Delicate fabrics are out
6. Accessories? What are those again?

*sigh* I have so many beloved articles of clothing sitting in my closet from my office days. Many things are wool, silk, and cashmere...obviously all fit for the dry cleaner. I guess it doesn't matter since most of the pants don't even fit my new figure. Blahhh.
It's well worth the price, but I miss my old clothes.
The casual things I DO have...well...many things have to stand the test of Paige. She likes to pull down my v-necks or scoop necks while I hold her. While Chris enjoys this, I am modest and do not. Just the act of holding her pulls the neck down, much less her grabby little hands going exploring. Plus, now that I have a little more cushioning, I find that my pants don't cover me as well anymore so I need longer shirts to cover my butt. And of course, when she spits up, sneezes all over me, or some other such thing I need to be able to wash and dry the item in a snap. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find things that fit the bill. I've been doing ok so far, thanks to places like T.J. Maxx or Shade Clothing. It's hard to find whole outfits that are stylish and fit all my criteria. I guess I'll be selling a lot of my old stuff at the yard sale this spring. Could this be a chance for a fresh start and a new look? Hmmm. I'd better start saving my money! Where do you like to shop for stylish and easy things?
