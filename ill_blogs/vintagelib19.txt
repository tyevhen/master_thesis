The weather round here at the moment has been pretty rainy. Perfect for what I had planned tonight. I managed to score a free double pass to see I Give it a Year. Great film! I wasn't sold on it at first but by the end I loved it.

I went straight from work to the movie, so what you see here is what I wore to work today. I love wearing bright colours to cheer up a dreary workplace and I'm so glad I work in a place where I can get away with wearing the kinds of clothes I want to wear. I also love the miniature floral pattern on this dress, and how flippy it is. Perfect for those days when you're not feeling like having anything constricting your belly!
