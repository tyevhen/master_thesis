I did a new painting! I'm so excited about it...it's in my favorite color scheme and Maren the Wonder Dog is in her first artwork. I wanted to create something in the aesthetic and "style" I'm going for. It has that sort of retro/vintage happy/colorful vibe that I like. I decided to offer it as a print for sale in the shop as 8 x 10 and 5 x 7 sizes. I hope you like it too!
