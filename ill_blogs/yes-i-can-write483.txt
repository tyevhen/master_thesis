Since I've fallen down on the job here, I'll tell you (briefly) what happened in the last couple of day.

July 14

Talking talking talking! I discussed sustainable living extensively with my mother as we cooked supper together (Moroccan Lentil Soup and Chicken and Celery Soup). It was nice to make a really good home cooked meal again, as it's something my mom's been rushing around too much to do in a while. I also discussed random things with my dad... And since a friend was over, stayed up until about 2:30 a.m. talking some more! Good times...

July 13

Well, I'm afraid the highlight of that day was not anything spectacular, just the most recent Foyles War mystery. I love that mystery show! Yes, it's aired on PBS, but I don't like all the shiny chase scene filled CTV ones.... So yeah, Foyles Way is awesome.

I'll fill in today's details tonight...
