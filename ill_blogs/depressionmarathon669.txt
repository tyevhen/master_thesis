It's been a long couple of days around here. Lots of reminiscing and grieving going on. Paul's wake was Thursday night and his funeral yesterday. Running has been far from my mind. I haven't had the energy, which is why it was really important for me to get out on the road this morning. After hitting the snooze button for an hour, I finally got out of bed and made it to our track club's group long run. My legs, I don't think, are fully recovered yet from last week's marathon. I ended up running alone most of the way this morning, but it was still helpful to run with the group. Despite my tired legs, I made it 13 miles. A bunch of us went out for breakfast, and then I ran two more miles with Puck once I got home. 15 miles total. I'm pretty happy with that. It wasn't easy.

It's nice being out with the group again. I still have to push myself to go to things like meals after funerals or breakfast with a crowd, but I'm doing those things despite my isolation tendencies. I know, in my brain, isolation isn't good for me, but it is so damn much easier! I'm hoping pushing myself will eventually make being more social easier. But I'm dubious.

I'm getting used to being back in the world again. Being social, going to group events, running...all of these things make me realize, again, how much depression takes me out of my world. I feel like I've been gone for months, and in a way, I guess I have. It's weird. I'm trying not to get overwhelmed with simple daily life. I'm waiting for the moment when I no longer feel like a stranger in a strange land. It's a process, I guess. And I'm grateful to be moving through the process rather then being stuck in the muck. The muck sucks.
