Well, the money continues to fly out of my wallet this month. First the root canal repair, then the truck repair, and yesterday it was the furnace. After a few hours freezing my buns off, the furnace man showed up yesterday around 10 AM. He was here for a grand total of 15 minutes, and it cost me $350! But at least I have heat, and I'm quite grateful for that.

My mother offered to loan me the money to pay for the furnace, but I said no. It really would make things easier if I accepted it, especially since I received a quarterly bill for my health insurance yesterday (another large chunk of money). But I have such a hard time borrowing money from anyone, especially my mother. I guess it's a pride thing. I don't know. I thought a lot about it today, but I just feel like I need to figure this out on my own. I have other options, and even though it would be easier to let my mother help, I think I'll pursue the other options first.

In other news, I completed my 20 mile run yesterday. It was tough as usual, but it was also quite pretty. It snowed for over half of the run. The flakes were light and fluffy and lasted for a couple of hours. After it snowed, the sun came out for the rest of my run. Lovely. I think I may have even gotten a little tan! It was a good run.

I ran yesterday instead of my usual Saturday because I'm going to be busy this weekend. Two old friends are going to be nearby, and they invited me to spend the entire weekend with them--their treat! We're going to go out to some shows, maybe do a comedy club, perhaps hit a spa, spend the night in a hotel, and then do brunch on Sunday. It's been an awful long time since I've done anything fun like this, so I'm really looking forward to it! It will be great to spend time with them, and it was incredibly kind of them to offer such an opportunity. I'll let you know how it goes.

And now it's time to pack...
