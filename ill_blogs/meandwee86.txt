My almost daily walk to our little village post office takes only about 2 minutes. But it's packed to the brim with the most beautiful sights and sounds. Trees everywhere bursting with blooms, birds of all kinds singing their songs, the soft breeze blowing through the grass. I love this time of year. It's so wonderful to stop and enjoy the blessings around us. Shipping orders to my awesome customers COULD be a chore; but isn't thanks to the loveliness along the way!
