Empty Space

poem by Cindy Wolf

I sit
I stare
My body sinks
I slouch
I sigh
My eyes don't blink

I hear a noise
It floats on by
I want to think
but cannot try

I see a blur
It fades away
I open my mouth
No words to say

Nothing below
              above
              around
              between
Just an empty space
Without a dream
