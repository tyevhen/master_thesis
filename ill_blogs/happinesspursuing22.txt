Hello everyone. It's Saturday and I decided to give myself the day off. I thought I'd check in on this blog and the associated email account. I was surprised and touched by all of your comments and emails. I know I've said that before and it might seem trite but it's true; I feel deeply grateful for your interest in me and this blog.

I'm okay for now. Nothing focuses the mind like a deadline. I've been and will continue to be frantically working on this damn book for a few more weeks. It's about all I think of these days which, in its way, is a blessed distraction from my own internal morbidity. It's also why I haven't posted much lately. Up or down, more writing is not really something I want to do after a long day's work.

Many of you have expressed genuine anxiety over my state. Thank you. I really am okay. And, upon entering my three favorite months - September, October, November - I should be so for a while now.

I know I don't post with any sort of regularity. I'm sorry about that but I find that navel gazing isn't always the best option for me. But, in creating this blog and allowing you to become invested in it, I do have a certain obligation to you. So, let's make a date. On 8 October 2010, when the trees are at their autumnal finest in my region, let's meet outside at 7:30 am. On that day and at that time, I will be outside, enjoying nature and feeling alive. I hope you will join me. (Nevermind time zones, etc. This is about the act, not temporal concurrence.)
