Hi friends!
Today's print was inspired by my love of ducks after seeing them waddling with babies all around the Bronx Zoo. I imagined them wearing preppy dressy clothes (seersucker anyone?) and headed off to someplace important as a family; like church. If that's not your thing, perhaps you can imagine them going to a Sunday picnic?
As with the others, this affordable art print is great for nurseries, a child's room, or someone who just likes cute illustration and ducks. :)
You can get a print at the MeandWee etsy shop.
