It was a cold, sunny day today. I got up early but couldn't get out the door for over 3 hours. After watching SportsCenter 3 times in a row, I finally had the moment I was waiting for--that magical window of energetic readiness. I ran to the bedroom and donned the requisite gear. Again, it was the tights that brought Puck to his feet. We slogged through the first mile of a loosely planned 5-6 miler in the colder-than-anticipated air. It felt like a long day was in store.

Actually, the mileage lengthened, while the run shortened. The magical energy must have returned, for I realized I was running comfortably at a quicker than normal pace. Eight miles later, Puck was lagging behind while I was finishing up with my fastest mile of the day. It was one of those runs.

It must have been the beautiful steak I was served last night. It could have resulted from the speedwork I've done the past three weeks. Whatever the reason, it was one of those easy days when everything clicked. It was one of those runs. Nice.

Now, if only my mood would get easy, too. Oh well, we can't have everything can we?
