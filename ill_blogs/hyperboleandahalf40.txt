If you have a brick or a pile of bricks, you may be thinking "bricks are really boring."  But you're wrong.   There are probably a million ways to have fun with a brick.   Here are seven of them.

1.  "Brick Tag"

The rules of brick tag are simple:  if you get hit by the brick, you're "it."  You can also play brick freeze-tag, but it is not recommended since a game involving blunt-force trauma to the head doesn't really need to be complicated by not being able to tell if your friends are dead or just not "unfrozen" yet.  

 
2. "Brick Roulette"

Have your friends stand in a circle around you.  Put on a blindfold.  Spin around as fast as you can while holding the brick with your arm fully extended to build up maximum force.  Let go.  


3. "Jump Over the Brick"

Put the brick on the ground.  Jump over it.  See how high you can jump.  



4. "Truth or Brick"

Tell the truth or get the brick.



5. "Drop the Brick"

Find something tall.  Go up on top of it.  Drop the brick.  



6. "Brick Conquerers"

Fuck the brick up.  Hit it with a stick, stab it with a sword, set it on fire - the goal is to inflict maximal harm on the brick. 



7. "Duck, Duck, Brick"
