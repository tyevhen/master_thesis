One of my favourite things about the Christmas season is when Starbucks and Costa release their holiday menu. Their festive themed drinks are so creative and always taste so divine. My favourite this season has to be Costa's Black Forest hot chocolate - it legit tastes like a gâteau in a mug...delicious!

Saying that, one of my all time favourite festive drinks has to be Starbucks's peppermint hot chocolate - I love it so much that I decided to try and recreate the recipe at home. And it worked so well that I just had to share it with you guys too!

The pictures above pretty much explain the steps you take to make the drink, however I will mention that whisking the milk into the after eight paste until it becomes totally smooth does take a while! Also make sure the heat on your hob isn't too high as the chocolate will end up burning and your drink will be ruined!

Let me know how you get on if you try this recipe and if you enjoy it!

Happy december!
