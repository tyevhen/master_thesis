The garden basket has been full and overflowing the last few weeks. It's been wonderful, and when I have felt myself feeling slightly overwhelmed at the massive amount of veggies and work, I remind myself of the blessing it is to have an abundant garden. 

The can cellar shelves are starting to fill up and the freezer is full of berries, and there are still more to be picked and preserved. Simple but busy work to keep the hands busy and the heart full.
