I'm going to try meditating. At first, it seemed daunting, as I'm always so busy. But I read at the Mayo Clinic's site that it doesn't have to be a big time commitment to pay off. Here's a meditation video I just tried: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditation/MM00623. Give it a shot. It only takes a few minutes, and I found it soothing. The real test is whether I can stick with it during the week! Do you have any online meditation videos to share?
