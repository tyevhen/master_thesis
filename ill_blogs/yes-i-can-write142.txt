Remember the talk I did at the Toronto Unschooling Conference?  It's posted in written format on this blog already (see part 1, part 2, part 3, and part 4), and the recording of the talk is now available for download (it costs $5).


You can buy it at either The Unschoolers Emporium or through Lulu.  It feels pretty cool though definitely weird that I talk I gave is for sale!  Anyway, just thought I'd let you guys know.
