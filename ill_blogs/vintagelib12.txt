A couple of months ago I took modelled as part of a fundraiser for the Canberra Endometriosis Centre at Blue Illusion. It was a great success - we raised $900! While the clothes aren't quite my usual style, I still ended up walking away with the blue pinstriped pants and the peach/white hat that you can see below. It was a great day - all of the models were endometriosis sufferers and a lot of the attendees were as well (or friends and family). It's great to have some community in what can sometimes be an isolating condition. It was pretty fun hamming it up on the "catwalk" as well.

Hopefully I'll find some time soon to tell you what else I've been up to - the last few months have been quite exciting with the Canberra Endometriosis Network!
