I refuse to celebrate [veterans of WWII] as the greatest generation because in doing so we are celebrating courage and sacrifice in the cause of war. And we are miseducating the young to believe that military heroism is the noblest form of heroism, when it should be remembered only as the tragic accompaniment of horrendous policies driven by power and profit.
~ Howard Zinn (thanks to Ronnie for the quote)

This quote pretty much sums up how I feel about things. It bothers me deeply that Remembrance Day seems more about glorifying war than anything else. Celebrating the dead who "gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country" (a line that in itself rings alarm bells to me). I don't want to celebrate or glorify war. I simply want to remember those who have died, and those whose lives will never be the same because of war (those who are also not getting the support they need and deserve). Remember and recognize the horror. And vow never to support a system that perpetuates such atrocities.

Peace,
Idzie
