I've added both a list of links to cool books about unschooling and green anarchy, and another list of links to essays, articles, and excerpts on the same subjects. The latter is still in progress, as I know I'm missing a few of my favorites that I'm just not thinking of right now! They're located on the sidebar (you need to scroll down a bit). Enjoy, and if you have any suggestions for cool essays, books, etc., then please let me know! :-)

Peace,
Idzie
