I'm cycling all the time at the moment. One day I am buyng extra pils and the next day someone says something nice and I feel that lovely flight in my stomach. I'm going round and round every other day! It has to end somewhere...

They say rapid cycling is four episodes in 12 months. What the hell is this then!! I'm guessing the depression has turned into a mixed episode :o(.
