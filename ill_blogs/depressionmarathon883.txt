You see the previous post? That's the last time I'll use a car analogy to describe my mood. Tonight my car died. Really. You can't make this stuff up! I feel like this is piling on a bit. Enough already! God? Anyone? I know, I know. Acceptance is the answer. Okay. I accept it, but I don't like it. No more car analogies.

On to the rest of the story. I'm still struggling with some intrusive thoughts. Despite that, I've been able to continue working, exercising, and attending meetings. It feels robotic at times, but I'm doing what I need to do regardless of this damn illness.

I started the triathlon class on Monday. We swam on Tuesday, ran and did mega-strengthening Wednesday, and rode the bike today. Tomorrow is another strength day, but that's all. Mondays and Wednesdays are the big, tough days. We workout together from 5:30-7:00 AM. And our instructor really worked us out this week!

I kind of liked the tough workout though. It reminded me of my college sports days. Showing up, being told what to do, and then working my butt off brought back memories. Plus, there was a nice simplicity to it. I didn't have to think. I just followed orders. I appreciated that, especially this week.

Well, I'm off to bed. Sleeping is about the only thing that quiets my brain, so I've been doing a lot more of it. Not such a bad thing, really...
