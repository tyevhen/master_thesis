This evening I prevented scurvy the old fashioned way: hand squeezing lemonade. It didn't seem ridiculous when I was doing it, but I guess it is. And it didn't even turn out that good. So here's a little wake-up call for all the annoying people who perpetuate that used-up slogan:
life better give you more than lemon, cause one measly lemon doesn't make much of anything except lots and lots of seeds
Lemonade needs so much sugar to make it palatable that you could substitute lemon juice with water and not only save lots of time but also make it healthier
maybe procrastinators would be well-served in investing in one of those juice squeezer things
