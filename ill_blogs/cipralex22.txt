I’m getting married soon, and you know how it is… we start thinking about bringing kids to the world… that made me bit worried because of the cipralex I’m taking…


I’ve talked to my doc about this issue, he said not to worry, he said a woman can also take cipralex while she’s pregnant, before and after – and it got no interaction or interference with the cipralex treatment.
Which is good news :-) but I’m planning to decrease the dosage to 15 mg in couple of days as soon as I’ll run out of the 20 mg pills package.
Just wanted to share that info with you guys, also I’m waiting for feedback about the new blog design J
Take care.
