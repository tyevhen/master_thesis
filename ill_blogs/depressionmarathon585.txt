Just a quick note to let you know things are looking up. As I said in my last post, we changed some of the ECT parameters on Friday, and so far that seems to be making a difference. I've had two treatments with the new parameters, and I'm definitely feeling brighter. At this point, I may be able to head home as early as Thursday. I have another treatment tomorrow. If things go really well, I'll just stop the ECTs at 11, rather than 12, and go home Thursday, rather than Saturday. I've been here a very long time, and I am definitely ready to go. After all, I need to begin training for Boston very soon, and that's almost impossible for me to do in here! We'll see how tomorrow goes. If I don't think doing one more ECT will provide any more benefit, I may be home the next time you hear from me!
