Well, sadly, not much. I've been recuperating, returning to my bad habit of staying up late and getting up late, and keeping my good habit of eating healthy. I have not eaten chips (a previously big weakness of mine) for over a month now, and I've been cooking a lot of my own food, and eating very little processed crap. On Saturday I had a marvelous time with my mom buying organic produce. First we went to a local market, and get some peppers, greens, and apples there, before heading to a nearby organic farm that we hadn't been to in years! The owner still recognized my mom, since in my families more healthy past she was a regular customer. When my sister and I were young, my family had a very healthy diet, but as we got older and busier, we slipped into eating the mainstream crappy processed food way too often. Then, however, I started being very environmentally aware and very health conscious, so we're eating healthier again! :-) My mom spent a while talking to the organic farmer dude, while I talked to his university aged son who works for his dad. Which was pretty cool. And now I'm a happy veggie who has LOTS of organic veggies to cook with! :-)

On a not so great note, I still haven't fixed things so my cpictures download onto the correct drive, so it's difficult to post stuff here... Oh well, an old(er) photo will haveto suffice.

Peace
Idzie
