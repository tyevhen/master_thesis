The semester ended last week, and from my perch at the university library I watched another generation of students clutch their diplomas in one hand and swimsuits in another as they marched to their graduation kegger/pool parties. I am still trucking away. Unfortunately, the more progress I make, the further away from the goal I seem to be. For example, my adviser is now giving me the corrections to my corrections to my lit review. For the love of God, I just want to graduate.
