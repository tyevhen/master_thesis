Hi friends!
I'm sorry for being gone so long! We spent a full week up at Togus Pond in Augusta, Maine...we rented my Mom's cousin's camp. It was wonderful! It was also extra special because Paige got to play in the waters where I learned to swim, MY mother learned, HER mother learned, and I bet even HER mother learned. So, we continued a tradition.


There's something so wonderful about going back to your place of childhood fun. I have many warm and happy memories of summer days spent at that pond. There's a certain feeling of coming home. We spent the week swimming, reading, relaxing, chasing Paige around the yard, and just pondering in general. I also turned 32 on July 14th which found us being visited by my parents and my brother later on in the day. It was also a tiring week; spending time in a new place with a wily and quick toddler can wear you thin. But, I knew it would be like that and was happy to relax during her naps! I have so many fun things to share with you this week! First, I'll end this post by showing you a barrage of images from our trip.
