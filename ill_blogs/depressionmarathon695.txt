I'm going back to work today. I took two days off while attempting to climb out of this black hole in which I've been consumed. Actually, I took the time off at the suggestion of my doc. She told me Monday to take a medical leave, or so I thought, but then yesterday she told me she thought work would be helpful. I thought I was doing the right thing. Turns out I wasn't. At times like these, I don't have a clue what the right thing is or isn't. So I'm going back to work.

I'm going back to work today, and I'm scared to death. I feel anxious and numb at the same time. I don't know what I have to give to my patients, and they need me to give them something. I can't be a zombie, but I feel like a zombie. My chest hurts. There is a familiar ache deep within my soul. Will I burst into tears when my first patient opens her door? Seems like a definite possibility. But I pray that doesn't happen.

I'm going back to work today, and I don't feel ready. But then again, how will I ever know if I am ready? Will I ever feel ready? I don't feel ready right now. But as my friend Bill pointed out yesterday, I do have a history of pulling it together despite my health. And that's what I'm banking on, I guess, that I'll pull another rabbit out of my hat and get done what needs to be done. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Ask me at the end of the day. I'm hoping to make it at least that far.
