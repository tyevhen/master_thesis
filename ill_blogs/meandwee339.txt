Not much cooking going on by me; but I HAVE made some baby food here and there. And I make a mean package of Creamy Garlic Shells. Even if all I do is boil water and milk. In this picture I'm wearing my Mom's funky old apron...it's reversible! It's great while cleaning and tending to housework if I'm going to be getting a little bit wet or messy which is most of the time now that Paige is around. :)
