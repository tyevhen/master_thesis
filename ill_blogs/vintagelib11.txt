About a month ago I had the privilege of modelling for my favourite Canberra vintage stall, Librarian Chic. The owner of the stall and I have become friends after many of my visits to her stall. I love the premise of her stall - it's not just about the vintage fashion - it's about the books as well.

I had a lot of fun on the day, dressing up and trying on things I wouldn't normally try on. My favourite outfits in the end were probably the tan skirt suit (a huge surprise for me with my love of colour! But I just loved the vintage feel) and the blue Studibaker Hawk (the final photo) which I would've never tried on in a million years but when I did, I found it fit me like a glove.
