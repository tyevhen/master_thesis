Losing someone is never easy. I knew that losing my grandma would be the first time I ever lost someone close to me. It hit me hard. She passed away earlier this year in January and thinking about her still puts a tear in my eye. I miss her. Months later to today I can finally pull together some of my thoughts of her.
When the moments are dark, I try to remind myself to be like my grandma. She is probably the strongest person I know. I learned so much about her when my family put together a slideshow about her life. The hardships she went through made me heartbroken, but her strength made me want to be the strongest person I can be.
Sometimes I still can't believe she's gone. She was such a big part of my childhood. But at the end of the day I know she felt loved by us and lived a long good life.  It makes me sad that I don't think about her enough because it is hard to rememeber her still, but moving forward I want to turn her memories into positivity and good. That's what she would want me to do.
Miss you poh poh.
