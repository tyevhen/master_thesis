Guess what?

...


I'm writing a book. With pages!


And there will be pictures on the pages. And words. And maybe the pages will be really aerodynamic or something. I haven't really decided what all of the hi-tech features are going to be yet. It's tough to choose.


Anyway, I've been wanting to tell you guys about this for a very, very long time, and now I finally can!

Touchstone (a division of Simon & Schuster) will tentatively release my book in Fall 2012, which sounds like it's a long time away, but really, it's only the gestation period of two slightly premature babies. And if you're a time-traveler, then it can be as soon as you want it to be. It can be now!

If you're not a time traveler, here are some helpful time-frame comparisons to make the book's publication date seem not as far away:


So really, it isn't actually that far away.  And I'll keep updating here in the meantime.  

The book will contain roughly 50% new material.  The other 50% will be posts I've published on this site already, but some of the posts that did not previously contain illustrations will be illustrated.  It will be basically just like my blog in book-form (illustrated short stories, guides, etc.), but it will have at least an attempt at an organizational structure, probably.  

There isn't really an appropriately climactic way to end this announcement, so here's a picture of some shapes:
