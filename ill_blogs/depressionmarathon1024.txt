I found out about an inaugural marathon today. It's an inaugural marathon in nearby Minneapolis. Unfortunately, this inaugural marathon is scheduled for May 31st. I don't know why I'm so tempted to run this race, as it likely would be a really dumb thing to do! Perhaps one obvious reason is that it is the 'inaugural' running. It would be cool to be part of a marathon's first running, especially a marathon which has potential, based on the Twin Cities Marathon, for long-term success. Another reason may be that it will be run alongside the Mississippi River in Minneapolis--i.e. beautiful. And finally, I think I'm just getting impatient. I'm tired of running 17-18 miles, like I did today, for nothing other than training. I want to get to the marathon already!

It's a long process to get ready for a marathon, and at this point it's not all that fun. Racing would be a lot more fun! Besides, my thinking goes, I'm supposed to run 20 miles on May 31st anyway. Why not run those 20 miles in another race? Once I got to 20 miles, I could shuffle my way to the finish, collect my inaugural bling, and go home. Sounds simple enough, huh?

Of course, May 31st is only three weeks before my 'real' marathon, Grandma's. And I hope to qualify for Boston at Grandma's, a goal I will likely put in real jeopardy by running a marathon just 3 weeks prior. But then my brain thinks, "Oh, what the heck? How big a deal can three weeks make anyway? Maybe I'll qualify for Boston in Minneapolis!" I think my brain is getting too big for my head!! Perhaps I need some feedback regarding these imprudent thoughts. If I allow my brain to keep on a-runnin', I'm afraid I'll be running on May 31st! Any thoughts, anyone?
