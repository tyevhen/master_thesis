I think I am heading up the sides of the slippery slope of my rut. Rather than the slip-n-slide cliffs of a few days back, my rut now is less angled, less wet. The footholds are occasionally slick but sometimes firm. I washed the dishes--a firm foothold. I scarfed down 1/4 pan of brownies topped with a pint of ice cream--"Look out below!" I took Puck for a short run--good footing. I couldn't organize my meds, put away those damn clothes, or finish a work project--oops, I slipped. But, hey, I will take a shallow, damp rut over a steep, soaked cliff any day of the week!
Progress, not perfection.

Progress, not perfection. Wow! I never could or would have been satisfied with that a few years ago. It's not something I could have even wrapped my mind around. Sure, I may have been able to say it. I could certainly teach it. It was okay for you. But me--progress not perfection? NO WAY! Tolerating, even embracing progress, and letting go of perfection is another example of this horrible illness positively impacting and changing my character and my life. Remarkable.

I hate the illness.
But-
I am grateful for the character-building it has forced upon me.
