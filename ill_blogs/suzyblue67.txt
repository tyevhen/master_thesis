Sitting in an induction lecture at 11am during freshers week, tired, hungry (and incredibly hungover!) was definitely not my idea of a fun wednesday...that was until I found out as part of our coursework for Stage 2 Fashion Management we would be required to set up and maintain our very own fashion blog. This immediately took my interest and for the week to follow my mind was engulfed with thoughts and ideas about this project.

15 days later, SuzyBlue was born! A haven for all things fashion and beauty related. This blog will feature everything from my style/OOTD's, what trends I'm loving and step by step tutorials on how I create different hair and makeup looks, to snippets of my everyday life as a poor student living in her own bubble-dreaming of the day she can lead a classy and fabulous and fashion filled life in new york (or if that fails, a disney princess at DisneyWorld!)

Thats all for now dolls, stay classy (and fabulous)
Suz x
