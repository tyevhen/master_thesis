So, I have now uploaded some photo's of my new hair colouring (it looks rather blue, but I swear when seen in person it's purple!!)! I'm also adding four videos, of a kind of before and after thing. I look absolutely awful in a couple of them, so I can't believe I'm posting them, but ah well... EDIT: Ack!! I can't get the videos to upload onto the blog, so I'll try again later...
