This plagiarism bullshit has really got me down. Thanks to my loyal reader, commenter, and all around smart person, Mohican, I now know that I am being copied by another site. So if you are reading this on a site titled Depression and Anxiety at Depressiono.com, you are reading blatantly plagiarized material. This is etta at Depression Marathon, and I am the actual author. Unbelievable.

Thanks again to Mohican, I've written another e-mail to the administrator of the offending website asking him to cease and desist. I've heard nothing so far. For those of you who didn't read yesterday's comments, I did succeed in getting the Alaska Psychiatry site to remove my material. In fact, they removed all of the other bloggers' material, too. Now the site appears to be about UFO's. Very strange.

Mohican, again, has suggested some ways I can protect myself in the future. If I can figure out how to implement those suggestions, I certainly will. I've already made one change, and I apologize to those of you who are used to reading my entire post via a feed. I've now changed my feed to a short form, which means you've had to click through to my site in order to finish reading this post. I'm sorry, but it may help protect my posts from being stolen in the future.

Like I said, this whole experience has really gotten me down. It sucks. I just wanted to run my little blog here, but unfortunately there are some unethical, character-less people in this world. I wish those people had never discovered this blog! No worries, though, I'll continue trudging along.
