I think I re-tore my right hip labrum. I was moving a patient at work last week when my right hip popped. Very familiar pain and aching in my groin and thigh followed. I prayed and prayed and prayed it wouldn't be true, but I'm afraid my prayers went unanswered. If torn, this would be the third time. Two surgeries had it fixed, until last week, but I'm not sure three is an option.

I'm not sure I want another surgery even if it is an option. It took about 18 months to fully recover from the last one. In fact, it's only been in the last 3-6 months that I've felt back at full strength. Unfortunately, the only way to thwart the pain is to resect the tear--i.e. surgery. So if it is an option, I'll have to take it. If it's not an option, I'll be in almost constant discomfort and sometimes pain. There is nothing positive here. Both possibilities feel ominous and unwanted.

Sitting here worrying about these potential outcomes is not helpful. It doesn't change a thing. I'd like to go back in time and change how I moved a week ago. Simply repositioning my foot would have avoided the re-injury. I know that now. I wasn't thinking about it then. There is nothing I can do to change my current reality, and that's difficult to accept. I'm frustrated and disappointed. Feeling defeated... I don't want to be sitting here in pain. I don't want to have to deal with this all over again. But I am, and I do. And I'm working on accepting it.
