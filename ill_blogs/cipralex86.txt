had a bit hard time to fall a sleep and also had hard time waking up...



but streghing is fun, i think i notice some minor differences, but i'm still feeling stuck in terms of borders around me or something....side effects are minimal at this stage... in 2 days it will be 2 weeks, many said after two weeks the cipra start to kick in and you start to feel improvements...crossing my fingers and hoping for the best...just came back from the nlp, i've noticed i'm not getting the panic attack when the attention is on me, it was actually like a challenge i enjoyed facing....thats interesting....
