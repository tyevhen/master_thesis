I hope you all have a happy weekend! We are celebrating Easter and Paige will also be going to her buddy's birthday party. Fun is in the air! As is spring, thank GOD!

I have some thoughts on next week's posts...Paige has just completed her evaluation and transition process readying her for preschool (our local public integrated preschool). She qualified for 4 half-days per week and the summer program to prevent regression in her skills. We're thrilled! So, you'll hear more about that.

Also, I thought I would share my favorite baby products with you...after 2 kiddos I've determined our must-haves. Although, everyone's must-haves are different, aren't they? I'll share nonetheless.
