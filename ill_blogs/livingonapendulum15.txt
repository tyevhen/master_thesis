You all know that I have been suffering from depression for a while now

In fact, some of you know that I sank pretty darn low at some point.

The good news is that I am technically better, I am no longer on the brink of death.  I have to admit that this blog, even though I have been somewhat quiet in the last little while has been partially responsible for my imporving.

An audience, no matter how small can make a difference, no matter what my occupational therapist was telling me.

The bad news is that I seem to have plateaued in my recovery.  Furthermore, my symptoms seem to have morphed into a new animal, but still depression.

On one hand I have become terribly confused and lost.  It's like my brain has taken a vacation and forgot to come back.  This may be a side effect of my medications.  I cannot focus and concentrate and I struggle to do what used to be so easy and simple.

On the other hand I have lost interest in so many things.

Former things that brought me joy, even small joy bring me nothing but boredom.

Things like:

reading
playing games online
doing crossword puzzles
the satisfaction of a clean house (or something like it, my house is never clean)
cooking
baking
taking a walk
drawing
crafting
taking a drive
shopping
blogging
etc.
It has all become such a chore, so boring.  It's as if I have become massively lazy.  Before you ask, yes Sex is on that list, but I gave up on sex YEARS ago. 

Anyone have any suggestions or advice on how I can gain pleasure again?

Thanks for reading.
