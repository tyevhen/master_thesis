No problems at all last night and today. I took the aripiprazole a few hours before bed and the quetiapine at bedtime. I watched a film and went to bed about 1am. I was awake by 10:30am. In the past if I have stayed up and watched a film in the early hours I would not wake until 2pm or even later :o).

I am very happy today and thinking the new meds might workout :o).
