Sometimes, a grad student needs to take a break from the hard work of procrastinating and enjoy a good beer in a pretty place. (Or, in my case, take a photo of a nice beer in a nice place)

This photo illustrates one of my many definitions of heaven. Isn't it nice? It makes me happy just looking at it. But it made me happier when I drank the beer.

PS. Kudos to those who can correctly guess the type of beer I was drinking.
PS2. I think the choice of beer (i.e., NOT Schlitz or Naddy Light) separates grad students from the common undergrad.
PS3. Not to brag, but I really outdid myself on this photo. Three cheers for my camera phone!
PS4. I apologize for bragging in PS3.
