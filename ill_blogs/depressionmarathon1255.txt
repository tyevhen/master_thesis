With my mood dive at the beginning of the week, I apparently had a big brain cramp! As a result, I totally forgot I ran 5 miles on Monday. All I remembered was I only managed 3 miles on Tuesday, so I really pushed to get all my weekend miles run despite being dead tired yesterday. Well, no wonder I was tired! By the end of my long run last night, I had logged 49.3 miles! I'm not sure I've ever run that many miles in a week. Ooops! Here is the rest of Week Ten of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program.

Into the pool today. Gotta give the legs a break. Good week. Getting closer to race day! Only 5 weeks left now.
Have a great week everybody!
