As you know from recent posts, my depression has sucked the life out of me lately. Specifically, my thoughts have been disorganized, obsessive, destructive, and confused. I've "lost time" apparently--meaning I've forgotten or just not registered some of the more difficult moments over the past couple days. I've semi-functioned, but something had to be done about my brain! My psychiatrist and I decided today to try a prn of a med that had previously been helpful when my thinking had become so troublesome. I took a tiny dose mid-morning, and it definitely made an impact--I couldn't get out of bed the rest of the day!! It knocked me out cold for over six hours! I slept, and slept, and slept. I attempted to get up twice, but it was futile, so I slept some more. I do feel better. My brain feels a bit more like my own. I guess that was one way to get it to quiet down--Knock it out!! So much for any plans I had for today...but, like I said, I do feel better. Let's hope tomorrow continues more of the same, but maybe with less sleep.
