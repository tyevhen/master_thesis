Ms. Singer and I have been busy lately. Here's what we've been up to...

This pillow. I got this idea to add a crocheted doily from Fine Linen (private blog so I can't link to it). I had this soft burlap-like fabric in my stash and it was just enough to make this pillow.

I stitched on the doily after I had the pillow completed.

Lastly, I added this vintage button...


I think I'd like to make more of these pillows to give as gifts. I'll have to keep my eye out for more crocheted doilies at the thrift stores.

With the scraps, I made these multipurpose C-mas tree ornaments/gift card holders. I can use these to give gift cards in and the receivers can then hang them on their tree. A perfect way to use up fabric scraps!


I also made this longer pillow out of red ticking fabric and some coarse burlap I had. I think I'll stencil a word onto the face of the burlap. I just haven't decided which word I want to use yet.
Ric rac trim...
I frayed the edges of the burlap for a more rustic look...
I've come to the conclusion that I'd sew a lot more often if my sewing machine was sitting out somewhere all the time. It's been gracing my kitchen table for the last couple of days, and I've been so inspired to use it when it's staring me in the face.
