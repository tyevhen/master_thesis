I have five minutes left on a cafe computer. I will continue my discussion of inductive and deductive poetry when my computer is repaired. For now, I encourage any interested to look at Frost. He does both kinds well, but I think his inductive work better. A favorite of mine is "Spring Pools." "The Oven Bird," another good poem, is deductive mainly. Frost is a nice place to start in showing examples.

Gotta sign off. Will be back soon! Mood definitely improved.

Thine,
