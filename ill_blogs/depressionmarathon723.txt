Whew! I'm not used to going out for the weekend. I'm still trying to recover two days later! I feel so old!

I had a great time with my friends this weekend. They had a room at one of the local casinos, so the place was quite plush and hoppin'! After a late dinner, we went to an improv comedy show Saturday night. It was really fun! It's so enjoyable to laugh until your stomach hurts, and that's exactly what we did.

The comedy show didn't start until 10:30 PM. That's really late for me. I'm usually asleep for a couple of hours by that time! I have no idea what time we got back to the hotel, but I do know we chatted, ate some more, gambled a little, and stayed awake until after 3:00 AM! Yikes! My friends, both of whom are several years older than I, really gave me grief about my usual routine. It was all fun.

On Sunday, we went out for a business brunch with some associates of my friends. These associates happen to represent a large shoe company--Brooks. (My friends own a shoe store.) After the Brooks reps found out I was a runner, we talked a little about my running "career." And guess what? They want me to run on one of their running teams! How cool is that? They'll supply me with free racing clothes and shoes, which I will then wear in races. I'm incredibly honored. I'll do anything they want me to do in exchange for free gear!

So I had a really great weekend. Puck got spoiled by my friends, Bill and Cindy, while I got spoiled by my friends, Mary and Jim. The only problem is I'm still wiped out! And it's nap time...again.
