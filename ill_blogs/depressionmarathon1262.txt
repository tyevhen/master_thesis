A good week! One which started with tired legs and ended with quickly recovered legs! I love when that happens. Unfortunately, Puck has some sore hips and will be unable to partner with me for the next 10 days or so...I hate it when he hurts! So I had to do my 12-miler alone. I now understand the loneliness of the long distance runner. Get well soon, my boy! Here is a summary of week nine of the Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon Training Program.

Week Nine: 5/5/08 - 5/11/08
Ran: 6 days
Miles: 41.5
Long Run: 12.1 miles
Speedwork: 4 miles at tempo pace in middle of 10-miler
Found Money: $0.05--tough week in the dropped change department. Apparently, the gas prices are making those clinking coins worth bending over for these days!

Happy with my mileage and with my quick recovery times during latter half of week. Hope to add a little light strength work this week, as I've been slacking on the sit-ups and push-ups! Also start speedwork this week! Yippee! I like running fast!
Have a great week, everyone!
Get outside!
