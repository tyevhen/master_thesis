My knee hurts. I worked today, and I walk all day at work. Walking actually hurts worse than running, so I was pretty sore when I got home. I just looked at my training schedule for this week, and as I suspected, 20 miles is on tap this Saturday. I've decided to take an extra day of rest tomorrow, although I was able to run my 3 mile recovery run today without much difficulty. Like I said, walking causes more discomfort than running.

This sucks, and I'm really worried. It's just ITB tendinitis, but tendinitis can sometimes be a bugger to conquer! I'm icing, icing, icing, and I'll continue treating myself with ultrasound at work tomorrow (one benefit of being a PT). But I am worried.

Things were going so well. I resent this distraction! I've worked so hard already. I really don't want this to get in my way. I have a feeling I'll be repeating multiple serenity prayers over the next several days. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change... Honestly, I'd rather pray for things to change!
