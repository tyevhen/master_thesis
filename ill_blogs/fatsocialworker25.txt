So, I got an iPad for Christmas. Apparently you can blog from this machine! I'm giving it a whirl because if it works, I think y'all can expect to hear from me more often.

This is excellent news because I've had lots and lots of ideas lately (because you know, it's winter break except I don't understand the meaning of the word "break"). Upcoming posts include a review of Golda Poretsky of Body Love Wellness's new book and a discussion of the writings of Irvin D. Yalom, body size and countertransference.

I hope that anyone this blog post reaches had a safe holiday. I also hope this blog post reaches anyone!

In solidarity,
