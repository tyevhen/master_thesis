Here I sit in my little town; not far from Boston as authorities shut everything down to hunt down the Marathon bomber. I went over to the post office to mail some orders to my customers and the clerk told me they aren't allowed to deliver mail as of now (I'm guessing until they catch the guy).  All this violence and negativity breaks my heart for my children who have to grow up in this kind of atmosphere. I'm going to be vigilant in protecting them from these outside sources; making them play outside all the time amongst the sunshine and trees as they blissfully live out their childhoods...oblivious to the violence not far away.
One thing I know; we will pray. We will rely on higher powers to carry out a greater plan which we are a part.
