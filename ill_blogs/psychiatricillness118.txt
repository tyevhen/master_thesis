I visited my GP yesterday and the psychiatrist this morning. I said I have been feeling a bit low for a few weeks now. The GP is being really helpful, I am having a load of blood tests next week to rule out anything physical. The psychiatrist is suggesting that my quetiapine is reduced from 200mg to 150mg daily. He says I am probably sleeping too much because I am over sedated. He also said it might be a bit of depression. Therefore, if I am not more lively in 3 weeks I have to increase the sertraline back up to 100mg daily. I have to go back to the psychiatrist in 6 weeks.

I am a little worried about going privately to the psychiatrist and having NHS prescriptions. What if the meds he recommends are not available on the NHS. There has been a lot in the media about this recently. Also when I bought my flat I moved out of the catchment area for my current GP and have not changed GP yet. I don't want to change as I now have a young female doctor who seems on the ball. She is the first decent GP I have had in about 10 years.
