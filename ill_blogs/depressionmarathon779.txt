I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm still in garage sale hangover mode. Maybe I'm not as active as I like to think. I don't know, but I'm feeling really lazy this weekend. I got out yesterday morning to help with our local half-marathon, but otherwise I've done absolutely nothing this weekend. I contemplated riding my bike this morning--a gorgeous morning--but here I sit with my cup of coffee listening to NPR instead.

I'll be honest. I'm hoping to work up the gumption to get on my bike later today. I would like to get back in shape. I feel so much better when I'm in shape. (Although I am feeling pretty okay now!) I wish I wouldn't take these exercise breaks, as it's always so hard to get started again. But then again, I think there is something healthy about taking breaks, too. Who knows? I'm envious of those who can run and run and run for years on end and seem to enjoy it all the time. Sometimes it's just work for me. Today may be one of those work days.

I've not much else to report. Lazy weekends don't lend themselves to news and stories. I am still recovering from my garage sale. Maybe I'll get busy cleaning and rearranging my house today. Then again, maybe I'll just sit here, drink coffee, and enjoy NPR.

Don't underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering. --Pooh's Little Instruction Book, inspired by A.A. Milne
