I found an interesting blog post on morning anxiety, a phenonomen I experience. For some reason, my anxiety is usually worse before noon (on weekdays), and by the end of the day activities that make me very anxious in the morning aren't as anxiety provoking. It's comforting to know that other people have the same experience.
