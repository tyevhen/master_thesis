Some interesting articles I've found recently are:

The Left? No Thanks! by John Zerzan. A short critique of the left as a whole.

Parenting... A Radical, Political Act by Tabitha Tucker is about how very radical being a stay-at-home-parent actually is.

Mourning a Daughter, Celebrating a Son by Adriana Barton. A cool article about transgender teens.

Education Needs to be Turned on its Head by Leo Babauta is a good introductory article on unschooling. As usual for these types of articles, some of the comments are very frustrating!

Home Birth With Midwife Safe as Hospital from CBC. Overall very positive article on the safety of home births. From what I've read, home births are actually safer, but at least more people can see that they really are at least as safe as hospital births!

Peace,
Idzie
