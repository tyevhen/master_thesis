I wrote these song lyrics when I was in high school, when I wanted to make a commitment, to God and my future husband, to purity in my life and love until I was married.  I never put these lyrics to music, though I hummed a little here and there, but I always thought of it as a song.


A Love from the Lord

1
We have not met each other
But I know that you are there
Someday our love will grow
And we'll be the perfect pair

We'll be brought together 
In God's own time
But I can't help wishing
His time would be mine

Chorus:
And we'll love each other
With a love from the Lord
You will be mine
And I will be yours

It will be worth the wait
There's no doubt in my heart
That in the strength of the Lord
We will never part

2
I pray for you now
As you go along your way
That your best friend will be Jesus
And you'll be close to him each day

May your steps be guided
By the light of his love
And everything you do
Bring glory to him above

Chorus:
And we'll love each other
With a love from the Lord
You will be mine
And I will be yours

It will be worth the wait
There's no doubt in my heart
That in the strength of the Lord
We will never part

3
If you should love someone
Before our love comes to be
Please treat her the way
You'd want a guy to treat me

And I pray that neither of us 
Will do anything that can't be undone
So that on our wedding day
We can each say, "You are the only one"

Chorus:
And we'll love each other
With a love from the Lord
You will be mine
And I will be yours

It will be worth the wait
There's no doubt in my heart
That in the strength of the Lord
We will never part

AMEN
yes
AMEN



It was 20 years after writing these lyrics that, last year, I married my husband.  It was a much longer wait than I ever thought it would be, but today I am so blessed to see that in all the ways my husband and I stayed true to the pure desires in my song before we were married, we are reaping the joy, and love, and trust in each other and God that has come from that commitment.  

Thank you, Jesus, for your help!  

I love you, my husband!  It was worth the wait to be with you!  There is no doubt in my heart.
With God's strength, we will never part.
