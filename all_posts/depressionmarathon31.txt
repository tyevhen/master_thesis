i began participation in the clinical drug trial today i had my first ketamine infusion it took almost hours by the time all was said and done , and i was exhausted afterward fortunately , i had very few side effects during the infusion i got a little spacey feeling , my blood pressure went up a bit , and my lips went numb all are normal side effects it could have been much worse nausea and even hallucinations are two of the other of a myriad of possibilities i am grateful i tolerated it with such ho hum effects , but unfortunately , i did n't have any big , miraculous shifts in my mood either i did feel mildly more relaxed and slightly less hopeless immediately following the infusion , but within minutes the tears , hopelessness , and intrusive suicidal thoughts had reemerged i'm doing my best not to panic , but i am feeling discouraged that 's the unfortunate price of hope the study coordinators still believe i am an ideal candidate for a favorable result , and they warned me i may not get relief until after the second or even the third infusion the second infusion will be done on thursday the third is scheduled for next monday , hopefully as an outpatient if my symptoms do remit , i will then have one infusion per week for the following four weeks i do hope i qualify for those four follow up infusions hope is still difficult though and scary i do n't want to be disappointed again i want relief i want relief from this illness i want my life back i want to return to me at this point working , running , and living functionally and independently in my home seem a long way away i want to get back to living with rather than suffering from depression suffering is just too painful if you pray , please keep 'em coming , my friends
