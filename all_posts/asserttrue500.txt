as the dimensionality of a hypersphere increases , more and more of the volume is near the surface the pink and red portions of the hyperspheres shown in cross section here each contain of the volume 'n' is the dimensionality the common supposition is that when your knowledge of something is surface deep , it 's tantamount to knowing nothing but is that always true ? what if you understand many facets of a complex topic , some perhaps at deep level , but you lack formal training in those facets ? does it mean your understanding rounds off to zero ? hardly here 's one way to look at it suppose the subject domain whatever it happens to be can be represented , conceptually , as a sphere everything there is to know about the subject maps to some region inside the sphere total knowledge represents the total contents the total volume of the sphere if the sphere is three dimensional , half the volume is contained in an inner sphere that has of the radius of the overall sphere stay with me on this for a moment , even if you 're not a math person for purposes of discussion , we 'll consider a sphere of radius a so called unit sphere by comparison to a unit sphere , a sphere that has a radius of contains half the volume of the unit sphere the reason for this is that volume grows as the cube of the radius , and the cube root of is so that 's what i mean when i say that the innermost of a sphere any dimensional sphere , as measured in terms of its radius , contains of the volume of the sphere the outermost of the radius bounds the outermost of the sphere 's volume this is summarized in the topmost portion of the accompanying graphic , where we see the cross section of a sphere with the innermost half of the volume shaded in pink and the outermost half shaded in dark red the boundary between the two half volumes starts at a point on the radius that 's of the way from the center to the surface now suppose we consider a hypersphere of dimensionality that 's the middle sphere of the graphic the one that has n next to it the volume of such a sphere grows as the tenth power of the radius therefore the inner and outer half volumes are delimited at a point on the radius that is of the way from the sphere 's center the tenth root of is again , the graphic depicts the outer half volume in dark red notice how much thinner it is than in the top drawing if we step up the dimensionality to n , the half volumes are delimited at the radius point half the volume of the hypersphere is contained in just the outer of radius you can see where i'm going with this as the dimensionality n approaches infinity , all of a hypersphere 's volume is contained in the surface so if the dimensionality of a problem is large enough and you 're willing to buy into the simple volume is knowledge model set forth earlier , surface deep knowledge can be quite valuable indeed the next time someone tells you your knowledge of something is only surface deep , consider the number of dimensions to the problem , then tell the person dude this is an n dimensional problem , and since n is high in this case , surface deep knowledge happens to be plenty let me explain why
