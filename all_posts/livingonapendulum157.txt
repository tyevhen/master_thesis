originally written in when i was a young child , i was normal my parents enrolled me in various activities and sports in actuality they enrolled me in various sports through the years , such as swimming , figure skating , gymnastics , ringette and ballet jazz i was always the top of my class and had quite a varied language speaking in two official languages i had such a master of words that i would often be called a walking encyclopedia i had a lot of energy i would be able to function at top level with few hours of sleep a typical day in winter , i would wake up at am to get ready and go to my skating lessons which would run from am to am i would then go to school at lunch time i would walk home for lunch , then walk back to school , play in the yard for a bit before class after class , i would head back to the arena for some more skating i would help some younger ones learn how to skate afterwards , i had my ringette for an hour then would go home to have supper , do my homework and go out to walk around town with my friends in summer replace skating with swimming and dancing lessons and hanging out at the beach i was also an avid reader , walking or biking to the library to borrow a book every few days every once in a while i would bike to the next town over to visit friends or watch a movie in summer this was about a minute drive in high school , they tested my iq and found out it was above average again i was top of my class though my activities had changed , i was still quite active when i moved out while i was in college , i was able to hold two jobs while going to school one job was part time , the other full time i would get up early in the morning to go for a two hour swim at school , do my classes then go to work i would often find the time and energy to go out partying with my friends after work i had my daughter while in college after college i was a single working mother , i had two night shift jobs hours during the week and during weekends i was able to go to work at night , pick up my daughter in the morning , take care of my child , do household chores and errands , take a nap with her in the afternoon then bring her back to the babysitter for bedtime and head off to work even though i had a hectic schedule , i still had time to spend with friends , bake , clean , shop i was an active person but my body did have its strengths and weaknesses even back then i was strong and enduring , i could go for hours and lift heavy things but i was slow and uncoordinated i could not hit a moving target if my life depended on it in a long distance race , i would be last at the start line but end up first as the others could not last the distance i could lift heavy objects for long periods of time and climb stairs i had a friend who lived on the th floor when i was in college i would never take the elevators when visiting him , always took the stairs up and down when moving , i could carry as any man i had no need for coffee that was me then things started to change after my son was born i was all of a sudden i was exhausted my legs were weak my back was hurting more than ever i could no longer work night shift i bought a cane at a certain point to help me walk and keep my balance i had no energy my emotions , which to tell the truth , had always been a little iffy went out of control ! that was the beginning now i cannot walk for more than minutes , cannot stand for more than walking helps to move my muscles and joints around so i can last longer i am always tired , drinking coffee like there is no tomorrow i always forget my words and my thoughts my body is always hurting somewhere where i used to be able to climb flights of stairs , i now almost collapse after the slightest effort depletes me i am proud i push my limits every day i do the stairs , i do the shoveling , i walk to the grocery store my motto is use it or lose it some say i should go on disability i can t , my children deserve more but when i get up in the morning , feeling exhausted , hurting in every part of my body , unable to form a clear thought , it s hard very hard , and this is a good day sometimes it gets worst i am , a single mom and work full time thanks for reading ! feel free to comment i fixed the comment options
