this is part of an month group project on litsy to read one chapter of harry potter a day , and to comment on a theme each day these posts will have spoilers today 's theme is loneliness there are three lonely characters in chapter harry himself , the snake , and presumably mrs figg mrs figg is only mentioned glancingly , but i think a little loneliness is shown in an older woman living alone who delights in showing off pictures of her many cats i 'll focus on harry and the snake both harry and the snake are being raised away from their natural homes they are both kept in cages harry in a cupboard and the snake in a cage and both get poked and prodded and abused the snake through the glass they can sense this in one another , and this is why they make an instant bond together what was rowling trying to say about loneliness in this chapter ? partly that it can bring together outcasts who would otherwise have nothing in common loneliness can be a glue whether this glue creates a healthy relationship or not depends on the people in this case , both harry and the snake benefited from the relationship the snake was released from captivity , and dudley was scared out of his wits not that he has many wits to begin with this was a healthy relationship there are unhealthy relationships that loneliness creates in future chapters of the book , but this post is only on the second chapter
