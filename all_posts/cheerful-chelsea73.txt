no face art today , the inspiration was there but my hands and head would n't cooperate so here 's a cheery face instead when i am especially unhappy in myself i seek to change physical things in the past year my hair has been a variety of colours , i 've been tattooed and pierced most of these changes i have embraced and have n't regretted i will certainly never regret my tattoos , both of which happen to be floral and could mistakenly be seen as being 'girly' , which is n't an issue but a girly tattoo was n't the outcome i was looking for i have a lotus flower on my wrist , the location seemed appropriate as prior to the time of getting the tattoo i had started self harming , a point that i never saw myself coming to i thought that if i was ever that distressed again i 'd be able to look at my wrist and remind myself to stay strong , the tattoo was almost a reward for finally holding my hand up and admitting that i needed help five petals for five years of suffering in silence , five years of self loathing and living in isolation the lotus flower lives in murky waters , usually pretty boggy places , they settle at the bottom of the water where the light cannot reach them but each day the flower rises to the surface of the water , it seeks the light and starts anew each day a new beginning i also have a floral piece on my side along with the words every flower must grow through dirt , even the most beautiful of creations sometimes have to live through bad conditions unfortunately i am still living amongst the dirt , waiting to bloom and tilt my face towards the sun i certainly never thought that i would ever get tattoos when i was younger i was brought up to think that they were ugly , that they would n't age well and were associated with certain groups of people but now i appreciate that some people need a solid reminder to stay strong or to have hope when things get tough , and if that prevents someone from breaking down or self harming then so be it i 've never had much confidence in my body , i still struggle to like the way i look but since having my tattoos i 've felt a lot more comfortable in my skin some of the other changes i 've made or attempted have n't helped me as much they have all been attempts to help me feel more comfortable in myself and perhaps to gain confidence i had to force myself to see past the 'my little pony unicorn' hair and see the reflection of a broken girl staring at me , pleading me to address the problems caused by the stubborn sting of depression the bitter reality is that i 've lost who i was , i still do n't know who i am or what i'm supposed to do i'm sure that most of us go through these periods , but for some of us these periods are a long and brutal road to discovering our purpose and our identity when you lose the sense of who you are , it can be difficult to stay in the present i often look back to when everything changed , whether i should have made some different decisions and then perhaps i would n't be in this situation now changes can be unsettling , they can involve some regrettable decisions , but some changes are for the better i ca n't keep my mind in the past every decision i made six years ago and up until today have shaped the person i am , those decisions have caused a lot of pain , but they have also lead to me meeting some of the greatest people , finding my partner and best friend , allowing someone to etch my artwork on my skin and most importantly have allowed me to experience this cruel illness and i truly hope that my experiences , letting those moments be heard and providing the smallest solutions and insights to getting better , i really hope they can help someone
