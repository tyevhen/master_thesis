the state of if only is not a place you 'll find on a map you ca n't set your gps to get you there but you can live your entire life in the state of if only and not even realize it living in the state of if only do any of these statements sound familiar ? if only i had a boyfriend , i would be content if only i won the lottery , i would be happy if only i had a sports car , women would like me if only i was prettier , men would notice me if only i was thinner , i would feel good about myself if only my ex would speak to me , i could go on with my life if only i had a girlfriend , i would stop drinking if only my wife understood me , i would stop cheating on her getting stuck living in the state of if only living in the state of if only is a state of mind i could probably come up with at least a hundred more of these statements and so can you , but i think you get the idea that living in the state of if only is a state of mind usually , it 's a self imposed state where we tell ourselves that if we had fill in the blank , then life would be worthwhile often , this is something we tell ourselves over and over again as we wait , wish , and hope for whatever it is that completes our particular if only statement living in the state of if only is like living in limbo living in the state of if only is like living in limbo and wondering when you 'll get out when we 're in denial about this limbo state , we can blame everyone , anyone or anything else and not take any personal responsibility for what is usually a self imposed state we might experience it as if someone or something is doing this to us but most of the time , we 're in denial that we 're doing it to ourselves acknowledging that you 're in the state of if only in order to get out of this state of mind , you must first realize that this is where you are acknowledging this , even to yourself , let alone to anyone else , can be very difficult it can make you feel uncomfortable because if this is , in reality , a self imposed state , that implies that you 're doing this to yourself and you need to stop ingrained habits can be hard to break , and habitually making your happiness completely dependent upon someone or something outside yourself is often a habitual way of thinking whether it 's something you learned when you were growing up or you developed it later in life , it involves a certain amount of denial about what you can do to be happy as opposed to waiting for someone or something outside yourself living in the state of if only can be like living with the devil you know once you 've acknowledged that you 're caught in a self imposed state of mind and you 've developed an awareness about it , you need to take action to change it this often takes a lot of internal motivation and here 's where many people get stuck they might not be happy with their state of mind , but change can be scary there 's an old saying that goes something like it 's better to live with the devil you know than the devil you do n't know in some ways , even though you might be unhappy , you know and you 've become comfortable with your personal devil , even though he might be torturing you getting out of the state of if only taking the first step there often comes a time when living in this state of mind becomes more uncomfortable than the fear you experience when you think about changing at that point , you have to admit to yourself that , even though it might be very hard to change and let go , it 's better than being miserable for the rest of your life at that point , in effect , you 're at a crossroad and you know you ca n't go back you know you ca n't keep doing what you 've been doing making that decision is taking the first step to making a change in your life getting help if you 've made the decision to change , but you 're finding it difficult to change on your own , you could benefit from seeking professional help from a licensed psychotherapist a psychotherapist wo n't tell you what to do no one can tell you what 's right for you but a therapist can help you to work through the issues that are keeping you stuck rather than live your entire life stuck in a self imposed negative state of mind , you owe it to yourself to get help so you can lead a more fulfilling life about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
