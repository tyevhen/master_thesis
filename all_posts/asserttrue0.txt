i have found a number of sizable palindromes in mycobacterium leprae br i report two here the larger one is bases long ggtgcttgttttgcaatctcgaccattacctggccttaaggccaggtaatggtcgagattgcaaaacaagcacc this is a true palindrome in that the reverse complement of the sequence exactly equals the sequence it occurs precisely once hence is not a crispr in pseudogene mlbr , which appears to be an analog of m tuberculosis soluble secreted antigen mpt the pseudogene in question , of length bases , is flanked on one side by a pseudogene that appears to be an analog of a s rrna methyltransferase , and on the other side by a pseudogene that is an analog of a putative integral membrane protein mlbr has a g c content of the pseudogenes on either side of it have g c contents of and the palindrome is long enough to fold back on itself to produce a hairpin like secondary structure of substantial size its function , if any , is of course unknown a palindrome of length can be found in pseudogene mlbr taccttggttagggcatagccgctgtgcagctgcacagcggctatgccctaaccaaggta mlbr has a g c content of only and appears to be an analog of type vii secretion protein ecce from mycobacterium malmoense and others , which has a g c content of the rather advanced at shift of the pseudogenes is consistent with runaway accumulation of random mutations the existence of long , intact palindromes in the midst of such mutational mayhem is surprising , leading one to wonder whether secondary structure is preferentially conserved in pseudogenes , even as codons degrade indeed , maybe that 's one reason why the pseudogenes continue to exist after an estimated to million years their secondary structures are needed
