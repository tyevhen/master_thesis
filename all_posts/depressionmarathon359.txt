why is it so difficult to ask for help ? i know i am not the only one who finds the prospect of asking others for assistance distasteful in fact , i grew up in a region of the country , among a nationality of people , who are known for , no , no , i'm okay everything is fine meanwhile the barn is burning down behind them anyone out there listen to garrison keillor on prairie home companion ? he 's not making up that attitude ! the point is , asking others for help is not one of my strengths unfortunately for me , despite my distaste for needing assistance from others , i am now in a position where i need help despite my best efforts , this depression episode has me in a precarious financial position my financial reality is grim my first hospital admission was september , i have not worked one hour since then unfortunately , as of november st , both my accrued vacation time and my employer provided disability benefit were exhausted in other words , i no longer receive a paycheck i have been without an income for five weeks , and that is not going to change any time soon let me tell you a little about myself i am a very proud woman i value taking care of myself financially i have an almost perfect credit score , do not use credit cards , and have rarely , if ever , been late paying a bill unfortunately , i do have debt my house , my vehicle , student loans , healthcare loans , jet 's surgery loan , as well as normal household bills keep me on my toes fortunately , i do have a small amount of money saved rather than use it for the new garage siding for which it was intended , i am now using it to pay my monthly bills soon , my pride will be tested , as all of my financial accounts hit zero since it looks like i may not be returning to work soon , my social worker and i have begun the month process of applying for social security disability whether or not i will be approved is any body 's guess i am trying to remain calm , to stay in today , but my stress as i look into the future has begun to climb and this is why and where i need to ask for help despite my value of financial independence , i have placed a donation link on my blog today the link will take you to paypal , and a donation in any amount can be made if you are interested in helping out , i will humbly accept your good will i will use the donations to pay my bills that 's it every dollar received will go toward keeping me in my house with the heat on and the lights glowing , supplying groceries to eat , and paying my healthcare bills i will be seeking deferments of my loans , but most of my bills simply must be paid , or i will lose what i 've worked so hard to gain placing a donation link on my blog was an extremely difficult decision to make , and i likely would not have done it without significant encouragement from those closest to me but now it 's done , and as i said , should you choose to use it , i will graciously and humbly accept your assistance during this difficult time i thank all of you for taking time out of your day to read , comment on , and support me through my little blog my gratitude is enormous
