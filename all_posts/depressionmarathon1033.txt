i was going to write about how i came back from my long , low day and ran x meters they were n't the fastest repeats i had ever run , nor did they feel the easiest , but the point was i did them it was going to be a really good post about all the correlations to life , moment to moment living , etc i thought i might write about friends and their importance in our lives , especially when we are struggling i planned to tell you about my weekly get together to watch lost and share a meal with two close friends it would have been a nice , upbeat post instead , i find myself writing about a drunk it 's not going to be nice , upbeat , nor inspiring but here goes i spent the better part of the last couple days dealing with a very drunk young woman she was months sober when she made the decision to start drinking last week four days in detox and multiple phone calls between us led me to believe it was an isolated incident but when she failed to phone for days post discharge , i knew the isolated incident was actually an unfulfilled fantasy with trepidation and frustration , i went to check on her more than four hours in the er was finally followed by another trip to detox , which is where she remains today this is one problem with alcoholism we drunks have an amazing capacity to throw nails under our own tires we do n't just screw things up , we blow them up we do n't just decide to drink , we decide to die if this young woman does n't get it soon , she will quickly die , and i need to get in the way of that i need to stop the death it 's not a position i want to be in it 's not a role i relish in truth , her recent self destruction really pisses me off and i understand it ! after months of construction , she 's blown up her foundation , burned her structure down , and smoked her landlord , boss , family and friends there is nothing and nobody left except me i pray i can help her put out the flames
