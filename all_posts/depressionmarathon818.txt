i 've been feeling a little conflicted about my blog lately i began this blog in the throes of depression , feeling like i needed to help others who were struggling like me i was n't working , as i had been disabled by my illness for several years i knew nothing about blogging i learned as i went along i was early in recovery , and knew very little about living a sober life i had time to write , the creativity of someone in pain , and lots to say in those early days , i wrote and wrote and wrote i had little support those around me thought it strange writing a blog about feeling bad and running whoever heard of such a thing ? what did i hope to accomplish ? nevertheless , i poured out descriptive posts and even a few poems my goal was to educate , support , and share but no one knew i was there , and i was happy when i got ten readers in a month it did n't matter the writing made me feel better now , it turns out , i 've got readers , and followers , and recognition among my peers based on comments i 've received , it seems the writing makes you feel better , too but i'm feeling conflicted as i gathered readers , and comments , and recognition , something in me began to shift i had fewer and fewer days in the black hole of which i once so passionately wrote i got better over the course of this blog , you 've seen me go from disabled to work there was a time not that long ago when i did n't think i 'd ever work in my chosen field again you 've read along as i 've taken this illness from my bed to competitive racing in the streets the illness which did n't allow me out of my bed now allows me energy to train for a triathlon i think largely because of my connection with all of you , i 've been healing unfortunately , healing leaves me conflicted i have less time and creativity now posts which used to flow like water rushing down the mountain side now thunk like cold peanut butter on soft bread i find less to be proud of in my words creativity has given way to utility whereas i used to write nearly every day , i now find time , hopefully , only times per week this blog which used to be about mental illness , with a little running on the side , now seems to be more about running and swimming , and biking with a little mental illness on the side i began this blog to educate others about depression am i still accomplishing that goal ? am i still accomplishing what i set out to do ? am i still a voice for those with mental illness ? do they find solace or comfort or support in my posts ? i do n't know but if they do n't , if i'm no longer a voice for those with whom i hope to connect , is it time to say i'm done ? i do n't know it 's weird i feel a little guilty for feeling better i feel a little bad about not feeling so bad can a person in remission still connect with those who are n't ? i hope that my feeling better offers some hope , but i do n't know if it does does it ?
