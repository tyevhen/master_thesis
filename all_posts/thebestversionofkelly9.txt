when i posted my first catch up post a week and a half ago i said i would update you on some areas in more detail i 've done diet and now it is the turn of my physical health namely my chronic fatigue syndrome cfs me i started this blog back in january to log my journey to improve my physical and mental health , face my fears and generally become a better version of me in terms of facing my fears i did rather well during the first half of this year and you may remember a post i wrote on those achievements , if not you can find that here if you have n't read that post please take a few minutes to do so as you will get a real insight into me , why i set up this blog and the journey i am on so how am i doing with my physical health ? it s tempting to say not good i am a natural born pessimist ! that wouldn t be fair though as i have made progress this year as i said it s too easy to say i haven t achieved progress but that is because firstly i am not yet where i want to be and secondly because the progress is so slow it s hard to notice it yet when i make myself think back to how i was a year ago i realise i have made huge progress i was still working then , just hours a week , but it felt like i worked , collected the kids from school and that was about it i would often go to bed at and sleep till the following day i had head fog pretty much daily and constant aches and pains , especially in my legs i have now had a year off work , firstly as sick leave and now as redundancy i have managed to get a lot of rest during that year and physically that has certainly helped me i can now stay up till or even most nights i can do housework or go out for a short walk or do some shopping or meet a friend and generally be fine so long as i get some rest too the pains are now mostly only aches and are not constant and i only get head fog if i have over done it sometimes i think i must be completely recovered now so will have a busy weekend with a later night to test myself and sadly it does catch up with me , but a couple of days rest gets me back on track and i can plan for that so , i am not cured but i am managing the condition well of course , if you read my catch up post here you will know i have had a lot of stress to contend with the past two years and so whilst the physical rest has been there the mental rest hasn t now the stress is done with manically touches wood i hope i can get the mental rest i need and that may be the final piece in the puzzle of recovery if recovery is even possible some people call it a remission , i guess they mean they are back to fully functioning normally but are also aware they could get another flare at any time we shall see whatever happens at least i know i have found a way to better manage this and i feel blessed to be better off than so many other cfs sufferers touches wood again i started the year with a whole list of challenges to tackle , i wanted to do it all in twelve months as we are now already into november it 's unlikely i will but you know what , that is ok so long as i am always making progress who cares how long it takes this is n't a journey with a set destination , it 's my life and i just need to keep finding the motivation to better it , little by little thank you for reading kelly x
