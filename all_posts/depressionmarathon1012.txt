i saw my doc yesterday morning , complained about feeling bad , tired , lethargic , blah , blah , blah she was her usual quiet , patient self with me i knew , as my psychologist told me the night before , it would pass with time it always does that 's so hard to remember when you 're in the middle of it , is n't it ? well , long story short , despite my worry , negative thinking , fatigue and lethargy , i made it to my appointments yesterday then i made it out for a run then i began feeling better i made it out for a run before work this morning , too that was amazing ! work went okay i tried to focus on feeling better , which i was , rather than on feeling tired , which i also was i am feeling better perhaps the depression reprieve is back i'm glad it was n't gone too long sixteen miles scheduled for tomorrow good thing i'm feeling better here 's to all of us meeting our goals this weekend !
