have you seen mad men ? this is one of those television series that critics and rabid fans tell you that a you are n't watching and b you really suck because you are n't watching it because it is so stinkin' good i do n't know about all that i like good movies and i like good tv a while back i decided to check out mad men and , i must say , it really is pretty good it took until season two for it to really amaze me overall i 'd say it 's an interesting and compelling show , especially if you 're a us citizen but , my views on popular entertainment are not why we 're here , are they ? the reason i bring the show up is that every time i watch the opening sequence the phrase sweet , sweet suicide comes to mind i 'll post it below so you can see what i'm talking about the trancy music , the faceless cartoonism , the generic businessmen floating down it all seems like a beautiful , drifting , perfect suicide i doubt that 's what the creators meant but , being a guy who 's spent most of his life thinking about suicide , that 's what i see do n't get me wrong i'm not on the edge i'm okay for now however , i ca n't watch this and not think how relaxed and lovely this guy looks as his floats to his death i 've often wished i could a few minutes later i'm having some trouble with this video if you ca n't play it above , click here
