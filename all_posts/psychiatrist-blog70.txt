dear aetna , i would contact you directly , but believe me , i 've tried perhaps you could help me i am a psychiatrist is baltimore and somehow my name is on aetna 's provider panel i never filled out an application or request with aetna and i have no desire to be on their panel over the last couple of years , i had gotten a few calls from prospective patients , clarified that i am not an aetna provider , at least not willingly , and left it at that recently , the calls have escalated to as many as a week i have called aetna repeatedly , and i ca n't seem to find a voicemail option that allows me to speak with a human i received a call left as voicemail from aetna the other day saying i must refund a patient because i charged more than the allowable rates for an aetna cover patient , and the patient told them i was not in network , and a number was left for me to call when i dialed that number , the automated answer machine knew who i was i suppose by my phone number ? but then none of the prompts led to an option to discuss network participation or to speak with a human i have also gone to their website , where there is a place to report network issues , and i reported there that i am not in network and never heard anything i googled the chief medical officer and tried to call him , without success this is a lot of time and effort to dis enroll from a company i had never enrolled with ! even your contact page is a fiasco network inadequacy is an enormous problem for patients and aetna makes it extremely difficult to address
