there is an article in the atlantic called the rise of work doping that talks about provigil modafinil as a medication that enhances cognition with very few side effects medically , we use it to treat narcolepsy the uncontrollable urge to fall asleep but i 've also seen patients on it for depression often a desperation measure prescribed during a hospitalization in terms of cognition and motivation , i have n't seen it do amazing things maybe the patient has more energy and functions a little better , but it 's been no panacea for low motivation or cognitive jump starting there 's a caveat here i 've used very little of it for a very practical reason the medication cause roughly for pills give or take a couple of hundred and it 's not a drug that insurances are eager to approve i 'd like to tell you something about the practice of psychiatry , or at least about my practice i see a fair number of patients with mood disorders , and the mood disorders are often pretty easy to treat the symptoms generally resolve no , not for everyone , but a for a lot of people and while many people get better and return to work and to a meaningful , active life , there are some people who stay stuck in a life they are disappointed with despite the resolution of the depressive symptoms they remain unmotivated especially for things they do n't enjoy doing , may not return to work or do so in notably under employed ways , and can find it hard to accomplish even little things , like cleaning up a bedroom or closet , or plowing through a to do list , or organizing a vacation , or coping with a broken car iphone computer or perhaps their moving along okay , but they are n't happy with their lives the way they are and just ca n't seem to do what 's necessary to get life to change often these people also have issues with attention to detail and organizing their lives they forget appointments , lose their keys and phones , and have trouble planning ahead what we call executive function while stimulants may help these folks with concentration and energy , they do n't seem to do much for helping with organizational skills so while i'm not interested in giving provigil to healthy executives who want a raise , i am interested in knowing if you have tried it with your patients with executive dysfunction , and if it 's been helpful to them ?
