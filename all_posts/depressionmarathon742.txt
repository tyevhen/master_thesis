our first very cold day today according to my car 's temp readout , i do n't think it ever reached degrees at least the sun was out that was nice but now it 's dark outside i do n't like the early darkness at all it 's getting more and more difficult for me as i age , i think it 's especially tough on my mood i do n't want to go outside when it 's like this , which means i do n't get as much exercise or even fresh air and that 's also tough on my mood i feel like going to bed , and it 's only pm ! i ca n't go to bed , though , as i need to ride a little yet tonight i was going to go to the gym , but again , it 's tough for me to go out in this weather i guess i 'll pull my stationary bike in front of the television and ride at home for awhile i usually like tapering for my marathons , but i'm feeling restless and anxious this time hopefully getting on the bike will help it 's hard to believe i 'll be in dallas on friday the marathon is sunday i feel ready i'm not sure yet if i'm going to run the race hard or just for fun i think i will probably race it my training went well , and i feel like i'm in good shape i do n't think i ran enough miles to run a personal best or anything , but it would be fun to re qualify for boston i 'd have to finish under to do that a few thoughts before i sign off did anyone notice that major league baseball 's american league and national league mvps both had mental illness and or substance abuse histories ? espn talking about depression and alcoholism that was refreshing ! did anyone else notice that dorothy hamill is now doing tv commercials to raise money , as a cancer survivor , for cancer ? i wonder why she never did that , as a depression survivor , for mental illness ? too bad the depth of darkness to which you can descend and still live is an exact measure of the height to which you can aspire to reach author unknown
