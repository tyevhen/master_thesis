because they 've been adversely impacted by their lack of skills in this area , and they want to change the following fictionalized scenario , which is not about any one person and has no identifying information , illustrates how someone who has not developed emotional intelligence can learn to develop these skills in psychotherapy bob bob was a man in his early s when he began psychotherapy , he had just received his annual performance review at his new company , and he was very disappointed to learn that his boss , gregg , was not pleased with how bob interacted with others at work while gregg praised bob for his technical skills , he told bob that he needed to improve how he interacted with his colleagues and senior management he felt that bob was too aloof and isolated at work , and he was not a team player gregg told bob that this was not just his opinion he had also received this feedback from bob 's peers and other managers at the company gregg told bob that his potential success at the company depended on bob learning to develop emotional intelligence on the job he recommended that bob read daniel goleman 's book , emotional intelligence gregg also told bob to consider getting emotional help to overcome whatever emotional barriers might be getting in bob 's way from forming good interpersonal relationships at work bob was also experiencing difficulty forming personal relationships he recognized that this was a lifelong problem , but he did n't know what to do about it whenever he tried to form personal relationships , whether they were friendships or romantic relationships , they never lasted beyond a brief period of time this left bob feeling very lonely and lacking in self confidence he had a couple of buddies that he went with to sports events , but he did n't have any close relationships bob often felt that there was something missing in him that caused him to have such difficulties in his relationships , but he did n't know what it was until his boss mentioned the term emotional intelligence , bob was completely unaware of this concept but as he started reading emotional intelligence by daniel goleman , he realized that he lacked these interpersonal skills , and he very much wanted to develop them when bob began psychotherapy , he had very little awareness of his emotional state at any given time he grew up in a household where his parents demonstrated very little in terms of their own emotions , and they did n't talk about emotions at all education was very important to them , and they encouraged him to do well in school when bob 's teachers told his parents that bob had problems forming friendships , they dismissed this as unimportant as long as bob got excellent grades , they were happy and they told him not to be concerned about friendships bob 's therapist began by helping bob to recognize his own emotions when he started therapy , bob had only the vaguest notion of his emotions generally , he recognized when he felt good or when he felt bad , but he could n't distinguish whether good meant that he felt content or elated or if bad meant that he felt sad or angry bob 's therapist helped bob to distinguish his emotions based on what bob was feeling in his body for instance , he learned to recognize that when his stomach was clinched , he often felt fearful he also learned to identify other emotions based on what he was feeling physically gradually , he began to distinguish fear from anger or sadness he also recognized that sometimes he felt more than one emotion at a time , which was confusing to him at first bob 's therapist also worked with him to begin to pick up on social cues in his work environment prior to this , bob did n't pay attention at all to the emotional environment at work he was emotionally disconnected from it and from how his colleagues were feeling at any given time over time , working with his therapist , bob began to learn how to read body language with individuals and at staff meetings this helped him to negotiate his relationships at work it also alerted him with regard to the appropriateness of timing and others' receptivity with regard to introducing new ideas in addition , he learned to take an interest in his coworkers prior to starting therapy , it never would have occurred to bob to ask a coworker about his or her weekend or a vacation after he began working with his therapist on developing emotional intelligence , bob began taking his first tentative steps by engaging in conversation with coworkers to his amazement , his coworkers began to take more of an interest in him as well he discovered that several of his coworkers would go out for lunch on fridays , and they started inviting him to come along , which pleased bob he recognized that his coworkers were beginning to like him while this was gratifying to bob , he also began to feel the sadness of so many years of not having this in his life , and he realized that this was an important missing piece for him socializing in his personal life was more of a challenge even though bob was very lonely , he felt very awkward in social situations , and he tended to avoid them he would often turn down invitations from his sports buddies to attend parties where he could have , potentially , made other friends or met a woman that he could date although he was very anxious about getting out more , bob was determined to overcome his fear so , when an opportunity presented itself for him to attend a party , he accepted the invitation he and his therapist had several sessions to talk about his anxiety and to work on how he could improve his interpersonal skills in these types of social situations even though he was starting to feel more comfortable socially with his colleagues , he was anxious about socializing on a personal level he felt that , at least in his work environment , he could talk to his colleagues about work but with new people where he did not have this in common , he felt very unsure of himself bob and his therapist worked on various role plays where he practiced how to start a conversation in a social setting they talked about all different types of scenarios and what social cues bob should notice among those around him with regard to people 's relative openness to engaging socially they decided that it would be easier for bob to start by asking the hostess to introduce him to some of the people at the party they also decided that , to start , bob did n't have to stay for the entire party if he was too uncomfortable , so they talked about how he could negotiate this socially with the hostess fortunately for bob , the hostess at this party was an emotionally astute woman she recognized that bob was anxious in social settings , and she started by introducing him to other people in his particular field of work although bob was very nervous at first , once he began talking to these people , he felt more comfortable one person confided in bob that he also felt anxious at parties , and bob felt relieved to know that he was n't the only one who experienced social anxiety it took bob a while , working diligently with his therapist , to develop emotional intelligence in his work environment and in social situations but bob felt proud when gregg approached him one day and told him that he was pleased to see that bob had improved his interpersonal skills at work this positive feedback was what bob needed to continue working on this issue in his therapy in addition , bob was starting to date women , and he was surprised and pleased to realize that women found him appealing what can you do to develop emotional intelligence ? how to develop emotional intelligence if you 're experiencing a
