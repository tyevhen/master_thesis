the screenwriting books all say that one of the most common complaints around scripts of all kinds is that the characters sound the same , instead of each character having a distinct , unique voice but how can you establish distinct voices in a script 's characters in the first pages ? that 's how long you 've got , basically it helps , obviously , to have a vivid image , in your mind , of a real life person such as a certain actor who fits the part for each character as you write , imagine what kind of language that person would use the other more or less standard bit of advice you encounter a lot in books and articles on screenwriting go through and edit all of one character 's dialog , whether it 's the first pages or the whole script , without looking at any other character 's dialog then do that for the next character and so on this way , you have some hope of achieving consistency in dialect and clean separation of diction patterns from one character to the next but how can you achieve characterwise speech differentiation quickly , without resorting to patois or other gimmicks ? i 'll tell you a trick i was able to use in the script i just finished the trick is pretty simple have one character mock the other 's diction in my script , greeners , the hero is a year old american grad student think mickey rourke his future partner is a year old hindustani woman from new delhi , a post doctoral fellow in his department by page , she owes him , bigtime , for putting out a car fire a few pages later they meet again , and she realizes she never properly thanked him she tells him so then asks how shall i repay you ? no american talks like that no one says shall i in conversation he says mocking how shall you 'repay me' ? come on , i did n't do anything it 's a subtle reinforcement of the fact that they 're from two different cultures she learned british english as a second language he 's james dean 's lost brother when he suggests she thank him by letting him take her out to dinner , she does n't nod she does a little figure eight head wobble , indian for okay perhaps why not she 's prim , well educated , polite to a fault , and therefore uses proper fully expanded english instead of ca n't she tends to say cannot , for example he can say would n't 've as in , i would n't 've done that she has to say would not have a few pages of this , and it 's pretty clear who 's the homie and who 's here on a visa another tip people 's true speech patterns always surface in a crisis one person might shout bleedin' christ ! whereas the next person might say oh dear lord no , etc so put a crisis on page and differentiate the characters right then and there you were planning to do that anyway , though right ? if you 'd like to see my wga registered screenplay , drop me a line my hushmail dot com address is kasthomas inquiries held in strictest confidence
