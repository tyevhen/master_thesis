it 's hard to believe , but my th high school reunion is coming up this summer years ! talking with a friend the other day , we were chuckling about how , years ago , we thought people our current age were so terribly old and now here i am , years old , years removed from those high school days it 's hard to believe i have yet to decide if i'm going to attend my reunion despite being a good student , an athlete , and having had a steady boyfriend , i never felt like i fit in during high school i would n't say i was popular , but i was n't unpopular either i just felt like i did n't fit this was especially true after the age of , my sophomore year of high school , which is when my first bout with depression began that bout with depression may have something to do with my indecisiveness regarding attending the reunion as well as an adult , it has become apparent when my depression symptoms are bad , i have difficulty forming new memories whether it 's the result of depression or not , the fact is i do n't remember a lot of my high school years i have a general , fuzzy overview of high school , but specific memories are lacking i worry i 'll look like a lost puppy while reminiscing with friends at the reunion i have a fear of feeling left out um not fitting in , years later ! okay , that was difficult to admit of course , this is reinforced on facebook when old classmates make references to past events i ca n't recall i hate that depression plays a roll in another piece of this puzzle when i went off to college , i packed all of my yearbooks , photos , awards , etc in boxes and stored them in my mom and former stepfather 's garage they divorced shortly thereafter , and my mom moved out , but my brothers and i continued to maintain contact with my former stepfather he 's still in our lives today fast forward multiple years i am now in the throes of my adult depression my former stepfather announces he 's selling his home and asks my brothers and i to remove our stuff from his garage he also , apparently , told us he would throw out anything we left behind i never retrieved my boxes i do n't know why i do n't remember i probably could n't pull myself together to make the hour journey and my former stepfather threw out all of my high school yearbooks , photos , awards , etc everything from my childhood and teenage years gone if i had some reference points , like yearbook photos , i'm certain i 'd have some concrete high school memories i'm also certain i 'd feel a lot more connected to my past and be much less worried about attending my reunion i do n't want to look , or feel , like a lost puppy it sucks not being able to remember to make matters worse , it 's not only high school memories which have disappeared depression has stripped many of my adult memories , too , whether due to the side effects of ect treatment or simply because of the illness itself it does n't matter , the memories are gone either way , and i end up feeling lost in space it 's disconcerting disconcerting is often my reality the missing memories are unlikely to return i have so little , internally or externally , connecting me to what 's gone on before , i truly must live each moment for that moment sometimes that 's okay , but with this reunion coming up , i wish i was a bit more tethered
