learning karate in my late teens was not one of the smartest things i have ever done , primarily because it was subtly intertwined with eastern religious principles and philosophies when i finally realized this , i quit karate before i did my black belt grading , as that required that i participate in a buddhist shinto senjo ceremony , and as a christian , i could not do that however , doing karate for two years had good points as well , the main one being that through it i achieved a very high level of physical fitness , and this had very positive effects upon every area of my life during those two years my energy levels peaked , my mind became more flexible and alert , my immune system became stronger than ever before , and if i did get sick , i recovered very quickly i also became more confident now although i knew that karate s regular workouts had brought about these amazing changes in my life , after i quit karate i made one of the biggest mistakes of my life instead of searching for another avenue of physical exercise without an eastern religious component , i stopped exercising altogether as to be expected , over the next four years my health steadily returned to what it had been previously i caught every sickness i encountered , they hit me hard , my mind lost some flexibility , my energy reserves ran out and it was a struggle to make it through each day admittedly , after i graduated from bible college i did far too much , working fulltime as well as being an assistant pastor , yet that was compounded by my lack of health due to partaking in no regular physical exercise in , while stuck in the depths of depression , i realized my mistake and started getting back into regular exercise initially i went jogging and did lots ! of sit ups , and then in , when i was well on the road to recovery from depression , i joined a gym at first i did weights and circuit circuit was fun , very energetic and a great cardiovascular workout on the other hand , since my mind had nothing to do while pumping iron , doing weights saw me struggling with fearful churning thoughts yet all the same , i noticed that my quality of life was slowly improving on all levels in , i changed from doing weights and circuit to doing aerobics three times a week aerobics proved to be a fantastic workout for the entire body , and even helped with my mental problems i recall going to an aerobics class while in the midst of a panic attack on several occasions , only to be pleasantly surprised when the brisk exercise to music drove the attack away having learnt my lesson , twenty years later i am still doing aerobics , as well as light hand weights at home several days a week being physically fit helps all areas of our lives it can boost our immune system , reduces the effects of illnesses upon us , strengthens our bodies and helps prevent injuries , makes our minds more flexible and alert , boosts our confidence , lifts our emotions , and even improves our spiritual condition i encourage everyone to partake in regular physical exercise a word of caution , though if you are out of shape , take it slowly , one step at a time start by going on three or four gentle minute walks a week after a few weeks of this , change this to brisk walks consider joining a pilates class and improve your flexibility in addition , depending upon your age and level of fitness , consider embracing more energetic forms of exercise such as swimming , aerobics , bike riding , or jogging joining a gym can be very helpful as the classes they run provide motivation for those who find it hard to motivate themselves gymnasiums also have exercise bikes , treadmills , steppers , rowing machines , and weights another word of caution depending upon our age and level of fitness , it is worthwhile getting a check up with a doctor before determining a suitable form of regular physical exercise doing too much exercise or unsuitable exercise could cause injuries if joining a gym , book yourself in for a physical assessment before joining any classes or doing any weights , and the instructor will design a program especially suited for you bearing in mind the comments i made about karate and its eastern religious content , please avoid yoga as its roots and purposes are inseparably bound with eastern religious philosophies as well another important aspect of maintaining our physical health is a good diet , eating plenty of vegetables and fruit and drinking about eight cups of water a day if our health deteriorates upon such a diet , see a doctor immediately some people are fructose or gluten intolerant , and a healthy diet can cause depression in such a case gary r collins , ph d shares the following advice for preventing depression , encourage physical fitness since poor diet and lack of exercise can make people depression prone , people should always be encouraged by word and example to take care of their bodies a healthy body is less susceptible to mental as well as to physical illness christian counselling , word publishing , do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit , who is in you , whom you have received from god ? you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor god with your body corinthians download an ebook on depression , ie , this blog 's articles all verses from the niv
