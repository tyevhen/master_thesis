posted by dinah maybe this should be titled the angry psychiatrist the patient has had a rough time of it , he 's a widower who tragically lost his wife , his only child is a disappointment to him , his boss is demanding and unpleasable i would listen sympathetically , but the patient wo n't talk he stares at the ceiling and says he does n't know what he should talk about i make suggestions they are all wrong he 's already talked about those things , and why do n't i remember ? or he does n't want to talk about them , it wo n't help i ask about something i hope will be benign weekend activities , how things are with a family member , even a tv show i know he likes , but anything that is n't charged , he 's deemed a waste of therapy time what 's important to talk about ? i ask , trying every angle i can think of you 're the doctor , he replies but it 's not a matter of fact , or even a slightly annoyed , reply it 's a hostile , you 're failing me , dig and he knows right where to aim when he does talk , it is to rail at me i'm not helping him , the medications are n't helping him , the side effects suck he logs my failures the time i did n't call his meds in fast enough , the time he was certain he 'd left a message i did n't return it does n't matter that i tried and could n't get through if i make any reference to the future , one he insists wo n't come , he uses it as an opportunity to angrily tell me how i have n't been where he 's been he stares at my wedding ring and asks how i 'd feel if my husband died , if my kid had the problem his kid has ? he makes many assumptions that i 've never suffered , and certainly , he announces , not the way he has the angry patient never misses an appointment , in fact , he arrives early , and he sometimes calls between sessions he comes , he says , because he is hanging on to his last remnant of hope he 's never had a kind word for me , never even an ounce of tenderness to his tone i 've tried to suggest he see someone else pleeeease , for at least a consult empathy , i 've said , is a necessary part of the psychotherapeutic process , and he feels i have none perhaps he might find it with someone else ? even i'm giving up on him , he 's quick to point out , and i'm not surprised i knew he 'd see my referral as a rejection he 's not telling his story again , not starting over , and i'm as good as the rest of the quacks he 's test driven quite a few gee , thanks , i think the angry patient stares at the ceiling and i glance at the clock i keep my tone gentle and even i listen and i try not to say the wrong thing i remind myself that he 's still grieving , and i try to garner some sympathy for his disabling narcissism , his cluster b ness which he wears like a coat of armor if the angry patient were just angry , that would be fine why does he have to be angry at me ? do n't answer that for the moment , i'm just striving for survival
