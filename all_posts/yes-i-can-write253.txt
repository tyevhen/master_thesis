it 's now official i , along with my mum and sis , am going to the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering in sandusky ohio at the beginning of february ! i'm doing the whole mixed feelings thing right now , because last year , i had an okay time , but not a great one the kalahari resort itself felt pretty icky to me honestly , with it 's tacky decorations , and staff that seemed almost subservient it felt like i was in the heartland of consumerist privileged america it just made me feel icky that said , i did meet some awesome people , go to some great talks , and i finally started to really enjoy myself just as we were getting ready to leave p i want to make it clear that my reluctance to go has nothing to do with the actual organization of the conference itself ! just a few issues with the venue if you want to find out more about my experiences there last year , you can read my write up , complete with lots of pictures , here as to why we 're going this year , even though there are some other conferences i might prefer to go to , is that emi is planning on meeting a friend she 's known online for about years now this friend is near enough that they can actually manage to get together if we go to the waterpark , which pretty much clinched the decision so now i'm switching gears , into one of focusing on the positive , thinking of all the cool people i'm going to meet there are only a few people whom i 've already met who are going to be there , as far as i know ! , on the fact that i'm going to get to go to a talk by john taylor gatto , and on how much fun the slides and wavepool in the waterpark are if you 're going to be there , i 'd love to meet you ! ! so if you recognize me , please do say hi , and if not , well , i just hope we run into each other at a talk or something ! peace , idzie p s i really appreciated each and every comment on my last post , the cons of unschooling , and read them all happily and with interest , but right now , the thought of responding to all comments feels a wee bit overwhelming which is why i have n't yet but i 'll try to in the next few days , and i want to thank everyone for making it such an interesting conversation ! you might also like unschooling gatherings the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering an epic adventure unschoolers winter waterpark gathering linkwithin
