note this story , which i wrote back in april , originally appeared in a slightly shorter form at bigthink com i'm reproducing it here because i strongly feel the story needs to get out to as many people as possible the story of the dark side of antioxidant research is n't well known outside of medical circles it 's an unseemly story , profoundly unsettling a story that refuses to be made pretty or happy or uplifting no matter how hard you try to duct tape a silver lining around it it does n't fit the antioxidants are good for you mantra that sells billions of dollars per year of blueberry and pomegranate fortified granola bars and tocopherol enrichened cereals , acai berry jell o mixes , juices and yogurts with added vitamins , organic baby foods , and so forth , not to mention the billions of dollars of nutritional supplements sold each year to say nothing of the sub industry of books and magazines devoted to nutrition still , it 's a story that needs to be told and some of us know where the bodies are buried for decades , mainstream medicine pooh poohed the possibility that vitamins or supplements could move the needle on major diseases two time nobel laureate linus pauling was harshly criticized in the s and s for suggesting a role for vitamin c in prevention and treatment of cancer even so , laboratory workers had known for years that changes to diet could influence the rate of tumor appearance in lab animals by the early s , case control studies and epidemiological evidence from a variety of sources had begun to accumulate , showing that persons who routinely ate large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables consistently did better with regard to cardiovascular disease and other diseases than most people in , sir richard peto and colleagues published a paper in nature that dared asked the simple question can dietary beta carotene materially reduce human cancer rates ? nature , shortly thereafter , the national cancer institute whose chemoprevention branch was headed by dr michael b sporn , one of the coauthors of the nature article decided to green light two large intervention based studies of the cancer preventing effects of nutritional supplements a study in finland involving beta carotene and alpha tocopherol vitamin e , and a u s based study involving retinol a form of vitamin a and beta carotene the finnish study conducted by finland 's national institute for health and welfare was initially designed to encompass , male smokers between the ages of and why just smokers ? and why male , and years old ? lung cancer is ten times more likely to affect smokers hence a cancer study limited to smokers would need only a tenth as many participants as a study involving the general population based on what was known about the age specific rates of lung cancer among finnish men , study designers calculated that the desired effect size a hoped for decrease in cancer incidence over a period of years would be measurable with the required level of statistical relevance if , older male smokers made up the study group as it turned out , the age distribution of actual volunteers did n't match the demographics of the eligibility group volunteers tended to be toward the young end of the eligibility range , and as a result the study 's enrollment target had to be reset to , in order to get good statistical relevance full scale recruitment of subjects into the atbc alpha tocopherol beta carotene lung cancer prevention study began in april and continued until a final enrollment of , men occurred in june enrollees were randomized into one of four equal sized groups , receiving either mg day about times the rda of alpha tocopherol , or mg day of beta carotene equivalent to around times the rda of vitamin a , or at and bt together , or placebo only at the same time , which is to say starting in after some very small , very brief pilot studies to validate recruitment mechanics , the carotene and retinol efficacy trial caret started enrolling volunteers in the u s unlike finland 's atbc study , volunteers for caret were both male and female and were heavy smokers or came from asbestos exposed workplace environments they ranged in age from to and were divided initially into four groups mg day beta carotene only , , iu retinol only , carotene plus retinol , or placebo , but in the treatment groups were consolidated into one group taking both beta carotene and retinol the study design called for continuing the vitamin regimen through , with reporting of results to occur in alas , things went horribly awry , and caret never got that far when the finns reported results from the atbc study in april , it sent shock waves through the medical world not only had alpha tocopherol and beta carotene not provided the expected protective effect against lung cancer the supplement treated groups actually experienced more cancer than the placebo group more , in fact this was an astonishing result , utterly bewildering , as it contradicted numerous prior animal studies that had shown vitamin e and beta carotene to be promising cancer preventatives surely an error had occurred something had to have gone wrong one thing it could n't be was chance variation with almost , participants three quarters of them in treatment groups , this was not a small study the results could n't be a statistical fluke as it turns out , the finnish investigators had actually done a meticulous job from start to finish in analyzing their data , they had looked for possible confounding factors the only confounder they found was that heavy drinkers in the treatment group got cancer more often than light drinkers two weeks before the finnish study hit , the national cancer institute was awash in conference calls accounts vary as to who knew what , when , but caret 's lead investigator , who had seen the finnish group 's data prior to publication , knew that nci now had a serious problem on its hands caret was doing essentially the same experiment the finns had done , except it was giving even bigger doses of supplements to its u s participants , and the study was due to run for another three and a half years what if caret 's treatment group was also experiencing elevated cancer rates ? participants might be dying needlessly and indeed they were when statisticians presented interim results to caret 's safety endpoint monitoring committee in august , four months after the finnish study appeared in print , it became clear that caret participants were , if anything , faring considerably worse than their counterparts in the atbc study even so , the safety committee found itself deadlocked on whether to call a premature halt to caret the study 's formal stopping criteria as given by something called the o brien fleming early stopping boundary had not been met ultimately a decision was made to continue to accumulate more data there were those on the safety committee who simply did n't believe the results the data were aberrant they had to be when additional numbers could be gathered they would surely show the early numbers to have been wrong a second interim statistical analysis was presented to caret 's safety committee in september , one year after the first analysis according to the committee at that time it was clear that the excess of lung cancer had continued to accumulate in the intervention regimen at about the same rate during the time since the first interim analysis further , the cardiovascular disease excess persisted the conditional power calculations showed that it was extremely unlikely that the trial could show a beneficial effect of the intervention , even if the adverse effect ceased to occur and a delayed protective effect began to appear therefore the semc voted unanimously to recommend to nci that the trial regimen should be stopped but the follow up should continue the study was halted but not until january , nearly two years after final publication of the finnish results even then , caret participants were contacted by snail mail to let them know of the study 's early termination and the reasons for it caret 's results were published in the new england journal of medicine in may once again , shock waves reverberated throughout the medical world participants who had taken beta carotene and vitamin a supplements had shown a higher rate of lung cancer they also fared worse for cardiovascular related mortality , and worse for all cause mortality there was great reluctance in the medical community to believe the results perhaps the even worse results of the caret study relative to the finnish experiment had to do with the decision to include , asbestos exposed individuals in the treatment group of , persons ? not so , it turns out intensive segment analysis of the asbestos group 's data relative to the heavy smoker group showed that there was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity of the relative risk among these subgroups what the caret study had , in fact , done was not just replicate the atbc results but provide the beginnings of a dose response curve the finns had used mg day of beta carotene caret employed a higher dose the result had been more cancer it was hard to understand the results of the atbc and caret studies in light of the fact that another large trial involving beta carotene , the physicians' health study , had reported neither harm nor benefit from mg of beta carotene taken every other day for years however , the physicians' health study population was younger and healthier than atbc or caret study groups and was predominantly made up of non smokers this turned out to be quite important read on it 's been almost years since the atbc and caret results were reported and to this day , most clinicians are not aware of the results of either study , at least in the u s what have we learned in that time ? in , bjelakovic et al undertook a systematic review of existing literature on antioxidant studies covering the time frame to the systematic review procedure was conducted using the well regarded methodology of the cochrane collaboration , a group that specializes in and is known for high quality meta analyses in analyzing the most rigorously designed studies of supplement effectiveness , bjelakovic et al found that , study subjects out of a total treatment population of , persons died while taking antioxidants , whereas , placebo takers , in control groups totalling , persons , died in those same studies this is not including atbc or caret results the studies in question used beta carotene , vitamin e , vitamin a , vitamin c , and or selenium in a separate meta analysis , miller et al found a dose dependent relationship of vitamin e with all cause mortality for , participants in clinical trials at daily doses below about international units , vitamin e appears to be helpful above that , harmful miller et al concluded in view of the increased mortality associated with high dosages of beta carotene and now vitamin e , use of any high dosage vitamin supplements should be discouraged until evidence of ef cacy is documented from appropriately designed clinical trials how are we to make sense of these results ? why have so many studies shown a harmful effect for antioxidants when so many other studies particularly those carried out in animals , but also those carried out in predominantly healthy human populations have shown a clear benefit ? the answer may have to do with something called apoptosis , otherwise known as programmed cell death the body has ways of determining when cells have become dysfunctional to the point of needing to be told to shut down when cells reach this point , their mitochondria kick off a cascade of reactions involving caspases and other enzymes designed to terminate the cells most cancer therapies exert their effect by inducing apoptosis , and it 's fairly well accepted that in normal , healthy individuals , precancerous cells are constantly being formed , then destroyed through apoptosis in a normal healthy adult , as many as billion cells a day , most of them non cancerous , are destroyed this way antioxidants are known to interfere with apoptosis in essence , they promote the survival of normal cells as well as cells that should n't be allowed to live if you 're a young non smoker in good health , the level of cell turnover from apoptosis in your body is nowhere near as high as the level of turnover in an older person , or someone at high risk of cancer therefore , antioxidants are apt to do more good than harm in a young , healthy person but if your body is harboring cancer cells , you do n't want anitoxidants to encourage the growth of neoplastic cells by interfering with their apoptosis this is the real lesson of antioxidant research the food industry and the people who make nutritional supplements have no interest in telling you any of the things you 've read here but now that you know the story of the dark side of antioxidants a story made possible by thousands of ordinary people who died in the name of science , you owe it to yourself to take the story to heart if you 're a smoker or at high risk for heart disease or cancer , consider scaling back your use of lipid soluble antioxidant supplements particularly vitamins a and e it could save your life there is no need to scale back vitamin d , however , which has potent anti cancer effects and please , if you found any of this information helpful , share it with family , friends , facebook and twitter followers , and others the story needs to get out the cancer industry is n't going to tell it to you they have n't so far there 's too much money to be made selling you , a year chemotherapies no one 's going to look out for your health but you you might also like aspirin for cancer prevention at bigthink com an enormous body of evidence points to vast reductions in cancer rates , for a wide variety of cancers , for those who take nsaids like iburofen and aspirin daily when vitamins turn deadly more on the caret disaster and why it took so long to terminate the study when investigators knew full well that people were dying unnecessarily who needs antioxidants ? why the free radical theory of aging is just plain wrong
