what it means if you do n't continue to practice or use the ability , you might lose the ability for example , if a person does n't exercise his or her physical body , he or she will likely lose strength , endurance , and stamina for those of us living with kennedy s disease , even if we use it , we will lose it however , it might take a little longer to lose it this is as much about muscle memory as it is motor neuron stimulation the key for me is that as long as i perform the right exercises , my muscle groups will continue to function better and longer it has been four years that i have been exercising every day in the four years , i have only missed one day if i didn t see the benefit , i wouldn t do it or , saying it another way , as long as i see the benefit , i will do it muscle memory helps perform the same functions repetitively for example , i perform steps in place every morning this particular function improves the muscles in the quads , calves , ankles and feet it also is a good cardio exercise when i combine it with side to side steps , leg lifts , and calf stretches , i have a good standing program that has my heart pumping what do you do to keep the muscles and motor neurons stimulated ? have you noticed any benefit ?
