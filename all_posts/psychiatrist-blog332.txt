i asked jesse to blog about non compliance , and at first , he was non compliant , but now he 's just being resistant or oppositional ? oh , truthfully , i do n't like the term 'non compliance' either it 's a term i rarely , if ever , use because i would never think of someone who stops a medication because it was too expensive , or because they were having side effects , or because they felt better at a lower dose , or decided that a different medicine worked better , as being non compliant it is a pejorative term , and people need to be their own medical advocates , and the decision to take or not take a medication is a personal one where many factors come into play why i don t want to blog on non compliance i try to be compliant with most of dinah s requests , but this one threw me and it took me a while to realize why the term is being , in my view , misused here when it come to psychiatry compliance is a term that is best used in the legal governmental sense it implies bending someone to one s will the office of medicare compliance for example they make the rules , or at least administer them , and those affected had better comply the word compliance is frequently used in medicine if a doctor said , for instance , i told the patient to take his penicillin twice a day for two weeks , but he stopped it after two days , we would understand that he had not complied with the instructions but we would not know why patient non compliance could be due to an unpleasant side effect , difficulty in following the instructions , expense of the medication , and so on it does not imply disobedience or ill will , but only that the advice was not followed yet in psychiatry , and particularly in the type of psychiatry that i practice , that of psychodynamically oriented therapy with completely voluntary adult patients , the term itself seems particularly wrong certainly i have opinions and express them , prescribe medications , suggest intervals between appointments , and occasionally even give direct advice , but i have never thought of compliance in all the time i have been practicing and never think of patients as being non compliant a patient might come in for his session and , for reasons i might not understand that hour , sit the entire time without saying a word that is his choice , and my job is to be sensitive to what is going on and try to help him , not superimpose my own values and expectations do patients come late , or not at all ? of course not take medication or stop it without having called me ? certainly wait ! let s pause at that last one if a patient does not call me in regard to a medication issue , and stops it , is he non compliant ? it is much more fruitful to try to understand , with him , what led him to do as he did i didn t want to bother you over the weekend he says i could simply say that it would not have been a bother , or i might try to understand what he felt i thought you might be annoyed with me if i called i felt it was my fault i ran out of the medication or even perhaps your wife would have answered the phone and i would have felt like i was intruding into your private life one does not need psychoanalytic training to sense that there is a lot to be gained that could be helpful to a patient by being non judgmental and thus being able to help him explore his thoughts and feelings , to see how they may be playing into his troubles so i find it much more useful in trying to understand and help my patients to be as non judgmental as possible and non compliance is a judgmental term , better left to that office of medicare compliance
