i do n't like being uncomfortable , and anxiety makes me feel very uncomfortable i especially worry about making mistakes ironically , my fears center around trivialities , such as misspelling a word in an e mail , bumbling a calculation when balancing my checkbook , misplacing a bill , and so on all of these little worries add up to one chronically stressed , uptight individual however , dr low reminds us that mistakes made in trivial matters are themselves trivial in my encounters with other nervous people , i 've noticed how we often sweat the small stuff but can handle life 's larger challenges for example , we 're more likely to panic over misspelling our name on a college application rather than making the big decision to attend a college i 've also noted that in true emergencies many , if not most , of us react just fine , with a cool head and calm demeanor so as we work our way through our own recovery journeys , perhaps we should keep our focus on the little things , those everyday events that we can change our attitude toward while our overall big goal is a long term reduction in our symptoms , in the meantime we can make progress by focusing on prioritizing our mental health during all of the little challenges of life and endorsing ourselves for every little victory
