a couple days ago , i shared some old song lyrics poetry i wrote a year and a half ago i found some more lyrics from a couple months ago that i thought might be worth sharing they were written after i had been doing some reminiscing and reading old diaries and capture some of the process of grieving and moving on in one 's recovery memory lane such beauty such bittersweet pain count my crosses mourn my losses shed a few tears over lost and lonely years ashes and ashes dust and dust let my tears fall turn these gold pages to rust as long as someone remembers where i 've been that long september spent praying they 'd let me in just walking down memory lane just turning pages that bring back the pain thinking of how he never kissed me wondering does he ever miss me or am i just a memory now some odd lovestruck girl for him to laugh about memory lane so much pain i 'd shut out till i came to doubt it ever happened now the scenes flow like rapids i was so down and out but look at me now i'm more than memories i put away these old pictures till next time i peruse it 's good to look back but i could really use some new memories r g the ending 's kind of corny but i thought it did capture a bit of the experience of recalling your past while you 're on the way to recovery i 've found that there is a lot of pain that i sequestered to some dark part of my memory and sometimes it seems right to take those old memories back out and remind yourself that you really did struggle , it was n't just an event you made up or blew up in your head my old self deserves to be recognized for what she endured so bravely read other poetry i 've written about tough times listen to my music
