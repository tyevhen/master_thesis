i had a thoughtful mile hilly run today the first six weeks of my marathon training program call for the hilliest run you can find every tuesday those of you following along know i hate hills , but i'm dutifully following my program today was week three somewhere between an up and a down this morning , i had a thought running a hilly route is like traveling along the road of depression the only difference between depression and running hills are the ups and downs are reversed that is , running uphill is akin to sinking into depression 's morass , whereas running downhill is like climbing out of the depression hole see what you think as i run uphill , or sink into depression , every step feels more difficult than the last soon my muscles ache , and fatigue settles in the negative thinking begins , and i contemplate quitting it would be easier to quit than to continue struggling along as the hill continues , i have less and less fun i worry about surviving to the top , and i ca n't wait for the hill to end on the contrary , arising from depression 's hole , or running downhill , is often lots of fun every step feels so easy , sometimes i think i'm moving too fast i catch my breath and let my mind flow free quitting never presents as an option as i continue toward the hill 's bottom , i know my ease cannot last sometimes i worry about the next hill coming up , but i always hope the freedom never ends up and down today 's hills , my physical exertion reminded me of the mental gymnastics associated with depression depression , like running hills , is a total body experience of struggle followed by freedom , pessimism succeeded by clarity , and fatigue relieved by energy uncanny , is n't it ?
