i met a very nice young man today he wore a suit and a tie and a white coat and his hair was neatly trimmed he took the time to explain to me what a white blood cell count was and how it could show how severe an infection is he explained what the x ray showed and why it was important to repeat the x ray after treatment to make sure the problem was n't something more serious he did a very nice job with his patient when he came back with my prescription for antibiotics he said , so , i just noticed that you 're a doctor ? a forensic psychiatrist , i said , meaning yes i do n't use my initials when i'm off duty he may have been a bit embarrassed talking like he did to a physician , but i loved it he did a wonderful job given the choice between being a doctor and being a patient i would always prefer to be the doctor , but in situations where i'm the patient i want to be the patient a social worker friend suggested that doctors who become patients get better care than regular patients , but this guy did n't know until the end of the appointment that i was a physician i ca n't say whether i as a physician would treat a physician patient differently because so far i have n't had any doctor prisoners maybe that 's something dinah or roy could comment on regardless , i'm getting the pneumonia treated after the past three days lying flat on my back i will have another two days confined to the house avoiding contagion it would be poor form to be the one to trigger an epidemic in a correctional facility i will be relying on our readers and my fellow bloggers to keep me from going bonkers with boredom so far i 've only left the house for healthcare and groceries , and i'm going mad , mad , i tell you !
