it 's am , and i'm awake actually , i 've been awake since am it was is one of those nights after awakening multiple times , and finally staying awake after , i decided to get up and go for my run yup , i went running at am crazy , huh ? actually , it was worse than crazy it turned out to be dumb my right calf and shin hurt every step of the way i'm a pt i know if a painful area does not improve within the first few minutes of running , it means i should stop running i did n't i only made it miles , but it was a long , painful , dumb miles i'm really pissed that i'm injured after all this training ! of course , running through it like i did this morning was not helpful i likely made things worse if i had stopped running , like i planned a few days ago , and started swimming instead of running , like i planned a few days ago , i might already be on the mend i just have to hope it 's not too late i also have to battle like hell not to go back out on the road prior to my race i have to trust i'm ready and in shape i have to have the serenity to accept the things i cannot change at this point in time , i should be able to maintain my fitness with swimming if i can stay off the road , my leg just may heal enough that every step of my marathon will not be painful god , i hope so !
