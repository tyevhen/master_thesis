i 've got a few questions for you i half jokingly suggested in a previous post that perhaps my year ordeal with depression had ended i do n't really believe that , but it got me thinking what would the end of depression look like ? what would it mean to be healed ? and how would i know it was over ? i 've been feeling well for a few months now i saw my psychiatrist today , and we had little to discuss that 's always nice life is moving forward work is fulfilling i have energy to spare running is fun and satisfying i have meaningful and enjoyable relationships with others i'm connected to my community and to the world does a few months of things going so well mean it 's over ? i have no idea if it 's over , of course , and truthfully , i spend little to no time thinking about it i live each day as it presents itself worrying about the past or fretting about the future are endeavors on which i cannot afford to waste valuable energy i figure it would take a few years of feeling well before i 'd be comfortable claiming i'm cured but it is an intriguing question , is n't it ? what would it take for you to feel free of your illness ? how would you know it was over ? what would it mean to be healed ? i 'd be interested to hear your thoughts
