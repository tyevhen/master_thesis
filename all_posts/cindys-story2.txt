there was a time that i decided i was going to kill myself in my mind there were some things that i wanted as i decided to commit suicide there were some things that i knowingly wanted , but as i am thinking about it years later , i realize that there were some things that i did n't know that i wanted as well first , here is what i knew i wanted i knowingly wanted the world and it 's problems to go away i saw disasters and devastation i saw anger and hate , murders and abuses of all kinds evil seemed to be pressing in all around me i knowingly wanted my pain to end i knew i was a failure at life , a disappointment , and no good to the world the losses which seemed to pull out part of my heart were too great the emotional pain hurt so bad i could hardly breath i knowingly wanted out of the darkness it felt like a dark cloud was pressing down over my head i had fallen into a deep pit of depression and despair i could not see any way out except to die in my mind at the time , that is all i thought that i wanted i wanted to die looking back on that time many years later i see there were some things that i unknowingly wanted as well there were things that i did and did n't do during that time of trying to kill myself that showed i had more things that i wanted here are some examples of things that i did n't know that i wanted during my suicide attempt i unknowingly wanted love when i first cut my wrist and let it bleed , after a long while i stopped it and called a friend who might care when i was invited to spend the night so that i would be safe , i went because i wanted to be cared for when my friend found me on the bathroom floor after i had cut again , i wept as arms were wrapped around me out of love when i was left alone in the hospital with a stuffed cat from my friend , i held on to it tightly because i needed to remember that someone knew my pain and still loved me i unknowingly wanted to show care to others i did n't want to share my thoughts of suicide with my family because i did n't want them to hurt and not know what to do i wrote a note of love and explanation to my family so they would not think it was their fault i decided i did n't want my friend to be traumatized to have to find me dead on the bathroom floor in the morning so i stopped my death when i had a chance to finish what i had started i allowed my family to know that i was in the hospital and to know what i had done even though i was afraid because i knew they would desire to love and help i unknowingly wanted help to live i actually went to my friend 's house when asked because i knew i could not protect myself i did n't leave and sneak away to die when my friend was sleeping or at other times when i had the chance because i felt a bit of safety i went to the doctor with my friend the next day which showed that i must have thought the doctor might be able to do something for me i went to the hospital even though i was desperately afraid it is hard to know all your desires when tunnel vision on death sets in i thought i just wanted the world and it 's problems to go away , for my pain to end , and to be out of the darkness in other words , i thought i just wanted life to end i am now finding that underneath that overwhelming thought was a desire to be shown love by someone who knew all my pain , to show love to others myself , and to get help for what i thought could not get better maybe you are in the situation that i was in , or maybe you are someone who is looking from the outside at a person who wants to die by suicide before you give up , try thinking , even though it may seem impossible , what unknown desires are behind this desire of death can you see it ? a desire to be loved a desire to show love a desire to get help for life maybe there is a little hope still
