in less than two weeks on march th , to be exact , i 'll be turning almost two decades on this earth and i feel like it 's this great , looming presence on the metaphorical horizon waiting , the days counting down , their passage constantly reminding me of how old i'm soon going to be i have n't really enjoyed my birthday in years since i was or so , birthdays reminded me of all the things i had n't done in that year all the things i thought would be good to do at x age , that never happened a time to feel sad about all the things in my life that were n't the way i wanted them to be is n't that a horrible way of looking at things ? but last year was different last year , i was simply dreading turning becoming an official adult , with all of the encumbent expectations of just what being an adult entails i think turning is almost worse at , i could get away with being a brand new adult ! now , i 've had a whole year to get used to it it 's like solidifying the adult ness and i 've really , really been struggling with that at this point in life , even most unschoolers expect me to be working , or in college , or in an apprenticeship they expect me to be doing something something more than what i am because i'm not working i'm not in school i have n't found someone to apprentice to i'm still just writing , researching , planning travels to a couple places , on very limited funds and when i look around me , it seems everyone my age is doing more i feel ashamed embarassed like i'm the slow kid in a nonexistant class , the one that people are looking at with a mix of dissaproval and confusion she 's smart enough , why is n't she doing something with it ? because the thing is , i do n't want to be an adult , whatever the fuck that means i finally realized that in one of my recent breakdowns i very rarely meltdown , normally , but in the last couple of months , i 've been making a habit of it that all i want to do is to be or again despite the fact i had no clue who i was at those ages , and was n't necessarily all that happy , and be able to just be without all of the pressure the expectation that i should be moving on to more and that realization makes me feel even more embarrassed i feel like feeling that way makes me immature i look at others my age , with their jobs and college classes and apprenticeships and world traveling , and wonder what they think of me my mother says i 've always been very wary of and unhappy with change i know that to be true i 've always wanted to watch from the sidelines for a while , before i decide whether or not i want to join in but have n't i been watching from the sidelong too long now ? do n't i have to find something to join into now ? i'm turning ! ! and i do want to make some changes in my life i'm not as happy as i could be with where i am now but the changes i want to make are n't necessarily the changes others think i should be making and i'm no longer sure what the right choices are which ones i want and which ones others want me to want i just feel lost and stressed and ashamed my mother and sister are supportive , and without them , i would truly be lost my father is loving , yet with a much more traditional outlook , and he 's worried he thinks unschooling has failed , because i'm not doing any of the things i should be doing by my age he does n't say it , he quite possibly does n't even think it , but what i hear is that i 've failed that 's not a nice feeling so that 's where i am right now what i 've been struggling with for too long now my apologies for the disjointedness , the rambling it 's late i'm overtired and life feels really difficult right now peace , idzie you might also like against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference the year growing up unschooled with siblings life happening linkwithin
