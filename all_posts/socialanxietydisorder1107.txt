we are trying to make the reader feel guilty i am , go easy ! ? ok here is the hypothetical situation our principle is worried about the students and their risk of obesity in our school , so he is thinking about requiring students to do physical fitness tests every year i know we have to do presidential tests already , but as i said this is hypothetical ! however , he is unsure of weather he should do it or not we are supposed to persuade him to do it or not to do it i took the side of making him do it in the opening paragraph , we are supposed to make him feel emotion in this case , it is guilty i am so go easy on me warning it is long dear principal insert name here everyday , many parents find out that their children are at risk of becoming obese , and the same could happen to the students of insert school name here what can i do about this issue , you ask ? you need to require each student to participate in a physical fitness test by doing this , you can lower the rate of obesity you can also help teens get their aggression out in a good way and help parents save money did you know that the possibility of obesity in insert school name here is very high , and it is up to you to stop it ? being overweight could affect much more then physical appearance , you know it is up to you to protect these kids from becoming obese it is up to you weather or not students suffer various health conditions would you like students to suffer health conditions later in life ? one major reason we should have these physical fitness tests is because obesity is a huge issue it can cause many problems such as diabetes and heart disease being overweight can also affect a persons joints , breathing , sleep , mood , energy levels , and various other health concerns so , being obese could impact a persons entire quality of life however , when teens start a daily exercise routine , they will be surprised on how much easier exercise gets throughout life , and how physically fit they become if you require each student in insert school name here to do an exercise routine , you could lower the rate of obesity in insert state here think about how many students get taught here in insert school name here every year ! imagine how many people could benefit from your physical fitness tests did you know that teens are more likely to do more exercise at home when they are required to do exercise at school ? think about how much of an impact you would be making on these students another huge reason these physical fitness tests are a good idea is because teens tend to become very moody and angry , exercise is a healthy way to get their aggression out and cool down not only is it a great way to get their aggression out and cool down , but also a great way for them to have fun with their friends and stay out of trouble for example , did you know teens are using drugs nowadays ? would you rather see students exercising and having a good time or using some rotten drugs ? the final reason these physical fitness tests are a good idea is because it is a great way for parents to save money if you think that sounds crazy , think about it how many bills do you think parents pay when their teen decides to stay at home watching television and eating potato chips ? the television bill would go way up and so would the food bill if the students decide to go outside and exercise , parents could easily savor money and spend it on things that could benefit the school for example , with all that extra money , parents might be able to give a donation to the school or buy school supplies for their teen if you care about your students health , you will require each student to take a physical fitness test you will be impacting students lives today , and their future lives as well remember , obesity affects their health very much it can harm joints , breathing , heart , and more would you rather have students playing in the field or have them on the couch eating potato chips and watching some l horrible television show ? the students health for their three years at insert school name here is up to you sincerely , insert name here http kidshealth org teen food fitness p s it is in paragraphs , it just doesn t show ! p p s sorry about the whole insert name here thing i am very protective ! answer this looks really great for a th th grader i don t think that you have anything to worry about very persuasive !
