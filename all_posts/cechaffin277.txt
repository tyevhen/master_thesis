tonight we voyage down to the bay area to have thanksgiving with my sister it 's become a yearly tradition , god bless her , and i like traditions we have too few she pointed out to me that black friday so named for putting businesses in back in the black coincides this year with our father 's suicide , twenty years he was a shrewd consumer mom tumored out on us years ago , exactly how long we 've all been orphans playing at christmas and thanksgiving it 's a bitch being in charge thank god for women , truly if i were my parents i 'd be grateful my children were still talking to each other notice the date he chose he meant it to be before thanksgiving , the poor bastard could n't face the bird , the pteranadon of darkness he wanted there to be something there more than chemicals there is , but in this realm it still involves chemicals as one parallel incarnation he did n't believe psychiatrists were real doctors , perhaps because they locked him up in the air force for a month for a manic episode and gave him a medical discharge the shame of it , for him , was too painful to acknowledge he always said it was for pneumonia my psychiatrist told me today that i had negatively biased information selection , the cognitive behavioral equivalent of a melancholy temperament the words change , the disease does n't of course i am much more likely to remember sad , mad and bad things about dad than rad and glad things about him my melancholy temperament makes me want to weep over my daughters in ballet outfits as young girls , though sometimes it curls my lips upward it 's my memory of me in those pictures that most makes me sad why do i feel lost ? my wife loves me unconditionally my spirit ca n't actually receive it though my body believes it how great it would be to look at the grain and not the chaff in the kingdom of craig there are no sad thoughts , no mad thoughts and no bad thoughts yearbooks make me sad even old photographs of my children can , rachel 's death notwithstanding my back hurts i do n't want to type any more in the kingdom of craig there is no pain my back is the chief reason i receive disability manic depression is just frosting did you really need to know that ? ah , but you love me because in the kingdom of craig , what ? there are no sad thoughts and no mad thoughts and no bad thoughts love and thanks to all , craggeerik
