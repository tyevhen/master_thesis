the travel company i represent is doing some amazing , exciting things , and it 's great ! it 's been tough for me to build a business it has required patience and energy , and i often have a short supply of both ! but really , that is not what has held me back i have been stymied by everyone 's favorite villian fear ! god , i hate that word ! fear fear gets in my way when i want to talk to someone about what we have to offer it gets in my way because i do n't like to hear no fear squelches my excitement in a heartbeat fear clouds my judgement , makes poor decisions , and puts me to bed fear sucks ! i have always had fear we all have fear we succeed by learning to confront it , challenge it , and walk through it i know i have walked through a lot of fear over these past seven years with repetition , many of my fears have given in and stepped aside as i 've continually walked by but there are two particular bullies on the block that wo n't give up they sense they retain the upper hand they step in my way , trip me up , and push me down , and they will continue their bullying as long as they can for as long as i allow them , my fears of rejection and failure will continue to be my neighborhood tormentors it is not enough for me to identify them it is not enough to gather intelligence about them it is only when i take action ! it is only when i take action confront them , challenge them , and walk through them that i will be truly free ! and when i am truly free , i will be truly successful not the other way around i have a great opportunity with this business to be very successful , but i hope i do n't waste the opportunity to be free
