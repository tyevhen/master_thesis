i 've been thinking a lot about where my life is going recently this is n't simply a new year , new me type of concern , its something i consider on a daily basis a major part of my illness is feeling as if the world and life is passing me by , i can see it happening and yet i feel unable to intervene i also hold a lot of guilt as i see everyone else in the house getting on with their lives , be that studying , heading off to work or helping out in the community they all experience stress too , its a normal factor of life however when you live feeling stressed everyday the body is put under an enormous amount of strain , and it can become impossible to carry out even the most basic of tasks when i was younger i was given a postcard advertising an art college in cambridge , up until then i 'd just been doing a lot of drawings in felt tip pens sprawled across my bedroom floor at that age i was n't aware that i could study art i soon became fixated upon the idea of going to an art college for years i struggled to produce artwork that was deemed worthy by my art teacher , i had to win her over to get into the gcse class , harsh on their end as i was still developing my skills and experimenting in ways they did n't approve of as it did n't match their preferred style i worked hard to get my way through coursework and exam pieces up until a level standard art by that point i 'd exhausted myself working to meet other people 's expectations and requirements , my personal style never had the chance to develop and my creativity and imagination was suppressed i 'd already applied to a foundation course for art and design as i 'd been steered in that direction for so long , i honestly believe i was n't encouraged enough in academia from a young age , by the time i realised i had potential in other subjects it was too late i 'd fully committed to the only identity i 'd ever known so when that started to break down i felt incredibly lost and terrified as i had no idea what else i could do with my life as a desperate attempt to start on a new path i applied to university to study sociology , a subject i seemed to take to naturally in sixth form unfortunately my illness got in the way of many opportunities available at uni , i watched as my friends managed balance their work and attended other sports sessions ans societies if i 'd been unable to do well with my studies there i thought i could have grasped some of the other opportunities , by getting involved with societies and volunteer work unfortunately , once again , i 've had to restart on another path i do n't regret any of the decisions i 've made , they 've lead me towards meeting some great people and i finally sought help for my depression and anxiety as i 've been particularly depressed recently i 've only been able to take baby steps , recently my sleeping pattern has been turned upside down and i 've barely been awake long enough to achieve any of said baby steps i 'd love to be able to do as much baking as i had been doing , i have an exercise schedule ready for me to start but i do n't have enough energy , i 'd love to be able to get some good photos for blogs posts , or just go for a walk or a drive without being consumed by anxiety to avoid going under completely i 've been trying to think one good thing i 've done each day , or one good quality i have its a lot tougher than it sounds ! trying to compliment myself is like dragging a horse behind a carriage even though i do n't know where i 'll end up in life or when it 'll finally get better for me , i can still make a list of the things i enjoy and attempt to think of future plans and opportunities surrounding those interests if you 've been having a difficult time thinking far ahead in the future but not knowing how to get there , try to think of the things that make you happiest in life keep the list to yourself or why not share it in the comments below , on the blog 's facebook page here or send them to me here my list is creativity crafts , animals , fitness , baking , family and friends
