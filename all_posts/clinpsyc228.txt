peter rost has a trio of documents on his site regarding potential off label marketing of seroquel as you may recall , i promised to track the seroquel lawsuit saga that i am fairly certain will continue to unfold why the lawsuits ? partially due to allegations of off label marketing the latest chapter , from rost 's site , is that az appears to have sent out a letter to sales representatives asking them to inform doctors about medical education events as you probably know by now , medical education is quite often drug company speak for advertising , , these medical education events were available via vhs , dvd , or webcast for doctors to view at their convenience one event discussed seroquel use in the young and the elderly , while another focused on seroquel for bipolar depression prior to seroquel receiving fda approval for such an indication is that naughty ? yes is it illegal off label marketing ? i'm no lawyer , but i bet not why ? well , the medical education was not provided by az no , it was provided through a third party i cme , which was supported by az i cme then found some key opinion leaders to provide education to their physician peers the marketing message is laundered through i cme so that az can say , we were n't marketing anything off label we 're not responsible for what i cme did with the program i cme is independent ! yeah , right should i cme wish to stay in business , they 're going to make sure to get pro az speakers and design a program that paints seroquel in a good light my favorite part is this snippet from the letter from the az cme director to sales reps astrazeneca supported an independent educational activity on october , in the areas of psychosis and dementia so if az supported an independent educational activity , does n't that make the activity , um , not independent ? give me a break for more on the seroquel for everything saga , please read prior posts here and here
