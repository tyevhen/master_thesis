you know when you see fat people they look like they were always fat , like it was inherited from fat mothers and fathers well you might be right half right and it is true that those in school who were fat still seem fatter twenty years later so why is that ? well a new study out helps explain it that plus what i have written in life before birth will give us a good idea what that is all about the study epigenetic gene promoter methylation at birth is associated with child s later adiposity fat godfrey , k m et al diabetes , may what it states is that a mother s intake of food during pregnancy produces epigenetic marks on genes producing a tendency to be fat at age nine and after now as i have written before , that epigenetic mark resulting from changes in the methyl is called methylation and is , in my terms , what produces the imprint it was changed by mother s fat and her nutrient intake while carrying increased fat mass along with low carbohydrate levels this may cause hyper methylation and a tendency for heaviness in the child because the child first learns the most important lesson of her life what kind of world to expect and what kind and how much she should eat her dietary regime is being formed if it is saying , you don t have enough and you need to eat more then that is the lifelong message it is not heredity , although it may look like it because the mother is also fat the big difference was the body fat index the link , they say , between mother s intake and the child s later tendency to be heavy after a few years is pretty convincing the uterine environment and the human adult phenotype how fat she looks is unmistakeable , as they did the experiment with another group and found the same thing what it shows is that experience during womb life will track us throughout lives , and as i show in the book will cause serious disease , including cancer and alzheimers disease , in my opinion , and any number of personality disorders it is the most crucial time of our lives when there is the most rapid growth of brain cells and organ systems it is here when critical set points for all kinds of systems and biochemicals are being set down so there can be deficiencies in thyroid hormone , for example , or not enough serotonin in help keep pain at bay and make us comfortable throughout life here is where personality is beginning to be formed and here is where we begin to have weight problems age nine for the rest of our lives here is where we need to pay the most attention to our babies if we are not calm and are fighting with our husband there is a greater chance of homosexuality in the offspring it is not a time to be taken lightly a new life is being formed
