this plagiarism bullshit has really got me down thanks to my loyal reader , commenter , and all around smart person , mohican , i now know that i am being copied by another site so if you are reading this on a site titled depression and anxiety at depressiono com , you are reading blatantly plagiarized material this is etta at depression marathon , and i am the actual author unbelievable thanks again to mohican , i 've written another e mail to the administrator of the offending website asking him to cease and desist i 've heard nothing so far for those of you who did n't read yesterday 's comments , i did succeed in getting the alaska psychiatry site to remove my material in fact , they removed all of the other bloggers' material , too now the site appears to be about ufo 's very strange mohican , again , has suggested some ways i can protect myself in the future if i can figure out how to implement those suggestions , i certainly will i 've already made one change , and i apologize to those of you who are used to reading my entire post via a feed i 've now changed my feed to a short form , which means you 've had to click through to my site in order to finish reading this post i'm sorry , but it may help protect my posts from being stolen in the future like i said , this whole experience has really gotten me down it sucks i just wanted to run my little blog here , but unfortunately there are some unethical , character less people in this world i wish those people had never discovered this blog ! no worries , though , i 'll continue trudging along
