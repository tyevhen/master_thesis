posted by dinah , in response to peter 's guest post a culture of whiners ? so , i liked the article in harvard magazine , and i loved peter 's metaphors comparing taking aspirin for headaches and seeing a doc for a sprained ankle to taking psychotropics for human distress , and i love thinking about this stuff which is why we have this blog i think , in my personal , non affiliated opinion , that we 've grown into a society that expects people to fit into a very small box if you do n't think and feel and function in a very limited and circumscribed way , then something is wrong with you worse than that , people become very distressed that they are n't living up to their expections of themselves or other 's expectations of them and become demoralized and consumed by their sense of failure sometimes it 's very hard to get people to look at the idea that maybe they were n't meant to live the life that was prescribed or self imposed , and the fallout becomes it 's own problem having said that , let me limit my discussion to two specific disorders adhd and social anxiety disorder , and i may throw in a mention of medicating grief let me also say that i do n't know a whole lot about adhd i do n't treat kids or even social anxiety disorder , but hey , i 've read the dsm , i prescribe the meds , and i even watch the paxil commercials i just meant that i have n't read the research in depth and while these problems surface in the course of my routine general adult psychiatry practice , i do n't label myself as an expert and if my sense on the phone is that someone is calling for nothing more than a prescription for an amphetamine , i send them to someone else so part of the box we 've created kids are supposed to sit still and concentrate in school let me give you a funny example from my personal life when my son was and entering middle school , he was accepted into a math science magnet program in the public school system the program had an excellent reputation and my son spent a day shadowing another child the school day went from roughly to with minutes for lunch it took him that long to get through the line , he ate cookies no recess , no gym , and the kids were assigned to hours of homework a night now whose idea was that to come up with this sort of curriculum for sixth graders ? the school he ended up at gives middle schoolers a minute break after nd period , a minute lunch , gym days a week , and an extensive after school sports program an all boys school we looked at included recesses a day in addition to the other stuff so , the adhd diagnosis is a complicated one , because it entails sometimes unreasonable expectations of children and some restless adults , it often does n't take into account that people just do n't concentrate well on things they are n't interested in , and with the diagnosis comes the expectation of treatment with an addictive , even dangerous medication that has often unpleasant side effects , so it 's not a benign designation the last psychiatrist tells us that little research has been done on the carcinogenic effects of ritalin , and psychiatrists are uneducated about the few studies that are out there for the psychiatrist , it 's a hassle all this press about physicians being monitored , prosecuted even for over prescribing controlled substances ok , pain meds , but just wait , and amphetamines in particular ca n't be phoned in or re filled in maryland , so getting the hard copy to the patient is always an issue and the other consideration is that amphetamines help everyone , even folks without adhd , perform better , faster so maybe they belong in the water supply ? and i suppose there 's this funny little question that no one dares ask adults with adhd what if it 's not that you 're not living up to your potential , what if you 're just dumb ? and no , i do n't ask my patients that ! when does someone fall far enough off the curve that we question if the problem is disorganization such that it 's a disease , versus a varient of the norm , simply a character trait ? but here 's the thing there are children who just ca n't function , hyperactive kids who prevent other children from learning , who ca n't hold still long enough to get educated , and there 's no issue here they need medication and it 's preferrable to putting them in special environments if you choose to homeschool your adhd kid rather than give them ritalin , more power to you and there are people who take stimulants and function much better , hold on to jobs they would n't otherwise be able to keep , stop having those funny little episodes of disorganization hmm , locked the keys in the car while it was running again and who feel life is much better on medications social anxiety disorder i have less to say about mostly , i see this in people who are otherwise anxious , and i do n't have a hard time giving someone who is suffering a non addictive medicine people have been taking a little inderal an anti hypertensive for stagefright for a long time , and this does n't seem to bother anyone if someone is my version of shy and wants a medication so they can function better in crowds , and i ca n't convince them that it 's okay to be shy or cure them with my great psychotherapy skills , then i'm not adverse to giving someone who is suffering an ssri , or even a little benzodiazepine for specific events i write lots of people for a few pills of ativan for flying since i do n't think i'm altering the makeup of the world , but maybe i should suggest non addictive support ducks instead ? i tell people the risks of paxil since the commercials , that 's what they want i tell people the risks sexual dysfunction , possible weight gain , a possible discontinuation syndrome upon stopping , and the fact that we do n't know the long term side effects , and that it may not work meds often do n't for these milder spectrum problems , i'm willing to prescribe it sometimes people i do n't think need meds feel much better , their lives improve , and they 're very grateful and if they have side effects or do n't work , they can always be stopped grief just briefly most people do n't go to a psychiatrist for grief , if they 're coming to me they are usually quite symptomatic meds do n't do much for uncomplicated grief anyway this view that ssri 's just numbs people is n't usually so though everyone is different the diagnoses themselves , without a demand for medication , can be extremely helpful it often comes as a tremendous relief to people to have a name for their difficulties , to know someone else somewhere has felt this way before and there are non pharmacologic ways of dealing with add or social anxiety , or whatever problem you have , things one can do to compensate if one is aware , in which case i do n't see a downside to the label now if only i could have gotten extra time on those sat 's and you can take medicines and get talk therapy , too , i'm all for it , see the psychiatrist as therapist post of course the insurance companies want whatever is cheapest , and of course they are molding how psychiatry is practiced it sucks and do i think psychotropic medications are altering the fabric of society ? yup , but maybe in a good way artists do n't paint , composers do n't compose , and writers do n't write if they 're dead or so depressed they ca n't crawl out of bed a little existential angst does fuel creativity or worse , the need to have a blog but i have n't seen anyone rush to the psychiatrist because of their creative juices , they come because they are suffering , and until you 've walked in their shoes , try not to judge of course , tom cruise knows what 's best , but as brooke shield put it to him in her new york times op ed reply to his criticism of her taking medications , i'm going to take a wild guess and say that mr cruise has never suffered from post partum depression ' on the issue of illness versus character trait , i think shiny happy person said it best with this thought mental illness robs you of your right to be a weirdo the designation as such robs you of the right to be many other things as well and so the giraffe he was photogaphed by clinkshrink 's sister and he has a number of issues for one , he is too small , and growth hormone shots will be starting next week with the hope of giving him a few more inches he 's fond of rainbows , cut out of the pack to shine beneath one , and we 're wondering if he 's schizoid , avoidant , seclusive , or anxious , or if he does n't play well with others perhaps he 's just thinking his own , possibly brilliant , thoughts
