learning happens best when it feels relevant to the learner , and when it relates to their own interests and life this is no secret , and is well recognized in the wider education world on the popular education blog mindshift , there are articles talking about how to connect school learning to a bigger purpose in an attempt to make students actually care about it , and in a list of ways to motivate students on the same blog connect abstract learning to concrete situations is number four as much as i try to care about some abstract collection of knowledge or skills , if i ca n't see the relevance in my own life , or how it relates to the things i find interesting and important , i just ca n't make myself focus enough to truly learn it this is true of almost everyone , and is the reason so many people remember so little of what they supposedly learned in school once the test is over , the knowledge , if it does n't feel relevant to the learner , will be forgotten quickly though many educators might disagree about just how much knowledge is lost , as the above mindshift articles show , they know that learning works best when it feels relevant to the student , which is why attempts to increase relevance are regularly made by progressive educators however , what strikes me about many of those attempts is just how artificial they feel it 's a desperate attempt to relate the material being taught to students' lives , in much the way that a lot of material is dressed up in bright colours and fun games in the lower grades i doubt either the supposed fun or attempted relevance fools many students , because ultimately much of what 's on your normal school curriculum wo n't be used in your life and is n't important to your community , and most of the work you do or the content you create does n't have any real impact or wider audience than a single teacher or possibly a whole class it 's not real work , it 's just busywork , which is about as far from relevant as you can get stuck in a very narrow mindset that sees schools in roughly the form they currently exist in as the only option , most approaches do n't truly seek to re imagine what education can look like and be even the data educators are working off of is based on such a narrow segment of humans , that of children in a very rigid and coercive school environment , that it 's not necessarily an accurate sampling of children as carol black , director of the film schooling the world , has said , collecting data on human learning based on children s behavior in school is like collecting data on killer whales based on their behavior at sea world when a teacher is coming from a place that sees compulsory schooling as a given , attempts at bringing the real world into the classroom too often look like pale copies of the real thing learning about wildlife from books instead of the wild , and solving problems for a test , not to fill a real need in your community some initiatives in some schools do actually make a difference in students' lives , and do manage to bring some learning and work that really matters into schools i do n't want to erase or downplay the ones that get it right however , as far as i'm concerned , school can never do as good a job at teaching children about the real world complete with real world problems and diversity and work , as participating in the real world itself it seems somewhat ironic that one of the biggest criticisms school free learners face is that they 're somehow avoiding the real world , when in reality life learners are embedded in it everything we do has meaning in our lives i 've never written a book report or an essay because i was required to do so , i 've only ever written for an actual audience , or because i was driven by inspiration i 've only ever taken classes i chose to or agreed to participate in i 've only ever learned about things i felt a real need to learn about , whether that was because of a personal interest or because that learning was needed to further a goal every part of my education has been driven by real need , real interest , and actual relevance in my life contrary to what some believe , that does n't mean i 've never done anything hard , or that i 've never had to deal with difficult people or situations living in the real world , you encounter a whole lot of different people and situations , some more pleasant than others , and you 're confronted with a range of problems and difficulties far from sheltering children from anything challenging or hard , learning through living means learning with the help of supportive adult figures how to navigate difficult situations , handle unpleasant people , and make the choices that are best for you and those around you life learning is all about authenticity , because nothing is constructed or designed in an attempt at engineering specific outcomes or learning instead , everything is an experience to be learned from , and at the same time , everything is just living the world ceases to be broken down into what 's educational or not , what can be learned from and what ca n't unschoolers seek to recognize that learning is always happening , no engineering needed , and instead just seek to build rich lives , full of resources and fun , interesting people and activities , and trust that that 's all you need for equally rich learning to occur when you structure your life in such an open way , with an outlook that 's so receptive to whatever learning might occur , you create situations where everything feels relevant to the learner , and where everything that 's done is done for a reason , whether that reason is fun , fascination , getting into a program you really want to be in , or helping out a friend to me , that 's what the real world looks like , not the artificial constraints of a school building , school timeline , and school curriculum unschooling is learning in the real world personally , i would n't have it any other way
