i feel so overwhelmed with all that i need to do in the coming year i do n't want to live a life of stress and constant busyness , but i feel like i need to but thinking of all i have to do makes my chest tight , my mind feel compressed and suffocated why am i doing this to myself ? i know it 's not good for me i feel lonely my friends are either out of the picture or people who are only occasionally available to talk i tried texting a couple people about how i 've been feeling , but did n't get a reply most of the time , i do n't care if i'm alone but sometimes i feel like i should n't have that attitude and i need to make friends but they always just seem to disappoint you i do n't think i can ever find a real friend i feel inadequate not accomplished enough not attractive enough to gain anyone 's attention not talented or popular enough to make any of my efforts at accomplishing things pay off
