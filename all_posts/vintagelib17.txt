here 's some happy happenings of late so i do n't end up ranting about how i wish pms did n't exist and how i'm dreading the next week and a half eating this is what it looks like when you order a black bean vege burger without the bun because you 're trying to go wheat free to improve your endo symptoms deliciously messy from shorty 's the new cafe in civic linking insensitivity d finally snapped tonight after watching me struggle to explain the disease for the umpteenth time and said , quite bluntly , think of it as cancer without the cancer endometriosis is terribly invasive it feeds on estrogen and burrows deep into the pelvic organs it has even been known to grow on other organs , such as the kidneys , lungs , and brain in more severe and admittedly , rarer cases it is incredibly painful , and the level of pain experienced by the sufferer is not always proportional to the disease s stage and while the growths are benign , the disease causes a host of other health problems along the way in addition to wreaking emotional havoc on the sufferer and her loved ones why dove s real beauty sketches video makes me uncomfortable and kind of makes me angry my primary problem with this dove ad is that it s not really challenging the message like it makes us feel like it is it doesn t really tell us that the definition of beauty is broader than we have been trained to think it is , and it doesn t really tell us that fitting inside that definition isn t the most important thing it doesn t really push back against the constant objectification of women are we better off without our bras ? with each incursion , i am struck by how these people seem to consider my breasts to be items for consumption or amusement , rather than essential parts of my self every time , i find myself thinking that i must learn to make concessions in the way that i dress or behave to stop eliciting these reactions the killer crush the horror of teen girls , from columbiners to beliebers an interesting article to revisit in the wake of the recent boston bombings and all the tumblr sites devoted to dzhokhar tsarnaev and just for fun take our ageless paul rudd quiz reading via in the last few weeks i have finished nine parts of desire by geraldine brooks and is everyone hanging out without me ? and other concerns by mindy kaling yesterday i finished extremely loud and incredibly close by jonathan safran foer i 'd been meaning to read it for ages and i'm so glad i did the whole book was delicious so many gorgeous quotes here 's a few there are plenty more where that came from in bed that night i invented a special drain that would be underneath every pillow in new york , and would connect to the reservoir whenever people cried themselves to sleep , the tears would all go to the same place , and in the morning the weatherman would report if the water level in the reservoir of tears had gone up or down , and you could know if new york was in heavy boots i spent my life learning to feel less every day i felt less is that growing old ? or is it something worse ? you can not protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness sometimes i can hear my bones straining under the weight of all the lives i'm not living now i ca n't wait to get into his other books eating animals and everything is illuminated making i 've gotten majorly into cross stitch at the moment it 's addictive a couple of weekends ago i managed to finish this one in under two days now i'm just looking for my next design
