since the inception of email in the workplace , i have truly had my share of nasty emails from parents , co workers , and other colleagues take this latest email from a new parent the student 's teacher and i had been recipients of several emails from this parent in one particular email , the parent asked a question of me and the teacher i knew the answer , so i responded in the next email , addressed to the both of us again , the teacher answered , but i did not i was clueless no big deal right ? well , a week went by and a very nasty email appeared addressed to my department , the administration , and all the student 's teachers in short , the parent was very dissatisfied that she had not received a response from me and that our department was very unprofessional the parent went on to state how sorry she felt for the students at our school because of the counselors' lack of attention she continued her rant by stating that other parents should not receive the same poor service after reading that email , i think i spent minutes just staring at the computer with a blank look on my face of course , i tried to find all the past emails from this parent to trace my responses then i began worry about what my administration was going to say and then i began to formulate equally nasty responses in my mind at that moment i had to make a decision respond immediately or wait and think out my response so what did i do ? well , i responded , but not the same day in fact , i gave myself some time to calm down and i wrote several drafts before deciding to send a very brief , concise email apologizing for my oversight shortly after the receiving this email from the parent who never responded back to my apology , i found a great article about responding to nasty emails written by attorney bill eddy in his article , mr eddy states that most email is just venting and has little meaning however , in a real conflict , mr eddy believes email can become increasingly hostile and involve more and more people he makes some helpful suggestions about responding to hostile emails you do n't always have to respond to a email that states negative things about you mr eddy makes a point that you could address inaccurate statements with facts , but leave out your opinions since our brain cannot think rationally when we are upset , wait to respond i did this right yay ! if your goal is to get someone to do something , do not respond to what they did wrong in the email instead use this technique b i f f be brief do n't respond to criticism and keep your responses short to reduce continued angry emails be informative respond to a email in order to correct inaccurate information avoid negative or personal comments about the other person i really wanted to blast this lady ! be friendly recognize the person 's concern in a friendly manner you do not have to be over friendly , but be non antagonistic be firm being confident in your response , tell the person your position or information if you must respond again , make responses shorter and state the same information as i know that i will always continue to get nasty emails sigh , i now have an effective strategy to respond to others now , if i can only get students and other professionals to use b i f f when responding to others on social media hmmmmmm want to read more from bill eddy ? go to his site high conflict institute
