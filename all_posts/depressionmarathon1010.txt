i had an interesting speed workout today i had x mile intervals scheduled i knew it would be a tough day , especially after ending last week with four straight running days and a mile weekend my legs were a bit heavy , and my heart was n't totally into it early in the run as i often do , i decided to try repeating a mantra to keep my mind focused and positive i started with the serenity prayer that 's always a good one for me , and it had worked for miles as recently as my miler on saturday as i began my repeats , between minutes per mile , it soon became apparent i needed a shorter mantra heavy breathing shortened it to god , grant me god , grant me late in the first interval it suddenly occurred to me , what the hell am i asking for ? and what gives me the right to be asking for anything right now ? i'm running i'm doing something i love , and i'm able to do it ! without another thought i found myself repeating , god , thank you god , thank you for each interval after that , i repeated the same mantra , thanking the higher power i choose to call god , and i felt freedom i was struggling physically , but something strange was happening spiritually i ca n't explain it any better than that sorry i guess it was just about time that i focused on thanking god for what i 've been given , the ability and freedom to train and perform in a sport i love , rather than asking for more it 's so easy for me to ask sometimes i need to remember to appreciate what i 've already got god , thank you
