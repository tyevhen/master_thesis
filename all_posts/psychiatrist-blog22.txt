i 've been finding the world to be a frustrating place , and when i'm frustrated , i write it could be worse i 've written a lot this week first i 'll send you to a commentary piece i wrote for the wall street journal asking the senate not to repeal a ruling that prohibits those who are both disabled by chronic , severe , mental illnesses and are unable to manage their finances often because they are cognitively impaired or have poor judgement i would not have concocted nor supported this original ruling under the obama administration because i do n't think mental illness and gun legislation mix , but given that it exists , it 's a pretty low bar but mostly , i hate that the nra has the power that it does in our country and that tens of thousands of people die from firearms each year see do n't repeal obama 's modest gun limit if you need to get around the paywall , try going through our facebook page to the link https www facebook com shrinkrapbook for a bit of a break , i reviewed patrick kennedy 's wonderful memoir a common struggle , in the same article with the dark comedy showtime tv series , nurse jackie an odd combination , but they are both about addiction see nurse jackie and patrick kennedy and finally , i want to rant about using jails instead of medical facilities for psychiatric patients i'm containing my outrage or perhaps i'm not , but when we hear about correctional facilities being the biggest providers of psychiatric care in this country , we do assume that the people that are being housed there have either committed a crime or are suspected of committing one with pending charges read my short article on psychology today about own hospital in south dakota now sends their overflow psychiatric patients to the local jail these are not people who have committed any crime in what alternate universe is this okay ? so much for controlling my outrage see https www psychologytoday com blog committed simple solution the bed shortage unfortunately jail and while i'm ranting about this , please see pete earley 's blog about a man who stole worth of candy then spent days in jail waiting for a bed at a state hospital his jail term ended when he starved to death his jail cell we can do so much better thanks for listening
