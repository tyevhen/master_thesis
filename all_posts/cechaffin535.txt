this week the poetry nazis at poetry thursday have called upon us blogging poets to post something on food as i am presently engaged in the battle of the bulge , this topic is not particularly welcome , but in the spirit of cooperation i 'll post something old and something new the secret meaning of carrots it was nearing winter when i pulled the remaining population , their green shuttlecock hair tipped with gold some were large , manly , others delicate , womanly , some had not reached puberty i grasped the whole tribe firmly , lovingly , and set them on the kitchen cutting board after their greens were shorn i bathed them in a colander as if sifting for gold they washed up like nuggets i placed them in a yellow bowl of cold water sweet , i crunched them in my teeth rich in vitamin a , i knew my vision had improved and i could see the secret meaning of carrots they begin from the smallest seeds , vegetate through summer and by storing the sun grow fat and sassy tubers , they groove on the slow conversion of energy into the sweet bacon of their bodies their central root aims for the earth s center like a heart worm uprooted , the same wire dives into the dirt of our mouths and by their sacrifice we eat the sun this appeared in in the now defunct tintern abbey , and in my first and only published book , elementary , which is out of print in other words i'm just a cyberghost with no bread crumb trail , just memories burying a caesar i made it on a saturday with romaine and green leaf lettuce stems crisp and firm fresh boiled eggs in slices the rose white flesh of radishes mushrooms cut kidney style spinach with that suede feel and chicken strips grilled in garlic oil if they 'd eaten it at the party or i had n't added dressing i would n't be standing here a week later fearing to open the blue ironware pot inside the refrigerator where hansel and gretel get lost in the furry forest of the fungal underworld where spice of meat and greens are married to the wilting tatters of miss havisham s spider riddled dress i must throw this mutant gallimaufry out i bag it blindly and drop it in the trash , holding my nose , but as i do i become curious about what alien stews must be composting in my neighbors trash see how the imagination festers ? i swear i'm not going to lift a lid unsubmitted , unpublished yesterday i caught my first rockfish i hiked two miles to a fairly deserted cove and finally managed to land a fish i took it home and froached it fried and poached , my term and it was delicious it tasted a bit like wild trout it 's such a satisfying feeling to catch or grow your own food we 've been eating some fine salads from my vegetable garden as well i am the world 's unluckiest fisherman , so i wo n't tell you how many times i was skunked before my triumph my mood is holding at one kilobunny i worked a great deal on the order of another ms yesterday for kathleen love poems if you go back to last thursday 's post , you can read one of those but who goes back ? is n't it the nature of blogging that folks only stop here for three or four minutes to see what 's happening today ? this blog has a history it started near san diego , continued in mexico , then found new life in the redwoods and turned intensely personal during my depression then we only have today , we only have this post nonsense ! with modern recording capacity we could document our entire lives if we wished just get a boswell with a video capable cell phone to follow you around now that might be a colossal bore , but it is technically possible if man can now record himself completely , all the more reason to believe in the akashic record , a tibetan conception of a book in which everyone 's life , living or dead , is completely preserved yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of decay , i will fear no caesar ce
