was n't happening for me until i started with a fresh empty ff user profile vista seems to be the problem in all of this gm on ff on winxp works fine , but with vista , gm does n't install properly unless you zero out your ff profile first at least , that 's the state of things today as i write this sept hopefully it will get fixed soon until then the procedure is in ff , go to organize bookmarks and export your bookmarks as html so you do n't foolishly lose them in the vista start panel , choose run launch firefox with a command line of firefox profilemanager when the profile manager dialog appears , create a new profile when ff launches , install greasemonkey import your bookmarks exit firefox return to step when profile manager dialog appears , delete your old profile or else leave it and have to contend with logging in to one or the other profile whenever ff launches whew sheesh
