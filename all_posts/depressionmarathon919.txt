i'm really proud of myself at mile , my legs were done i had hustled back on pace from a pit stop at mile , and we had just finished miles of rolling hills i was in the midst of composing my blog post in my brain the title was to be , missed again i was grieving thinking of everything that had gone wrong too much walking the day before the race , the injured calf , forgetting to buy yogurt my usual food for breakfast , travel stresses i had a lot of sadness and negative thinking going on despite my faulty thoughts and failing legs , i decided i would n't walk until at least mile the halfway point i do n't know why it was just a little goal i had already played other brain tricks earlier in the race for instance , at mile six i remember thinking , only more miles until there 's more miles left to go perhaps that thought of mile sixteen is what kept me going once i reached halfway at mile i thought , give yourself a chance just get to and that became my theme give yourself a chance , i kept repeating and by that i meant keep running on pace until mile before thinking about slowing , walking or quitting it worked i made it to mile , on pace , and felt a hell of a lot better than i had at mile or mile give yourself a chance , etta just make it to mile , and i did and then the goals were miles , , and by mile , i was pretty sure i was going to make it miles were perhaps the toughest miles i had ever run , but i did n't slow i was determined if it was easy , anyone could do it that was my thinking over the final miles any time i thought it was too hard , i reminded myself it was supposed to be hard that 's what would make it special and special it was i exuberantly yelled , i qualified , as i ran toward the finish line as far as i was concerned , the spectators were all cheering for me ha ! it was my ten seconds of fame i was very emotional and held back tears after i crossed the finish line those first miles were filled with physical discomfort and emotional negativity i think i am more proud of battling back from that than i am of qualifying for boston in many ways , the race was a microcosm of my last months remember july ? gripped by depression , i could barely get out of bed from my bed to a qualifying marathon i do n't know what else to say i'm happy i'm grateful life is good today
