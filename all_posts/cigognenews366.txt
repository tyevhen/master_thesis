we had a staff training today our practice is to bring in patients who need extra help to discuss their problem with them today , we saw a gentleman who has been sidelined for four years with chronic fatigue syndrome very few know what it is , which is why he has been shuttled from one doctor to another , getting one type of medication after another and he still is unable to work he did receive the diagnosis , however , which shows how useless a non dynamic diagnosis is chronic fatigue syndrome he is exhausted at all times , cannot drive or go to work just lies around let me explain this affliction and see what can be done about it and in do so doing i will try to help us see what the act out is and the act in , as well chronic fatigue can often be so subtle as to be undetected in the case under discussion exhaustion was his act out what that means is that he is not just tired now because he has no energy there is an imprint of exhaustion from far back in time that that dominates his life and drains his energy he really is tired in the same way that someone deprived of love early on acts out sexually trying to get touched as much as possible to make up for that past deprivation she really needs love and touch , and is really sexual driven by the past and its imprinted pain or in the case of early food deprivation , especially during womb life , the mother on a strict diet to keep her form , they are really hungry out of a memory ! all of these patients are acting out their need from the past in the present that is called symbolic acting out it is never satisfying or fulfilling no matter how much one does it and if one is dissuaded from the act out in therapy the need and imprint are still there doing damage down below during the birth process our fatigued patient struggled mightily to get out only to be smothered by a massive anesthetic given to the mother he couldn t struggle any more , so that failure set in he exhausted any and all resources he had in the battle to get born the exhaustion became an imprint later , he felt chronically fatigued and unable to struggle it wasn t so evident during growing up except that he disliked exercise or making a move , and he had less energy making a move originally was impossible he gave up easily when he should have pushed forward so when i say he gave up and couldn t struggle any more i am indicating nothing thought out it was a biologic memory that had nothing to do with conscious awareness the imprint was purely physiologic with no awareness counterpart it can only be understood after the fact of reliving the imprint when the feeling rises to the top level for comprehension , at last clearly , there is no reaching for the imprint because the patient does not know it is even there so he cannot deliberately think it out to go there our fatigued patient began to run off the imprint over and over throughout his life , with no idea what was wrong the distance between the birth trauma and current day fatigue is so large as to make it seem absurd it is not one way we know is through patients who suffer from it they relive and relive , first the terrible struggle to get out , then the lack of oxygen and near death sensation back then from massive anesthetic given to the mother , followed by shutdown of many key biologic systems , and giving up the struggle fail syndrome it is that syndrome that is carried through life and acted out without cease until there is conscious awareness for it to stop one needs connection it is the only way , the only way , to stop the act out yes , we can smack some man who gets erect when seeing a picture of a nude man or of someone who salivates at the sight of a juicy steak but it is only temporary until the imprint again rears its head , which it will certainly do that is why anger management cannot work we can find tricks to push down anger but the imprint dominates and never lets up nearly every treatment in the anger management armamentarium has to do with suppression , pushing back anger is not to be managed it needs to be felt in context then it is over we have to manage it , like food and sex addiction , when the person does not feel the feeling so either feel or manage it is one or the other the imprint is a memory that is unconscious because that is where it resides and it resides there physiologically , put in place long before the neurological capacity for full comprehension it is an imprint , nevertheless , and agitates us and forces the act out without stop it was physiologic originally and remains so it is impelling and compelling because it is purely physiologic , treatments that work on the physiology such as tranquilizers do work what is diabolic is that the there are mental consequences , impulsions from below , that force compulsive ideas that lead us to believe , somehow , that it is mental in origin not so obviously , the reliving cannot be faked because the memory has been hidden and does not become conscious until it is relived no patient can foresee this and decide to relive it and no one would want to fake it since it can be uncomfortable since several thousand patients have gone through it with success , some long before i wrote about it , we have a good idea that our hypothesis is right there is nothing quite so liberating as that reliving process once relived and the sequence completed it is over and one is no longer driven by it the compulsion is over because the imprint has been experienced meanwhile , until then , it captivates and rules most of our lives we are often bedeviled by our need to eat , or our constant exhaustion now we know what to do about it and treat it properly until there is connection for this fatigued man the smallest effort now leads to exhaustion and giving up he does not want to try any more the birth has been hijacked and is run off continuously effort , struggle , blocked , smothered by drugs , anoxia diminished oxygen exhaustion , failure to be clear , the physiologic component of the original imprint is run off and will be run off until it is experienced and made conscious that is , the entire biologic panoply , all of the physiologic components of the imprint , are there and active all of the time we act it out because there is no conscious connection like a headless chicken if our patient even thinks of going to look for a job he is literally paralyzed into inactivity it is as if the anesthetic is administered all over again after his birth struggle in this case , the act out was giving up and failure this was then a repetition compulsion where any kind of effort he made exhausted him , the analogue of the birth imprint unfortunately , he could never waver from this scenario because it was held fixed by the imprint itself , which never allowed any wavering or alternate behaviors originally if we want to know the hidden feeling we have only to examine the act out it is nearly always a direct reflection of the hidden feeling as we see in chronic fatigue this is not to say that it is always thus , but close enough it is often hidden by some kind of concocted philosophy or theory but it is still the outcome of an imprint why isn t the act out fulfilling ? because it is symbolic the fulfillment is for a past event and not current and it is not fulfilling because it is driven by an unrelenting memory of no fulfillment that is what is driving us and will continue to do so the no fulfillment is always there no matter how much we eat because it is an ineluctable imprint if we do not understand the imprint explained by me in the blog the mechanisms of methylation and acetylation we can never understand what drives our compulsions and how to treat them understanding is primordial otherwise , we are forever prisoners of pain
