i was pleasantly surprised to find this book i have been following the work of guilio tononi for some time and that involves reading articles co authored by christof koch as one his main collaborators there also have several excellent videos available on youtube where they discuss consciousness and integrated information theory iit of consciousness in this book we learn about koch 's personal and professional trajectory in the field and several of his influences he is currently the president and chief scientific officer of the allen institute for brain science and a professor of biology and engineering at caltech his academic credentials are available at the link to his web page and they are reviewed in this book as a backdrop to how he came to the field of consciousness studies the layout of the book is chapters over pages it is well written in that it contains technical terms but they are well explained for the novice on the other hand there are also higher level concepts pertaining to consciousness that will probably not be obvious to many readers that are well explained and worthwhile reading for anyone who is not an expert in the field the text reminds me of a slim guide to neuropathology that one of my med school professors claimed was the only book he studied to pass his subspecialty boards exams in other words , the more you bring to a book like this , the more you may take away at the same time it is interesting reading for a novice a typical chapter is organized around clinical and scientific observations , associated philosophy and the personal experience and meaning to the author i thought about characterizing the writing as a very good blog , but this writing by one of the top neuroscientists of our time is several levels above that koch writes from the perspective of admiration of some of the best scientists in the world when it is clear that he is among them he adds a unique perspective referencing his training , his family and social life , and the relationships he has with colleagues and mentors in the final chapter he describes how his career and experience has impacted on his belief system and personal philosophy i will touch on a couple of examples of what he covers and the relevance to consciousness chapter consciousness in the clinic is a chapter that is most accessible to clinicians specializing in the brain he briefly summarizes achromatopsia and prosopagnosia or face blindness he discusses prosopagnosia from the perspective of clinical findings and associated disability , but also consciousness for example , patients with this lesion do not recognize faces but they do have autonomic responses galvanic skin resistance when viewing faces that they know family or famous people relative to unknown people this is evidence of processing that occurs at an unconscious level that he develops in a subsequent chapter he describes the capgras delusion as the flip side of prosopagnosia in that they face is recognized but the patient believes the original person has been replaced by an impostor in this case the expected increase in galvanic skin resistant is lacking because there is no autonomic response to unconscious processing in the same chapter he details the problem of patients in a coma , persistent vegetative state pvs and minimally conscious state mcs and how some new developments in consciousness theory and testing may be useful from a consciousness perspective coma represent and absence of consciousness no arousals and no sleep transitions persistent vegetative state result in some arousals and sleep awake transitions in the minimally conscious state there are awakenings and purposeful movements the minimally conscious person may be able to communicate during the brief arousals at the clinical level being able to distinguish between the persistent vegetative state and the minimally conscious state is important from both a clinical and medico legal perspective he discusses the use of fmri in the case of apparently unresponsive patients who are able to follow direction to think about very specific tasks and produce the same brain pattern of activation seen in controls in a subsequent chapter tononi and massimini use transcranial magnetic stimulation tms and electroencephalography eeg for the same purpose this technique is considered proof of iit as well as a clinical test to differentiate pvs from a minimally conscious state in normal awake volunteers the tms impulse results in brief but clear pattern of reverberating activation that spreads from the original stimulation site to surrounding frontal and parietal cortex the pattern can be viewed in this online paper see figure in the patient who is in non rem sleep there is no cortical spread from this impulse and the total impulse duration is less , illustrating a lack of cortical integration required for a conscious state when applied to pvs versus mcs patients , the mcs patients show the expected tms eeg response that would be seen in conscious patients the pvs patients do not he describes the tms eeg method as a crude consciousness meter but obviously one that probably has a lot more potential than traditional clinical methods there are many other clinical , philosophical and scientific issues relevant to consciousness that are discussed in this book that i wo n't go into i will touch on a recurring theme in the book that gets back to the title and that is science and reductionism philosophical perspectives are covered as well as the idea that the origin of consciousness may not be knowable by scientific methods koch 's opinion is that most everything is knowable by science and that science generally has a better track record of determining what is knowable that is certainly my bias and i am on record as being an unapologetic reductionist rather than a romantic one this is a book that should be read by psychiatrists and residents these concepts will hopefully be some of the the mainstays of st century psychiatry it can be read at several levels i was interested in the development of koch 's ideas about consciousness i wanted to learn about his relationship with collaborators i was pleasantly surprised to learn that we had similar thoughts about popular media , philosophy , and and psychodynamic psychiatry i have had career long involvement in neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology so the description of cortical localization and clinical syndromes was second nature to me but even against that background , he makes it very clear where consciousness comes in to play one of my concerns about psychiatric training is that there is not enough emphasis on neuroscience and consciousness condensed into this small book there are number of jumping off points each chapter has a collection of annotations and there is a list of about scientific references at the end it may take some work , but this book is a brief syllabus on how to get up to speed in this important area and greatly extend your knowledge of how the brain works george dawson , md , dfapa reference christof koch consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist first
