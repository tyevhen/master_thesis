well , it is the apex of our year supposedly national school counselor week ! last week i had the pleasure of witnessing our counseling colleagues honored by the first lady at the white house and i was so proud for them ! although there was much fanfare in washington , around the nation there were many school counselors who were unaware this event was even going on how sad for instance , many of the school counselors in our district county were unconsciously unaware that the white house was throwing this amazing affair sigh makes me so proud ! now let me digress for a minute before going to college , i worked in a video store each month , we would get about ten new movies to watch , tell our patrons about them , and either recommend or not recommend that particular film so , during this time i watched a lot of movies and i still remember a lot of them especially some of their one liners thinking about our profession , i remember one quote from a movie during that time period that is pertinent to our situation first , a brief synopsis man has a happy family , but meets an attractive woman who seduces him into an affair that is not the part that is pertinent to our profession stick with me the man feels so bad about the affair that he breaks it off with her woman does n't take it well and stalks man and his family eventually woman faces off with man , with a butcher knife no doubt , and tells him i will not be ignored dan okay , i know you are thinking what does this movie have to do with this school counseling post ? well , actually the movie is irrelevant , but her quote stood out in my mind i realized that she had been discarded and was going to do what she needed to do to get the attention she thought she deserved now , i am not advocating for violence , stalking , or insanity however , as school counselors , we need to bring attention to our profession by standing out and showing how we benefit our schools in an article written by anne o'brien , she found that even though research shows that school counselors are important to academic success in schools , they are highly undervalued further , she indicates that school counselors are still considered a luxury in most states in fact , the office of civil rights found that one in five students still lack a school counselor and some counselors have caseloads up to students i am shaking my head on this one what really put our current professional situation in perspective for me was a quote i read by one of my counseling friends , carol miller carol writes a great blog and manages a facebook page for middle school counselors on this facebook page , carol posted a quote that reflects the belief that many school counselors have about our profession many school counselors feel that people should know what we do and so why should we bother promoting our profession in our school she had an amazing response to the counselors who said that they were too tired , it did n't matter , or people should be celebrating that they are school counselors so why bother ? because i hope these things bother you as well i hope that you will find the strength to promote our profession because that profession helps kids they are the reason we go to work in the morning they are reasons why our jobs exists that are the ones who ultimately benefit from our advocating if you think it does n't matter , you 're wrong sometimes it has to be played like a broken record , being repeated over and over again until the words are embedded in our brains but , it does have impact our words matter just as words you say to a student may not seem to have any impact , but then years later that student sees you and says , remember what you said to me ? it made all the difference side note carol posted a comment on my blog and i wanted to share her thoughts with you one thing i want to add is that if you missed national school counseling week this year , do n't worry just pick another week and participate you do n't have to wait until next year we are , after all , school counselors weeks a year , not just one while you 're at it , remember what you learned in kindergarten remember to say 'thank you ' i'm sure you had a school counselor who has touched your life let them know so , the reality is that we are not where we need to be even the first lady recognizes that school counselors are often treated unfairly by our schools okay , so what can we do to change this mindset by our stakeholders ?
