why can it be hard to 'get in touch with your feelings' , to 'feel what you need to feel' ? psychodynamics offers one answer it 's because we do n't want to feel pain , and so shy away from painful emotion and from the anxiety it causes no doubt that 's sometimes true yet other factors suggest themselves thus what can make for the difficulty may not be so much the intrinsic pain , but the secondary shame , of the feeling or at least , what can make for the difficulty is not having a sense of an other who will accept one in one 's feeling that , i believe , is not so far from a difficulty in 'mentalising' one 's emotions , so long as one resists the temptation to construe that phenomenon in a merely cognitive manner shame and acceptance enter into the heart of self understanding thus you enter into the ontological heart of i but what else needs considering is the intrinsic difficulty of transitioning between states being in an emotional state is being in a self maintaining auto enacted attractor basin of affect , thought , activity , etc it is being in a mode which itself is one way of 'making sense' my hypothesis is that it is simply difficult to move between states where by 'simply' i mean not because of the pain of the shift , despite the shift being painful , but because we do n't know our way around you have to escape the self maintaining attractor dynamics of one state , move over a threshold , and enter another state moving between solitude and co presence is a good example getting in touch with your latent anger when you are happy is another we are n't obliged to think of this difficulty in motivational terms often enough we are , when we arrive there , perfectly happy to be angry or sad or what have you it was the transition , not the destination , that was troubling or , sometimes , not even troubling , but simply difficult so what we need to do is to cultivate our ability to move across thresholds between emotional states we need to develop rites of passage micro emotional forms of what anthropologists note regarding major transitions in life some of these are simple for example , we have rituals for saying hello and saying goodbye these enable us to move between the radically different modes of being of solitude and company moving between states can be troubling i propose that 'anxiety' is the name of the stateless in between , the state of upheaval we feel when we move out of one unanxious known into another such but , since we must reconfigure ourselves or better , since we must be reconfigured in transit , we have to go through discombobulation but , once again , i'm not proposing a psychodynamic theory i e it is n't that we do n't want to feel the anxiety although that too may well sometimes be true it is that we are designed to keep being pulled into the prior steady states it is anxiogenic to get in touch with uncommon emotions , on this model , not because we do n't want to be in the latter state , but because the process of auto reconfiguration we must go through to get there is intrinsically jarring but , again , it 's not necessarily that we act to avoid the anxiety , so much as that we get auto configured by the attractor basin of the original affect state we know our way around when we are in a steady affective state that state reveals the world to us as heidegger contends regarding mood we do n't know our way around when we are transitioning between states we lack an inner seer , an inner shaman , an inner spirit guide , to take us from one world to the next it 's not that we do n't want to travel , but just that having a home is having a place we are pulled back to when we get there , finally , we 're usually happy enough
