claude shannon made an important finding when he realized that the information contribution of a symbol could be estimated very simply as fx logfx , where fx is the frequency of occurrence of the symbol x for example , a series of a coin tosses can be considered a binary information stream with symbol values h and t heads and tails if the frequency of h is and ft is , the entropy e , in bits per toss , is times log base for heads , and a similar value for tails the values add up in this case to the intuitive meaning of the shannon entropy is that a single coin toss conveys bit of information contrast this with the situation that prevails when using a weighted or unfair penny that lands heads up of the time we know intuitively that tossing such a coin will produce less information because we can predict the outcome heads , to a degree something that 's predictable is uninformative shannon 's equation gives times log for heads and log for tails , for an entropy of bits per toss in this case we can say that a toss is redundant claude shannon dna is an information stream resembling a series of four sided coin tosses , where the coin can land with values of a , t , g , or c in some organisms , the four bases occur with equal rates each , in which case the dna has a shannon entropy of bits per base which makes sense , in that a base can encode one of possible values but what about organisms in which the bases occur with unequal frequencies ? for example , we know that many organisms have dna with g c content quite a bit less than or in some cases more than the information content of the dna will be less than bits per base in such cases as an example , let 's take clostridium botulinum the source of botox serum , a soil bacterium with unusually low g c content , at if we go through the organism 's , protein coding genes , we find actual base contents of a t g c these numbers are for a single strand the coding strand or message strand of dna , which is why a and t are n't equal for whole dna , of course , a t and g c , but that 's not the case here we 're just interested in the message strand if we put the above base frequencies into the shannon equation , we come up with a value of for the information content in bits of one base of c botulinum dna the dna is about redundant on a zero order entropy basis the dna may be over a and t , but it 's a long way from being a two base one bit information stream each base encodes an average of bits of information , which is a surprising amount surprisingly close to for such a skewed alphabet
