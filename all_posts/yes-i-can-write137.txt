i 've been unschooled from the beginning of my school years with a few interruptions explained in my next answer how long have you unschooled did you unschool ? we had a little bit of curriculum structure near the beginning and end of my school experience , and i went to nd grade because my mom was getting a massage therapy license , and gifted class one day a week for the rest of elementary school how old are you now ? do you have any siblings ? if so , did they do they unschool as well ? i have two sisters , kate and ivy , and they were also both mostly unschooled if your parents chose unschooling , do you know how why they made that decision ? my mom decided to unschool us i'm sure she could articulate her specific reasons better than i could , and i do n't want to put words in her mouth , but she 's always been interested in alternative education and is really a free thinking person in many areas of life and i have to get serious credit to my dad , too , for supporting it and being the breadwinner so my mom could stay at home with us what do you think the best thing about unschooling is ? the time and space to be myself , pursue my passions , make my own choices i have always been passionate about storytelling , in some form or another , and spent the majority of my childhood hours creating stories , comics and art , and playing complicated pretend games with ongoing plot lines with my sister i felt like i was really hitting my creative stride in my teen years , when my peers were buried with homework and school and were too old for a lot of that stuff i think they were missing out i would still play pretend games if i could ! but my writing now pays the bills , and i have loads of stories from my teen years that i still pluck ideas from to rework to say nothing of the time to learn the things i wanted to learn whatever i was interested in , i could study to my heart 's content , immersing myself in one or two subjects at a time , and i think it really helped me retain the things i learned when i was in the early days of my anime manga phase at , i learned to read and write the japanese syllabary in one intensive day of study in school , you 'd just get a little time for this and a little time for that , whether you liked it or not what do you think the worst or most difficult thing about unschooling is ? i think it really depends on the individual situation but i did lack friends the friends i did have were mostly the children of my mom 's friends , which meant i did n't really get to choose them from a classroom pool , and even then i did n't see them often the internet was a wonderful thing when that came along , but it still sucked having all my friends in other states ! however while people worry about homeschooled kids not having enough friends , i also skipped the negative side of being around a million other kids , like bullying or peer pressure did you decide not to go to college or university ? if so , could you talk a bit about that experience , and what if anything you decided to do differently instead of college ? i did skip college at first it was n't really intended to be forever , i just did n't know what to do with myself , but i did know i did not want loans unless i had a purpose for them i felt like i needed some time to work , get out into the world , and figure out what i wanted to do so i did in my early twenties i visited a friend who was attending the university of toronto , stayed in her dorm , sat in on some classes got some serious college lust plus i 'd hit upon the idea of getting a degree to become a librarian so i started looking into schools and finances as i was doing this , though , i was thinking about how what i really wanted to be was a writer and i 'd never really tried so i dropped the college idea for the time being and gave myself a new goal sell a book in four years , or go to college i was at the time , and it took me three years to hit the goal are you currently earning money in any way ? yes , i have now been a full time writer for two years it 's not the most financially stable work , at least for a debut author , but so far so good , and it is my dream job i have one novel on the shelves and two more done and sold what jobs ways of earning money do you , and have you , had ? prior to selling a book , i worked at a health food store , and before that , at sears first job and all whee do you feel that unschooling has had an impact on what methods of earning money or jobs you 're drawn to ? i think unschooling helped me know that i did n't have to settle for less than joy in my working life what impact do you feel unschooling has had on your life ? it is honestly as hard for me to imagine what my life would be like going to school as it would be to imagine being born in some far off country it 's had a huge impact and i would n't trade it for anything what advice would you give to unschooling parents or parents looking into unschooling ? do n't be afraid if your kids seem to be playing all day i incorporated all kinds of things into my play math ! history ! music ! but most importantly , i used stories and art to puzzle out the world around me as i grew , the big questions in life love , death , war , religion , sex , gender the list goes on taking in art , through books or movies or comic books or music or even video games , and making art through whatever mediums one prefers , is as necessary as breathing to being human art and stories are woven through the fabric of every subject , but i think sometimes school sucks things dry do n't be afraid if kids are bored sometimes there is something on the other side of bored , and it 's a wellspring of creativity and ambition that is all the better for a kid having to find it for themselves do n't be afraid if your kids do n't seem to get as much social interaction as other kids contrary to current belief , children do n't need to be around a group of children of their exact age all day every day to learn how to interact with other humans in fact , i might argue that it 's detrimental and artificial to do so , because the real world certainly is n't like that
