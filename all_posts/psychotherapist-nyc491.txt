the term 'lesbian bed death was originally coined by pepper schwartz and philip blumstein who wrote the book , american couples in their book , they wrote that lesbian bed death refers to a phenomenon that occurs in some long term lesbian relationships where one or both women lose interest in having sex with each other lesbian bed death a myth or reality ? while it 's true that loss of interest in sex can also occur in long term heterosexual relationships , according to the authors of american couples , it seems to occur with more frequency in lesbian relationships however , after their research results were published in the s , their methodology was challenged obviously , there are many happy lesbian relationships where couples continue to have sex and have a healthy relationship many lesbians remain in long term relationships , have children , and with the new law in new york that finally allows gay couples to get married , go on to get married so , it 's understood that many lesbian couples lead happy lives together there are many lesbian couples who have happy , full lives together but , for the purpose of this blog article , i'm focusing on a particular issue and , rather than debating whether lesbian couples' sex lives fizzle out more frequently than heterosexual couples , i 'd like to discuss a particular phenomenon that i 've observed with lesbian couples who come to see me in my private practice that often leads to lesbian bed death i 've observed this phenomenon among lesbian couples more frequently than in heterosexual couples or gay male couples given that this is a complex topic , one blog article ca n't be as comprehensive as this topic deserves and my observations are n't part of any research , so i ca n't say that they are generalizable to the lesbian population as a whole , but i think this phenomenon does occur in many lesbian relationships , and it 's worth , at least , opening up a dialog about it obviously , the lesbian couples , and couples in general , who come to see me in my psychotherapy practice are couples that are having problems in their relationships , so i ca n't say they 're representative of most long term lesbian relationships because i generally do n't see the couples who are in happy relationships long term lesbian relationships the following vignette is a composite of many cases , to protect confidentiality , where a lesbian couple in a long term relationship has stopped having sex due to a particular dynamic in their relationship sue and ann when sue and ann came to see me , they had been together for years they came because they had not been sexually intimate with each other in the last three years they were familiar with the concept of lesbian bed death and , whether it was a myth or not , they were concerned that they had lost the sexual passion that was once so important to each of them at first , they both thought they no longer had sex due to long work hours and the pressures of everyday living but even when they went on vacation and they had time to be sexually intimate , they no longer felt sexual with each other as we explored their relationship dynamic , it became apparent that they were living together as if they were mother and daughter even though they were both the same age in their late s , sue related to ann as if ann was her mother sue liked ann to behave in a maternal way towards her ann did n't really like being in this role , but she went along with it to make sue happy the problem is that when two people in a relationship relate to each other like mother and child it can feel incestuous to have sex so , it was n't surprising that they were n't feeling sexual with one another now , this phenomenon of a couple behaving as if they are parent and child does n't just happen with lesbians it can occur in heterosexual relationships and in gay men 's relationships but i 've seen it most in lesbian relationships although , once again , i do n't know if we can extrapolate from what i 've seen in my psychotherapy practice to make any general statements about lesbian relationshps or lesbian bed death what 's more important is that couples like sue and ann need to be able to communicate with each other about this and decide it they want to change while it 's true that most long term romantic relationships have an element of reparenting in them , when this becomes the predominant dynamic , it can have a big impact on the couple 's sex life sue and ann had already decided that they wanted to rekindle their sex life so , sue began her own individual therapy with another therapist to work out early childhood issues of emotional neglect she had to grieve the loss of not having an emotionally available mother when she was a child over time , this allowed her to treat ann more like her girlfriend instead of like her mother sue and ann also became more comfortable in couples counseling talking about what they each wanted in terms of their sex life together over time , they introduced novel ways of relating to each other sexually so that they were able to rekindle the passion in their lives lesbian bed death a myth or a reality ?
