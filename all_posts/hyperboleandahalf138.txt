grammar is a subject that is very dear to me however , i do n't agree with some of the commonly accepted ways to use it wait ! do n't stop reading ! this is not some snobby diatribe stressing the importance of proper grammar it is about making grammar better my way very unique uttering the phrase very unique is like punching grammar in the face the reasoning goes that unique means different from anything else in the world so to say that something is very unique is completely unnecessary no it 's not every person in the world is unique every snowflake is unique property owners want you to think that their sh tty 's apartment with the decorative stairs to nowhere is unique but to say that individuals like marilyn manson or the late michael jackson are unique is an egregious understatement yes , we are all different but they are really , really different they are to different what pluto used to be to the solar system before it was so unceremoniously demoted why do i feel the need to include pluto in all of my grammar posts ? they are on the very outer edge of the spectrum they have a much greater distance between themselves and normal which is still unique , just more normally so our language should allow for a descriptor to reflect that increased distance the number of dots in an ellipsis should reflect the length of the pause writing would be so much more descriptive so much more malleable and honest example jenny chewed her lip and fiddled with the pages of her algebra textbook as she tried to find the right words finally , she said mr smith i'm pregnant uh said mr smith i know that it is not right to make light of student teacher sex scandals , but it is my blog and i do what i want and for your information , mr smith turned out to be a great father and he married jenny the moment she turned example knock knock who 's there ? jerry the mute jerry the mute who ? i also know that it is not right to make up knock knock jokes that poke fun at serious disabilities , but if you are offended now , you might want to reconsider reading further also , you may want to pause and reflect on the sheer genius behind that joke since it is not every day that i come up with something that awesome example upon noticing the packet of prescription valtrex on the nightstand , jenny asked mr johnson , what is valtrex for ? it is valium for large dinosaurs , my dear being an english teacher , mr johnson knew not to pause as long as jenny do n't worry jenny is legal in this story daylight saving time , down syndrome and dived over the years , people have added unnecessary s 's to daylight saving time and down syndrome the first one is simple we are saving daylight it makes sense the second one does n't compute quite as neatly apparently dr down did n't want to be like dr alzheimer , dr hodgkin , dr asburger , or dr huntington he wanted to be more unique , so he simply named the disease he discovered after himself no apostrophe or s needed some words are so commonly misused that they should be adopted as standard simply so that the smart people are n't the ones sounding like illiterate dummies for example , did you know that dove is not a verb ? despite the fact that everyone and their dog uses it in such a manner , it is still considered correct to use the word dived i dived off the proverbial cliff when i decided to write this offensive post but dived sounds retarded so does down syndrome but i think i could get in some sort of trouble for saying that or something we should adopt dove so that i do n't look like an idiot for trying to be grammatically correct favre how this series of letters came to be pronounced farv i will never know faver ? sure fav ray ? why not ? favery ? i guess it works but farv ? ? what kind of dyslexic french a hole came up with that one ? while we are on the subject , i think i should address french as a whole french is supposedly the most romantic language there is if you consider completely unnecessary and phonetically nonsensical extra letters romantic eaux is supposed to make and o sound really ? are you so full of yourselves that you thought forget zee o we need four letters because our language eez four time better ! i personally think that france would be world dominant if they did n't have all those superfluous letters slowing them down while we are on the subject of being on the subject of talking about foreign words , i thought i might mention something to my american friends if you are trying to pronounce a foreign word in an otherwise english sentence , please do n't pronounce the word with a heavy accent it makes you sound pretentious and douche y i am in no way insulting brett favre himself if i were to do that , it would decrease my chances of ever bearing his grizzled , womb warrior children , and i definitely would n't want to do that less fewer i am going to back strunk and white percent on this one if there is one mistake that i cannot stand , it is the confusion of less with fewer you commonly see this error in grocery stores express checkout items or less also in porta potties this unit is designed to accommodate the needs of people or less during a normal work week less is supposed to refer to an amount that cannot be counted like air or sand fewer refers to a number of things that are countable , such as oxygen molecules or grains of sand a few more examples jenny is less of a tramp because she slept with fewer teachers than veronica i made that knock knock joke less offensive by including fewer references to disabled people mr johnson now uses less valtrex because he has fewer herpes sores other languages are less awesome than french because they use fewer unnecessary letters less should be used less often than fewer because there are fewer instances where less is appropriate nonetheless , less is used more i hope that your lives have been enriched by my mighty opinion i am sorry if i have offended you , but you should try to be less offendable
