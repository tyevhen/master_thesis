one of the symptoms of over training is a drop in previously attainable times today , i could barely meet my meter interval time goals , and i only cranked out versus the repeats which were scheduled i'm tired another symptom of over training is needing more sleep , or feeling less refreshed after a normal amount of sleep yup , i 've got both of those signs , too but then again , i often have those sleep symptoms i have depression ! however , this does seem different my legs , my lungs , my brain i'm tired everywhere perhaps i'm a bit over trained this is not good i have my last long run this weekend miles it 's normal to be tired at this stage of training i'm in the midst of the highest mileage week but my slower times , i think , are sending me a message i'm over trained i am considering cutting out tomorrow 's scheduled run that 's hard for me to even consider , but i'm trying to be smart trying to be smart that 's why i cut my run short today , too i hate having to be smart i 'd rather just run i 'll let you know if tomorrow leaves me brilliant or fatigued
