one of the worst aspects of depression is the fear that it will never end i often wrote of that fear in my diary th march will this nightmare ever end ? th april what is this storm that rages within me ? why won t it abate , why won t it subside ? it comes in like a storm , and devours me and it won t go away it s near four months now four months of doing nothing , just hiding , hiding , and waiting rd july i just want to get on with my life will i ever be me again ? th july i hate being so irritable and frustrated , so disturbed , all day , every day and it never ends oh lord , where are you ? i feel like getting so angry with you i guess it all boils down to this is he trustworthy or not ? i know the answer is yes but why does he make me wait so long yet at the same time , i had a faint hope that the nightmare would end one day , that there was light at the end of the tunnel th may but each day comes to an end eventually , and so will this emotional turmoil th may how i long to be normal again , as i believe this will all end one day the recovery will be slow , i think it needs to be , i could n't cope with anything quick i'm beginning to see some hope for the future , which is good i guess one saturday in , when i was feeling very low , my mother said , don t just sit around moping , you need to do something why don t you go and do a painting , like you used to i took her advice , sat down , and without any goal in mind , painted this painting i guess it was a subconscious attempt to show how i was feeling , that i was stuck in a dark cave high in the cave was a small opening through which i could see sunlight , which was mockingly beyond my reach yet when i showed the painting to my mother , she smiled and said , see , there is light at the end of the tunnel you will get out of this , you will recover and she was right i did get out of the hopeless , dark pit i learnt how to cope with depression and live a fulfilling life while letting depression and its symptoms churn away in the background like background music background music that slowly faded away over time as i slowly healed and i eventually recovered from depression competely the purpose of this post is just to encourage anyone stuck in the miry pit of depression that there is light at the end of the tunnel , the nightmare does end however , we must not wait passively for this to happen depression is an illness , and like any other illness , needs to be treated so we need to seek sound medical advice and seriously consider taking medication if recommended , see a christian therapist or counsellor on a regular basis so that the underlying issues that causes the depression can be treated we also need to understand the fear adrenalin fear cycle and learn the steps we can take to break that cycle the fear adrenalin fear cycle breaking the cycle and of course , we need to be patient and give our exhausted nervous system and mind the time they need to heal most of all , we need to place unwavering trust in god , recognising that he is with us and is in control , instead of letting our hearts be troubled we need to rely upon christ s strength in our weakness , rather than stagger along with what little remains of our own strength and the god of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory in christ , after you have suffered a little while , will himself restore you and make you strong , firm and steadfast peter so do not fear , for i am with you do not be dismayed , for i am your god i will strengthen you and help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand isaiah download a pdf booklet of this blog 's articles all verses from the niv
