i do n't have very much time to post today so i decided i would leave this quick thought i know that the biggest reason i have social anxiety issues is due to a lack of confidence in myself i 've mentioned this before but since its so constant in my mind i will mention it again one way i am trying to overcome that is to pick up hobbies that i like that allow me to express myself creatively this not only allows me to be proud of myself and what i have accomplished but i feel it also gives me a sense of depth as a person , and it helps to define who i am in small ways also , it seems to relieve stress for me maybe it can do all of that for you too so one of my latest hobbies is photography i also love to scrapbook , play the piano , blog yes i consider it a form of creativity and expression and i am sure i will pick more up along the way i do n't claim to be a professional at any of them but it is very fun here are some recent pictures i have taken with my new camera i got for my anniversary these above are a couple pics of my newest nephew that i took while babysitting here is a combination of pictures taken at different settings and then meshed using an hdr program just playing around to see how it works here is a closeup of a flower using a macro filter anyway , if you have n't found anyway to express yourself you should you do n't have to be good at it i am a beginner at pretty much everything i do , but it still brings me a sense of accomplishment and worth to look back and see my progress some ideas for hobbies are photography sports water sports , team sports , etc sewing knitting carpentry work woodwork scrapbooking writing painting gardening landscaping videography skateboarding longboarding training for marathons or races creating webpages dancing rc racing play a musical instrument sing the list could go on and on ! now that i have shared one of my hobbies what do you guys do to express yourself ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety
