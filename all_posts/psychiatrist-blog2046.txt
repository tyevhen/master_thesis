when i was in medical school i recall seeing an unkempt looking fellow standing on the sidewalk , talking to himself and spinning round and round people walking past were giving him a wide berth i stood near him and said , excuse me at that utterance , he immediately stopped spinning and began walking down the street as if he were a skipping record and i just nudged the needle hmm do people even get this analogy in the cd era i'm feeling old as an aside , this symptom of spinning is an interesting phenomenon that has often been mentioned in older schizophrenia literature pubmed what i find interesting is that the spinning is usually in the same direction counter clockwise , often attributed to asymmetrical changes in dopamine physiology hmm wonder if it is clockwise in the southern hemisphere so anyway , it was one of those brief , random interactions that you do n't forget never having an explanation to fully understand it so that it can be neatly categorized and put away i was at the ocean this past week and had several experiences of seeing folks standing or walking on the boardwalk , talking to themselves at times , they seemed to be gazing in my direction , prompting an excuse me ? as i wondered what they were asking of me after getting no response , i realized they were plugged in to a bluetooth headset , chatting away on their phones , oblivious to the world around them it 's funny funny strange , not funny ha ha , as gilligan would say if i saw the headset , then i did not get confused i immediately realized they were chatting to someone else and did n't give it a second thought but when the headset was in the ear i could not see , it caused an ambiguous moment , not knowing if they were talking to an unknown person , maybe hallucinating it 's funny how our not just psychiatrists , but all of us brains are wired to notice odd or unexplained behavior , while instinctively filtering out things which fit neatly into our normal or expected categories of behavior as the world becomes more wired weird ? , i wonder that our expectations about human behavior will change having a one sided conversation no longer seems so clearly psychotic the idea of a transmitter implanted into one 's tooth no longer seems so clearly delusional i still see people with schizophrenia having paranoid delusions , but i note that i more often discount their concerns that there are cameras watching them there are or that their email is being monitored it is the technology reshaping the world will turn us all on its ear
