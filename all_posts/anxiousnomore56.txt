every year when january st rolls around i have a whole list of resolutions for every aspect of my life i guess its the perfectionist in me , as there is a never ending list in my head as to how i can improve then , as long as i actually complete one resolution , i am happy its sort of fail safe last year one of my resolutions was to display some of my pictures that i take in my home i came up with a photo wall of x canvas prints that i love i have one left that i need to still fill of my hubby getting him to do a photo shoot of only him will be a miracle but it was a lot of work and took a long time to accumulate the photos and put it all together so i am happy this year , i want to do a lot more for my home turning my house into a home kinda stuff i have my toe dipped into so many little ventures , i would like to take one of them and run with it turn it into something bigger as for my health , i have a lot of ideas for the site , but i have n't made any real goals for myself i am still trying to master the once a week yoga the holidays kinda took me off of that one , whoops ! i have spiritual goals and family goals , but they too come with roadblocks that make it hard and i 've decided i do n't want to put too much pressure on myself make life simpler so as not to get so overwhelmed so i think the simplest way for me this year is to sum all of my goals into one mission statement if you will to spend my time with people that i love , doing activities that i love , that make myself and my family happy remembering that will help me to stay focused on where i should be any new year 's resolutions for you ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like new year 's resolutions my year new year , clean slate , fresh look a year later same scenario , different outcome what to do when feeling overwhelmed linkwithin
