so , it 's been a month since i first put out the call for zine submissions , and i have half a dozen pieces that people have sent in however , i was silly and never really mentioned a proper deadline so , i 'd really like to have everything in by december st , so i can start putting it together then and have it completely finished before christmas when i wo n't have time to do much of anything ! i know how easy it is to get sidetracked and forget about stuff like this i know i have done so more times than i would like to admit , so i figured i 'd send out a friendly poke to everyone who said that they may want to contribute something to the zine grins if you do want to send something in , but are n't able to by december st , that 's still totally fine just drop me an email at open eyed slave gmail com to let me know when you 're able to send it in by ! thank you so much to everyone who has expressed interest in this project , whether or not you 're able to submit something ! just having this much interest has made a big difference to me peace , idzie you might also like diy life zine looking for submissions for issue ! first ever issue of diy life zine now available ! ! diy life zine now has it 's own website ! diy life zine table of contents linkwithin
