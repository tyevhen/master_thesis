on the maryland psychiatric society 's listserv i recently heard about a newly available in the us snri , savella milnacipran it came out for fibromyalgia earlier this year but is used for depression in other countries first i heard it was available who knew ? then , i pick up the june issue of the psychiatric times i usually let this languish in a pile , still wrapped in plastic , for a few months , and then summarily discard it , unread , once it breaks my months rule if a throw away mag journal is more than months old , toss it i flip through it and discover only because of the advertisements several other new drugs i am unaware of where have i been that i 've not been clued in ? twitter fail ! so here are the other things fanapt iloperidone was approved , for treating schizophrenia vanda makes it you can get mg of effexor xr in a single tablet ! but it 's not effexor , it 's actually a generic brand called venlafaxine extended release yes , that is the actual brand name and it 's a tablet , not a capsule made be upstate pharma who knew ? there 's also a new brand of bupropion aka wellbutrin out there that puts an extended release formulation of the maximum dose mg all in one pill i heard about that one in an email from sanofi , about this new formulation called azplenzin though you have to order mg to get mg this one 's so new , a google search turns up only hits so , i'm just saying that the marketing works to get something new noticed the more important part is doing the research to determine if it is something that may help you or your patient
