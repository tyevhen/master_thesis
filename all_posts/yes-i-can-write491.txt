well , first thing you should know about me , just to get it out of the way , is that i'm unschooled in case you do n't know what that means and do n't feel like looking it up on wiki , i 'll tell you i teach myself yes , you did n't read that wrong of course , i do n't do it all alone i'm greatly assisted by numerous books , my parents when i ask them to , and most importantly , the world around me have n't you ever noticed that the things that seem to help you most in everyday life were not learned from a textbook ? life is rich there are so many things around you to discover why would i want to spend my time cramped up in a dull classroom looking out the window and longing for fresh air , for sunlight and swing sets and gardens , butterflies , forests , good novels , and interesting conversations all those things seem to be in short supply in your average high school , from all that i 've heard now that i 've gotten that out of the way , i will move on to tell you what the main purpose of this blog is i'm going to try very hard to write here every single day , detailing what things i did that i learned from whether it 's an interesting conversation with a friend on world politics , watching ants collect food , writing poetry , or anything else rewarding i can come up with this is mainly for my benefit and enjoyment , but you 're more than welcome to read along as well oh , just one more thing i highly reccomend that if you want to learn more about unschooling , you check out the marvelously inspiring book entitled the teenage liberation handbook how to quit school and get a real life and education by grace llewellyn enjoy you might also like learning advice from a learning life learning by doing education made real unschooling does n't mean there 's no hard work unschooling for adults linkwithin
