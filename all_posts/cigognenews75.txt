one clear example of dangerous feeling therapy is rebirthing driving patients way too deep way too soon reliving birth in the first weeks of therapy is defying evolution and leads to disaster it is arriving at deep levels of consciousness prematurely , skipping evolutionary steps and going through the motions of feelings without feeling it overwhelms the integrating capacity of the brain and there is flooding with far out ideas and bizarre notions we have seen pre psychotics who come to us and slide immediately down to some kind of birth trauma , way off a proper evolutionary voyage they are often deeply disturbed and start therapy with a severely damaged gating system they usually need help in gating so we may recommend medication for a time to control the upsurge of brainstem imprints the medication temporarily enhances gating so that a proper descent is now possible without that there is no integration and therefore no getting well even worse , when the doctor buys into the ideas and beliefs the patient is in danger suddenly , he merged with the almighty and in booga booga land , the doctor may nod agreement it is now a folie a deux if the therapist is mystical he may not find all this so strange , because those into mysticism never think that their beliefs are odd the problem with rebirthing is that it defies the fundamental evolutionary law never challenge evolution respect and follow it it will unerringly take you where you need to go , and only when you need to go i have seen the psychosis that this mistake engenders and we see the inherent danger in rebirthing because feelings are directed by someone else , the therapist , on his timetable and they are reached prematurely violating history s careful steps don t fool with history no one is smarter than that and no one has any idea what lies in the unconscious only the patient knows and it takes time for him to know his body knows but he needs a higher brain to inform him his body is screaming the message through its asthma and migraine and high blood pressure but it is a silent scream that only his system can feel it says , i hurt and he says i hurt but he does not know from what the decorticate message has gotten through but it lacks key information that cannot be imparted when we are too young and fragile to understand and accept it when the whole brain is forced into a state for which it is not ready , it galvanizes itself and moves up the evolutionary scale abruptly searching for a handle , some way to deal with the pressure when the ineffable feeling reaches the top level neocortex , it concocts ideas and beliefs that are basically psychotic at one with the cosmos and this is the precise mechanism in a true psychosis rather than induced where the gating system has been trashed by the continuous onslaught of compounded pain over the years until it collapses notice that the pressure of the feeling moves up the evolutionary scale searching for some way to turn off the pain it is a biologic rule for all therapists to understand crazy ideas are not single entities they are the result of a long evolutionary voyage that ultimately results in a belief when a therapist meddles with an idea , she is interfering with this evolutionary process and i include behavior in all this and the anti evolutionary behavior therapy how simplistic to strip behavior of its roots and then to keep on manipulating the effluvia
