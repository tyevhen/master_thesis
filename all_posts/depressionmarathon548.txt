surprise , surprise ! despite my vow to rest after boston and hopefully heal my left achilles tendonitis , i 've decided to run another marathon in fact , my next marathon will be in lacrosse , wisconsin , this sunday ! yep , i'm going to run another marathon just days after boston i actually decided , tentatively , to run this race soon after finishing boston after all the training leading up to boston , i just was n't satisfied with the run walk slog necessitated by boston 's heat i feel the need to have a better effort under my belt and that effort will hopefully take place this sunday , may th , beginning at am of course , this could totally backfire and be another slog to the finish line , but if that 's the case , so be it this is a new race i believe it is only in its third year it 's supposed to be flat and fast , and it does n't require an overnight stay in a hotel it will be a small affair , i believe , but i have convinced one of my friends she also ran boston to join me so i'm going with the intent to run and have fun i actually just came in from an easy run i was supposed to have a job interview today , but it got rescheduled i 'll go on thursday instead i was close to quitting my job yesterday , but i did n't i would n't have walked out immediately that 's not my style , nor do i think it is professional behavior i would have given them weeks notice i just want my time there to end , but i do n't want to shoot myself in the foot either since i do n't have another steady job lined up , i decided to keep my mouth shut and keep working it may be just a few more days before i can legitimately i e i have another position waiting serve notice i 'll try to be patient
