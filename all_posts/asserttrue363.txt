today i wrote a post for bigthink that i 've been meaning to write for weeks in august , several papers were published showing that a particular bacterium , fusobacterium nucleatum , is strongly implicated in development of colorectal cancer crc fusobacterium living in intestinal mucosa the latest research in no way invalidates the huge existing body of work showing strong almost certainly causal connections between crc and consumption of alcohol , sugar , meat , and or tobacco there are other risk factors as well , such as lack of physical activity by itself , obesity , and genetics see this paper and this one for more discussion , and by all means do further investigation on your own using google scholar genetic susceptibility , however , plays a role in no more than about of crc cases and even in those cases , it 's by no means certain that bad alleles constitute a death sentence the picture that 's emerging is a complex one in which intestinal dysbiosis triggered by for example poor eating habits leads to the differential accumulation of various species of gut bacteria bacteroides fragilis , fusobacterium nucleatum , and others that are implicated in colorectal cancer at some point over a period of years , apparently , fusobacterium gains entry to intestinal muscosal cells f nucleatum has aspects of an intracellular parasitic lifestyle once it has established residency , f nucleatum overproduces fada adhesin , a small protein containing amino acids , the exact sequence for which in fasta format is tr qib qib fusnu adhesion a os fusobacterium nucleatum gn fada pe sv mkkflllavlavsasafaatdaaslvgelqaldaeyqnlanqeearfneeraqadaarqa laqneqvynelsqraqrlqaeantrfyksqyqelaskyedalkkleaemeqqkavisdfe kiqalragn the letters here correspond to amino acids , using the standard one letter code system as presented here in three dimensions , the fada protein looks something like this your new worst enemy fada adhesin produced by fusobacterium nucleatum , the kickoff protein for colon cancer when this relatively small protein binds with normal e adhesin in a specific amino acid region , it activates catenin signaling , which in turn unleashes a cascade of cytokines cytokines il , il , il , il , plus tnf and an inflammatory cycle that leads straight to adenoma of the colon for the non paywalled research paper on this , go to http www plosone org article info adoi f fjournal pone read that paper and this one , if you can and decide for yourself how strong the case is for f nucleatum fada as a causative agent in colorectal cancer i think it 's pretty clear we 're looking at a smoking gun now the really interesting thing about f nucleatum is that it 's most commonly found not in the large intestine but in your mouth which brings up some interesting questions , right ? for example how does poor oral hygiene correlate with colorectal cancer ? little work has been done on that specific connection , but a huge amount of work has been and continues to be done on the substantial and increasingly obvious link between periodontal disease and cancer in general which i 'll probably blog about at some future time if the link between f nucleatum 's fada protein and crc proves to be as solid as it 's starting to look , it opens countless doors to new therapeutic approaches to crc treatment and prevention we need to know , for example , if specific probiotic treatments can greatly reduce the risk of precancerous adenomas by staving off dysbiosis we also urgently need to know if the outlook for early stage crc patients can be improved with aggressive use of antibiotics , including antibiotic induced near sterilization of the large intestine followed by fecal transplantation to restore the normal flora it hardly needs mentioning , but if it turns out to be true that crc is mainly a result of a single bacterium , perhaps a vaccine can be developed , either against fusobacterium or against the fada protein , or both i'm extremely encouraged by the recent research pinpointing fada as the likely culprit in crc obviously , much work remains to be done but we have an exciting new insight into this particular type of carcinogenesis the treatment options that come out of it may well lead to other cures some of us here i'm speaking with my microbiologist 's hat on i have an advanced degree in the subject have long suspected that microbes play a role in fostering and preventing various cancers when i was in graduate school , you could count the number of microbially caused neoplasms on your thumbs now you have to use most fingers of both hands who knows what the full truth may yet turn out to be ? exciting times if you enjoyed this post , or the corresponding one at bigthink , do me a favor tweet it or share it in some fashion this is knowledge that deserves to get out who knows ? it may save a life
