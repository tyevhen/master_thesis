for many years we have measured the vital signs of patients before and after each session and over the long term our results show a normalization after one year of the therapy when we took the final measurements of course , when we measure vital signs we are measuring vital functions those functions that keep us alive and allow us to survive when any of them exceed normal limits we are in trouble whether too low a blood pressure or too high a heart rate or a continual body temp far over normal range , the minute we are dislocated one way high or the other low the body is telling us that something is wrong and it tells us in what way is something wrong , and sometimes even why , if we know how to read the signs over the years when these signs are excessive we can almost be sure that disease will occur early in life , followed by life threatening illness later in life it is ineluctable these vital signs mean vitality and they reflect our imprints quite accurately they also reflect what nervous system is in charge and is dominant we know , for example , that many vital functions are either controlled by one of two nervous systems mediated by the hypothalamus i thought for some time that the parasympathetic , that of rest , repair and repose , controlled body temp but it may be that the direction of the dislocation depends on two different nervous systems thus , high is controlled by the sympathetic , the galvanizing , mobilizing , alerting system , while a swing to the low end is controlled by the parasympathetic this may also be true of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure thus , the direction tells us the kind of imprint we are dealing with today i heard from an epileptic , a breech birth , suffocating and strangling on the cord who had to conserve oxygen and energy to survive his modus operandi was to hold back , not use energy his imprint was parasympathetic , something that will dog him for a lifetime and determine his interests writing , his non interests exercising , whom he marries the aggressive one and how he will treat his children passively or with indifference and that is not the half of it now why all this ? because the very first life saving effort becomes imprinted and remains as a guide for future behavior what saved her life at the start will go on being utilized despite any reality to the contrary personality is formed out of this matrix and a certain biologic state of course , later experience helps shape it all , as well but that first imprint is vital , in every sense of the word when patients come in for a session and we do measurements , we already have an idea of where we have to go one of my depressives came in consistently with a very low body temp of to she was mired in hopelessnessand that low a measurement usually means first line pain is involved as our session went on almost hours each time , she started to normalize that was important because a whole lifetime was wrapped around the vital functions it wasn t just the body temp that normalized but a whole host of biologic responses and personality features later on , she smiled , had energy and felt up she could go seek a job , something she could not do previously and of course , she never had enough money to buy proper food because she could not hold a job a previous therapy informed her that hers was a loser trip that didn t help much except to put a label on her behavior as she went on reliving the prebirth and birth traumas , a mother smoking and taking tranquilizers , suppressing her whole system , which was also imprinted , her body temp came up and stayed up to degrees when a patient comes in with a very rapid heart rate and a brainwave signature of beta very fast our first job is to bring him into the feeling primal zone if we do not do that he remains above the primal zone he will not feel and certainly not integrate when the patient is too low the same law operates we can only feel in the primal zone we need to adjust medications to allow that to happen we cannot and must not cajole a patient into trying to feel and often the fast ones are also the tryers i believe that the parasympath operates on the low end of all vital signs we can go to different doctors and be treated for a heart rate that is unsteady , another doctor for high blood pressure , and yet another for lack of energy but the leader who sets the tone is the imprint unless we recognize this we will be bifurcated in our efforts and miss the essential one key thing we want to know after each session is was there integration ? sometimes there is , after weeks of feeling one key feeling but often there is a dredge effect the patient feeling one feeling which resonates with a connected deeper feeling hoplessness and helplessness we know here that there is more to come it may be that the patient will need tranquilizers temporarily to get over the hump we need not be afraid of this since it is not an end in our therapy but a means it is not the therapy , as is the case in so much psychiatry , but something to use for a bit of time we want patients off drugs , not on them while on them there is a superficial and artificial state drugs nearly always hold back feelings and aid defenses that is not the business we are in quite the opposite , we want feelings to come up but in ordered , measured ways primal therapy will get you there if you let it if you stay with it the direction is nearly always right i often say , it is not a miracle but it is miraculous in the same way that we may increase sexual drive in males with testosterone injections , it may well be that we can inject love into people , or at least inject a hormone that encourages it give people a shot of love , so to speak this shot may help us bond with partners , allow us to feel close to others , and to empathize with their feelings and pain , at least for a time someone can swear she is full of love , only to find herself very low in the essential hormone of love oxytocin it is actually good news that less love has a physical base , for there may be something we can do chemically to alter that state , and there is certainly something we can do psychologically to change it , as well at some time in the future , we may be able to determine what proper love from a parent to a child is through the measurements of various hormones bonding is a strong emotional attachment that helps us want to be with one another , help and protect each other and touch and become sexual with one another high levels of oxytocin encourage and strengthen bonding because early trauma and lack of love affect the output of this hormone , the ability to relate to others and have good sex later in life may be determined even before birth and just after we learn how to bond emotionally in adulthood through early bonding in childhood , as simplistic as that sounds attachment is pretty well set in our childhood it is not something we learn it cannot be taught ! and it certainly cannot be taught in later life it is something we feel something organic and physiologic , something biochemical those who did not bond very early on with their parents may well be condemned to a lifetime of broken , fragile , tenuous relationships it may be in large part due to deficits in the hormonal wherewithal such as oxytocin they key here is early on that bonding takes place so early in our lives that later in life it is almost impossible to know where the problem in bonding may come from so we give advice to a patient to try this and that when her whole physiology is crying out from the pain of the lack of early attachment
