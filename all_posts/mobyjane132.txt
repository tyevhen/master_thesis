hi a b ! i enjoyed your last two blog posts thanks ! reading the myths of happiness your reflection on suffering was interesting helpful in a chat room i frequent , one of the questions asked was , why are there so many bad things in life ? the woman who posted the questions wondered about events like the shootings at sandy hook , other crimes , war , poverty your books other writings , a b , have shaped my approach to things we can view life its vast array of experiences as an obstacle , or an enemy , or we can open the possibility that whatever is in front of us is meant to be , even if we did n't never would have asked for it ! there is so much more going on in life than our thoughts about it ! this is what i wrote to the questioner thanks , a b , for reading if you have time ! you 're asking the big questions , you are getting a lot of wonderful responses that are speaking to truth , if not providing concrete answers there is something to be said for surrender accepting that we do n't have all the answers never will life is largely a mystery that ca n't be contained by our minds within our concepts thoughts about it but while we will never have all the answers tied up with a bow , there are pointers ! a common theme you see over over on this thread is the redemptive nature of adversity repeatedly , we see that without losses , hardships , suffering , the better angels of our human nature would not have been revealed , much less developed we ca n't help but conclude that ultimately , suffering , the situation we would never ask for , serves a purpose in our evolution as humans i like this quote from eckhart tolle even within the seemingly most unacceptable painful situation is concealed a deeper good , within every disaster is contained the seed of grace dear g , thank you for your reflections we are each a part of each other 's solution to adversity a chance word , a thoughtful remark , a hand extended toward you in a gesture of understanding it all helps and without each other , nothing helps and , of course , it 's always easy to be philosophical about adversity once we have overcome it the hard is , while we are in the throes of suffering adversity , that we keep our wits about us , and keep thinking about some bit of philosophical reminder to bouy us up , and remember to reach out to others in some small way a b curtiss
