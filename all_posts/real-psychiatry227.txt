from understanding and predicting suicidality using a combined genomic and clinical risk assessment approach reference with permission one of the most interesting aspects of biological psychiatry is the attempt to characterize complex biological systems it may not have been apparent but complex biological systems factored in a recent post about bronchitis lungs are certainly complex with two different blood supplies and complicated immunology , but the lungs are not thinking organs they do n't come up with any secondary concepts that need to be analyzed as possible derivatives of the biological substrate and even then , basic syndromes that we all learned about in medical school and in clinical rotations , defy more useful classifications i have previously posted on endophenotypes and their usefulness in the treatment of asthma and only recently noted that they have proliferated to include an obese endophenotype and how that affects response to therapy diagnostic and treatment approaches to asthma and bronchitis are necessarily crude , largely because the biological complexity in these processes is not fully appreciated and addressed the brain is certainly the most complex organ in the body cellular arrays in the brain produce a stream of consciousness , robust unconscious processing , unique conscious states , and all forms of emotional , social and intellectual constructs that can be observed , monitored , and changed that brings me to a paper from molecular psychiatry on possible biomarkers for suicide not just any paper at this point it is the most downloaded paper from the top ranked psychiatry journal in the world molecular psychiatry has an impact factor of and that is the highest impact factor of all psychiatry journals in part that is probably driven by how absurdly expensive that similar journals like biological psychiatry are or other barriers to purchase like needing to be a member of the sponsoring society this is a public access journal that uses creative commons licenses for their content the authors in this case have provided a pages article and pages in supplemental information the idea of a biomarker for suicide is very attractive to psychiatrists , because assessing suicide risk is a big part of what we do current clinical guidelines suggest that we need to make that assessment at every patient visit the actual prediction of suicide is difficult due to the fact that mental states change over time and people may not be able to communicate their true level of risk i have had people tell me in retrospect that they lied about their degree of suicidal thinking and level of control when i asked them about it i have had acute care colleagues tell me that they were weary of having to guess about whether a person was going to try to kill themselves or not many times a day the assessment is further complicated by a lack of acceptable acute care options that may further hinder complete self disclosure a biomarker would potentially be beneficial i qualify that by the fact that the dexamethasone suppression test was once considered a biomarker of suicide , but these days it is rarely done and certainly not as part of a suicide assessment a study by coryell , et al notes that the dst was not able to differentiate patients who died from suicide or cardiovascular disease when long term mortality was determined by the national death index those authors suggest it may be useful as a predictor of suicide only in patients with depression in this article the authors take a look at possible biomarkers in blood that could predict both suicide and some associated markers like risk of hospitalization there is a lot going on in this paper all the research participants were men they studied four different patient cohorts including patients followed longitudinally this group was called the discovery cohort because markers were discovered based on patients who had a switch from a no suicide state to a high suicide state defined as a score of on the hamd question about suicide deceased patients who committed suicide were used to validate the initial markers two psychiatric cohorts of and to look at prediction of suicidal ideation and hospitalization with the chosen tests the flow of these experiments in depicted in the graphic at the top of this post from the original paper in the diagram , the designations ap absent present and de differential expression are techniques to capturing genes that are turning of and turning on and off and gradual changes in gene expression the respective genes in this analysis are color coded based on those properties the convergent functional genomic cfg approach is depicted in the box candidate genes are ranked in the triangles according to cfg score the cfg score was the sum of various weighted factors including evidence of human brain expression , evidence of human peripheral presence , human genetic evidence and linkage with weighted scores in the cfg box using their discovery and validation sequence the authors were able to pare down the total number of genes down from to to and ultimately to genes the supplementary information provides the validation of biomarkers and a table that looks at each gene and prior human genetic evidence , prior evidence of brain expression and prior human evidence of peripheral expression the authors discussion of the biological relevance of their findings was interesting they did pathway analysis looking at ingenuity , kegg , and genego databases of these only the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg is publicly available without a subscription fee it is very useful to know about kegg because of the relevance of pathway analysis in the psychiatric literature as an example , i have been teaching about the mtor pathway discussed in this article in my neurobiology of addiction lectures for the past years this article is very interesting and can be read at several levels it is premature to consider it definitive at this point and based on this paper and the work of the associated lab these authors are working on additional validation strategies if they are correct , suicidality may be captured in time as a polygenic event based on a combination of genes that are turned off and on and others that gradually change i titled this post as patentable genes because the only conflict of interest cited is the lead author is listed as an inventor on a patent application being filed by indiana university for trainees and early career psychiatrists a familiarity with this technology and its potential uses and limitations would be one of the reading goals and including molecular psychiatry and its sister journal from the same group translational psychiatry is probably a good idea both are potentially good sources of neuroscientific information in psychiatry and if popularity is any indication fill a niche in the field some of the tools that they developed along the way are useful to think about from a clinical perspective , the thought that the cfi s scale was particularly interesting because it is a point binary scale that looks at factors excluding suicidal ideation that they determined to be important the factors are also classified as to whether they represent increased reasons ir or decreased barriers db to suicide the emphasis on suicide as a discrete syndrome independent of diagnosis is a research strategy that has been called for recently based on the need to come up with better ways to diagnose and treat the problem in a clinical setting i think that clinicians are still frequently surprised by suicide attempts and suicides being able to determine if a patient is in a high risk state based on a blood test independent of their clinical presentation and statements would be useful both in terms of the test but also the associated dialogue what i really like about this paper is that it is an attempt to deal with a common psychiatric problem at the appropriate level of complexity clinical trials do exactly the opposite as an example , clinical trials in psychiatry will look at heterogeneous groups of patients pulled together under a vague diagnostic category there may be rating scales or global ratings just because the rating scales do n't seem to have much discriminatory power in the end , the entire study is generally collapsed for a very simple statistical analysis getting to those final variables and what has been ignored in the process is always the critical question i think it is trendy these days to commiserate about the fact that there are inconclusive , weak and non reproducible results from the standard clinical trials technology i do n't know why anyone would expect a different result if anything this paper illustrates that a lot of biological information can be considered and analyzed the popularity of this paper leaves me hopeful that this is a positive trend for
