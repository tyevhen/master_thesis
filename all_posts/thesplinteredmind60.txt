friday entry with november winding quickly to a close , i have been reflecting on how well i have done using lift to track my progress with nanowrimo given that i have freelance writing work and another book project that takes my time on top of being a single dad , i was asking a lot of myself to also work on nanowrimo yet , i wanted to train myself to work daily on my fiction in the past i have wasted so much energy spinning in place and being distracted that i wanted an incentive to train myself for a higher level of functioning after all , only by steadily moving forward can i make progress besides , it 's not as if success will mean i 'll have more time on my hands i need to learn how to write both types of books simultaneously i started the month off with a bang , and have really been racing along this past week , but there was a giant block in the middle of the month where i wrote nothing on my project at all not even words a day it is possible that i forgot to record some days , but i cannot deny that i need more work making fiction writing a daily event what 's wonderful about lift is that it can show me stats by week and month or as the traditional calendar with the days i completed filled in for me i 've also been interacting with others who joined the challenge to write such a meager amount of words per day it has been encouraging giving props and getting them as long as i remember to log in and update my progress , lift is a great , visual method of tracking progress perfect for my adhd since i have adhd , i am likely to get sidetracked from time to time lift helps me stay on track i enjoy using it as opposed to having dedicated calendars up on a wall where i cross off the days i lie keeping my calendar of progress in my pocket , but more importantly , this whole process is showing me how low a priority i place on my fiction writing i truly do have difficulty justifying time to write fiction my goal for the rest of the month is to work on my middle grade novel every day , no matter how busy i am it is my hope that with practice i will come to enjoy working on my fiction as opposed to reading news or spending time online time is precious and i 'd rather fill in the little bits of spare time i have here and there with something that brings me joy as opposed to something that merely entertains d
