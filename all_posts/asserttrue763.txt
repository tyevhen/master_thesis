at the recent aiim show in philadelphia , there was a session called stump the consultant in which audience members got to put their toughest questions to a panel of three experts jesse wilkins of access sciences , lisa welchman of welchmanpierpoint , and my esteemed colleague alan pelz sharpe of cms watch there were approximately questions from audience members a very high rate of participation one of the questions was quite interesting , and it drew an interesting response the question came from someone working for an organization with two sizable constituencies of highly educated domain experts i'm being a bit vague , deliberately the organization 's content management infrastructure , the questioner said , was practically nonexistent , with many users still accessing content via very old fashioned tools there 's an urgent need to overhaul the system and put some semblance of a real ecm solution in place but there are two groups of users to satisfy senior domain specialists older workers who are comfortable with the old fashioned tools and do n't want to change and younger workers with a strong preference for modern , browser based apps the question is , which group do you try to please ? which group can you least afford to alienate ? if you cater to the younger group , you risk alienating your most senior people talented , expensive , hard to replace experts people you do n't want to lose to the competition people with great political capital in the organization , who can perhaps defeat an it initiative by pushing back hard on the other hand , if you cater to the older group , you risk alienating the younger workers and you risk keeping obsolete systems in place far longer than you should , making future replacement that much more difficult while also impeding business objectives , etc lisa welchman gave what i thought was a poignant and insightful answer i 'll try to paraphrase she said , in essence , that if you 're wise , you 'll put a new system in place that serves the needs of all , but serves the wants of the younger generation of workers and yes , you do this even though you know it will bring pushback from the more senior workers lisa explained in a much more articulate way than i can manage here that older workers are less likely to quit their jobs than younger workers they may grouse and grumble over a new system , but most will stay in their jobs rather than leave younger workers , on the other hand , are more mobile and more inclined to go off on their own and find another job or start a company when conditions become frustrating the older workers will retire you 'll eventually lose them anyway , no matter what system you put in place or do n't put in place but if you fail to attract and nurture a talented , motivated corps of younger workers , the future of the company is put at risk so you do the right thing for the business you put in a new system one that will hopefully meet your current and future business needs while also satisfying as many users as possible and if you have to choose between satisfying senior personnel versus generation next , again you do the right thing for the business you go with generation next lisa 's answer resonated with me it seemed to resonate , also , with the audience of or so people from my seat near the front of the room , i turned around and surveyed the tableau of faces the majority of people looked to be over the age of everyone seemed to get it everybody seemed to understand that a company 's best investment is not in its it , but in its people and not just in its older , more experienced workers , but in its older workers to be one thing you ca n't do is cater to workers who want to cling to the ways of the past , no matter how senior or how influential they may be as it turns out , i was only able to attend one session at this year 's aiim expo because i was working the cms watch booth the rest of the time i'm glad it was this one
