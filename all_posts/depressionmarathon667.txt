well , i made a decision yesterday , after more research and negotiating , i accepted the position at the nursing home here in town it was a tough decision , but after talking with the physical therapist i'm going to be replacing , i had enough information to make it i felt relief after accepting the position , and that tells me i likely made the right decision the reality is , even if it turns out to be the wrong decision , it 's only temporary reminding myself of that was helpful yesterday life is temporary that 's why i try to live it one day at a time the other big accomplishment of yesterday was resigning my current position i was really nervous about doing that , as i had n't been in the office for more than one month i did n't know what to expect coming back from medical leave in order to resign could have been viewed negatively thankfully , it was n't when i arrived at the office , my boss and co workers were really happy to see me my boss , once i told her i needed to resign , was incredibly supportive we ended up talking for at least minutes it was all good she understood why i needed to resign she was supportive of my decision she wanted to leave things open so that i could be re hired in the future if the stress level of that position decreases , i would happily go back and it 's really great to know she respects me and my skills enough that she would have me like i said , it was all good i'm relieved to have made my decision i had to say a lot of prayers and ask god for a lot of guidance in the days prior to yesterday i think that helped i should try that more often ! while i'm sad to be leaving home health care , i'm looking forward to learning some new skills in my new position life is full of change by not dwelling in the past nor worrying about the future , i can handle the changes and move forward daily i did a lot of moving yesterday today , i rest
