yes , sometimes i am amazed that it has been forty years in the making i have learned a lot about living with kennedy 's disease over these last four decades a young man stumbled upon my blog the other day and wrote me he is years old and just diagnosed with kennedy 's disease he wrote , i don t really know what to expect or even how to deal with things can you recommend to me anything as far as exercising or vitamin supplements or really anything i can do to try to remain my best possible my neurologist will only see me every months and really hasn t told me much other then i need to see a genetic counselor any recommendations you may have will be appreciated i responded exercise is important do n't overdue , however there is something called the rule exercise to of your capability this will keep your good muscles and motor neurons strong and active without doing damage what your weight as the condition progresses , it becomes more difficult to stay mobile keeping your weight down makes it easier to walk and sustain a good level of activity exercise and a good diet will go a long way in staying healthy inactivity and certain foods contribute to certain health conditions since we are less active , we do n't burn as many calories and are more susceptible to certain conditions safety first when you are young , it should n't be too much of an issue , but i did a lot of damage in the early years because i did n't know when to back off keep a positive mental attitude life does n't end with kd it just changes if there is something positive about kd , it is the slow progression of the condition you should n't observe too many problems in the early years seek out support from those of us living with kd the kda , the kda forum , facebook , etc always remember you are not alone most importantly , kd does not define who you are and what you are capable of doing observe , adjust and stay active you might not physically be able to accomplish something the way you used to do it , but it can still be done or you can ask someone to do it for you what i thought of later dr grunseich at the nih recommended the following those of us living with kennedy s disease should avoid high doses of b because it worsens the neuropathy systems the normal dosage in a multi vitamin should be fine he also said that we should consider taking additional supplements of b because it is good for the nervous system swallow your pride it is okay to ask for help when you need it others will understand and look forward to helping the mda clinics are beneficial for those of us living with progressive conditions there are clinics in most major cities in the u s and canada i am certain there are similar organizations in other countries join one of these groups they provide excellent support and give you access to certain mobility aids through their loan locker at some point when mobility has become an issue , consider taking dutasteride i feel it has helped me maintain my strength
