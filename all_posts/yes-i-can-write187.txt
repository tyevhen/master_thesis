i have a longstanding love affair with food as horribly cliche as that sounds , it 's pretty true ! to me , food is something fascinating and fun and exciting i love trying new things , looking at food and eating in new ways , and playing with eating different diets and when i say diet , i mean it in the lets try a new way of eating way , not the i'm trying to lose weight way i adore fresh foods i was delighted when my mother brought home organic snap peas on saturday , that she picked from the vines herself ! , healthy and organic stuff , food from different cultures i tend to go in cycles in terms of cooking more and eating better , versus cooking less and eating worse i start to feel not so great , get tired of the boring stuff i 've been eating , and realize that i need to cook more i start cooking a lot more , and feeling better and more excited about food again , before i start slowly slacking off i'm currently in the stage of realizing the food i 've been eating is n't making me feel so good , so starting to cook again ! yesterday i spent the afternoon in the sun , watching my sister march in a parade with one of her highland bands the food that was served there was your usual hot dogs and hamburgers , so i ate a couple veggie soy burgers there , despite the fact that those are definitely not on my list of foods that makes me feel good , or even on a list of foods i particularly like i was hungry , okay ? ! but when i got home , i decided that i wanted to eat something healthy , and also something grain free so i fried an egg seasoned with herbs in coconut oil , then heaped steamed kale and baby garlic on top of it a bit of salt sprinkled on top , and voila ! healthy , grain free , and not too bad on the taste buds since i was still hungry after that , instead of turning to my usual snacks of grain based foods , i ate a bunch of the aforementioned snap peas then baked some carrots with coconut oil and a bit of brown sugar vegetables for the win ! what we eat has a huge impact on our overall health and well being it affects how much we get sick and how long it takes to get better it affects our moods and emotional well being how much energy we have and how well we sleep what we put into our bodies affects everything and for different people , different ways of eating are needed ! which is why i like playing with my diet i love seeing what changes i see in myself from changing what i eat my newest food experiment is the no grains thing i 've been reading interesting stuff about grains , and how they probably should n't be such a dietary staple for so many people i want to go entirely grain free for a week once smug passes i'm way too busy until then ! , which should be interesting ! other ways of eating i want to try at some point are a sugar free diet processed sugar , not foods with natural sugar , a dairy free diet , a paleo diet minus the meat , and eating raw food more regularly maybe eating entirely raw one day a week ? the possibilities are virtually endless , and when food is looked at as something interactive and interesting , it 's also genuinely fun ! peace , idzie p s sorry i 've been a bit neglectful of this blog , and that this post might be not so hot ! life has been busy , and inspiration for blog posts has been virtually non existent hopefully that will change soon !
