from last year as the new style of this blog has probably led you to believe , i have fall on the brain as recently as four days ago it was damn hot like , really hot the news told me that with the humidity it felt like nearly degrees celsius , which translates to about degrees fahrenheit ! but the last couple of days things have cooled down a lot , it 's become slightly damp instead of humid , the wind has been blowing loudly through the trees , and i 've been bundled up in warm sweaters , delighting in having everyone finally agree to opening all the windows in the summertime my family always wants all the windows closed and the air on , even though i 'd much rather have real air in the house , which means open windows ! it 's really starting to feel like fall and i love fall the smell , taste , and feel of it is singularly unique it 's an amazing season ! yet , at the same time , fall is almost without fail a really emotional time for me melancholy and happiness course through my system depending on the day and in some cases , the hour , since fall always catches me by surprise is summer really over already ? i 'd swear it was spring just a couple of weeks ago ! it reminds me of the passage of time something that i tend to find pretty terrifying , since there never seems to be enough of it , while heralding a movement toward slowing things down , moving toward the hibernation of winter fall feels deeply spiritual to me , and usually involves a lot of deep thinking and questioning , a lot of soul searching and wondering of what comes next and also , of course , fall to me means samhain and dark windy nights , beautiful yellow , orange , red , and brown leaves falling and swirling through the air , to be jumped on when they land on the ground , making an incredibly satisfying crunching sound fall is candles and year end because fall feels more like the end of the year to me than january campfires , warm sweaters and knit blankets and sharp air i miss summer already , but i love fall every bit as much as summer this month i 'll be away so much i 'll probably miss seeing the beginnings of the mass change of leaf colour here , though since i 'll be away in both the toronto area and vermont , i 'll certainly see the changes there last year at not back to school camp in vermont i marveled at the changes i could see every day but , though i'm greatly looking forward to nbtsc , the next trip i'm going on is to the toronto unschooling conference ! and dare i admit it ? , i still have n't written more than a snippet of the speech i'm supposed to be presenting there this threatens to send me spiraling , once again , into extreme stress and worry but , that has not happened yet , so i 'll just have to in a calm and collected manner write it in the next few days i certainly have lots to say on the subject of unschooling , it 's just a matter of getting it all down on paper in a somewhat organized fashion ! wish me luck and forgive me for such a disjointed and generally pointless post i simply wanted to touch base with my lovely readers , let you know what my currently cold addled brain is thinking about , and that i'm still alive i might even be blogging about the northeast unschooling conference which was terrific ! ! in the next few days or , depending on how this cold progresses , i might just be curled up on the couch watching season of buffy the vampire slayer under a fuzzy blanket while listening to the leaves rustle outside the open window i guess time will tell oh , and if you have any thoughts on the new blog layout , please share them in the comments ! you might also like fall days and new writing against the current talk from the toronto unschooling this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and unschooling gatherings linkwithin
