no crises , no depths , no chemical aberrations to report no doubt my readers will quickly become bored with my newfound wellness , though i am delighted with it to not be depressed is the greatest blessing i can receive in this life sure , i love my wife and daughters and friends but when depressed i can feel none of that love , neither for me nor for them i feel like an insignificant fly speck or worse , a tiny curse in the world , or so my chemicals would convince me until whipped into shape by modern psychopharmacology my poem , when i am an old man in chimaera was a take off on when i am an old woman i shall wear purple it s worth a peek for a laugh , though i do wax a little surrealistic at the end which reminds me of some paintings i saw yesterday , categorized as hyperrealistic surrealism and damn , it fit ! today i attended my mushroom identification course , per usual , except my memory for recalling famoptosis cajanderi and countless other strange monikers is much improved with the depression at bay it is amazing how much my mind improves when free from a depression , just amazing i can think of many delightful , forgotten grudges from the past , not to mention all the new slights i look forward to next week we ll begin our field work with fungi , thank goodness , as i am so tired of the classroom experience the rains have come so the mushrooms will follow i can t wait to be foraging for fungi in the forest that line reminds me of another poem that no one has deigned to publish , a poem in a light hearted vein i labor to be reader friendly i try to write for readers , not poets but this is not a new poem i am holding to my vow to eschew poetry salad burial i made it on a saturday with romaine and green leaf lettuce , stems crisp and firm , fresh boiled eggs in slices , the rose white flesh of radishes , mushrooms cut kidney style , spinach with that suede feel and chicken strips grilled in garlic oil if it had been eaten at the party or i hadn t dressed it for convenience i would n't be standing here , a week later afraid to open the blue ironware pot where hansel and gretel are lost in the furry forest of the fungal underworld , where spice of meat and greens are married to the ghoulish sponge of miss havisham s spider riddled wedding cake holding my nose i look away and blindly bag the mutant gallimaufry , dropping it in the trash , but as i do i wonder what alien stews must be composting in my neighbors cans see how the imagination festers ? did you like the phrase , mutant gallimaufry ? i was proud of that so what does the immediate future look like for me if i stay euthymic ? my main goals are to wrap up all my art from the past , to record all the songs i ve ever written , to revise or complete all the prose and poetry else toss all i 've written , and to improve my website so that my music can be downloaded i also aim to complete the workbook , a graceful farewell , so that in the event of my own death things will go smoothly so many die unprepared ! i don t want my brothers fighting over my stratocaster and my martin guitars , for instance as for a literary executor , it is not clear at this point whether one will be needed unless my writings obtain a higher visibility right now this blog is the best thing i got going , because more people read it than all my poetry buried in all those publications for the semi elite strange , isn t it ? journaling gets me more readers than composition other goals ? i want to paint our living room and purchase better furniture and use our space more elegantly our unit has two rooms , upstairs and downstairs upstairs holds the bedroom , tv and closets downstairs kathleen and i each have our own office in opposite corners from which we sometimes e mail each other in lieu of talking our dual schmegg zones eat up all the available space we ca n't even have guests over for dinner , having no table to speak of the rain is here so is my birthday , october , for which kathleen has purchased me a guided abalone dive i can t wait ! that s what i asked for when she asked me what i wanted can you imagine me just two and half weeks ago asking for anything at all ? nope neither can i what a different when the light is turned on like that old film star , the only presents i now accept are those i can eat , read , wear , listen to , or spend no knick knacks for those with budget constraints a simple genuflection to my blog photo will do i do also kinda want a cat hear that , laurel ? we are not ready for a new dog yet kilobunnies , ce
