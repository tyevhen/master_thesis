clients often come to psychotherapy when they feel they have lost a vital part of themselves it 's not unusual for people to come into psychotherapy because they feel that they have lost a certain zest for life and they want to try to recapture a vital part of themselves that they feel they have lost from an earlier time in their lives while psychotherapy and clinical hypnosis ca n't provide the fountain of youth , it can help you to try to remember and revive a certain aliveness and authenticity that you might have felt at an earlier time more than just a feeling of nostalgia or the pain of a midlife crisis , when we look back to an earlier time , we might recognize parts of ourselves that we might want to have come alive again in our current lives for instance , if we feel that we have become too complacent or we 're stuck in a rut , we might want to recapture a part of ourselves from an earlier time that was more curious , daring , and adventurous and , now , with the benefit of having had more life experience and , hopefully , better judgment , we can recapture those energized parts of ourselves to explore new ideas and expand our sense of ourselves it might be that those parts of yourself might have been dormant for a while but , often , through clinical hypnosis , you can re experience a particular phase of your life and see what you might want from that time and how you can benefit from recapturing and reviving that part of yourself of course , there are no guarantees in any treatment but the following vignette , which is a composite of several cases , is an example of what i'm talking about scott when scott started psychotherapy , he was in his late s , divorced , and feeling like he was just living from one day to the next he was successful in his career , but he had lost his enthusiasm for his field long ago he was dating a couple of women casually , but he did n't have anyone that he felt strongly about in fact , scott did n't feel strongly or passionate about anything , and this was a big part of his problem he felt like he was just existing he did n't feel any highs or lows anymore his emotional world felt flat but , according to scott , it was n't always that way there was a time when he was more actively involved in community affairs , he volunteered with several organizations , he was in love , and felt more involved and alive in his world scott said he had not felt alive and passionate about his life in at least years he yearned to feel energized again the way he used to feel when we discussed when was the last time that he felt passionate about his life , he talked about a time when he was involved in a local community project that was very important to him , he was in a relationship with a woman that he really loved , and he felt invigorated by his world , curious , and open to new experiences what ever happened to that person ? he asked although clinical hypnosis tends to be faster and go deeper than regular talk therapy , there was nothing magical or very quick about scott 's hypnotherapy treatment there were many underlining issues that had to be dealt with before scott started to feel better however , through clinical hypnosis , scott was able re experience that earlier phase in his life and remember not just in a factual way but to actually have a felt sense of what it was like for him when he was happier and more fulfilled in his life over time , he was also able to recapture and revive that part of himself in his current life although his hypnotherapy treatment was not a quick fix , he began opening up and allowing himself to experience life more fully again he left his current field and went into the field that he wanted to be in years ago it was a dream that he had let go of because he felt like he was being more practical what he did n't realize is that , over time , he had become closed off and his life had narrowed this had a deadening effect on him mentally , emotionally , and physically soon after he entered into his new field , he felt that his life was now more aligned with his personal values he also met a woman that he really cared about as the years go by , it 's easy to overlook how some of the compromises that we make , often out of necessity , can affect our lives after a while , if we 're not careful , we might find that our world has become a lot smaller and we are less and less satisfied with our lives sometimes , it 's only after we have been in a rut for a while that we realize that life is n't as meaningful as it used to be we might look back at a happier time and yearn for those earlier years often , through clinical hypnosis , you can recapture the felt sense of the more energized parts of yourself that are dormant now and reintegrate them to lead a more fulfilling life i am a psychotherapist and hypnotherapist in nyc to find out more about clinical hypnosis , visit the asch website http www asch net to more about me , visit my website http www josephine ferraro com to set up a consultation , call me at
