one method i use to battle my anxiety and depression is through mindfulness a lot of people recommend it and although it is beneficial , i do n't think it can fully cure you from your struggles mindfulness is about taking time out of your day to focus on yourself and to block the world out it provides an escape and a focus on your mental health i find on an everyday basis i can get stressed and caught up in the happenings around me and sometimes taking time away from that is just what i need and you can do it too ! all you need to do is find somewhere you feel calm and relaxed , such as the garden or your bedroom and find somewhere comfortable to lay or sit some people prefer to sit in silence , but i prefer to find some meditation or sleeping music on youtube which helps to calm me i tend to spend around minutes with my eyes closed , focusing on my breathing and the muscles in my body i focus on my breathing through taking a shorter breath in than the breath i exhale or i use number counting to count the seconds of my breath with my body , i tend to start at the top of my head and imagine every muscle relaxing until i get to the tip of my toes if i feel my mind wondering , i try to bring it back by focusing on my breathing it may be difficult at first , but once you get it , you can feel completely refreshed , calm and sometimes even quite light ! lots of people recommend it and i personally think it 's something that is helpful to all amy xx
