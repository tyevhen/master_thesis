someone with significant depression told me today that they could n't relate to my blog because i was doing too well that made me sad i'm still sad about it and i must confess , it is something i 've worried about recently what do i do ? i started this blog to support people with depression and to educate others about depression when i started this blog i was n't doing all that well i was occasionally well , but my depression was ever present as the years passed , the balance shifted now i'm well more often than not my episodes into the black hole continue , but they are shorter lived and less frequent make no mistake , i'm thrilled about that it 's what i wanted it 's what i worked hard to achieve and while i'm certain i can still use this blog to educate , can i offer support when those in the black hole ca n't relate ? i'm sad that those i intend to assist cannot relate to my story , but i understand i remember being there i know the only books about depression i ever read are the ones that tell it like it is the ones that explore the depths , describe their experiences within the black hole , and detail the darkness i get it it makes me sad that some ca n't draw inspiration from where i'm at now , but i totally get it those of you who 've been around awhile know i 've explored , described and detailed those dark experiences in this blog , but many of those posts are long in the past one would have to search to find them , but they are here my hope is writing about how i'm doing now , which is well more often than not , would inspire and or give hope to some sufferers but again , i understand how it may have the opposite effect as well i 've been there ! i'm not sure what to do about this recently , i contemplated discontinuing my blog for this very reason , but i got a lot of feedback to keep going i want to help i want to be a safe haven for fellow sufferers of this illness i'm sad this person is n't reading , but i'm not sure there 's anything i can do realistically , i know i ca n't be everything for everyone realistically , this blog helps me as much or more than it helps you i do n't think it 's a coincidence that three years after starting here , i'm doing very well i thought again today about discontinuing my writing , but i'm going to continue many of you have told me i'm making a difference , and i appreciate that feedback thank you i hope i can continue to provide something for someone
