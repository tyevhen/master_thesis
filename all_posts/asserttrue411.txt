earlier , i gave evidence for a surprising relationship between the amount of g c guanine plus cytosine in dna and the amount of purine loading on the message strand in coding regions the fact that message strands are often purine rich is not new , of course it 's called szybalski 's rule what 's new and unexpected is that the amount of g c in the genome lets you predict the amount of purine loading also , szybalski 's rule is not always right genome a t content versus message strand purine content a g for bacterial genera chargaff 's second parity rule predicts a horizontal line at y szybalski 's rule says that all points should lie at or above surprisingly , as a t approaches , a t approaches the golden ratio when you look at coding regions from many different bacterial species , you find that if a species has dna with a g c content below about , it tends to have more purines than pyrimidines on the message strand thus purine rich mrna on the other hand , if an organism has extremely gc rich dna g c , a gene 's message strand tends to have more pyrimidines than purines what it means is that szybalski 's rule is correct only for organisms with genome g c content less than and chargaff 's second parity rule which says that a t an g c even within a single strand of dna is flat out wrong all the time , except at the g c point , where chargaff is right now and then by chance since the last time i wrote on this subject , i 've had the chance to look at more than , additional genomes what i 've found is that the relationship between purine loading and g c content applies not only to bacteria and archaea and eukaryotes , but to mitochondrial dna , chloroplast dna , and virus genomes plant , animal , phage , as well the accompanying graphs tell the story , but i should explain a change in the way these graphs are prepared versus the graphs in my earlier posts earlier , i plotted g c along the x axis and purine pyrmidine ratio on the y axis i now plot a t on the x axis instead of g c , in order to convert an inverse relationship to a direct relationship also , i now plot a g purines , as a mole fraction on the y axis thus , x and y axes are now both expressed in mole fractions , hence both are normalized to the unit interval i e , all values range from the graph above shows the relationship between genome a t content and purine content of message strands in genomes for bacterial genera the straight line is regression fitted to minimize the sum of squared absolute error software by http zunzun com the line conforms to y a bx where a b the line predicts that if a genome were to consist entirely of g c guanine and cytosine , it would be guanine , whereas if in some mythical creature the genome were to consist entirely of a t adenine and thymine , adenine would comprise of the dna interestingly , the confidence interval permits a value of at x , which would mean that as guanine and cytosine diminish to zero , a t approaches the golden ratio do the most primitive bacteria archaea also obey this relationship ? yes , they do in preparing the graph below , i analyzed codon usage in archaeal genera to obtain a , g , t , and c relative proportions in coding regions of genes as you can see , the same basic relationship exists between purine content and a t in archaea as in eubacteria regression analysis yielded a line with a slope of and a vertical offset so again , it 's possible or maybe it 's just a very strange coincidence that a t approaches the golden ratio as a t approaches unity analysis of coding regions in archaea reveals that the same relationship exists between a t content and purine mole fraction a g as exists in eubacteria for the graph below , i analyzed eukaryotic genomes everything from fungi and protists to insects , fish , worms , flowering and non flowering plants , mosses , algae , and sundry warm and cold blooded animals the slope of the generated regression line is and the vertical offset is eukaryotic organisms n mitochondria and chloroplasts see the two graphs below show a good bit more scatter in the data , but regression analysis still comes back with positive slopes and , respectively for the line of least squared absolute error mitochondrial dna n chloroplast dna n to see if this same fundamental relationship might hold even for viral genetic material , i looked at codon usage in varieties of bacteriophage and plant and animal viruses ranging in size from kb to over kilobases interestingly enough , the relationship between a t and message strand purine loading does indeed apply to viruses , despite the absence of dedicated protein making machinery in a virion plant and animal viruses n bacteriophage n for the plant and animal viruses above left , the regression line has a slope of and meets the y axis at when x for bacteriophage above right , the line 's slope is and the vertical offset is when inspecting the graphs , take note that the vertical axis scaling is not the same for each graph hence the slopes are deceptive the y intercept at x is so again , it 's possible a t approaches the golden ratio as a t approaches the fact that viral nucleic acids follow the same purine trajectories as their hosts perhaps should n't come as a surprise , because viral genetic material is in general highly adapted to host machinery purine loading appropriate to the a t milieu is just another adaptation it 's striking that so many genomes , from so many diverse organisms eubacteria , archaea , eukaryotes , viruses , bacteriophages , plus organelles , follow the same basic law of approximately a g a t the above law is as universal a law of biology as i 've ever seen the only question is what to call the slope term it 's clearly a biological constant of considerable significance its physical interpretation is clear it 's the rate at which purines are accumulated in mrna as genome a t content increases it says that a increase in a t content or a decrease in genome g c content is worth a increase in purine content in message strands maybe it should be called the purine rise rate ? the purine amelioration rate ? biologists , please feel free to get in touch to discuss i'm interested in hearing your ideas reach out to me on linkedin , or simply leave a comment below
