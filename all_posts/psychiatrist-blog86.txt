have you tried to find a psychiatrist lately ? it can be hard of course , there are your insurance panels , if the docs listed are n't dead or listed in error and are taking patients and sometimes , people just get lucky and make a call to happen upon a psychiatrist they like a lot it can also be a hassle , and to someone who contacted me recently , if i did n't have an anxiety disorder when i started looking for a psychiatrists , i 'd have one now ! i can push an icon on my phone open table and find out in a matter of minutes exactly which restaurants in baltimore can take a party of at tonight , or another icon uber to get a driver to take me to that dinner me in minutes , but there 's not an easy way to figure out who can see a patient quickly it 's hit or miss and often a matter of luck or who you know , even when there may be doctors with time , or perhaps someone who had a bunch of unexpected cancellations one day i thought i would try to rectify this situation in maryland and in less than an hour i 've had a little practice with these website things , i was able to set up an access to care website in maryland , located at marylandpsychiatrists net do check it out , and each week , more and more psychiatrists have registered with openings i'm trying to get the word out that the website exists , so if you 're a doctor in maryland , do let folks know http www marylandpsychiatrists net
