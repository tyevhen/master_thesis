in my feb post , i speculated that u s life expectancies would soon peak and start going down it seems the first part of that prediction has already come true in cdc 's national vital statistics reports , based on preliminary data for , we find that overall life expectancy at birth all races , both sexes in the u s was unchanged from to , at years see table a , page of report this means that since , u s life expectancy has risen just year this leveling off is not happening in other countries in fact , life expectancies in europe are blasting ahead at the incredible rate of two to three months per year and have been for quite a while this is n't the first time u s life expectancy has faltered it fell from to between and , and from to between and it 's possible we 'll recover again , of course , but a recent analysis by l david roper professor emeritus of physics at virginia polytechnic institute and state university suggests , to the contrary , that we 're asymptotically approaching a max life expectancy of years a more elaborate projection based on years of data is presented in stagnating life expectancies and future prospects in an age of uncertainty by denney et al social science quarterly , oct it shows u s life expectancies increasing by only three years between now and for more information on how u s health is trending relative to other countries and relative to past u s history , i strongly recommend the following book , which comes via the national academy of sciences , from research funded by the national institutes of health if for some reason the link goes dead , try this link instead
