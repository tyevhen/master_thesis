personally for me , the spring brings many challenges as a high school counselor there is often a rise in suicidal threats , an increase in student pregnancies , an escalation of fights , and warm weather entices students to skip class for some additional socialization however , this spring there was an additional concern that emerged from our student body national feel a boob day now that i have your attention , let me elaborate on the real meaning of this day and how it was celebrated at my school national feel a boob day is a national awareness program that encourages women to perform self evaluations for lumps in their breast in addition to each woman checking her own breast , her partner is persuaded to perform breast evaluations on her as well this day originated as part of a movement to promote self breast examinations among women and their significant others however , its meaning was lost in the hallways of my school so , i guess you are wondering how national feel a boob day played out at my school ? see the reason for national feel a boob day below national feel a boob day honestly before last week , i did not even know that this awareness campaign existed that is until one of my frequent flyers came into our counseling suite with another girl looking very annoyed i asked the girls why they were in the office during their lunch and they began to describe their difficult day both girls explained they had been fondled and groped all morning by acquaintances and decided to hide out in our office so they could catch a break of course , i was not happy about the idea of two girls being touched inappropriately and i asked them if they would be willing to write down the names of these guys so that i could report this to the administration one of the girls said it was no use because we would have an office full of people she then went on to inform me that it was national feel a boob day okay , i thought , this has got to be a joke ! however , later that afternoon , one of our assistant principals walked by my office and shared another similar story with me this time , a female student got into trouble for fondling another girl s breast in front of the whole class the assistant principal asked her why she did it and she informed him that it was not a big deal because it was a holiday , national feed a boob day in both incidents , the students were very matter of fact about all the inappropriate touching and explained that this behavior had been going on all day without much concern by the faculty or students really ? the normalization of sexual harassment why i am so surprised this is not a big deal ? wake up girl just look at the messages from hollywood from our media and pop culture , students are trained at an early age to ignore harassment and then engage in this sexual behavior with songs like my humps , milkshake , and even the oldie but goodie , brick house , students are inundated with sexual messages even at this year s oscar , seth macfarland earned many laughs for his song , i saw your boobs the song was about the exposition of actresses breast in popular films like the accused , monster , and
