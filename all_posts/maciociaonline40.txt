the menopause in western medicine menopause indicates the complete and permanent cessation of menstruation an interval of months is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis climacteric indicates the phase in a woman s life during which she makes the transition from a reproductive to a non reproductive stage this transition is a period of declining ovarian function which usually spans years around the menopause thus , when we refer to the discomfort and symptoms appearing during these years , it would be more appropriate to call them climacteric syndrome rather than menopausal syndrome menopause usually occurs between the ages of and and the median age in industrialized countries is about the very first chapter of the su wen describes the year cycles of women , according to which menopause occurs at x this is not far from the above mentioned median age of furthermore , data analyses indicate that the menopausal age has remained unchanged for centuries indeed , the mean age at menopause is just over and this is remarkably constant not only throughout the western world but also other countries a survey of malaysian women showed a mean age at menopause of years , and another of seven asian countries found that most women reached menopause at around the primary basis for the progressive decline of reproductive power in women is in the ovary itself , as ovarian follicles are greatly depleted by the time of the menopause this is very important to remember when interpreting menopausal problems from the point of view of chinese medicine the symptoms of hot flushes flashes and in particular vaginal dryness are due to a decline of oestrogen and therefore tian gui in chinese medicine tian gui derives from kidney jing it is interesting to note that there is a progressive decline of follicles even from the time before birth in fact , at the time the ovaries are formed in the foetus , there are approximately , , primordial follicles , which decrease to about , at birth , to , at menarche and to about , at the time of the menopause this would seem to confirm that the menopause is not an event that takes place suddenly in a woman s life but one that reflects a gradual physiological process throughout her lifetime , starting even before her birth this confirms that the biological basis of the menopause is determined during a woman s lifetime , i e although the decline of kidney jing is gradual , lifestyle and dietary habits from childhood onwards determine what kind of menopause a woman is going to have if a woman has a poor diet and if she overworks for several years prior to the onset of the menopause , she will be more likely to develop more severe symptoms during the climacteric years the main menopause linked symptoms are three vaginal dryness hot flushes flashes night sweating by far the commonest symptom is hot flushes flashes , from which per cent of menopausal women suffer per cent may experience them for years after the menopause indeed , some gynaecologists say that , strictly speaking , only hot flushes and vaginal dryness are oestrogen deficiency related manifestations according to their view , most of the other manifestations are due to increased stress at this time of life other symptoms that they may appear during the menopause are headaches , tiredness , lethargy , irritability , anxious mood , nervousness , depressed mood , insomnia , inability to concentrate the menopause in chinese medicine from a chinese perspective , menopausal symptoms are due to a decline of kidney jing in its yin or yang aspect however , within this basic pathology there can be many variations of patterns i must stress that i am discussing only the normal menopause that occurs around age and not premature menopause that may occur even in the s while the normal menopause is due to a physiological decline of tian gui , premature menopause is always a pathology since menopausal symptoms especially vaginal dryness , hot flushes and night sweating are due to the decline of oestrogen occurring at this time , from the chinese point of view , they are due to the physiological decline of tian gui tian gui is discussed in the very first chapter of the su wen which says that , in girls , it arrives when she is x and it dried up when she is x at the age of the tian gui arrives , the ren mai begins to flow , the chong mai is flourishing , the periods come regularly and she can conceive at the age of , the ren mai is empty , the chong mai depleted , the tian gui dries up , the earth passage uterus is not open , so weakness and infertility set in the golden mirror of medicine yi zong jin jian , says at , kidney qi is abundant and the motive force dong qi between the kidneys is abundant at , tian gui arrives , i e the dong qi within the water of the pre natal tian gui , and it enters the uterus this is an interesting statement that makes the point that what he calls dong qi , essentially the yuan qi , is pre natal and is therefore already active when a girl is by contrast , tian gui is post natal and it is the transformation of yuan qi into water when it enters the uterus making the girl fertile although i myself think that we should be careful in making direct connections between western and chinese medicine , in this case i think we can definitely say that tian gui is an expression of ovarian activity and of oestrogen which is what determines puberty and menopause as tian gui derives from kidney jing , it follows that , during the menopause , there is a physiological decline of kidney jing finally , i would like to stress that the menopause is neither a disease nor a pathology it is the natural , physiological decline of kidney jing indeed , many women go through the menopause without marked symptoms of course , it may become a pathology when a woman suffers from a pre existing deficiency of the kidneys and other patterns which will cause distressing symptoms which require intervention pathology of menopausal symptoms i often hear that menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes are due to kidney yin deficiency not so ! half of the menopausal women i see have a pale tongue and suffer from kidney yang deficiency that is because kidney jing deficiency may manifest with a yin or yang deficiency indeed , many herbs that nourish jing are in the category of tonics of kidney yang e g bu gu zhi , yi zhi ren , suo yang , jiu zi , sha yuan ji li my experience is that in menopausal women , more often than not , there is an overlapping deficiency of kidney yin and kidney yang , albeit always with a predominance of one i e it is never kidney yin and kidney yang deficiency simultaneous kidney yin and kidney yang deficiency hot flushes are easy to explain when there is kidney yin deficiency as empty heat rising from kidney yin deficiency , but how to explain them in kidney yang deficiency ? as mentioned above , during the menopause there is usually an overlapping kidney yin and kidney yang deficiency therefore when kidney yang deficiency predominates , the tongue is pale and the woman has many cold symptoms such as feeling cold , cold feet and or back , pale urine , etc however , since kidney yin is also deficient , there will be some empty heat rising and causing hot flushes figure illustrates this concept as can be observed , both kidney yin and kidney yang are deficient in both cases albeit in different proportions so that a woman suffering from kidney yin deficiency may also experience cold feet and one suffering from kidney yang deficiency will have hot flushes minister fire there are also other aspects to the menopausal pathology that explain the hot flushes with kidney yang deficiency one aspect is the minister fire the minister fire is the physiological fire of the kidneys that plays a vital role in supporting the physiological activity of all organs the minister fire is a formless fire that has special characteristics crucially it is a fire that does not dry up water as it even nourishes water when there is a deficiency of the minister fire there is a kidney yang deficiency and , since the minister fire may even nourish water , there is also a secondary kidney yin deficiency derangement of qi there is yet another aspect to the menopausal pathology that has not to do with yin and yang but with qi with the onset of the menopause and the decline of kidney jing , there also develops a weakening of the ren and chong mai in the lower burner and an instability of qi in the lower burner thus , during the menopause , qi is easily deranged and , because it is unstable in the lower burner , it rises above contributing to the hot flushes thus , in explaining hot flushes , one should not concentrate purely on the heat aspect of them , but also on the derangement of qi aspect therefore , besides clearing heat , hot flushes should be treated also by consolidating qi of the ren and chong mai in the lower burner and subduing it in the upper part of the body vaginal dryness so far , we have concentrated on the pathology of hot flushes but the pathology of vaginal dryness is equally important and very distressful the pathology of vaginal dryness is more directly related to kidney jing than that of hot flushes is in vaginal dryness we must obviously nourish yin but remember that it also occurs with kidney yang deficiency for the reasons explained above what it means in treatment is that , if we are treating vaginal dryness in a woman with kidney yang deficiency with herbal medicine , we must definitely modify the formula with the addition of herbs such as sheng di huang radix rehmanniae and nu zhen zi fructus ligustri lucidi full patterns finally , the menopause obviously does not occur in a vacuum and every woman of around will always have a pre existing pathology that will aggravate the menopausal symptoms it is important to understand that such pathology will aggravate the menopausal symptoms but is not menopausal as such the only strictly menopausal pathology is a decline of tian gui and a kidney deficiency thus , in addition to a kidney deficiency , there will also be some full patterns such as dampness phlegm qi stagnation blood stasis liver yang rising rebellious qi of the chong mai all these patterns will contribute to the development and severity of menopausal symptoms and they must be treated in addition to tonifying kidney jing aetiology of menopausal problems as we discuss aetiology for diseases , to discuss the aetiology of menopausal problems seems to contradict what i stressed above , i e that the menopause is not a disease however , the factors discussed below are factors that definitely aggravate menopausal symptoms emotional stress emotional stress is an extremely important aggravating factor in menopausal problems , building up for year after year before the onset of the menopause anxious , fear or guilt weaken the kidneys and lead to yin deficiency , especially when these emotions occur against a background of overwork as is usually the case in the long run , as kidney yin fails to nourish heart yin , they also lead to heart yin deficiency and heart empty heat and this would aggravate hot flushes worry , anger and fear may lead to liver yang rising which would aggravate hot flushes overwork in my experience , overwork , in the sense of working long hours without adequate rest usually combined with irregular diet and worry , is the most important and frequent cause of kidney yin deficiency in western women as there is a pre existing kidney yin deficiency , this will aggravate the symptoms of vaginal dryness and hot flushes smoking tobacco smoking injures not only the lungs but also the kidneys it dries up jing and blood and it therefore leads to kidney yin deficiency which would aggravate menopausal symptoms tobacco has an interesting history in chinese society and medicine when tobacco was first introduced in china , chinese doctors started testing it to see whether it could be used as a medicinal herb the zhen nan ben cao ming dynasty concludes that tobacco is pungent in taste , hot and toxic without any medicinal effect cu ci shan qing dynasty made the most interesting statement when he said tobacco is pungent and drying , it burns jing kidneys and the fluids , damages the throat , the sstomach and the lungs it enters the heart orifice causing mental confusion as if one were drunk it makes the tongue coating dark yellow or black , food and drink have no taste , the medical texts have no treatment for this the most interesting part of the statement is the reference to tobacco burning jing this would therefore aggravate a jing deficiency and aggravate menopausal symptoms irregular diet eating irregularly and eating excessive amounts of dairy foods and greasy fried foods leads to the formation of phlegm this often aggravates menopausal symptoms tea coffee and alcohol tea , coffee and alcohol are yang in nature and would aggravate menopausal symptoms and hot flushes based on the above aetiological factors , i now advice young women about the menopause if i see a , say , old woman who is overworking , eating a lot of dairy foods , drinking excessively and smoking , i tell her that now is the time to do something about the menopause and i list below the advice i give them not to overwork do moderate exercise not to smoke to consume only moderate amounts of alcohol to avoid emotional stress easy to say ! to consume tea and coffee in moderate amounts not to eat dairy foods treatment of menopausal problems acupuncture the acupuncture treatment must be based on tonifying the kidneys and strengthening the ren and chong mai when treating menopausal problems , i nearly always treat the ren mai and the three points i use every time are lu on the right , ki on the left to open the ren mai and ren guanyuan in addition , i would also reinforce ki taixi and sp sanyinjao in case of kidney yang deficiency , i would use the same points plus bl shenshu in addition to points to tonify the kidneys , i also use points to subdue qi and clear empty heat i do this with l i hegu , p daling and he yinxi in case of severe emotional stress and anxious mood , i add du shenting and ren jiuwei in case of rebellious qi of the chong mai , i use the chong mai instead of the ren mai with these points sp gongsun on the right , p neiguan on the left , plus l i hegu on the right , liv taichong on the left , ki qixue bilateral , ren guanyuan herbal treatment i shall now discuss the treatment of the main patterns involved in menopausal problems a kidney yin and kidney yang deficiency with predominance of kidney yin deficiency clinical manifestations dizziness , tinnitus , poor memory , hardness of hearing , night sweating , dry mouth and throat at night , lower backache , ache in bones , tiredness , depressed mood , slight anxious mood , cold feet , abundant pale urine

a year old woman complained of menopausal problems for the previous years , after her periods stopped her main problems were severe hot flushes , night sweating , depression , anxiety , mood swings , a tingling feeling all over and insomnia she also complained of severely cold feet and frequent urination her tongue was red with a slightly rootless , yellow and dry coating and her pulse rapid , overflowing on both front positions and weak and deep on both rear positions although most of these symptoms started after her periods stopped , she had a history of severe stress in the years leading up to the menopause husband s redundancy , father s death and daughter s breakdown and this obviously accounted for the severity of the menopausal symptoms diagnosis most of this patient s symptoms are due to deficiency of kidney yin with empty heat affecting the heart and harassing the mind the symptoms of kidney yin deficiency are hot flushes , night sweating , red tongue with a slightly rootless coating and a weak and deep pulse on both rear positions the symptoms of empty heat affecting the heart and harassing the mind are depression , anxiety , mood swings , insomnia and a pulse that is rapid and overflowing on both front positions as in the previous case history , in this case too there is an overlapping of kidney yin and kidney yang deficiency although the primary condition is one of kidney yin deficiency , there is also some kidney yang deficiency as evidenced by the cold feet and frequent urination treatment principle the treatment principle adopted was to nourish kidney and heart yin , clear heart empty heat , and calm the mind a secondary aim was to tonify kidney yang she was treated with acupuncture and patent remedies acupuncture the points used were

her periods stopped she complained of hot flushes , night sweating , some hair loss , nails breaking easily and backache her tongue was slightly pale and her pulse was weak in general and especially weak and deep on both rear positions diagnosis although she had few symptoms , the prevailing patterns are those of kidney yang deficiency and some liver blood deficiency the menopausal symptoms of hot flushes and night sweating indicate empty heat from kidney deficiency the backache and hair loss indicate kidney deficiency since the pulse is weak on both rear positions , the only factor that points to kidney yang deficiency is the pale colour of the tongue as we have discussed , in women over a deficiency of the kidneys nearly always involves a deficiency of both yin and yang , albeit always in differing proportions thus , when kidney yang is primarily deficient , kidney yin also becomes slightly deficient , giving rise to the empty heat symptoms that cause the hot flushes in this patient , the brittle nails indicate some liver blood deficiency treatment principle the treatment principle in this case is to tonify kidney yang primarily and nourish kidney yin secondarily , and to nourish liver blood she was treated only with herbal medicine c kidney yin and liver yin deficiency with liver yang rising clinical manifestations irritability , headaches , dizziness , tinnitus ,

menopause as we have discussed above , every menopausal woman is bound to suffer from patterns other than those purely related to the decline of kidney jing therefore , every menopausal woman will suffer from a combination of kidney deficiency and some full patterns such as qi stagnation , rebellious qi of the chong mai , phlegm and blood stasis however , remember that such full patterns are not menopausal syndromes in the same way hot flushes and vaginal dryness are therefore , when the clinical picture is significantly complicated by some of the above full patterns , i will tend to use a custom formula rather than a prepared remedy if the above full patterns are pronounced , then it might be advisable to deal with these first by using a decoction that resolves phlegm , moves qi or invigorates blood for example , were the deficiency of the kidneys accompanied by a pronounced stasis of blood , one might invigorate blood and eliminate stasis first by using for a few months a formula such as ge xia zhu yu tang eliminating stasis below the diaphragm decoction similarly , were phlegm pronounced , one might start with a decoction to resolve phlegm such as er chen tang two old decoction however , prepared remedies may also be used in these cases combined with the menopausal remedies prognosis and prevention chinese medicine can help women to minimize their problems in the transition from a reproductive to a non reproductive age herbal treatment is more effective than acupuncture because herbs are better at nourishing jing acupuncture is very effective at controlling menopausal symptoms but it needs to be administered regularly , so that herbal medicine is cheaper for the patient generally speaking , if menopausal problems occur against a background of kidney yin deficiency , the treatment will be more difficult and one can say that the redder the tongue body and the less coating there is , the more difficult the treatment the tongue indicating the worst prognosis would be one with a dark red body , completely without coating , cracked and dry as mentioned earlier , the severity of menopausal symptoms depends on the pre existing condition of the kidneys and therefore on the woman s diet and lifestyle throughout her lifetime thus , it is important that the patient understands this and is willing to be patient chinese medicine can help a woman in this transition period only in a slow and gradual way it is becoming more difficult to explain this to patients given the quick results they are offered and sometimes experience through hormone replacement therapy hrt we should now discuss the integration of chinese herbal medicine with hrt , is such integration is possible in my experience , there is no problem in using chinese herbs while the patient is taking hrt because they work in different ways and at different levels hrt works by tricking the hypothalamus in thinking that the ovaries are still working so that it will stop stimulating the pituitary gland to secrete fsh chinese herbs work by gently nourishing kidney jing to minimize the effects of the menopausal transition however , while it is possible to combine the two in the short term , it does not make sense to combine them in the long term in any case , menopausal women generally come to us wither because they do not want hrt or because they want to stop it finally , another question that arises is how long can a woman go on taking chinese herbs for the menopause ? in my experience , these can be taken for years without any side effects however , when a patient takes a remedy for the long term , i usually ask them to suspend it for about month every months western view the ovarian changes associated with the menopause have already been mentioned in the introduction the main endocrine change is a decreased oestrogen production by the ovary which is the main source of oestrogen in the form of oestradiol in the reproductive years after menopause , the ovarian oestrogen production decreases markedly and the main circulating oestrogen is oestrone rather than oestradiol most of the oestrogen present in menopausal women is derived from adipose tissue from the conversion of androstenedione to oestrone the amount of oestrone produced in adipose tissue is determined by the overall amount of this tissue therefore thin women convert a smaller percentage of androstenedione to oestrone per cent compared with obese women who may convert as much as per cent the main source of androstenedione is the adrenal glands the time preceding the menopause is characterized by an increasing irregular menstrual cycle which may become either scanty or heavy and irregular in timing the symptoms associated with the menopause may be classified according to the organ or tissue involved brain hot flushes , depression , anxiety , insomnia , poor memory and concentration vagina vaginal dryness and atrophy heart coronary heart disease blood vessels arteriosclerosis bone osteoporosis skin thinning , slow healing , itching as mentioned before , some gynaecologists consider only hot flushes and vaginal dryness as oestrogen related menopausal symptoms hot flushes are the most common menopausal symptom up to per cent of menopausal women suffer from them and per cent of them do so for up to ten years after the menopause associated with an increase in temperature , increased pulse rate , and increased blood flow in the hand , each hot flush lasts on average minutes hot flushes are a mechanism for dissipating heat through vasodilatation and perspiration in response to the thermoregulatory centres in the anterior hypothalamus the vasomotor symptoms hot flushes occurring during the climaterium are probably due to fluctuating pulses of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone fsh which rises to abnormal blood levels at this time in an effort to provoke ovulation from increasing unresponsive follicles oestrogen in the form of hrt hormone replacement therapy deceives the pituitary that normal ovulation and oestrogen production is continuing so that the overproduction of fsh ceases and so do the hot flushes the western treatment of menopausal problems is based on the administration of hormone replacement therapy hrt or ert in different forms these could be native oestrogens oestradiol , oestrone , oestriol , conjugated equine oestrogens , and synthetic oestrogens such as ethinyl oestradiol in a dose ranging between and g this is a lower dose usually about th than the one used in the contraceptive pill and , for this reason , many gynaecologists believe that the potential side effects of hrt have been wrongly extrapolated from those of the contraceptive pill indeed , they say that some of the side effects , far from being that , are actually indications for example , while the contraceptive pill carries the potential adverse reaction of cardiovascular disease , hrt is , presumably , effective in protecting menopausal women from cardiovascular disease however , this thesis is hotly debated as we shall see shortly in any case the potential adverse effects of hrt include endometrial hyperplasia and cancer , thromboembolism , strokes , hypertension , breast cancer , gall bladder dysfunction , gall stones , and lesser symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , water retention , and headaches as most practitioners will know , in spite of the potential adverse effects , menopausal women are increasingly being prescribed hrt almost routinely the one adverse effect that is usually taken seriously is the potential risk of breast cancer for this reason , hrt should never be given to a woman who has or has had breast cancer or to a woman who has a breast lump of an unknown nature however , this view is also debated as there are doctors who think that women who have been cured of their breast cancer can receive hrt without risk the oestrogen present in hrt is often supplemented by the administration of progestins principally to oppose the effect of oestrogen on the endometrium hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer there are two classes of progestins used native progestins progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone and synthetic progestins nortestosterone derivatives and carbon atom compounds such as medroxyprogesterone and megestrol if oestrogen is given for days with a break of days , progestin is added in the last days if oestrogen is given continuously for days without a break , progestin is usually administered in the last days vaginal bleeding usually occurs with cyclic oestrogen progesterone therapy and is caused by the progesterone component progesterone therapy for menopausal women has not proved of much benefit and also has potential side effects such as depression , breast fullness and tenderness , a distended feeling , weight gain and symptoms like those of pre menstrual tension however , the theoretical side effects of progesterone rarely manifest in practice when it is combined with oestrogen for the relief of menopausal symptoms progesterone s undisputed role in hrt is to neutralize oestrogen s potentially carcinogenic effect on the endometrium and breast hrt therapy can be administered in the following forms oral tablets transdermal patches percutaneous gel subcutaneous implants vaginal creams , pessary , tablets contraindications to oestrogen treatment are hormone related cancer active liver disease a history of hormone induced thromboembolism vaginal bleeding of an unknown cause untreated hypertension please note that i have reported the above contraindications mostly for the practitioner s information it should be borne in mind , however , that new research is being carried out on the effects of hrt all the time so that new findings are reported every few months thus , not all gynaecologists would agree with the above list of contraindications for example , there are some who claim that having had breast cancer is not always a contraindication for hrt from a western point of view , menopausal problems are almost exclusively attributed to a deficiency of oestrogen and the cure is therefore hrt in modern industrialized societies hrt is increasingly prescribed almost routinely as soon as a woman approaches the menopause , both to alleviate menopausal symptoms and because of its alleged protective effect against osteoporosis and heart disease more and more , the menopause has been medicalized and defined as a deficiency disease for example , a recent text on women s problems in general practice says in the usa , australia and western europe , the concept has emerged of the menopause as a deficiency disease which needs treatment by hormone replacement therapy there are many flaws in this thinking first of all , the menopause is not a disease and it needs medical intervention only if its symptoms are uncomfortable and distressing secondly , the decline in oestrogen levels following the reduction in follicles is a natural , physiological process that is part of a woman s biological rhythms seen from this perspective , menopause is no more a disease than menarche is thirdly , the protective effect of hrt against osteoporosis and heart disease is hotly debated and not at all conclusively proven the many studies which have been conducted are confusing and contradictory for example , a review of english language literature on oestrogen therapy from to concluded that oestrogen use by menopausal women reduces the risk of coronary heart disease chd by about per cent and the risk of hip fracture in post menopausal women by about per cent moreover , meta analysis of epidemiological data demonstrates that women using hrt after menopause experience lower rates of heart disease on the other hand , a study of , post menopausal women observed over a period of twelve years found that women using oestrogen had over a per cent elevated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and more than a twofold risk of cerebrovascular disease the study also concluded that no benefits from oestrogen use were observed in the study group moreover , two other studies demonstrated a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism in users of hrt fourth , and probably most important , there are many studies showing that hrt does increase the risk of endometrial and breast cancer the review of literature mentioned above found that since at least thirty five epidemiological studies have shown a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer in women who have taken oestrogen similarly , the same review showed that the risk of breast cancer increases with long term use of oestrogen in fact , a swedish study of , hormone users reported that the incidence of breast cancer compared with that in non users was increased after six years use one of the most recent british studies of , women taking hrt showed that breast cancer mortality in these women compared with the general population rose from per , in the earlier period of follow up to , to per , between and in both the swedish and british studies no protective effect was observed when progestogen was given however , other studies show that the risk of breast cancer is reduced or nullified if progesterone is administered in addition to oestrogen continuously rather than sequentially fifth , protecting a woman from osteoporosis and heart disease must surely depend on very many factors such as diet and lifestyle before the onset of the menopause thus , it is simplistic , at best , to think that oestrogen taken as soon as the menopause approaches is going to protect a woman from these diseases although the potential impact of hrt on the risk of endometrial and breast cancer it still debated and not conclusively proven , taking all the above factors into account , it does seem that chinese medicine , with its gentle and steady tonification of the kidney jing without side effects , can offer a safe , effective and logical alternative to hrt , even though its effects will never be as rapid as those of hrt in any case , the treatment of menopausal problems with acupuncture and chinese herbs should not necessarily be seen as an alternative to hrt as the two may also be combined because hrt and a chinese treatment work in different ways hrt works by tricking the body into thinking that it is still ovulating but it does not tonify the kidneys chinese medicine , on the contrary , works by gently tonifying the kidneys and the kidney jing to help the woman in this transition time of life the interesting thing is that , as the ovaries reduce their production of oestrogen , nature has something else up her sleeve women are also able to produce a form of oestrogen called oestrone from the adrenal glands in order to compensate for the decline from the ovaries women also produce oestrogen from fat cells , so being ultra slim will not have health benefits in the long run , particularly if you are going through menopause of course obesity presents its own health problems , but from an oestrogen production point of view , it is better to be slightly overweight than very thin women s health initiative randomized controlled trial on the risks and benefits of oestrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women the women s health initiative in the usa conducted a trial to assess the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy hrt in healthy postmenopausal women , postmenopausal women aged with intact uterus were given conjugated equine oestrogens mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate mg or a placebo the trial was to last years the main outcomes checked were breast cancer and coronary heart disease on may , after years , the trial was stopped because it showed an unacceptable increased risk of breast cancer , coronary heart disease and stroke in the women who were taking hrt the investigators concluded that the overall health risks exceeded the benefits from use of combined oestrogen and progesterone this study does not come as a surprise as other studies have highlighted the risks inherent in hrt in fact , some studies show that women on hrt have an increased risk of breast cancer a swedish study of , hormone users reported that the incidence of breast cancer compared with that in non users was increased after six years use one of the most recent british studies of women taking hrt showed that breast cancer mortality in these women compared with the general population rose from per in the earlier period of follow up to , to per between and thus , excessive oestrogen , as the above studies show , increases the risk of developing breast cancer million women study growing evidence about the risks of breast cancer and other serious illnesses posed by hormone therapy for menopause has led many women to give up the drugs , and many doctors to stop recommending them but there has been a lingering belief , according to some , that for younger women in the early stages of menopause , hormone risks may be negligible , at least for a while so those who are really suffering from hot flushes , insomnia and other symptoms are often told that it is probably all right to take the drugs , as long as they use the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time some researchers are even testing an idea , called the timing hypothesis , that starting hormone treatment early in menopause may help protect women from heart disease now , information from a huge observational study in britain suggests that the women thought to be at the lowest risk from hormones may actually be at the highest risk , at least when it comes to breast cancer the study found that women with the greatest risk of breast cancer from hormones were those who took them earliest before or soon after menopause began these findings are not considered to be the strongest type of evidence because they do not come from a randomized trial however , this particular observational study also has a unique strength it included more than a million postmenopausal women , i e one in four british women who were aged to during the enrolment period , from may to december the research , called the million women study , found that in women aged to who had never taken hormones , percent a year developed breast cancer the rate was higher , percent a year , in women who started taking the most commonly used hormones estrogens combined with progestin five or more years after menopause began but it was highest of all percent a year in women who started taking the drugs before or less than five years after menopause began and the risk was increased even in women who took the drugs for less than five years the lead investigator of the study , prof dame valerie beral , a professor of epidemiology at the university of oxford , said that her research group had decided to look at the interval between the start of menopause and the start of treatment because other studies had found evidence of higher risk among women who started earlier but in the other studies , the numbers of women who had started early were relatively small , and so the evidence was not statistically significant in the million women study , percent of the women taking hormones had begun them before or within five years of the start of menopause , so there was a better chance of finding an answer one of the studies that had detected a possible but inconclusive link between earlier hormone use and increased cancer risk was the above mentioned women s health initiative , the randomized trial that in found that combined hormones were causing small but significant increases in the risk of breast cancer , heart disease , strokes and blood clots in the lungs end notes a govan , d hart and r callander gynaecology illustrated , churchill livingstone , edinburgh , p gomel v and munro m gynaecology a practical
