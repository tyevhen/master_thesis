great post over at the last psychiatrist regarding the biological bias that is predominant in psychiatry biology counts , while other factors are negligible here 's a snippet this is an interesting cover which states the consequences of a poor fit for therapy can be disastrous no one would ever have thought to create a similar warning about the disastrous consequences of a poor fit for , say , depakote we know it has side effects , but using it would never be disastrous , right ? but why would bad therapy be disastrous ? if psychiatry is so biologically based that the a bad environment is not the main cause of illness , why should bad therapy be so powerful ? if bad parenting ca n't cause adhd , how could bad therapy make it worse ? snip the art of psychotherapy ok but why the science of pharmacology ? because we sling hta around like we know what we 're talking about ? very interesting social commentary in a concise format follows over at his post , which can be accessed here if you 've not yet visited his site , i'm sorry i 've not done my part by linking there until now , and for that i apologize to my readers i do n't rubber stamp all of the commentary at his site , but his arguments are always insightful and thoughtful there are precious few sites that consistently focus on mental health treatment issues and do so in a manner that is not just a reflection of the conventional wisdom propaganda that dominates the field i encourage my regular readers to frequently read his stuff as well start by checking out his list of the ten biggest mistakes psychiatrists make here
