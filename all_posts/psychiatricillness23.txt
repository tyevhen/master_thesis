my old psychiatrist said to me that once i was in a protective relationship we could consider reducing my medication i do want to reduce them one day but at the same time i am quite scared i have had a brilliant months , probably one of the best times of my life i do n't want it to end and i do n't want mr r to be put under any pressure or stress if i become sick neither can i afford to be sick from a work point of view i am on months check ups with my gp at the moment , i may raise it with her next time i visit
