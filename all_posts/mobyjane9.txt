question i have been suffering from anxiety and depression and reading your book is really helping me understand the whole thinking pattern and with me i need to understand something before i can change it if that makes sense i am in my s with young kids i work but it 's not my passion i want to do something i love rather than something i know a few years ago i was thinking about becoming a therapist but i put it off and dealt with life s events and recently i 've been doing a lot of reading and reflecting , realizing that becoming a therapist feels like my calling it 's something i would love doing rather than just to have a job ever since i can remember i 've enjoyed helping others i'm not sure what kind of therapist i want to become how did you come to choose to become a psychotherapy ? answer thanks for your letter my becoming a therapist was totally coincidental i was taking a friend to sdsu trying to get her interested in some course of study to get her mind off her recent divorce i was behind her in line and looking at the list of courses when i realized the woman at the counter was asking me what course i was interested in thinking this was merely idle conversation i answered i was kind of interested in the counseling education course oh , that s closed , she said oh that s okay , i said and i thought of my best friend in high school who became a biofeedback counselor and realized i had been slightly envious but never before had given a thought that i myself could aspire to such a lofty calling the clerk said to me then but you could take it on an at risk basis and hope to get into the program after the semester ends fine , said i , i ve been at risk all my life so , on a whim i just signed up then and there and that s how i became a therapist to become an mft marriage family counselor is time intensive you need at least hours of practice usually unpaid before you can even take the license exam you ll have to check on that figure it may be as much as , hours i don t remember for sure and there are many different kinds of therapists hypnotherapists , and spiritual therapists besides the marriage family mft you can get a degree on line of if you belong to a church you could become a lay counselor on the other hand , some people simply develop a helpful expertise , write a book and give lectures without any official designation read dale carnegie s book how to make friends and influence people he started out by doing small free talks at the ywca and his course in now known throughout the world some people just start by writing a helpful blog and reach out to help people that way some people begin by doing tarot readings for people in some kind of psychic community like elfin forest good luck on your path you might find deepak chopra s book the essential spontaneous fulfillment of desire helpful in finding out what your next step might be it s less than pages a b curtiss
