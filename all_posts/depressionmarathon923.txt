i do n't know about you , but when i'm feeling a bit out of sorts my house usually shows it thoughts strewn about my brain are matched by clothes strewn about my house a dingy , gray mood is paralleled by a dingy , gray kitchen and bath interestingly enough , i find the reverse is also true that is , when my house is messy , cluttered , and dingy , my mind and mood soon follow now i am not a neat freak i appreciate clean , but my house is my base of activity there are running clothes drying on various door knobs , work shoes resting wherever i removed them , and bills lying open next to my computer this is the norm the problem arises when the vacuum stays in the closet , the broom rests by the refrigerator , and the cleanser hides in the vanity this , unfortunately , is the current state and what do you know , my mind and mood are headed in the same messy direction ! so today is cleaning day even though i hate cleaning , i need to clean my house to clear my mind there are so many things i would rather do unfortunately , ignoring the clutter is eventually dangerous for my mental well being wish me luck today as i confront my mess i 'll let you know how it turns out !
