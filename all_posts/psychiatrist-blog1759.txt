reminder grand rounds at shrink rap , byob , submissions due by saturday sometimes , the last psychiatrist says things that make me want to scream he did that the other day , in a post about the virginia tech shooter , he made the statement , and i quote cho was n't mentally ill he was a sad , bad man who killed people because his life was n't validated there was no psychosis , there was no cognitive impairment , there was no psychiatric impairment in insight in judgment there was a lack of sex , but that 's not yet in the dsm not to reduce his life down to a soundbite , but he was a guy who thought he deserved better by virtue of his intelligence and suffering found himself in a sea of mediocrity but could n't understand why he could n't therefore excel and , worst of all , found that all the things he thought he deserved eluded him especially hot chicks , who not only dismissed him and found him creepy , but , worse , chose to be with the very men he thought were obviously inferior to him can i scream ? ? ? i do n't want to defend this man , i have n't followed the news all that closely , and i watched one minute video the killer made , though i will admit that statements he made along with some of his behaviors for example , killing himself , or perhaps even the illogical thought process that might lead one to think that murdering innocent people makes one a martyr for one 's nonexistant children led me to think he might have a mental illness on our podcast we talked about this in response to a reader 's question and we did n't think a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder was necessarily accurate or not , and we did n't think it was relevant to the act of mass murder i do n't know how the last psychiatrist practices psychiatry for me , when i do an evaluation of a new patient in my ideal bubble world private practice , i schedule hours , i sometimes run a little over i ask the patient about every aspect of their lives , including extended family history , descriptions of their parents' and siblings' personalities , detailed medical , occupational , romantic , legal , military , and habit histories i ask about past episodes and treatment i do a mental status exam i request records , if someone accompanies the patient , i bring them in at the end of the interview to clarify history , get another perspective , talk about a plan in less than ideal clinic world , i take a history and i often have extensive records from prior treatments i 've never made a diagnosis based on a three minute tape , one where i did n't get to ask questions how does the last psychiatrist know there was no impairment in insight or judgement give me a break , he thinks this guy had intact insight and judgement ? how does he know cho did n't have sex ? how does he know cho was motivated by his anger about not getting the hot chicks ? did i miss something here ? the last psychiatrist seems to know an awful lot about the inner thought processes of a stranger thanks for letting me scream i'm done now
