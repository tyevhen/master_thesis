recently in one of our local area papers , i read about two high school girls who were arrested for drugging and sex trafficking a middle school student the middle school student was prostituted to over men by these young ladies i use this term loosely to my dismay , one of the johns was a former student from my current high school as i looked at the picture of these two young girls , i imagined that they could be any student walking the halls of my school what was so surprising is that their pictures showed two innocent looking girls who barely looked like they could drive a car much less pimp out a year old girl how were these young girls able to hide this horrible secret ? fortunately , a hospital social worker saw the warning signs and reported the situation to the authorities how many students in our middle and high schools experience this same type of horror student by day and sex slave by night ? it is almost like a lifetime movie where the naive young girl is enticed by a handsome young man or kind woman to hang out in the evenings gradually , the pimp lavishes the youth with gifts and attention she is persuaded to wear seductive clothes to be noticed by others she may experiment with mind altering drugs and ever so slowly she becomes trapped in this unforgiving lifestyle after reading this news article , i began to wonder who were the students in my school in this same situation and how can they be identified ?
