up and down , round and round , up and down i go in the last couple days , i have felt better and then worse , and then i 've been better , and then i 've been worse sometimes the better has lasted hours sometimes it 's been only minutes of relief it 's so frustrating i am beside myself i do n't know what else to do i do n't feel like i can expect anything to stay the same for very long today was particularly frustrating and painful i felt okay when i got out of bed i went for my tempo run , as planned , prior to seeing my psychiatrist at am after my run , the world went dark i crashed by the time i saw my doc , i could barely hear myself talk she increased one of my meds it 's helped in the past i slept much of the day i could hardly wake up everything was slowed i was so low earlier in the week , i planned to run a cross country , k race tonight as race time approached , i forced myself out the door the race was literally just down the road at a local golf course i got there , signed up to run , and then sat on a tree stump awaiting the start the high school cross country meet was still being run , so there were probably parents , spectators , and kids running around i felt alone in the crowd i began to leave , but someone stopped me to chat i ended up running the race , a difficult , hilly affair , and i ran well go figure the pain of effort felt better than the pain of emptiness i came home hours after i left , and my mood was good it was like night and day i chatted on the phone with some friends who had been concerned i told them i was okay after that i took puck for our usual walk we were half way through our walk when the darkness descended again within minutes of telling my friends i was well , i felt dark , heavy and alone it did n't make any sense i am frustrated and baffled it seems i am on my own private roller coaster i'm doing life i'm working , running , staying connected with friends , and following doctor 's orders but i ca n't seem to get off the roller coaster huh i just re read this post , and i realized something i would n't expect a cancer patient 's illness to go into remission because she was doing all the right things i would n't expect a diabetic to suddenly be free of diabetes because he went to work why am i expecting my depression to magically go away ? it seems i'm forgetting this is an illness and sometimes , like many illnesses , it just does n't make sense this roller coaster is no fun feeling low sucks i 'd like to be able to change my illness with my actions , but i think i 've now proven there 's more to it than that i think it is important to keep doing what i 've been doing i 'd likely feel a hell of a lot worse right now if i had n't taken my meds or run that race but i have to remember i'm dealing with depression the illness and sometimes , no matter what i do , it rears its ugly , ugly head i 'll try to be more patient this too , i know , shall pass
