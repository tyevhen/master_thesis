hi ab ! i 've read and re read july 's blog post over and over i need this wisdom , and i appreciate your essay so much i relate to the poster 's questions , and i also have a different spin on the issue i am the wife of someone who is unhappy with his job , who talks about relocating , but it does n't happen in , he angrily started on this track , and i responded by upgrading the kitchen to prepare for resale last year , i remodeled a large bathroom i will soon be gutting and re doing the first floor powder room we bought at the height of the market , so even if we had only changed light bulbs since we moved in , we 'd still be certain to lose money at sale time it 's stressful , and i worry about it a lot so i decided to visit a reputable psychic who has been doing the work for years and is affiliated with a r e edgar cayce 's place in my area first weekin april , she told me she did not see a move in my near future she thought we 'd be in our house until my hub retires or more years i went back to see her the last day in july , and she said something had changed ! my hub would find a job that would be a director position , rather thana staff postition , which is what he is currently has the job would happen in the next months , in a certain town still in our current state , but hundreds of miles away she said ultimately it would be a positive move she could see us both being happy there the position of greater authority would be goodfor my husband who she correctly noted is highly analytical , hard working and likes things done right which is usually his way ! this threw me for a loop ! i got very depressed and started asking my hub about his job search i started pestering him , really i would n't tell him about the psychic , but i brought up the job search issue , which i had not done for months it was just assumed that he was keeping an eye out for a job things were happier in the house thisway now , my hub seems to feel pressured to kick up the job search a notch and i even wonder , had he put the whole thing on the backburner , and since i dredged it up , it 's now on the front burner ? i am not dealing well with the uncertainty of the situation , and ironically , the thing i did to get a definitive answer , visiting a psychic , only disrupted my mentalstate even further for the first few days after the visit , i felt really crazy i'm feeling better as time goes on , but i really struggle with this are we moving or are n't we ? situation how can i make plans ? how do i know how much to spend on the house ? i find myself in such a state of confusion and angst i know life is uncertain for us all , but most of us can enjoy an illusion of certainty ! people actually make five , ten , twenty year life plans i ca n't plan for any length of time ahead my hub isallergic to making plans he wants things to just flow if something comes along , he 'll seize the opportunity if not , we stay put i do n't like this approachvery much i 'd rather say , i'm not crazy about living here , or this job , but i am going to take the bitter with the sweet and put down roots also , we 've paid ahead of schedule and the house will be paid for in and a half years from now sorry for rambling on and on if you have any further insights to share i 'd appreciate it i believe that the title of your last blog post says a lot it 's not where you live , but how you live that really counts ! thanks , g dear g , my grandmother used to say never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you one of my professors said it this way never let your thoughts go beyond your situation yes , you need to plan ahead if there is some reason to plan ahead and there is a time for planning but if you do n't know if you are going to move , it is not the time to plan to move if it is not the time to plan to move and you are worrying about if you are going to move this is an example of letting your thoughts go beyond your situation a b curtiss dear a b thank you yes , i suppose that is true ! sounds so simple and sane ! i will try to look at it that way i guess i'm terrified i regret buying this house to begin with , since values fell i ca n't seem to let go of trying to have some control over the situation i 've never stewed over something for six whole years before ! when i'm not obsessing over the house , i'm on the internet looking at the job listings in my hub 's field i do n't think i 've ever been quite this anxious or unhappy before am i hopeless ? g dear g you must develop your own interests rather than be so interested in what your husband is or is not doing you should n't be making your heaviest investment in worrying it is a poor use of your talents as a creative person and a desolate path to trod as a human being a b
