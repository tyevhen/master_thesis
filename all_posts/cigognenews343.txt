there are several ways to know about how long we will live first , if you drink and smoke a lot it won t be very long if you do a genetic test you will get an idea , but also a very good way is to measure your telomeres these are the ends of the chromosomes which , if you expect to lead a long life the telomeres need to be long the shorter they are the shorter the life , in general and the real question is what is their function and why do they get shorter and therefore shorten our lives lifelong stress will shorten your telomeres , which shorten under stress or adversity telomeres form the ends of the chromosome that shorten under chronic financial problems , long term care of a loved one , emotional neglect and being unloved , including getting divorced , or suffering chronic anxiety it is one way that anxiety kills it is that chronic stress indicates a system wide problem that is expressed in telomere length the key ingredient for this is long term stress resulting from more rapid dna replication and the key ingredient , then , is imprinted stress that causes rapid dna turnover generally the earlier it begins the more deleterious it is because unavoidable stress is deadly living in the womb is about as helpless as we get of course what stress does is ramp up levels of cortisol , the stress hormone that work in see saw fashion with telomere length the higher the cortisol the shorter telomeres will be , in the long run when we couple higher cortisol , shorter telomeres together with higher body temperature and elevated blood pressure we have an index of a shorter life fortunately , there is something we can do about it since we do lower vitals after one year of our therapy body temp is on average one degree less and blood pressure in hypertensives are points lower we have not as yet done telomere studies there have been studies on healthy adults who started in life in an institution they had radically lower telomere lengths see nature vol oct , more important , mothers who underwent severe stress while they were carrying death of loved one had offspring with lower than average telomeres i have not seen studies on telomere length in those with adverse gestational lives but we plan to do it particularly , we want to study imprinted stress that continues in our system long after the very early trauma we must never neglect the imprint it is the way we engrave experience in the total system a person can claim that he had a wonderful childhood but if his telomere length is shorter than average we need to examine him more carefully when we have shorter telomeres we can expect that the person will be more vulnerable to such diseases as diabetes and heart problems the shorter length individuals are much more likely to develop cancer , by the way and dementia is another great likelihood can you die from neurosis ? chronic imprinted stress absolutely can you suffer from premature serious illness ? yes , yes can we avoid it ? yes , yes take out the pain it s the pain , my friends take it out and there will be far less smoking , drinking and drug taking , and therefore , longer telomeres it is the telomere that are shouting out the pain in their own way , we need to listen and we need to talk back to them in their own language physiology and we need to say , hang on , friend , we will take your pain away , even if you do not know it is there
