many years ago , my friend mary mcvea was driving me to chicago 's o'hare airport after i had visited with her and her husband robert , a close college friend a lot of our friends are getting divorced , she said and when i ask them why , they tell me something that sounds pretty minor to me and i feel like saying 'that 's it ? ? ? maybe it 's just the last straw or something but i find it puzzling i did , too , until i went back to school to become a marriage and family therapist in my internship and after i was licensed , i encountered many couples in distress some of them were in crisis because of an infidelity or a gambling habit that had emptied family coffers or , in a few cases , overt abuse but many ended up in counseling or divorce court because of a string of little cruelties that added up to marital estrangement what are the little cruelties that add up to marital distress ? they 're as unique as the couples involved there was the couple i met when i arrived at their spacious home to interview the man , a prominent doctor , for a magazine article his wife welcomed me warmly , brought coffee and was returning with a plate of pastries when her husband said brusquely just set that plate down and get out ! we have work to do her face burned with humiliation and anger as she silently withdrew from the room the doctor did n't miss a beat , turning on the charm for the interview as i sat there stunned then there were the couples who came for therapy the wife who never let her husband forget that she had married down and who corrected every statement he made incorrect or not with a running commentary on what he was saying , questioning both his accuracy and intelligence the husband who belittled every interest and pursuit of his wife as stupid and insignificant and fondly called her an airhead when challenged by others , he would smile and say aw , she knows that i love her ! the wife who escalated ordinary disagreements to major crises by giving her husband the silent treatment for days at a time the jazz musician husband who had married an exceptionally talented jazz singer and then never seemed to miss an opportunity to make negative comments about her talent , actually hiring another female singer for his band the wife who had a habit of blaming her husband every time anything went amiss from a balky computer to a rained out picnic with one phrase ca n't you do anything right ? and there was the husband who snapped at his wife whenever he had a bad day at work and then wondered why she tended to keep her distance of course many of these little cruelties are not little at all and some indicate larger problems within the marital relationship but the fact is that casual cruelty , careless words and thoughtless actions all add up to marital tensions and estrangements working with couples , i used to stress the importance of being kind to each other , even when depressed , mad , exasperated , disappointed or otherwise challenged so much more is possible if disagreements are resolved amicably , if spouses are as courteous to each other as they are to good friends some people talk to their spouses in a way they would n't dare with friends yeah , one husband in therapy told me if i talked to my friends the way i talk to my wife well , i would n't because it would hurt their feelings and he thought his wife 's feelings were n't hurt ? he squirmed a bit well , she 's my wife she should understand that i need to blow off steam that 's just the way i am just the way i am i ca n't count how many times i 've heard that in couples counseling as a way to justify casual cruelty it 's a way to say i do n't intend to change or pleasing you is n't worth any discomfort on my part it 's a relationship dead end so what can change a relationship headed downhill ? think before you speak is that just kidding ! comment or barbed humor likely to hurt your spouse ? is that casual aside or that verbal victory worth the cost to your relationship ? consider that it 's more important to be kind than to be relentlessly right remember that your spouse is or could be your dearest friend and treat him or her that way if you would n't say or do what you 're about to do to a dear friend why in the world would you say or do that to your spouse ? change established patterns this is as necessary for the victim as well as the perpetrator as long as you do n't speak up , your spouse has little incentive to change and for spouses who are casually cruel , this is a habit that needs to be broken if the marriage is to survive or thrive work to eradicate hierarchical thinking in your relationship those married to people they consider beneath them in social status , intelligence , education or simply overall worthiness may not only inflict considerable pain and hurt on their spouses , but also miss the joy of realizing their spouse 's unique strengths and talents growing up poor or middle class instead of rich does n't mean a person lacks class the absence of a college or professional degree is not an indication that a person lacks insight or intelligence and the acquisition of such a degree is no guarantee that a person is smart , insightful or wise besides , there are many kinds of intelligence in real life , emotional intelligence may far exceed intellectual ability in becoming a successful human being your spouse is your partner , not your personal joke punch line , not your verbal punching bag do n't minimize those little things maybe they 're not so little to your spouse maybe the accumulated weight of small hurts , flashes of anger , and small betrayals is adding up to a big problem after all , it 's the small things , the casual , passing , small cruelties that can erode love and good will and it 's the small moments of connection and caring , of thoughtfulness and of kindness , one after another after another , that help love grow and flourish in marriage and in life , the small things can make a huge difference
