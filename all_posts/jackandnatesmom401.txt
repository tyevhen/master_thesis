do you remember dorothy 's disappointment when she finally makes it to oz , finds the wizard , pulls back the curtain and realizes the wizard is nothing more than a mere mortal ? that would describe our day at kennedy krieger in a nutshell , we learned nothing new , and were offered nothing useful it 's ok , i know this is going to happen lots of times before we find some answers for natey , it 's just a bit frustrating first thing , they asked us to have nathan fast prior to his blood draw ever made a highly routinized child not eat his breakfast ? it 's not a pretty picture still , it did n't bother me , as it was for a good cause this was the blood draw that would look for signs of oxidative stress , and was specifically for children with regressive autism they wo n't say it , but they are looking at stress on the body from things like gasp vaccines ! you know , those things they swear up and down are safe safe safe ? in any case , we brought our cranky little boy in , and to their credit , they took us right up for the blood draw but the phlebotomist sucked ! i try very hard not to be judgmental of other health professionals , and honestly , i have always been in awe of how effortlessly phlebotomists can get blood , especially from children they really know their landmarks and most of them do n't even seem like they need to feel the vein yeah , this woman did n't have that skill at all she kept dropping the needle on his arm before she started and then when she missed his vein she just sat there motionless , neither giving up or fishing which i hate but is occasionally necessary and then that was it she would n't try again so we starved our kid , both took the day off of work , and drove an hour to their greenspring location and already , minutes in , he is going to be excluded from one of the two studies we came for ? what happened to grabbing a different phlebotomist ? or taking a breather and then trying again ? or heat packs ? i am not trying to be cruel to nathan , not saying , stick him til it hurts , but come on i mean , they put iv 's in preemies ! heck , i drew blood from one of my oncology patients' thumbs one time ! if she missed twice , then ok , but let 's make an effort here i am mad at myself for not asserting my parental authority a bit more , but what was i going to say ? again ! come on lady stick my kid ! and they could n't try later in the day since by then he had eaten after the blood draw came the one test that both john and i found extremely interesting and it actually did yield some reassuring data basically , nate was put in a high chair in front of a television and shown a series of images , one would pop up on the screen then the other , they would move , disappear , etc some of these images were also faces they had a machine that was tracking his eye movements , to see if he would shift attention from the first object to the second object , to see what area of the face he was studying , to show if he had a preference of one face over another familiar one vs novel one at the end of the test she was able to show us his eye movements on the computer screen he did shift his attention to the second objects , then shift back to the first object he did look directly at the faces , and always at the mouth the tester said this was an excellent indicator that he truly is trying to figure out speech and language he also would favor a novel face over a familiar one these are all appropriate reactions something you really never think about , but fascinating the next step was the typical developmental assessment portion this lasted approximately two and a half hours as you can imagine , most of this was play based , as we are talking about a two year old here they only tested comprehension , receptive language today no expressive language , that would be later on in this second study there was nothing really new in the findings , he is severely delayed , think receptive language of a month old on an emotional level , it never gets easier to watch your child struggle , or , in the eyes of the evaluator , fail this was the first time john has really had to sit through the full battery of tests with one of the boys mom and dad are not really allowed to help or encourage nathan much during the evaluation i could viscerally feel john struggling not to scream wait he can do that ! during certain portions of the testing at one point , he asked me why i was so quiet we all know i'm never quiet right ? i have found that it 's better for me to just say nothing at all because i might let out a primal scream if i open my mouth it 's so damned frustrating to watch ! that being said , there were moments today when i was really proud of nathan some of his aba stuff is really paying off he worked his puzzle completely independently , followed direction under duress much more effectively than he ever has in the past there were certain toys that he knew exactly what to do with and i would have to say this is the first time i have ever seen him do it without any prompting that was really encouraging do you remember way back to my first post where i talked about nathan just giving up after trying to pull his cup out of the diaper bag ? how he never even tried to ask for help ? i use that a baseline and am constantly assessing his communication based on how he asks for his cup hilarious during this assessment the boy was obsessed he still does n't say cup but he does say more and every time we snuck the cup away from him he would run back and forth between john and me asking for more even if we distracted him for a few minutes , he would go right back to it when he remembered eventually i asked the evaluator to move my bag out of the room it was the only way to make sure he understood the cup was off the table tenacious little guy and i am thrilled for me , it 's tangible progress once the evaluation portion was done , they calculated nate 's results and determined if he was eligible for this second study he was then they found out which arm he was randomized to one arm involves school , at the greenspring location , days a week am for months starting in late june plus daytime parent classes the other arm was parent classes at night we knew we were only going to be able to participate if we were randomized to the second arm and we were n't we were placed in the classroom group i should be thrilled but there is no physical way that this can happen his current aba is to days a week , so i would have to switch him to this program for the next months , then switch him back to his other program in november , and then when he turns three in december he gets moved to another program too many transitions for nate not to mention the hour commute each way for a two year old , and the fact that , oh yeah , i have another child , and a full time job i just do n't see how this can happen i did n't give them a definitive no yet , but it 's pretty much inevitable i am bummed so we came out technically no better than when we went in at least i know where the facility is ? and there are several other studies that have n't started recruiting subjects yet they have our permission to contact us for these i guess if nothing else , they know who we are , and they know we are willing to do anything within our power for our son so hopefully we 'll get some calls sometimes , what you think is your goal is not it at all maybe this day served a far greater purpose maybe there is something much bigger coming in the future that we will now be privy to because of our actions today fingers crossed !
