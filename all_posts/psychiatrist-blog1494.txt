i'm posting after the fact , but i did watch the paul returns to gina episode last night can i give this episode a few sub titles why i do n't have a home office why do n't these people listen to each other ? so paul returns to tell gina that kate really is having an affair an insurance agent an employment guy a supermarket manager i guess he was n't listening he talks about his disconnection from his childrens' lives and how kate blames him for his neglect while paul has mentioned once last week that a patient says she 's in love with him , that erotic transference thing , he has n't said much about it , and gina repeatedly and insistently as if by crystal ball comes back to the feelings paul must have towards laura as the source of his marital woes , and therefore , we can assume , in having some role in kate 's need for another relationship outside the marriage he does eventually confess that laura 's beautiful and he 'enjoys' the flattery and the feelings but well before this , gina was probing him laura could have been the ugliest , most unavailable woman in the world but gina was insisting i hate it when therapists do that sure , patients repress things or do n't see the obvious , but in real life , you 're just testing theories , and if a patient backs away from an idea , you figure that either you the therapist were wrong , or that the patient needs more time or a new way to see this , and you back off you do n't ram your theories down their throats or i do n't it was interesting that paul was eventually hammered into looking at the connection between laura and his feelings , but it could have just as easily turned into a repeat of last week 's screaming sessions , and unlike any of my patients , paul has the benefit of a professional script writer to compose his lines for him paul talks about kate 's jealousy of his home office , of her feeling excluded and not important to him he mentions that she was in it after the miscarrying couple left he did n't mention that she was there because he barked an order for her to come help with the damn spot , and he mocks kate saying what happens in this office ? nothing in their real life compares to what goes on here and she never feels like his top priority i ask my husband if he ever feels that my work comes first , and he says never point for dinah , zip for paul i hate to offend anyone , but much of what goes on in a therapist 's office is mundane , while neat things happen , or there are frequent i wish i could write about this on my blog moments , it 's not that magical i think about our real life house it was built generations ago by a doctor and some form of doctor has always owned it we are the first family in which that doctor is the wife , not the husband there is a separate entrance , and until the owners before us , the first floor was divided into a physician 's office i do n't really know what the layout was , but as we doing the final walk through , the former owner a hospitalist who did n't have his practice at home pointed out that a radiology tank used to be where our tv now is , the bathroom had been relocated , essentially , our playroom , family room , laundry area , were all somehow a separate physician 's suite it would n't be so hard to reconfigure this into a shrink 's office , with the separate walkway and door already there , and people have asked why i do n't have an office in my house so if you watched in treatment the last few days , you know that spending a few bucks on office rent , especially if you have a family and all those bathroom issues paul seems to have , is n't such a bad idea so we move on to learn that gina 's husband david died just a year ago and here 's a fun subplot paul had referred his good friend charlie to gina for treatment charlie fell in love with gina and he told paul that gina was in love with him we see from her face this is true charlie , like david , is now conveniently dead so we can talk about all this with no hope of fixing it paul is angry that gina 's response to her feelings for her patient his friend was to run away to england on sabbatical with her husband huh , charlie was her only patient ? no college tuitions or morgates to pay , i suppose paul writes her script that this was the reason why ? there 's no room here for other possibilities requirement of david 's work , once in a lifetime opportunity , nope , without asking , he 's told her that she dropped her practice , picked up her hubby , and moved across the big pond to escape charlie gina flinches so we figure it 's true , but a little more convincing with the script writing , huh ? why do n't these people ask , try out their theories , consider other options paul mentions there sessions are like debate teams where everyone goes in ready to plug for their side without hearing the other 's side yup this is n't therapy and it is n't supervision , and it 's only by virtue of television that they have n't thrown those pretty water glasses at each other just for the record , paul says if he transferred every patient he was attracted to , he would n't have a practice interesting i do n't believe that 's the usual
