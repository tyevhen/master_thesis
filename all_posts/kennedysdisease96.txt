we are snowed in again it snowed most of the day friday and then froze solid last night i commented in any earlier post that i would not complain about the cold again this winter well , this post is not a complaint i have resigned myself that this winter is one of the tougher ones , and that complaining will not bring spring any quicker to the sun belt besides , punxsulawney phil saw his shadow and we all know what that means i was reviewing my journal this morning and came across comments about my love for winter it is unusually cold for northern georgia this morning it is degrees and the high might reach we thought we moved away from this type of weather my hands and legs are not functioning well this morning the cold makes my hands more clubs than functioning fingers and hands they just do not seem to want to work the cold also affects my ability to use my legs i find myself feeling much weaker even though temperatures in the house are still comfortable , the cold still seems to affect the functioning of the muscles i wear long underwear , wool socks , a hooded sweatshirt , and even have heat packs for my gloves they all seem to help , but they do not eliminate the problem fortunately , we are supposed to be in the 's again for christmas being born and raised in minnesota , you would think these georgia temperatures would not bother me winter was just a part of minnesota weather and it never slowed us down as a teenager , we camped out when it was below zero we would hunt , fish , hike , and play football and basketball outside no matter how cold it was one of our favorite pastimes was to wander around town during snowstorms and help people when their cars were stuck or occasionally buried in snow we even would snow ski in the ditches of country roads while being pulled by a car i think you get the idea winter was not a hardship in minnesota it was just another playground for kids i found this cartoon and it made me laugh if you have ever milked cows in the wintertime , you will appreciate it now , when the temperatures drop below degrees , i have to wear gloves it is frustrating when you are unable to pick up a piece of paper or a glass because my fingers and thumbs will not work if it is cold for the sun belt , by the time i come in from walking my dog , i have to run my hands under warm water or wrap them around a cup of hot tea or cocoa when the temperatures are below freezing , i use the heat packs and they help i also wear wool gloves inside of wool and leather choppers when we lived in pennsylvania , many times while shoveling the driveway my hands just could not grip the shovel often i would just rest the handle on the wrist to continue to shovel the snow if it was slippery , my legs would become fatigued quickly while trying to stand or walk i would dread falling down because i knew i would not have enough strength to stand up without help one time during a heavy snowfall , i walked through three foot of snow to fill up the bird feeders near the back of our property on the way back to the garage , i lost my balance and went down in the deep snow , i just could not stand up no matter how i much i tried to leverage myself , nothing worked i ended up crawling through the snow to the garage i was recently reading the kda forum a fellow kd'er recommended something that might help during these abnormally cold days i have found when in severe pain to buy thermacare products i use the lg xlg back warmer for back , neck , fingers i wrap my hands in them , etc there 's one for knees ! the neck one does n't seem to give off enough heat it makes a car trip bearable , the nighttime manageable , and daytime i can somewhat keep up with my kids well worth the cost i buy in bulk at sam 's i am not considering these thermacare products for pain relief i want them to warm my body i wonder if punxsulawney phil would ever consider accepting a bribe ? please feel free to comment by taking a moment to share your thoughts you add much to these articles the articles then become more than just something i said or believe in addition , by adding a comment , you might just be helping the next reader by sharing your opinion , experience , or a helpful tip you can comment by clicking on comments below or by sending me an email i look forward to hearing from you
