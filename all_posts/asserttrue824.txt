i just finished reading a paper called the energy cost of ssl in deeply embedded systems , by sun microsystems researchers vipul gupta and michael wurm fascinating stuff it turns out that secure communication over ssl shortens battery life by approximately in very small mote like wireless devices that use ssl the size of such devices commonly used as sensors in manufacturing , but soon to be all around us , if you believe the sci fi hype makes them extraordinarily sensitive to anything that draws electrical current , including computation in a mote , it 's not uncommon for of the available energy from a pair of alkaline batteries to be consumed by ssl handshakes , by polling , by ssl data transfer , and the remaining by the device itself those ratios will be different for non secure non ssl data transfer if you do the apples to apples energy balance , the ssl mote pays an energy penalty of , overall , for security the authors of the paper do n't discuss things like efficient versus inefficient implementations in assembly language of handshake algorithms such as elliptic curve , but obviously a poor implementation could significantly affect performance an unfriendly chip architecture could affect things too the authors do mention that the particular chip they used ti msp offers a rotate instruction which speeds up sha and md by almost motes are n't ubiquitous yet , but hopefully by the time they are , they 'll be powered by something other than batteries e g , ambient light , so that we do n't have to worry about ssl causing even more zinc and manganese to enter the environment when worn out mote batteries find their way into landfills imagine that ssl as an environmental threat
