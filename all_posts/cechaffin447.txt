wounded i know this clotting wound will never heal but i can keep it clean for you , o lord until the resurrection makes me real you rose with all your wounds it s no big deal to fall on ploughshares and discover a sword i know this clotting wound will never heal the tragic movie spins from reel to reel , the audience either suffering or bored until the resurrection makes them real i tell my wife , don t ask me how i feel pain is less when pain can be ignored i know this clotting wound will never heal minds are meant to know and lips to seal but if i were an apple i d be cored until the resurrection makes me real i look inside and watch my blood congeal i know my way it s neither from nor toward i know this clotting wound will never heal until the resurrection makes me real there is a danger in villanelles of sacrificing substance to suit the form , and the required repetition can turn an average line into a bad one but i won t comment on today s effort it s the effort that matters kathleen returned to work yesterday and returned in a good deal of pain , but there are more workers in her area so she didn t have to work as hard as before she wears a back brace now , which i think is more helpful in reminding a patient of proper mechanics than any direct benefit i tried a number of back braces when i still had hope for improvement yesterday my doctor suggested a long acting narcotic for my pain but i told him i d think about it i must see a qualified psychiatrist to consult about my medications before i add another for mere physical pain , which is , as i have said before , not comparable to emotional pain perhaps the flagellation practiced by monks eased their spiritual pain more than denying the flesh pain can be a welcome distraction from depression because it seems real i should practice my html today , but unfortunately i haven t been able to figure out how to log into my website from here the course scares me because i m a novice and have so much to learn then i remember that s how i felt in nearly every course i ve ever taken i feel anxiety until i master the subject , so i try too hard too early to understand it all i don t feel very chatty today at kilorats , ce
