as most of my faithful blog followers already know , i write for cracked com these guys if you 've stumbled randomly upon my blog while traversing the abyss of the internet , and my finicky website is currently functioning as intended , you can find my previous two articles somewhere near the top of this page , under cracked articles my third article will have something to do with touching reunions that went horribly awry i ca n't actually tell you what it will be called or when it will be posted until the day it 's actually strung up for the world to gaze upon , because i have only slightly more control over that than the janitor who cleans the cracked offices at night , but you can rest assured that i 'll let you know when it 's available or you could just keep refreshing the cracked homepage now your choice
