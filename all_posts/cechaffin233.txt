here 's a poem of mine that was just purchased by sigurd magazine dare because i doubt my being i drape you in words like papier mache' that when you withdraw i have a hollow to inhabit everyone is jesus to me , everyone who leaves a space to occupy notice how many hollows letters contain and the spaces between words i dare you to find me they had a submission policy of twelve lines or less for poetry , which made submitting a challenge glad i found something they liked i just found out from cider press that my poetry ms did not even make the finalists , and tony hoagland chose a book by stacey lynn brown as the winner if you google her you 'll find very few online references , nothing like mine but i never do well in contests , though magazine editors seem to like me and of course , she is married to a poet and has an mfa , so is probably better connected with the poetry world my poetry has always striven for depth , for meaning , and much of today 's poetry seems chatty and trivial to me but i have no mfa , so i speak out of turn i bought a huge vegetarian cookbook today world vegetarian classics at kathleen 's urging , since the one i was using was limited even so , she wanted pork for dinner ! should go well with my vegetarian chile now , norm , i 'll conclude this brief note with no reference to youknowwhat cheers , ce
