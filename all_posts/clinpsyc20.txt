abilify for depression you 've seen the ads you 've hopefully read this blog , and the excellent series in the la times from melissa healy the advantage over placebo is nothing to get particularly excited about especially from the patients' point of view as i have mentioned previously , the two studies that were touted by key opinion leaders are supporting the efficacy of abilify for depression suffered from a number of problems most germane to this post , the patient self report rating scales did not indicate a significant advantage for abilify in either study well , yet another abilify for depression study is out in cns spectrums and guess what still not a significant advantage over placebo according to patients so in each of three large studies , abilify has failed to beat a placebo according to patients' self report these three trials are the basis for the massive marketing campaign and an fda approval abilify started off as an also ran antipsychotic but times have changed bristol myers squibb 's ceo prophetically stated in after abilify 's approval as a treatment for bipolar disorder this approval underscores our commitment to delivering innovative solutions that address unmet needs for a broad spectrum of patients with mental illness , as well as their families and health care providers he could as easily have stated this approval underscores our commitment to rebranding our unpopular antipsychotic as a swiss army knife broad spectrum psychotropic that treats everything under the sun if i can get the fda and the public to believe that this akathisia inducing bottom feeder can treat depression , then i 'll be loaded , bwaah , ha ha ha ha ! ! ! ok , maybe he did n't actually say any of those things , but his broad spectrum comment was literally right on the money just do n't ask those pesky patients what they think they might tell you it 's no better than a damn sugar pill yes , i'm aware that on some other rating scales , abilify was rated as superior to a placebo , but i'm thinking that if the patient self report of depression is consistently not favorable for abilify , then who are we kidding by calling it an antidepressant ? robert m berman , maurizio fava , michael e thase , madhukar h trivedi , ren swanink , robert d mcquade , william h carson , david adson , leslie taylor , james hazel , ronald n marcus aripiprazole augmentation in major depressive disorder a double blind , placebo controlled study in patients with inadequate response to antidepressants cns spectrums , ,
