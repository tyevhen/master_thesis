a minimum of billion dollars saved that is what i thought could be achieved by eliminating insurance companies from the american health care system it turns out the savings are a lot bigger than that just looking at countries where the per capita health care costs are at least and comparing the usa to switzerland the country with the next highest per capita health care costs we get the following equation the difference x million current population the the us billion that is what converting the us health care system to single payer would involve no more managed care companies mcos pretending to be efficient no more pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms rationing medications in order to make profits no more outrageous obamacare premiums that seem to be rising with no end in sight no more mcos , and pbms making your doctor 's life miserable and burning him or her out the writing should be on the wall by now for all americans the us congress and their healthcare lobbyists fully intend to continue the unsustainable health care bureaucracy to every american until the last possible moment that is as true for republicans as it was for democrats what do i mean by unsustainable ? according to kff org in employer purchased health insurance policies averaged , per year , paid by the employer and , paid by the employee for retirees the situation is even more stark i used the aarp calculator to look at estimated health care costs only in retirement for a theoretical couple retiring at the result was an estimated , of that total only , was covered by medicare and that left a shortage of in out of pocket costs to me that means the average social security dependent senior citizen in this country cannot cover their health care costs even with medicare some of them are telling me their supplemental policies are as high as , to , year for any couple trying to stay in their own home in retirement health insurance premiums and property taxes will easily absorb most if not all social security income the gross estimate by this calculator varies from state to state but some sources have given the gross average amount for a retired couple to be about , and where does all of that money go ? that is easy it goes to bad management in a country that has fewer doctors and fewer hospital beds than most countries in the above graph it should be obvious that rationing medical care to make profits for wall street does not work two recent experiences will illustrate the problem i heard a presentation given by a speaker from one of the major physician run medical clinics in the us for some reason she started talking about the ratio of administrators to physicians in their organization the number given was administrators to every physician that is an absolutely stunning number with that number of people in hospitals and clinics it should raise the question what are they doing there ? and why does it take this many people to administer the most accountable professionals in the us ? not only that but what has all of this administrative oversight accomplished ? the answer is in the graph at the top of this page the most expensive and most inefficient health care system in the world it is basically an expensive jobs program for managers and bureaucrats , and bad technology the second scenario was a physician talking with me about his speciality clinic of physicians he recently learned that they were being administered by mid level administrators reporting to a single higher level administrator when he questioned this practice , he was asked why he was concerned about the number of administrative staff i guess according to the previous estimate he was doing quite well with a ratio of administrators for medical staff the real impetus for this post occurred as i was doing some exercises at home before work this morning the today show was playing in the background matt lauer and katie couric were interviewing trump advisor kellyanne conway about a number of issues i heard the question have they republicans come up with something to replace obamacare ? ms conway responded with the typical free market solutions buying insurance across state lines , health savings accounts , etc , etc none of these are solutions to bad management and what is basically corporate welfare for the army of healthcare administrators in this country the only correct response to that question is single payer health insurance get rid of the unnecessary managers and save a trillion dollars in mismanagement george dawson , md , dfapa attribution the figure on per capita health care spending is from the kaiser family foundation accessed on january , and this is their citation oecd , health spending indicator doi dee en accessed on january i have no affiliation with the kaiser family foundation or the oecd and their graphic is used here per their terms of use for non commercial , non profit sites supplementary i would be remiss in not pointing out the mountain of fake news that goes into getting americans to believe that some kind of government led reform that concentrates market power into a few for profit proxies is a good idea there is the associated fake news from both parties that just happens to leave the pricing power to private industries , in that context the fake news by ms conway this morning is all part of an unmistakable years of nonsense stretching back to the clinton administration and their idea about managed competition we have had nothing but mismanaged competition ever since the dynamic in health care is an obvious parallel to the financial services industry and their guaranteed profits from the work of congress in both cases , all americans foot the bill supplementary let me remind the free market advocates that there is not now and there will never be a free market in health care or anything else in the usa it is largely a republican fantasy the major markets in the us all depend on government intervention and the sector with the best lobbyists gets the most favorable deals it is the only way to explain a trillion in waste , just based on free market management not including other boondoggles like a highly regarded electronic health record that is less functional than s database software and paying for cents worth of epinephrine
