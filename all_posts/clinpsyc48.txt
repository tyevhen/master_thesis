below is a guest post from tim desmond i do not necessarily agree with all of the the contents of the post below , but i thought the topic was thought provoking and controversial , so i have agreed to publish it feel free to add comments as you see fit i will likely add my two cents in the next couple days i would like to contribute to the discussion on this blog by summarizing the work of richard bentall , psychologist and award winning author , on psychiatric diagnosis and the dsm iv while we may be able to agree that long term use of neuroleptics should not be the treatment of choice for schizophrenia , or that bipolar disorder is being over diagnosed in children , i would invite us to question whether 'schizophrenia' or 'bipolar disorder' are valid diagnoses at all over the course of his career richard bentall has critiqued the medical model of modern psychiatric diagnosis and proposed instead a more personalized symptom based approach the basic question is this do people suffer from a finite number of discrete psychiatric disorders diseases or do people experience varying degrees of human suffering in their own idiosyncratic ways which include spectrums of sadness , fear , dissociation , etc ? the modern mental health establishment clearly subscribes to the former as evidenced by the structure of the dsm and the theory of 'chemical imbalance ' this belief is so pervasive that even people who claim to disagree with the medical model of diagnosis often think within its terms for example , the idea that one can be 'misdiagnosed' presupposes that a correct diagnosis could exist similarly , saying that schizophrenia is partially caused by psychological factors assumes that 'schizophrenia' is a valid way to group people the theory that psychological distress is caused by a finite number of psychiatric diseases can be attributed to emil kraepelin , who first published his compendium of psychiatry in kraepelin believed that the psychiatric patients he treated suffered from diseases analogous to any treated by a practitioner of internal medicine note the common comparison today between psychiatric diagnoses and diabetes forwarded by the pharmaceutical industry he said a specific disease process should generate identical symptoms , have identical pathological anatomy and identical etiology or cause according to kraepelin , all that was needed was for these diseases to be discovered in order for diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry to catch up with the rest of medicine since it was far beyond the knowledge of his time or ours for that matter to find common pathological anatomies or etiologies , he chose to group symptoms he believed that if he grouped symptoms 'correctly' the people grouped together would be sharing the same underlying disease they would therefore have the same anatomical problems , the same etiology and respond more or less identically to treatment he hoped that this kind of systematizing would lead to great advances in the efficacy of treatment while kraepelin 's categories have changed over time and grown from to over , the basic idea persists to this day that there are a finite number of discrete psychiatric disorders diseases people can have and if we were to somehow group symptoms 'correctly' we would have isolated real disorders diseases the problem with this idea is that it is not at all based in evidence it began as kraepelin 's assumption and he was unable to provide any research in his lifetime to support it however , it has been an idea so compelling to psychiatrists that they have tried in vain to support it for over one hundred years in fact , there is a large body of research that directly contradicts this theory for example , you would expect that if one doctor diagnosed you with strep throat , you would be able to go to any other doctor and get the same diagnosis and you 'd be right the reason for this is that strep throat is a real disease associated with an infection of streptococcal bacteria you either have it or you do n't and there are reliable ways to test if you do however , if you are experiencing severe psychological distress and one psychiatrist diagnoses you with bipolar disorder there is only a chance that the next one you see would give you the same diagnosis why is this ? both psychiatrists would have been highly trained in diagnosis , and they would be using the same criteria to make their judgment so if one says you have ptsd , another says bipolar and a third says brief psychotic disorder , which is the correct diagnosis ? what do you really have ? bentall argues the problem is that kraepelin 's main assumption that there are a finite number of discrete psychiatric disorders is just not true you do n't have any of those disorders because they are not real instead he argues that any psychiatric patient is experiencing a high level of emotional distress that is expressing itself through a range of symptoms and these symptoms can be better understood as extreme expressions of normal human responses to distress bentall advocates for abandoning psychiatric diagnoses altogether he claims that psychiatry 's stubborn attempt to treat mental distress as a medical problem is what has led to its inability to improve treatment outcomes over time citing a large body of research , bentall shows that symptoms from depressed mood to hallucinations can be accounted for psychologically and that doing so is not only more in line with science but more humanizing to patients therefore he favors what he calls a 'complaint oriented' approach in which each patient would be assessed according to his or her unique symptomology the focus becomes the symptoms themselves and we avoid trying to groups them into arbitrary non existent disorders symptoms can be understood and treated , while disorders cannot because they are not real to learn more about bentall 's work , read his 'madness explained' which won the british psychological society 's book award author note tim desmond offers phone counseling and training for therapists through his website at www coherencecounseling com
