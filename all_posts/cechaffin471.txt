i had a lovely break and possibly a life changing experience at the men 's retreat time will tell i think that last night , due to the experience of the retreat and resuming zyprexa an antipsychotic drug used in severe depressions and also mania , my head came above water and i feel much better today , though admittedly fragile i can even wrap my brain around the idea of hope having to construct something to hope upon eliot , ash wednesday i wrote this sonnet today it began in my too busy mind while i was watering the garden i could n't post a sonnet for sonnet sunday because i was where bears proverbially shit the raven be quiet my head , suspend your ceaseless chatter the soup inside your skull is boiling hot with details and demons it doesn t matter whatever you thought you thought , you already thought be quiet my head , the animals command you they have no words for water , air or food and yet they drink and eat just as we do but have no scent for being misunderstood see that large raven ? when he calls he calls for now and for forever , and when he flies he has no thought of flying but never falls his being is his doing he knows no lies , unlike his human brothers who march to war and soon forget what they were fighting for i will not rate myself in kilorats or bunnies faith is all thine , ce
