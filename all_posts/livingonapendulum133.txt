originally posted on facebook august , the other day my daughter told me that she came to the realization that she did not have a passion something that helps her look forward to every day some people write , sing , sew , garden , paint , draw etc something that they love and can lose themselves into , forgetting worries , relaxing and finding their centre , in essence rejuvenate themselves did n't matter whether or not they are any good at it it 's done for the joy of it , not for what others think it made me think i knew she used to have many passions , drawing and singing however it seems she lost those passions because she did not get adequate feedback so maybe it was not a passion after all ? then i started thinking about my passions i have had many passions , many at the same time skating was a love of mine when i would put on my skates and hit the ice , the world would drift away later , drawing and writing became an escape i have written many poems to chase away tears , boredom or to underline joy ! were they good poems well who cares ? arts and craft , creating , decorating was also an amazing escape everything i did , everywhere i went , i saw things as a project and saw possibilities of beauty remember , beauty is nin the eye of the beholder i may have been alone in my visions last dancing was something that could make me smile and my saddest moments what are my passions now ? nothing nothing i do brings me joy nothing in my life makes me happy to get up in the morning i have nothing that i look forward to many things like skating dancing or taking a simple walk have become so painful and exhausting , they are torture to even think about decorating and painting have become a dreadful chore i try to recapture those things , but i do n't even feel motivated anymore life has become one being obligation after another , one problem after the next for every moment of peace there is tenfold pain and sorrow i see and admire people like my friend paul , who have adversity and pain thrust upon them and who seem to only grow stronger and more inspiring , who have that strength to fight and overcome those who become their own self motivators and cheerleaders gosh i wish i had half of that wonderful love for life that keeps them going no matter what ! i wish my personality was a third as engaging and charismatic instead i am socially inept and boring untalented and weak
