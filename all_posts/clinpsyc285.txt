very sad news to report pharma giles , easily the most entertaining pharma related blog , has decided to call it quits i wish he were just pulling a peter rost and retiring for a week , then coming back , but giles strikes me as pretty serious that being said please don't go ! ! ! pharmagossip and peter rost agree with me , as i'm sure do others you ca n't possibly leave who will fill your shoes ?
