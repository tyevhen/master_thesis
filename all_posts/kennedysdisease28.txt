profiles of young researchers in an earlier post called , the nine stages , i mentioned hope was the ninth stage i ended the post by saying , with acceptance , and armed with the additional knowledge that researchers were working diligently towards finding a treatment and potentially a cure , i discovered something that had been missing recently in my life hope in my post , another ray of hope on the research front , i commented , how fortunate we are that another generation has picked up the baton and continues to move towards the finish line finding a treatment or cure as long as someone is carrying the baton , we have hope in this post , i wish to recognize another researcher who is carrying the baton tobias jochum , post grad student , is a researcher at the institute for synchroton radiation , forgschungszentrum karlsruhe , in eggenstein leopoldshafen , germany bruce why did you decide to focus your research on kennedy 's disease ? tobias after my diploma thesis , which was more related to different biophysical techniques , i decided to move on with a more biological topic for my phd however , i wanted to use the knowledge that i had acquired during my studies for the prospective phd project together with my diploma supervisor dr david moss and prof andrew c cato we discussed in a few meetings how research on sbma kennedy 's disease and modern biophysical methods could be combined in order to contribute to this research field i decided then to study the current literature and found out that sbma kennedy 's disease and the related polyq diseases are open research areas this made me curious bruce briefly summarize what you are currently working on and why you feel it is important in kd research tobias my research on sbma has the objective to use recent technological advancements in biophysical methods to characterize the protein aggregation process in kennedy 's disease which is caused by the polyglutamine extended sequences in the androgen receptor this , we believe , will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular processes associated with sbma kennedy 's disease it will also provide a robust assay that could be used to predict the efficacy of future chemical compounds for the treatment of sbma kennedy 's disease bruce what are your aspirations career goals ? tobias first of all , i want to finish my phd afterwards i will try to find a post doc position that should definitely be related to neurodegeneration and studies using biophysical methods
