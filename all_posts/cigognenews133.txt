this is a dialogue about my war years art there was a guy called larry allred and the dangerous part of war was what i did n't realize until the last week , was he and i were on a troop ship with troops going to war and going to europe and german submarines were everywhere shooting down and torpedoing our boats , but he and i never talked about it , we never even were afraid and he was a tough guy , a very tough guy so i got off the ship , i went to a commando center , in the south of france , and he became the admiral 's driver , in london so i went to visit him and while i was there , i , it was just before and after the blitz , there were bombs everywhere and rubble everywhere anyway , he and i and his girlfriend slept together we did n't make anything of it , it was just like , this was war and we were all just pals , you know it was a very different atmosphere so i lost touch with him for a long time and one day , twenty years later i called , and i said , how are you doing larry alread ? and i said , larry , how are you doing ? he said , fine , da da da , and i said listen , i 've got to go back to work now , but i 'll leave you my number and you can call me he said , i ca n't i said , why ca n't you ? he 's a tough guy now do n't forget he says , i'm blind and instead of saying to him , why are you blind , was it the war , what happened ? i just hung up i was so shocked and then i read his obit , two days ago , and that he had alzheimer 's , he died of alzheimer 's , but it did n't say he was blind and i do n't even know if he came out of it or what but he was my war pal , and we were , in all the battles that i was in , the worst was being chased by german submarines because they were after us night and day and we had warning signals , they had destroyers around us at all times , circling us , going this way while we were going that way , and you know , it was harrowing because they had blown up a million troop ships , you know , they were circling cause we were the guys that were going to fight them , so , and eventually i got ready to fight them with the rhine crossing , we crossed the rhine and went into germany to fight em , anyway , that 's another story so i lost larry , and i never followed up , and a lifetime passed , and i never knew what happened to him or why , i mean , except that he died of alzheimer 's and then i do n't know what happened in the war , we lived in , he lived in , he had an office at a very luxurious hotel in london because he was the admiral 's driver but then we had a little place just outside of london , i forgot the name of it , but i used to live there , i forgot the name of it , and he had a gorgeous girlfriend , and they had sex , while i was sleeping , but nothing was ever made of anything , there was no morality , no moral stuff , it was just life is what it was david you were trying to get through the war art yeah , that was just my life with larry , and here he 's dead , most of my guys on my ship are dead and i'm still here , but life is short , man , and that 's the sum total art now dwight eisenhower , he used to say , he was n't very bright , but about these things he was very bright , and he said you can never recapture the atmosphere of war , never recapture the atmosphere of war and it 's so true because everything during the war was so different , so different , and everything had an urgency about it , you know , and i mean , i was in many many battles , and i never even knew i was going to die , i mean , until a guy who came aboard my ship to driver food and chocolate , i was in the aleutians where it was like below , and we were chased by japanese submarines , again would you believe , this time japanese not german , and they would wait , we had iron gates on the battleship , we had iron gates in front of us so that japanese submarines could not get at us and then we had to wait for our dash time , so we could get out of there and try and come back to japanese torpedoes and we had destroyers to help us pave the way and get us out of there , and then we chased the japanese fleet all the way back to japan but before we did that we had two battles , one in kiska and one in attu , and i remember the one in attu , the fog was so thick you could maybe see three or four inches before your nose but that was it but we 'd hear a bang and they were setting off canons , and then we 'd hear a splash , but we never knew where it was coming from or where it was going so the terror of waiting for each of their big bombs , you know , and not knowing where they were going , was very very disconcerting , to say the least and then we got up there and they forgot to send us foul weather here , would you believe , so we 're below zero , i'm wearing towels to keep myself warm and then what happened after that ? we had two sea battles , oh we chased the japanese fleet and that night we came back and went straight down to the pacific for a bunch of other battles we had the worst one was tarawa that was a very famous one , we were the first ship in , and they wiped out a whole platoon of us soldiers because they were hiding behind certain barriers that we could n't see , and then they opened up on the soldiers and hundreds of em died , and they were floating in the water , and stuff , you know , it was just terrible but i was n't old enough , i was n't human enough , to understand where it all ends
