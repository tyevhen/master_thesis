the weather remains cool , gray and wet around here my mood , however , not so much the dip i feared never really materialized , and for that i am extremely grateful i saw my doc on thursday , and she gave me a nice pep talk she is so supportive she reminded me i 've worked very hard and devoted myself to maintaining my physical and mental health she was confident i was having a little lull of which i could pull myself out her confidence in me feels good , and her pep talk did help i left her office feeling emboldened and immediately experienced a lifting of my spirits she gave me exactly what i needed at that time my sponsor and i got together friday night , which always feels good i love working my program of recovery , and my sponsor is a great role model after attending an inspiring meeting this morning , two women celebrated over years of sobriety , i got some more recovery time in while running miles with my friend , t i usually do all of my training alone , so it 's always nice when t and i get together to cover some miles i enjoyed our run and chat the rest of my weekend will be restful i do n't have to work i'm tapering for grandmas marathon , so i do n't have to run much in a couple hours my house will be clean and my laundry done there are a few social things going on , but i have n't yet decided if i will attend or not i may just stay in and enjoy the peace if it does n't rain , i may spend tomorrow in the woods with jet we have n't been hiking together yet it was one of my favorite things to do with puck , so i'm anxious to introduce jet to my favorite state park and trails i think he 'll love it , and i know i will love watching him experience it for the first time until we meet again , carry on with health and happiness , my friends
