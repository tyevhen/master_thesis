the unfaithful , ungrateful , diabolical servant , maria martinez talk about a generic spanish name was briefly jailed last friday and posted bond and has since been released all week i 've been trying to get our lawyer to find a date to get our dog and stuff back monday i signed four copies of an official letter to the judge requesting the return of our possessions , considering that maria was guilty and did not deny her perfidy before composing the letter our lawyer asked me in all seriousness what he should list for recovery i told him if her read the prosecutor 's file there was a two page list of the same without embarrassment he said , ok , and wrote all things listed in the prosecutor 's file hard to find good help anymore hard to find good professional help in mexico altogether i called him again today , but he was out sick and not answering his cell phone , which he rarely does , having actually returned two calls in four months so i called the prosecutor and he 's going to meet with us tomorrow to decide on a date to get our stuff back every time i write stuff i think of george carlin what that date will be , i do n't know , but our stuff is now spread between three of her domiciles and we do n't know where kenyon is i will request a police escort for a show of force after we have everything that remains , if she has n't sold it all for fun and profit , nor made tacos of our dog , we can get out of here and return to that enfant terrible to the north i 've always wanted to eat dog they have a special medium size hairless breed here that some keep as pets , descended from the aztecs as dog was an indian delicacy and remains a korean one , i have an open mind besides , a street vender in morelia was not long ago arrested for serving human tacos they found a refrigerated torso in his basement , but it was n't clear that he murdered anyone he was just trying to lower his butcher 's bill , apparently i have completed the second draft of my tome on t s eliot 's four quartets , which weighed in at , words after kathleen 's edits now she 's begun editing the third draft , which will appear in the last issue of our magazine , the melic review , sometime this month many prominent net editors have already sent their condolences on our demise , and we really appreciate it , but it 's time to move on and concentrate on my own writing for the sole purpose of filthy lucre i have hopes my book length series of essays on eliot may be accepted by a university press to ease the undergraduate puzzlement that often afflicts young readers of eliot if only it could become a required textbook , i could do well ! unfortunately , at ucla , i noticed most assigned books were either written or co authored by the very professors that ordered us to buy them at inflated prices and people think the bush administration insular ? how about that great state of the union speech ? bush has become the green president , and that does n't just mean the largest budgets and shortfalls in u s history go , gasohol ! go , solar ! go , golf courses ! go , green eggs and spam ! it is said that the tides represent the greatest source of energy on earth we might employ unfortunately , no one has figured out how to harness them , though the occasional tsunami does try to get our attention i think that 's all for today btw , kathleen m chaffin will soon be featured in gary blankenship 's mindfire , and i'm dem proud of her here 's the url for the last issue i know http www mindfirerenew com issuefall frontfall html kathleen 's out looking for a dress today for our good friend bill taylor 's th birthday party the poor bastard had his first heart attack at and has had three bypasses when he says , i did n't expect to live this long , i believe him and amazingly , he credits his doctors ! so nice to hear someone speak of my profession positively for a change anybody watch house on fox ? it 's the first medical show i could tolerate rachel , our oldest daughter , recently became enamored of it she said dr house reminded her of a wimpy version of her papa lol ! now that i'm done with eliot and we almost have our stuff back i'm more bored than ever and i was especially disappointed when i rented terry gilliam 's the adventures of baron von munchausen , that uma thurman did not appear naked as botticelli 's venus as i had remembered only one breast showed kathleen was disappointed , too a recent quote from my boon companion the only thing craig loves more than me is air conditioning i guess i do n't blow as hard when she reads that i know i'm in for trouble , but hey , she said it in public in a mostly male crowd sometimes she can be a bit off color , and it always surprises people , since everyone 's impression of her is that of a real lady thine in semi stasis , c e chaffin
