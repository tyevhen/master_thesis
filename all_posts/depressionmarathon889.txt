yippee ! i went for a run today ! it 's bitter cold here , so i had to do it indoors on the treadmill or as my friend renee calls it , the dreadmill i was n't sure how it would go , as my lungs still felt clogged it was really busy at my gym i almost used that as an excuse to walk out , but i stayed and ran instead surprisingly , it went well i ran almost miles at a pretty good clip my legs were certainly well rested , so no lingering pains there and my lungs felt okay in fact , i think the run helped clear them out a bit i did some light lifting afterward i feel pleasantly tired now i had n't ran since christmas day ! that was a long time ago ! on the job front , it looks like i will be staying with my current employer a while longer i did n't get the local job for which i had applied a couple weeks ago they went with someone with whom they had a previous relationship , and that made sense i would have done the same thing i am surprisingly okay with the result initially , i reeeaaaly wanted this job , and i fretted about it for at least four days then , realizing how anxious i was making myself , i did something remarkable i turned the result over to my higher power just like my aa program teaches me ! their decision , after all , was totally out of my control so i relaxed and gave it away , and it worked ! i'm okay remarkable i have faith now that most things happen for a reason before aa , i would have spit on you for suggesting such a thing ! really but i 've seen it and experienced it myself , when disappointments have turned into fortunes perhaps my higher power wants me to stay at my nursing home so i can be with my patient see previous post while he dies maybe there 's something there for me to learn maybe i 'll never know the reason that 's okay , too i'm supposed to be where i'm supposed to be , i guess
