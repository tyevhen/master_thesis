a while back on one of my regular blog key word searches for unschooling i love searching various things i'm interested in in blogs , and seeing what other people have to say about the subject , i came across a blog post on unschooling by a student teacher as part of their class , each student is keeping a blog on various aspects of education , which i find quite fascinating in itself ! this particular student 's blog theme was educational and intellectual curiosity , and as such she 'd written a post on unschooling , and was mildly critical of it now , that 's kind of a pet peeve of mine , hearing negative things about unschooling since i 've had to put up with so much in my life ! i just had to comment and she asked to do an interview , to give a better idea both to her and her classmates of what unschooling is like so of course i agreed ! here is that interview , which i invite you to check out , especially if you have questions about unschooling ! oh , and i 've also added a couple more of my favorite blog posts to the sidebar peace , idzie you might also like interview on unschooling unschooling interview on connected mom a short interview some more thoughts on teaching and learning linkwithin
