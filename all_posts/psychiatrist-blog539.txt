usually clinkshrink posts about shooters it 's really not my area of expertise , but lately i 've been struck by how many shootings there have been i'm wondering if this is a more common occurrence lately , if it 's more publicized , or if i'm just paying more attention in the last few weeks , it feels like there is a constant flow of tragedies in the news there was the teenager who killed students and wounded two others at a school in ohio a florida teacher killed the head of his ex school after being fired a gunman walked into a psychiatric hospital in pittsburgh and killed one person and wounded others a u s soldier in afghanistan killed civilians in their homes , including young children i suppose the story of the teacher is different in that it was a murder suicide where the shooter knew the victim and had a motive such tragedies do happen often and their news coverage is often limited to local news while the other shootings sound to have random , multiple victims , and no obvious motive i 've actually never heard of a mass shooting in a psychiatric hospital any thoughts ? maybe clinkshrink has some insights
