hi , i wo n't post your question as you asked , just my edited reply my advice is this as long as you are visiting and are the houseguest of someone , especially a close friend or relative that you want to have a continuing relationship with , you do what they want , not what you want you go out of your way for them and do not expect them to go out of the way for you even if it hurts , and it probably will you do n't judge their emotional stability or the rightness or wrongness of what their interactions with their own family might be people are to be left alone in their own homes we all do the best we can you will find the situation changes back to normal when you meet on neutral grounds , either when they visit you in your place or at least away from being a guest at their place from this neutral territory or if they become the guest , you can decide how much going out of your way you want to do and you will learn to be political about it so you can sidestep someone who might be wanting to take advantage of you babysitting wise , dog feeding wise , waiting for delivery men , etc the hardest thing we will ever do in our life is to accept other people 's stupidity and give them space and respect for their bottom line humanity and human connection to us no one wants to be the last man on earth we need each other it 's hard to accept other people flaws because we can only see their flaws and now our own we never see our own stupidity , unfortunately , just other people 's the good part of seeing other people 's stupidity is that we can decide that at the very least we do n't want to do what they are doing we 'll still be doing our own stupid stuff but it 's one way to cut it down when we see what we do n't like in others and decide to check it our in ourselves for this reason i have always believed that being a therapist is the best way to become sane yourself by avoiding in your own life other people 's bad examples a b curtiss
