howdy ! it 's that time again to play along with what i wore wednesday over at the pleated poppy we 're all inspiring each other to get dressed at least sometimes ! during the week and feel good about ourselves i'm focusing on clothes that are good for the stay at home moms you can read about that here this outfit is casual and fun great for errands and running around with the kiddos all fully able to go in the washer dryer , non wrinkling , and modest the navy striped top is from downeast basics and the cords are from jcrew those boots are several years old they were motorcycle boots from banana republic what makes this outfit extra fun is the bright yellow color of the cords i could have opted for something more plain , but why ? they make me feel happy when i wear them and that 's the best part thanks for stopping by ! i 'll be back very soon to write about noah and how he 's an old coot now months old ! save
