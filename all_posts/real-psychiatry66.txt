i came across this open access article on my twitter feed that highlights some of the reality of antidepressants that i was trying to get at in my previous post i encourage a full reading of the article in order to understand it specifically how patients were selected from a large commercial database in this retrospective study the authors selected patient with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder mdd who were taking and antidepressant but only in a specific time interval they did this for the purpose of constructing the above survival curve they started with a group of , , people on antidepressants between and and ended up excluding all but , exclusions were based on no diagnosis of mdd in the previous months , no prescription of an ad in the previous months , lack of continuous enrollment in the previous months , and pharmacological therapies that included initiating treatment with more than one ad or ads or augmenting agents aa the final study population was , patients two major endpoints were defined as measures of medication adherence medication possession ratio mpr and proportion of days covered pdc pdc was considered the primary measure of adherence due to previous convention calculations were made at , , , and months persistence and adherence were calculated for each major antidepressant class ssri , snri , tca , maoi , and other adherence and persistence were calculated across all of these dimensions bar graphs are available in the full text adherence and persistence at months was snris had the highest persistence and adherence rates at months at and tcas the lowest at looking at the kaplan meier survival above the curves were significantly different with the lowest adherence to initial tca and maoi therapy the curves also show natural break points at and day intervals that correspond to the typical length of prescriptions although most primary care physicians provide a significant number of refills beyond that a study like this has obvious limitations and the authors do a good job of explaining them most of them had to do with the limitations of using a database like this one with limited granularity for example no data about the status of the prescriber or practice context i would have the question of whether adherence was any different among those given and antidepressant based on a screening questionnaire versus more detailed assessment and follow up it would also be interesting to see if subjects seeing psychiatrists were any more adherent than than what i am guessing are the majority of patients being see in primary care surrogate markers for psychiatric care could have been devised based on ad and aa combinations but that would be an imperfect marker since most primary care depression guidelines incorporate these strategies there was a very minor erratum essentially a typographic error that does not change the main paper when i look at a study like this , i always ask myself if the study group resembles the people i am currently seeing or have seen in this case of the population was female and were covered by commercial insurance twenty four percent had comorbid anxiety , had comorbid chronic noncancer pain , and had both sertraline has the largest percentage of prescriptions at with only about of people on bupropion extended release i currently see a large number of people on sertraline or citalopram bupropion augmentation despite the fda warning about maximum doses of citalopram i still see people on mg day or mg day who are years of age or older both of those situations were flagged in the fda warning i do find that snri medication are better tolerated than ssri and do not hesitate to make that change sooner than later give the limitations this is an interesting study at several levels it matches my experience at least of people do not tolerate ssris very well i have also found that snris are effective and more well tolerated than snris the major limitation from my perspective is that without the data that the authors refer to it is really not possible to design a clinical program that optimized adherence or that provides much of a foundation for the differences many psychiatrists have the experience that they see the same people with severe depression for years in many cases plasma levels of antidepressants are measure to optimize dosing but they also confirm adherence in other cases , the patients are in settings where medications are administered a critical dimension in psychiatric practice is the ongoing relationship with the patient looking at how the relationship with the patient and how that effects adherence is needed , but it is obviously a more difficult study to capture in a retrospective database george dawson , md , dfapa references
