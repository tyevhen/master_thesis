the last few days have been interesting the mornings have been characterized by sadness , tearfulness and hopelessness for example , after my coffee this morning i laid down on the sofa heavy and tearful i did n't want to move the upcoming day felt overwhelming there was no reason behind any of it likewise , there seems no reason for the different emotions i 've felt in the afternoons the afternoons have been okay , even good no sadness , hopelessness nor tears i'm not talking about major swings in mood , just shifts from one to another the morning heaviness leaves , and normalcy whatever that is sets in it 's weird my physical health has been much less weird in fact , i'm feeling pretty good i'm in the second week of my triathlon training class i'm actually finding it enjoyable to have someone else direct my training for awhile we have workouts days per week monday we ran and then swam today i did biking and strengthening i actually feel a bit out of running shape because i'm doing other things on most days i do feel stronger already hopefully the running will come i'm off to bed soon five o'clock a m comes pretty quickly here 's my gratitude list for the day i'm grateful to be free of the intrusive thoughts which plagued me over the last few weeks i'm grateful i enjoy and have the physical ability to run , bike , and swim i'm grateful to have a sponsee working the aa program she helps keep me sober and i'm grateful to have a warm house during these extremely cold days what 's on your gratitude list today ? think about it good night
