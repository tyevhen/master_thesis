i'm sitting in my house on a beautiful sunday morning i'm tired my mood remains low and my energy lower i 've already napped for over an hour , and it 's barely noon i think i'm really missing running more specifically , i think my brain and my body are missing running i'm hoping to motivate out the door after writing this post i do n't have anything planned for the day , but even going out to throw the ball for jet would probably help my mood despite my low mood and motivation , i did get out of my house yesterday i grabbed a cup of coffee , threw on my baseball hat , and drove to my aa meeting in the morning after that , on a bit of a whim , i went to see my friend , jodell she cuts my hair she 's been cutting it for years while i waited for her to finish with another customer , i decided to change things up rather than the typical trim of my long , curly locks , i had her cut them off i used to wear my hair very , very short , but i 've been keeping it long for several years now i got tired of being called sir maybe the motivation yesterday was my mood , maybe it was just time to make a change , but for whatever reason , i felt the need to do something different when i told her to cut it off , jodell , with surprise , asked if i was sure i was n't , but i was willing to give it a try so my hair is short again , and i have to admit , cutting it did jolt my mood upwards just a bit i needed that mood and energy jolt yesterday because i had other errands to run and chores to do prior to going out last night some friends and i went to dinner and a play last night this was especially nice for me , as the star of the play was my friend , ben , the young man i mentored while he was in high school he played the villain in a melodrama , and he was fantastic i felt like a proud mama sitting in the audience last night i needed that unfortunately , the mood jolt , the energy , and the pride did not make it through the night i woke up in the dumps , mentally and physically i'm going to have to motivate myself to do something more than i 've done yet today i 've got to change things up again , or i fear i 'll only slide deeper into the darkness i do n't want that it 's time to move carry on , my friends
