keep me happy or else ! a life lived in fear is a life half lived spanish proverb one thing that makes life hard is when you live in constant fear of people in my case , it 's fear of women ok , i'm actually afraid of almost everybody , male and female i can only think of one person where i do n't experience a physical shrinking from reaction in my gut when i'm around them everyone else makes me cringe internally , even if it does n't show on the outside , which it usually does n't the roots of my seeking approval from women i grew up with a violent , rageaholic mother who i was terrified of and secretly hated i quickly learned to repress my thoughts , feelings and even the sense of my right to exist my mother did not live by a code of forgive and forget she was like an elephant because i do n't think that bitch ever forgot one slight , injury or insult in her entire life her main weapons were retaliation , humiliation , and if necessary , direct physical violence that last was usually not necessary with me because since birth i 'd gotten her unspoken message regarding the purpose of my existence loud and clear you 're here to make me happy my mother was filled with hate towards her own father who molested her i think i was the vehicle through which she was going to get revenge on all men she hated men , and i was going to be the one who would fix all the injustices she 'd suffered at their hands i would be different , because not only could i be trained to be her slave , she would also finally have the freedom to take out her frustrations any time she wanted on a man who could n't fight back she also instilled in me a cringing , physical fear of her rage , which could explode without warning at any time i lived in more or less constant fear of physical attack for years and felt i might be killed this freezing in terror feeling is the most awful , shaming , and debilitating sensation i 've ever experienced and it 's also the gift that keeps on giving i'm still seeking my mom 's approval from other women growing up male with a mother who hates men is not the best way to end up feeling good about yourself the lingering effects of my mother 's toxic influence includes messages like men are wicked you 're a man , therefore you are also wicked you are my confidant and sympathizer you understand me like no one else can your father is evil you are my real husband , my real partner i 'll be damned if i 'll let your father be a part of your life simply because he ejaculated men are pieces of shit i love you i'm the only one who loves you everything 's your fault you 're such a fuck up you 'll never be able to live without me you 'll never amount to much you 're a deviant you 're disgusting you 're a rapist all men are rapists ! you 're not a real man you 're my slave you 'll always be my slave you owe me big time you do n't appreciate all i 've done for you i'm so disappointed in you do what you 're told or i 'll get rid of you these messages run deep some have changed over the years and some have not all of them are still in process needless to say , this type of early programming can really fuck up your sexual relationships with women getting sexually involved with any woman triggers some or all of the above messages for me which ones get triggered the strongest partly depends on her personality i tend to be attracted to strong , loud , opinionated , beautiful women who have more than a little touch of skank in them most of the women i 've been with are or have been bad girls and most of them have rage issues even though i'm not a kid anymore and have not really been abused by a woman in years , i still engage in the same approval seeking behavior i used to survive my mom i still go into this tailspin with women , even ones who are relatively healthy everything 's my fault i'm a piece of shit it 's my job to keep her happy i 'd better say i'm sorry if i make her angry , she might hurt me if i make her angry , she 'll get rid of me she might be dangerous she might even kill me if she gets too pissed off and the worst part is that the freezing sensation of terror is always beneath the surface it 's part of my daily living experience i feel it almost all my interactions with other people , no matter how superficial and it 's utterly devastating for me in intimate personal relationships it feels like be slowly strangled to death i do n't trust anyone and i do n't really believe in my heart that anyone is truly safe i know what human beings are capable of , and there 's no way i can ever unknow it do you also live in fear ? are you also constantly seeking approval from women ? moms ? wives ? girlfriends ? children ? your comments are always much appreciated
