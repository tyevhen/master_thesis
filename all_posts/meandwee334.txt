hi friends ! whew ! things have been busy around here ! we had paige 's first birthday party on saturday with mostly immediate family it was great ! i figured i 'd show you , in this post , a few of the decoration details there was n't really a theme to the party just more of a look with the colors turquoise , yellow and pale orange we set up a table that had most of the details in play which ended up being covered with all kinds of platters of food but i got a few pictures at the beginning before we finished the set up with all the stuff so that i could show you i was really inspired by this post by sharilyn over at lovelydesign she put out her cupcake flag template for use , so i opened it up in adobe illustrator and changed the colors and used the design for paige 's cupcake flags , the happy birthday banner flags , and the flags on the invitation thanks to her we had the look of the party underway ! i found the poms over at etsy at pomlove found here they were n't too hard to put together , but my father did of them he was much better at it than me ! i 'll be back soon to show a few pics of paige enjoying her party and thanks to all who came and made it special for her and for all the kind comments from our awesome blog friends ! i printed the banner flags on crane 's lettra paper on my inkjet printer , cut them out , and attached them with colorful plastic brads i found at the craft store i was going to sew a fancy bunting , but i realized it was a bigger time commitment than i had to spare so i made the paper one instead much quicker ! here is the table before we put all the food on it save
