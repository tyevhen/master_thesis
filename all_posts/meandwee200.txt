hi friends ! ugh my pressing anxiety is back in full force i wish it were n't so at least i'm not also feeling depressed , so that 's something ! it hit me like a wave slowly until i finally realized it was happening when it crashed over my head and sent me underwater i have a doctor appointment tomorrow morning and hopefully i 'll come away with some medication that will make life manageable again i so enjoy my life when i feel good but every little thing is entirely overwhelming at the moment and for the past while and it sends me into fits of rage and frustration at the slightest things then , i feel guilty for yelling at p or freaking out at the dog they do n't deserve that sigh i wish it were something i could control i 've worked so hard at trying all the calming techniques i know it truly is a chemical imbalance that i'm no match for god is helping me though after crying a lot last night and praying , a thought popped into my head this morning i trusted my angels to your care while they are on earth i would n't have done it if i did n't think you were fit thank you , god and , by the way , i have many friends that are looking forward to caring for more of your angels if you want to send them along to wonderful earlthly homes but you know that already i know you have big plans in motion i'm really looking forward to feeling like myself again and like i can do things all i have been able to do is talk about doing things i'm looking forward to participating in life again once it does n't feel like too much to handle besides , i ca n't miss out on relishing moments like this can i ? save you might also like on anxiety antepartum depression mother 's day and the birth linkwithin
