more senior citizens are attending psychotherapy these days , according to abby ellin of the new york times see link for the article and a video below for many seniors , the stigma that once was associated with attending therapy no longer exists they 've seen their children and grandchildren attend therapy and they 're aware now that a person does n't have to be crazy to attend therapy also , people are living longer these days , and many of them do n't want to live an unexamined life for their remaining years people are living longer and many of them do n't want to live an unexamined life my internship experience with senior citizens at a local nursing home when i was in graduate school , i was a clinical social work intern at a local nursing home at the time , the thinking was that all these senior residents needed was someone to talk to and keep them company because they were lonely so , i was assigned to meet with a few of the residents on a weekly basis , and as i met with them , i discovered that they had unique problems at this stage of their lives that were n't being addressed more seniors are attending psychotherapy these days recognizing that senior citizens have unique issues that are often unaddressed might seem like commonsense now , but back then , this was n't the thinking in the administration they were quite surprised to hear that residents were interested in talking about their personal histories and how it affected their lives , unresolved family issues , their emotional and social isolation , their fear of dying , and many other related issues a positive shift in perspective for administrators seniors can benefit from psychotherapy the administration was surprised at how open these residents were to talk about themselves and their problems rather than just keeping them company , the residents and i were addressing important , sometimes longstanding , issues in their lives i was very happy that by the time i left the internship , the administration had changed their views , and they hired a therapist to provide psychotherapy sessions to these residents many seniors can work through trauma there is one area where i disagree with ms ellin at one point in the video , she says she thinks that most seniors probably will not make big changes in their lives many seniors can work through unresolved trauma of course , a person 's ability to make changes , no matter what the age , is different for each person but , contrary to what i understood ms ellin to say , i have worked with senior citizens using emdr to work through longstanding trauma so , contrary to what many people think , many seniors can , indeed , make big changes in their lives i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com how therapy can help in the golden years by abby ellin new york times photo credit adwriter via photopin cc photo credit old shoe woman via photopin cc photo credit href http www flickr com photos proimos alex e proimos via href http photopin com photopin href http creativecommons org licenses by cc
