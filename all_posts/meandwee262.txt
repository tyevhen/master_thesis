dear little p , today is the last day that you are one year old i ca n't help erupting into tears now that i 've written that i'm happy you are turning two i just wish i could keep you small and innocent and wanting to be near me forever but i know you do n't belong to me you are a child of god and i'm here to try my hardest to show you how to be the best you can be for now , i'm savoring all the littlest moments with you in light of that , i decided to take some pictures of your little belly it 's one of my very favorite things and i know you will grow up and this belly just wo n't be the same anymore so , selfishly , i took pictures of it and am documenting it here so i can always look at it and marvel over your cuteness thanks for humoring me and allowing it love you madly , mama save
