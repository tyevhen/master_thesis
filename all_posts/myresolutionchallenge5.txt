are you holding yourself back ? when we re in our tweens , we long to reach our teens when we finally arrive at that sweet sixteen landmark , we long for adulthood as adults , many of us aren t prepared for the mess of responsibilities , or indeed , the real life influences that can suck out our creative soul time goes by , and our lives can feel a little bit out of control that electricity bill needs to be paid , the sales meeting must be attended , and the car has to be insured , but when do we make time for the dreams and aspirations we had growing up ? as an eight year old , i had clear ideas of becoming an author , but it wasn t until i reached the ripe old age of forty two that i got around to doing something about it for thirty four years i d held myself back in a variety of ways throughout my twenties , and thirties i often woke in the middle of the night dreaming about characters , and plot twists , but i used the excuse of an unhappy marriage , subsequent divorce , and being a single mum as a way of telling myself i didn t have time to write i allowed my limiting beliefs to control my actions i m not good enough , and people will think i m stupid , were constant thought patterns i d built these walls around myself , and it took many years before i realised they were preventing me from achieving my writing dreams in the film , the holiday with kate winslet , there is a poignant moment between kate s character , iris , and the adorable neighbour and screenwriting legend , arthur played by eli wallach arthur in the movies , we have the leading ladies , and we have the best friend you , i can tell , are a leading lady , but for some reason , you re behaving like the best friend iris you re so right you re supposed to be the leading lady of your own life for god sake arthur , i ve been going to a therapist for three years , and she s never explained anything to me that well that was brilliant , brutal , but brilliant i find this clip to be a wonderful reminder that by holding myself back , i'm not the leading lady in my life when i did finally focus on my creativity and balance my dreams with all that real life stuff , i found the time to write , i discovered a passion for sharing my story , and i even built a thicker skin to deal with feedback that belief that i m not good enough still rumbles around my brain , but i ve made an active choice to stop holding myself back and to embrace everything life has to offer think about your own life for a moment are you holding yourself back from fulfilling a dream ? can you find a compromise or balance ? perhaps you ve already made a few changes and can share your wisdom as always , i d love to hear your thoughts so feel free to drop me a comment below , or on my facebook page are you holding yourself back ? via shelleywilson
