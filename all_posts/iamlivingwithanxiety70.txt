lately i 've been pondering what exactly is a triviality dr low said there are no rights or wrongs in the trivialities of everyday life , so we should not let our fearful or angry temper take control in those situations in the current economic climate , is one 's job a triviality ? true , work is essential to daily living , and dr low frequently commented on the importance of work but in the grand scheme of our lives , is our current job really just a triviality , not something to get worked up about ? as i see layoffs mount and businesses fail , i have struggled with this question i worry about my employment status a lot in fact , much of my daily distress centers around my work performance i ve been reminded that worrying accomplishes nothing , but controlling my fearful temper has been difficult any thoughts or tips from dr low that can help ? i endorsed for writing this post !
