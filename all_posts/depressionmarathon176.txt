it 's been a good week i just returned home from work it was my third full day of work this week , and i'm not collapsed on the sofa yet ! i'm not out running , either , but my energy has not been totally sapped i still have a little left enough to sit here and write at least i'm pleased with how things are going my mood has been very good and holding steady for at least a month now i'm thrilled to have more energy i 've gradually been building up my hours at work it 's going well i 've been working hour shifts , days per week we 're busy , so i'm seeing one patient after another , and like i said , i have n't crashed it 's really rather remarkable i feel so normal better yet , i 've been able to keep up with some sort of exercise days of the week exercise is key to my mental health in balance with working , socializing , and my recovery , i need exercise to continue to feel well i 've lost some of the weight i gained during my depression relapse , and i feel physically stronger and healthier today than i have for months unfortunately , my running comeback took a bit of a hit two weeks ago when my right achilles acted up in the middle of a run i was worried i took a week off , focused on cycling and lifting instead , and i seem to be back on track i'm now up to running for minutes interspersed with minutes of walking i'm hoping to increase the running time to minutes and decrease the walking time to one minute within the next week it 's slow , but it 's progress i like progress i'm happy with my progress i'm hoping to continue on this trajectory life is so much simpler when my mood is good and i'm very grateful for that
