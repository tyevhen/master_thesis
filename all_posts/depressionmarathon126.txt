i believe it was just or posts ago that i was complaining about feeling cooped up and wishing for some excitement in my life i wonder if i can retract that wish ? the wish actually came true , but it 's been the wrong kind of excitement infiltrating my life lately the morning after the post , i had the pleasure sarcasm of being reamed out for minutes by a patient 's angry spouse that stressful situation went unresolved for a week , and it continues to cause me grief i 've not yet recovered from her tongue lashing , or my resentment , but i'm working on it unfortunately , today i was blessed sarcasm with another obstacle to battle i'm in the midst of more very stressful drama with my teeth long story short , i may lose another molar i'm being treated for an infection of another old root canal you may recall i lost a molar less than a year ago for the same reason if the high doses of two different antibiotics do n't cure the infection , this molar , on the other side of my mouth , will have to be pulled , too i really do n't know if i can handle the removal of another tooth this year process , which was only supposed to last months , of getting braces in order to pull down my right canine tooth , which after months of pulling turned out to be ankylosed and had to be removed , and the loss due to infection of an upper left molar , and the long process of bone grafting , which may or may not be successful , and then hopefully surgical implants to replace the canine and molar , has already been exhausting , exasperating , and painful this was all supposed to turn out so , so differently i'm not sure i can go through anymore drama with my teeth of course , i am sure i do n't have a choice in the matter drama or no drama , i have to keep putting one foot in front of the other and continue to take the next right action that 's all i can control if this molar , on the lower right side , has to be removed , it will have to be removed i'm praying hard for the pain to subside and for the infection to clear and i'm praying really hard that the infection never returns so i can keep the tooth , and for the braces to do their job so i can begin bone grafting , and for the bone grafting to be successful so i can get the implants , and for one day to have a normal mouth again ! that 's all is that too much to wish for ?
