for two day in a row last tuesday and wednesday , i went for really long walks yay ! both days my sister and i started out with my mother , and she turned back early as we continued with a friend or two but really , it 's best to let the pictures i took the first day tell the story sorry , the order is totally screwed up we my mother sister and i started out walking around the streets , then my sister , borris , and i continued into the woods and destroyed strip the pictures , however , are a total mish mash s endless line of dried sludge as far as the eye can see literally i believe we 've walked straight along here for about minutes , and we still ca n't see the end of it i like the lines here my sister and i 's shadows it 's a smiley face can you see it ? the trees caught the sunset apparently you 're not supposed to stand under these huh , who knew ? it looks like an aerial view of another world hmm way overexposed , but i wanted to show the extant of the damage some greenery has grown up along the devastated strip , but most of it is still dried sludge i love the beautiful fall leaves a farm road wanders off to the side shining strands of power lines having fun is n't this fire hydrant just amazingly adorable for some reason ? where the green things end and as for the upcoming festivities , the first one is pretty much here ! tonight , my immediate family minus my dad who 's sadly away on a business trip is celebrating thanksgiving we 're cooking an almost entirely organic , harvest themed meal , with homemade bread , roasted carrots , potatoes and onions , meatloaf for the meat eaters , and i believe soup as well as for the other upcoming festivities , well , that 's something i'm really looking forward to since halloween is so disgustingly commercialized , and i feel like i'm a bit too old for trick or treating , i decided to celebrate samhain , a pagan holiday celebrating the final harvest , and also remembering the dead some historians also believe that samhain was the celtic newyears so , with the help of my sister and at least one friend , we 're going to put together a small celebration it will be cool peace idzie
