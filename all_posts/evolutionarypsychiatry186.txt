alrighty you might have noticed i 've slowed down on the blogging a tad this month well , there 's sunshine and vitamin d to collect , and lots of social engagements here in the northeast u s we seem to do everything for the whole year in the summer also , ever since i started doing crossfit , i have needed more time to admire myself in the mirror see melissa 's comment today 's music is on the cheesy classical side i'm feeling a little spanish summer on the mediterranean right now just go with it as always , right click in new tab concerto de aranjuez adagio paleoland events turns out i'm the blog of the week at latest in paleo ! also , fantastic surely you jest , i mean , really ? tell me more thanks angelo ! and very excited that next week i will join the ranks of stephan guyenet , kurt harris , and chris masterjohn to participate in a healthy skeptic podcast with chris kresser and danny roddy chris asks me to ask you if you have any questions for me you can post them here on my blog , or if the blogger comment system is too much of a deterrent you are not the first hindsight would lead me to wordpress , then i'm told chris is also going to post and you can ask a question over there if there is something i ca n't answer , i will surely dodge or turn it around on you just like any practiced therapist now , the science a new paper came out in the jama archives of neurology the archives are always going to be pretty much a first tier journal in any specialty , and it is important to keep abreast of them here 's the paper diet intervention and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment the design healthy y os and y os with amnestic type mild cognitive impairment were randomized to either a high diet or an isocaloric low diet for four weeks the high diet was fat saturated fat , high glycemic carbohydrates , and protein the low diet was fat saturated fat , carbohydrate , and protein the diets were designed by a nutritionist and the food was delivered twice weekly to the participants there is no more information about the diets , but i have emailed the corresponding author to ask for more details um , were the deliveries kinda like jenny craig mirowaveable meals or whole food ? is it sugar or starch ? is the saturated fat animal fat , coconut oil ? what about the trans fats ? you know , all those gory but vitally important details all participants were free of major psychiatric or neurologic disorders other than mild cognitive impairment , and were free of kidney disease , diabetes , copd , cardiac disease , alcoholism , and no one was on cholesterol lowering medication where did they find these year olds not on statins ? oh , seattle i quote the length of time participants consumed the high diet was restricted due to safety considerations my goodness ! safety considerations ! what were they giving them ? surely not something so horrific as coconut cream or steak well , thus far we do n't know what they were giving them i mean , i have to give the researchers huge kudos for examining diet and the brain at all ! but let 's have a look at the results , shall we ? the participants received cognitive testing , oral glucose tolerance testing , blood collection , and a lumbar puncture before and in the fourth week of the diet insulin , glucose , and blood lipids were measured , as well as csf amyloid beta protein a couple of types , tau protein , apolipoprotein e , and f isoprostanes omega derived marker of inflammation and oxidative stress okay so the high diet increased insulin resistance measured as insulin area under the curve , which is nice , and the low diet decreased it far more so in the healthy controls than the mild cognitive impairment folks , which is interesting on the high diet , ldl went up by points in the mci patients and less than points in the healthy controls ldl dropped points on the low diet in mci folks and points in the controls not surprisingly , hdl went down on the low diet by points in controls and points in mcis and up on the high diet about points for both for some weird reason , the researchers used ldl hdl ratio instead of the more standard total cholesterol hdl ratio , and that went down in the low folks and up in the high folks with respect to cognitive testing , everything was a wash except some mild improvement in delayed visual memory scores that were better on the low group than in the high group in controls , csf amyloid protein went down on the low group and up in the high group in the mci folks , amyloid went up in the low group which would fit the general model that amyloid beta is a last ditch desperate substitute for cholesterol in those with a dementing process going on and remained the same in the high group the authors interpreted this as pathology was already advanced in the mci group so dietary interventions could n't make it much worse csf apoe in controls stayed the same in the control low group and increase in the mci group again apoe drags cholesterol into the brain likely to increase on a low fat diet if the brain is fat starved apoe went down in both control and mci groups on the high diet the authors considered this to be a bad sign for the high diet i'm not so sure if you need more apoe , the inefficient apoe will be found wanting csf insulin dropped in the controls on the low and high diets in the mci folks insulin increased on the low and stayed the same on the high since low csf insulin is associated with alzheimer 's , the researchers considered low insulin bad f isoprostanes decreased in both groups on the low diet and increased in controls on the high diet but not in mci folks yeah i do n't know what to make of it either the authors seemed to think it was a ringing endorsement for the low diet for healthy adults , the high diet moved csf biomarkers in a direction that may characterize a presymptomatic stage of alzheimer 's disease the ad biomarkers were unaffected by the high diet for adults with mild cognitive impairment , possibly because more extreme intervention is needed to exacerbate already exant pathologic processes and , shucks , if the high diet was all industrially fried pork rinds and chocolate cake with hydrogenated frosting , i would n't doubt it we 'll see if more information comes from my email i hope so ! otherwise , i think this study serves as another example to show that diet is important , but that research is pointed in the direction of macronutrients rather than the quality of the food , thus we ca n't really make useful conclusions this paper also states that cholesterol does not cross the blood brain barrier in a healthy brain seneff et al suggest that transcytosis of ldl across the bbb is conclusively proven in this paper
