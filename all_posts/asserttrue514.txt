the spiky doorknob on the door to evil passive voice causes a lot of trouble , for readers as well as writers but it 's clearly not evil someone who writes no murder weapon was found is guilty of no grammar felony , no diction misdemeanor if we 're honest , we have to admit that in many cases , passive voice is actually the best way to say something why , then , does passive voice get such a bad rap ? i have my own theories i stay up late at night thinking about this sort of thing writing is linear words are written and read sequentially as you read a sentence , word by word , you try to parse it for meaning my theory is that when you can parse a sentence sequentially , as you read it , it 's an easy sentence and a rewarding reading experience example when you read something like the dog barked at the man , you encounter the subject dog first , the action word barked second , and the object of the barking the man third that 's what i would call natural parse order the sentence is , in some sense , self parsing , because the things you need to know occur in the order in which you need to know them dog bark man when you encounter the man was barked at by the dog , you have man bark dog , which is harder to make sense of , because it 's not in natural parse order the actor in this sentence the dog is at the end you have to read to the end before you can be sure how to decipher the sentence but you get an added anti bonus the sentence is longer than the active voice version your brain needs to stay online longer funny things start to happen to your writing when you begin to not give a crap about parse order the first thing that happens is , you start using a lot more passive voice because you can ! , which also means your sentences get longer also , suddenly it 's possible to write sentences that lack an actor the longer a sentence is , the more your reader 's brain screams out for an actor , a doer , an identifiable subject , because that 's where parsing begins fail to provide a subject in a long sentence and you 've created a parsing nightmare for example it is mandatory that performance trends be continuously monitored and action plans implemented when negative trends are detected that could result in revenues being adversely impacted this sentence is a cognitive train wreck , not because passive voice made it so , per se , but because the writer felt free to write an actor less sentence that obeys no particular parse order what made it possible for the writer to write an actor free sentence ? passive voice what made it possible for the writer to forget about parse order ? passive voice how can we improve the sentence ? first , give it an actor let 's use managers follow up quickly with a verb monitor followed by an object performance trends managers must monitor performance trends now the sentence begins to feel self parsing add the extra events respond to trends that affect business voila ! you have an easy to parse sentence managers must monitor performance trends and respond quickly to trends that might adversely affect business passive voice itself is n't evil i like to think of it as the spike studded doorknob on the door to evil you have nothing to fear from a spike studded doorknob per se just be careful how you use it
