furious seasons has a great post on the latest zyprexa ruling i wo n't even attempt to replicate his insightful analysis of the situation i will simply focus on one part of the ruling , in which the judge stated the harm faced by lilly is amplified by the fact that the protected documents which respondents seek to disseminate are segments of a large body of information , whose selective and out of context disclosure may lead to confusion in the patient community and undeserved reputational harm 'what appears damning may , in context after difficult proof , be shown to be neutral or even favorable to the defendant oh , such a bad argument ! so unless every single document is released which lilly will make sure never happens , then any document released is out of context here 's where this line of thinking may lead maybe lilly can use it to defend themselves regarding zyprexa and diabetes sure , studies a through z showed a link between olanzapine and diabetes but there are other studies which we conducted that put these findings into context however , we cannot show you said studies because they contain trade secrets in fact , we insist that all of the earlier published papers linking olanzapine to diabetes be retracted and burned publicly , as they are clearly lacking context this trade secrets and out of context thing is blowing my mind i'm not a lawyer , and i'm glad about that , because i'm not sure i can come to grips with this type of thinking this is giving me flashbacks to the british psychological society 's handling of the blakemore brown case and i think i 'll need a safe , gentle psychotropic to help me handle the stress
