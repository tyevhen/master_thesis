today i was friended by psychiatrist friend i have n't seen in a while she 's in her 's and has always been pretty technologically savvy i told one of my teenagers , who has met this friend in real life , and she the teenager told me she did n't want to hear it ! huh , you are n't interested in my facebook life ? people do n't talk about what happens on facebook huh ? neat stuff happens on facebook , why ca n't i talk about it ? well , i got an earful you talk about what happens on fb , because then it 's like you do n't have a real life , and people will think you 're pathetic , and this will push away the real people in your life who now think you 're rather dismal and all you have to talk about is your virtual life because you have no real life to talk about , and then you 'll have less people in your real life and you 'll need facebook even more , and it 's a vicious cycle mostly likely , i'm doomed
