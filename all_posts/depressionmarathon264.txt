i'm recovering this afternoon from my second surgery in the past month this time it was oral surgery , and boy am i sore ! unlike my hip surgery , this one knocked me flat today the combination of pain and not being able to eat anything substantial wore me out the stitches inside my mouth are really sore it will be three days before i'm allowed to eat anything hot or with any texture yogurt , ice cream , and chocolate milk were on the menu today , and i'm already sick of all three i may try some cool mashed potatoes tonight that will be exciting ! today is in sharp contrast to yesterday yesterday i was busy for hours it was an exciting day ! victoria , the producer from nyc was here to shoot the videotape i wrote about in my last post it was strange and exciting to participate it was weird wearing make up , as i rarely do , and even stranger to have someone else put it on my face thank you , heidi my home was turned into a studio with lights and cameras thank you , christopher jet was beside himself with all the activity unfortunately , it was also incredibly cold outside , the coldest day of the year , so we froze while shooting the outdoor scenes even jet was shivering but overall , i think the day was a success things seemed to have gone well i'm really looking forward to seeing the end product it may be completed within a couple of weeks of course , i 'll post a link here for all to see when the time comes carry on , friends !
