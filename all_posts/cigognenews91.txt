i will imagine that most of you will think of strange ideas and beliefs but neurosis , a high level of unresolved pain , is everywhere and above all it is found in those who are not very athletic not dexterous , cannot easily put the finger to the nose or hit a tennis ball there is a lack of agility and coordination does that mean that all great athletes are not neurotic ? not at all from early on that were approved of that proclivity and learned to overcome whatever handicaps they had many do not in an average tennis game one can see it among players what they do not see is where it comes from it turns out that harm during gestation and birth sways physical abilities later in life in other words , lack of coordination begins before we try to really coordinate who d have thunk it ? and what helps this ? what would you imagine ? lots of close and warm touch a rare oddity in neurotic families it seems as though we can ameliorate some imprinted damage with love not a lot of undoing , no total reversal but some change there is a lesson here for those who underwent a blocked or deviated birth lots of love right away and for a long time sleep with parents who hug and kiss often neurosis has uneven effects depending on when and where it happened and where it landed this reminds me that wherever we look at early trauma we see neurosis in all its forms it lies in breathing problems , in chronic tiredness , in dizzy spells and some seizures we find it in hyperactivity and in a myriad of other afflictions the symptoms settle in and become chronic ah now ! what keeps them going on and what is it that we ignore in treatment ? the cause is always there it can be observed and it can be extirpated think of that , as we go on trying to find solutions , yet we do something instead give pill after pill without any thought to causes and to ending them we can do it now ! we know what to do and have known for decades
