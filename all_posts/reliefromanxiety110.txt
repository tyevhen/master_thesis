first off , happy new year ! now is the time to make promises to ourselves that we wo n't keep well me ! this time of the year for some can be difficult , which is understandable and this is why it is important to know to look after ourselves even though christmas time is the best time of year for me , there are other times when it all gets too much and i need to look after myself the recovery from mental illness is never smooth , unfortunately and if you 're anything like me , which i am sure many of you are , you will have days where anxiety and depression are weighing down on you like a tonne of bricks making it debilitating to even move even on days like this , if i notice i have even the slightest bit of energy , i will try to be productive if this is even at all possible and i will keep trying to push myself to not allow myself to fail as i think it as of course , this is not the case and i am not failing , i am just having a bad day like anyone else in their journey but , the problem with me is that i do n't know when to stop and rest when i am physically ill , i want to keep doing things and the same with my mental health but , what it important to remember is that by giving yourself time to rest , you are giving yourself the best chance at a speedy recovery , rather than pushing yourself and making yourself worse having a bad day is not a failure and no matter how hard it is , these are things that we have to try and accept it is okay to feel this way you are not going back to the beginning amy xx
