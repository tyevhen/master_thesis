there is a quote by susan w tanner , when i know who i am , i can do anything he asks me to do i have been working really hard this year on learning more about who i am , where i came from , where i am going this brings me peace i used to not even be able to talk about death because it made me really uneasy knowing who i am is helping me to value myself more i am feeling more at peace with my trials in this life , why i have them , and that i wo n't always have to go through them this is a post that i am sooo excited to share with you i feel very passionate about it because it has changed my life i recently came across the idea of making scripture journals from shannon at the red headed hostess blog and i have spent the last few months creating my own through trial and error i want to share with you what i 've done in hopes of helping you feel enthusiastic and excited about studying scriptures it 's no longer a chore for me it 's my favorite part of my day and i want it to be yours too it does n't matter what religion you are if you study the bible , book of mormon , or any scripture you can apply this idea to your studying if you are not religious you can apply this same concept for anxiety related quotes , uplifting thoughts , positive affirmations , etc the best part about this is that you can be as simple , straightforward , and logical as you want , or you can get as artsy and creative as you want wherever you are in the crafty spectrum and have time and patience for you can do this the important thing to remember is to make this yours do what works for you why keep a scripture journal ? here are a few reasons we often leave the most precious personal direction of the spirit unheard because we do not record and respond to the first promptings that come to us when the lord chooses to direct us elder richard g scott i 've found , as i'm sure you have , that when you are trying to learn from the spirit , it 's important to make a note so it will not be forgotten the more you not only hear but abide by what you 've been told , the more the lord will give to you it will come more and more rapidly and you will begin to hear and feel those impressions of the spirit more quickly than you have previously done elder gene r cook the prompting that goes unresponded to may not be repeated writing down what we have been prompted with is vital a special thought can lost later in the day through the rough and tumble of life god should not , and may not , choose to repeat the prompting if we assign what is given such a low priority as to put it aside elder neal a maxwell in the few short months that i have started my scripture journals , the knowledge that i have learned and retained is more than i have learned about in years of just reading a chapter a day which is how i used to study my main reason for doing scripture journals is to give them to my children as a family heirloom after i am gone or when they are old enough to appreciate them as shannon said i'm paraphrasing it 's a way to keep teaching my children after i am gone i give full credit to shannon at her blog for this idea and i thank her for all the work she put into sharing her journals i want to help spread the word to more readers because its worth sharing if it helps people grow spiritually materials needed first you have to pick some journals this is important you want to find some that is the right size , enough to hold lots of information , will function the way you want it to , and look the way you want it to if you plan to keep it simple , pick a lined journal that you can do lots of writing in that has thick pages so your ink wo n't bleed through i planned to be more artsy and wanted to decorate my covers using scrapbooking supplies so i bought a coptic journal kit from etsy when it is all done i will bind it so that it will open and lay flat this may be a little more extreme but for me this is my creative outlet so i needed a blank canvas any journal will work the way i have mine set up is i have two journals one that is for chapter by chapter study and another is for topic based study they can be referenced to each other also get a good ballpoint pen that wo n't bleed through pages , or leave puddles of ink that will smudge and make a mess optional colored pencils , glue stick , scissors , scrapbooking supplies paper , stickers art supplies what do you put inside ? this depends on you and your style this is not a daily record of your personal thoughts like a diary this is a record of what you have been learning during your scripture study this means a record of quotes you want to remember , promptings , stories , talks , word definitions , scriptures you looked up , etc some of my pages are purely artistic in nature others hold pictures that i love others are journal entries with my personal insights from a story , others are character analysis on the people i have been reading about i created a template in photoshop that i print out and glue in and write on but getting it all organized is the tough part here is a post from shannon that talks about how to set one up i have been born of goodly parents if this is something you are interested in trying i highly recommend checking out the following sites for additional inspiration and tutorials update i am now selling downloadable journal templates in the store at my other blog here if interested here are more of my journal pages and tutorials on the techniques i use here is my pinboard that i keep for my scripture journals if you want to follow that it lists sites , talks , quotes , etc that i plan to put in my journal somehow or art supplies i plan to use the red headed hostess she even has some journals you can purchase that are already set up and ready to go i bought a set and they are really great for outlining how to study she is the main source for all my inspiration so you should really check her site out i want to be her when i grow up here is a sheet you can download with some ideas from dana cockrum that was also taken from the red headed hostess i hope you find this as fun and uplifting as i do enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
