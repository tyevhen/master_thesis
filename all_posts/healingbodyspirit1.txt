why i am a mormon the short answer is that my great grandfather heard the gospel preached in wales in the spring of his two cousins , hopkin and david mathews , came into the village preaching the mormon doctrine they heard how in a young man by the name of joseph smith , who after reading james in the bible went into a grove in palmyra , n y , to pray about which church was true there he saw god the father and his son , jesus christ whose glory and light were beyond description he was told that he should join none of the churches , but that through him the church of jesus christ would be restored to the earth it would be restored by a process of revelation and by translating the book of mormon my grandfather and his wife were convinced this was true i am convinced that it is true because by the power of the holy ghost the spirit has born witness to me i have walked through that sacred grove and know without a shadow of a doubt that god the father and that his son , even jesus christ appeared to joseph smith i bear testimony that the book of mormon is the word of god and is another testament of jesus christ and his dealings with an ancient people on the american continent
