i love him , but i do n't spend much time with him i forget that he is waiting and longing for me to come spend time with him i love him , but i do n't talk to him much at all sometimes days go by before i say anything to him sometimes i reminisce of the days when we were close , when we spent time together every day pursuing our shared desires in life it was so good , those times we would share life we would talk i would listen as he spoke to me , and he would listen as i spoke to him not only did we speak together , but i loved him so much i would speak to my family and friends about how wonderful he was , and even speak to people that i did n't know about him my love for him spilled out and brought me joy ! the thing is , i still love him just as much i love him more than anyone or anything i would die without him so why do i ignore him and forget about him ? i know he loves me and is faithful he loves me so much he would die for me so , why ? you may ask , do you not communicate ? why do you not share every moment of your life with him ? has he gone away ? is he unreachable ? no , i say , he , the one that i love , he is here he is always right beside me ready to listen , ready to speak into my life , ready to share joy , and ready to comfort me when i need it he wants to love me and provide for my deepest needs he waits for me and calls me to come to him so , this year , , i would like to combine my feelings of love with my actions of love i want us to spend times talking , listening , and sharing i want us to be on the same page when it comes to the desires of our hearts i want to spend so much time with him that i begin to take on his wonderful likeness i want you to see such love and excitement from me that you ask me , who is this amazing one that you love ? how can i know him too ? i want to love him with my life so i say , jesus christ i love you
