i am having trouble with blogger , where i ca n't seem to compose with the regular composer and html does n't do paragraphs unless i know the code for it i 'll come fix it later when it seems to cooperate better hello all , i started this post several months ago but have never felt inspired to come and complete it did i mention in a previous post that last year around this time i hit a huge pothole ? well ever since that time i have developed a fear of driving it was mild at first , i 'd just be afraid that my car was defective as a result of hitting that pothole eventually i went to have it checked and what needed fixing was fixed yet the fear did not go away it progressively got worst i know that in a previous post i discussed some peeves i had in regards to other drivers , well some of those peeves have developed into fears i am no longer just afraid of bicycles and bikes but of every vehicle on the road i am also afraid of every pedestrian that walks on the sidewalk i am afraid of my car breaking down or suddenly catching fire i am afraid of ice and snow i am afraid of skidding or hitting something or someone or maybe just getting into an accident by skidding off the road or getting into a rollover i am afraid of tow trucks in front of me loosing their load or any type of truck really i am afraid of something malfunctioning with the tethers in other load baring vehicles if you can think of it , i am afraid of it just this morning i almost had a collision i was driving in a lane and someonedecided to turn into my lane right where i was ! it 's a good thing there was nobody in the other lane as i was able to vear into it at the last minute to avoid a collision he either did not look properly or well , there are no other excuses really had i not been able to vear into the next lane he would have hit me , that is how close i was to a collision it 's not that he was cutting me off and i had to slow down , or that he was trying to come in behind me , there was enough speed to hit me this was right near my home , the rest of the drive in to work i was raw nerves i have discussed it with a therapist but since i am still driving i do n't think they have taken this fear seriously yes i am still driving , with my heart in my throat every single time , on the verge of hyperventilation from shear panic but yes i am still driving i hear that if i stop it will only get worst last week i spoke to my psychiatrist about it , told her i had severe anxiety while driving and that i wanted to find a way to stop being so afraid she said she would refer me to an anxiety program but did n't know if and when i would be accepted to think that a bad pothole started all of this amazing do any of you have any suggestions for me ? thanks for reading !
