dear a b i am struggling with issues i have brought to you before my husband is very unhappy at work he has n't pursued another position yet , but expresses a desire to do so when the right thing comes along in my opinion , he has severe issues with getting along with others his ego is too wrapped up in being right and in how he is being treated he is a very smart person , very good at what he does , i have no doubt but , job after job , he ends up quite angry very , very dissatisfied he has commuted long distances in the past in order to leave a job go to another this time , there are no other options within commuting distance we 'd have to move i'm working hard to get the house we bought in high market in shape more updated i 've worked on the house since we moved in actually ! am currently getting ready to have a large master bathroom remodeled i am not a contractor nor a designer , i'm pulling it all together myself , trying to get the most impact for as little money as possible not compromise on quality i research things like crazy study up on toilets , tubs , tile , etc ! guess my frustration and fear lies here in all the time , effort , thought , energy money , that has gone into this house we 've already done kitchen updates , had a big paver patio walkways installed , just had a new heating cooling system put in we must do all these things to simply sell this house , we wo n't get what we paid for it in not even close i also feel frustrated fearful regarding my husband 's work , since this job issue has been an ongoing crisis for a quarter of a century now he seems to derive his entire identity from his work , which i realize many men do asking him to calm down , chill out , get a life , a hobby , etc , only rubs him the wrong way he takes his work very seriously too seriously , i think i am grateful that he works so hard provides well for us , but the situation begs the question at what price ? i do n't know how to see this anymore with a positive outlook i never know what to say to him , what to advise him i used to naively think that this time the new job would make all the difference he 'd finally be happy it never turns out that way is there an answer ? i know so much of how we deal with things rests in how we frame them how we look at them i ca n't seem to find the rosy lens through which to view this now turning our lives upside down moving again for what ? i feel really depleted and disappointed sincerely , g dear g cheer up you are much too focused on your husband 's flaws it is too bad , really , that he is not living up to your expectations you can easily see how he could do it right and it is frustrating that he continues to live according to his own nature and not yours he has taken on the responsibility of supporting a family he has obstacles of his own personality flaws that obstruct him he has to work doubly hard he is probably over sensitive to his own feelings and because of that he is insensitive to the feelings of others because he is so easily hurt himself , his reality in any interaction is slightly skewed he gets wounded , then he gets defensive and angry this is a common failure in men who are not feminized or who have not undergone sensitivity training he thinks he is dealing with reality but his reality is slightly different from the reality of others who are part of any interaction with him many talented men such as your husband are in a similar mind set in lieu of firing a valuable employee , their bosses send them to sensitivity training a good counselor can point out the slightly skewed view of reality and the person can begin to see things in a different paradigm in terms of the other 's flaws and the fact that they are doing their best rather than in terms of their being attacked or devalued by these flawed people your problem , however , is not how to mend your husband 's flaws your problem is how to bear up under the stress of moving i know how you feel i remodeled houses like you did one house was finished on week and went on the market the next , sold in a month and i was off again you will have to put your creativity into managing the situation for yourself in a positive way rather than managing your husband remember , anything done out of fear anger , etc turns out to be inappropriate to your life figure out how to do something for love of something order , peace , creativity , self responsibility in adversity etc this is not easy because , unfortunately , our culture is not supporting you as it did in earlier generations to make sacrifices for your marriage today the stability of marriage in general is threatened because the family is no longer considered the pivotal unit of society which exists as the accepted sane way to live in order to nourish the next generation and maintain the civilization no , today the individual is considered pivotal unit of society and thus marriage is seen as the way to individual happiness in addition , self responsibility is no longer considered as important as self esteem and the idea of being entitled to the good things of life and getting your needs met by others government , spouse , etc thus if your partner is not meeting your needs today s marriage counselors simply advise you to get a divorce and find someone who does meet your needs and what , therefore , is happening to our culture ? we are becoming so loose we are falling apart at the seams what families cannot hold together no ship of state can bind those who are wise will see beyond what they are entitled to more money , better husband , good health and see what they can manage to create out of whatever adversity comes their way thanks , a b yes , i probably am too focused on my husband 's flaws ! thought he 'd have grown out of a lot of this by now , but guess that i too , still have a lot of growing up to do ! he is probably over sensitive to his own feelings and because of that he is insensitive to the feelings of others because he is so easily hurt himself , his reality in any interaction is slightly skewed he gets wounded , then he gets defensive and angry you summed that up perfectly ! do n't think he 'd go to a counselor though i see that it would serve him well to see things in a different paradigm in terms of the other 's flaws and the fact that they are doing their best rather than in terms of their being attacked or devalued by these flawed people he does seem to often feel attacked ! when he 's talking about people at work , is there anything i can say to help him feel less defensive attacked ? in whatever scenario i find myself who knows if the house will sell , or when , or where we will end up ! i will focus on making choices that will foster peace and order i will continue to focus on doing my best with the home improvement projects i do want to do a good job for the sake of it , see how much improvement i can achieve with my bath makeover those who are wise will see beyond what they are entitled to more money , better husband , good health and see what they can manage to create out of whatever adversity comes their way well said ! i love your perspective but then , my husband 's job swapping does n't fit with that approach , does it ? could changing the job this time really make a difference ? i think i hear you saying that it 's better to stick with something and make the most of it , learn from it , and stop thinking the grass is always greener on the other side everything , everyplace , and everyone comes with at least one big catch nothing is perfect my husband tells me that he does n't care if he 's jumping from the frying pan into the fire he just wants to get away from his two bosses if the next place is bad too , so be it , at least it will be a different sort of bad ! he does , however , concede that the rest of the team is pretty good hard working , so it 's not all bad your reply helped me so much ! thanks again ! sincerely , g
