i'm back in my humble abode after another day hospital stay i wish i could report my mood has spectacularly improved , but i'm unable to say that my mom is here with me helping out for a few days in order to ease the transition from inpatient to real world , but i'm still feeling overwhelmed and a bit unprepared to face the world in fact , the first thing i did when i got home was cry i still feel low , and feeling low after days in the hospital scares and discourages me i'm trying desperately to stay mindful of each moment , move within that moment , and try not to forecast future catastrophes i ca n't waste energy focusing on where i 've been , and i ca n't control what 's coming up next , so this present moment is all i 've got i'm going to keep working to stay within it and see if that helps stabilize this pesky mood of mine as far as treatment goes , i had my last ect treatment today again , i would have hoped for a shinier outcome , but what i 've got is what i 've got my mood is somewhat improved but not back to where i would like it to be on a scale of , with being fabulous , i'm somewhere around a four i can function at a , but it takes extra effort and energy i'm aiming for a return to work next week , at least part time , and i think that may help me feel more useful and productive it would have been nice if the ect treatments had carried me a little further along the road to recovery , but their effectiveness seems to have worn down over time anything i can do to help myself , like return to work , or anything i can accomplish at this point in time will be beneficial , i think i'm focusing forward and hoping for the light to return to my days this is a nasty illness i so empathize with all of you out there struggling to make it through , whether that means getting out of bed , taking a shower , going off to work , or meeting family obligations whatever you 're doing , keep doing it take the steps forward one step at a time , keep moving forward i'm convinced that 's the only way to defeat this diabolical demon we call depression by stomping right through the middle of it carry on , my friends
