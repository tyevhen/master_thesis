some of you might not know this , but i have always had a love of dramas , musicals , plays whatever you want to call them acting was something i was hung up on when i was little i was convinced i would be a movie star or something now i am somewhat thankful , that i did n't get my wish i did however participate in a few plays , one was our town production of annie i was eight and had a blast , i memorized the whole thing , every line , all the songs i lived and breathed it over the years , i forgot about this love , writing , painting , reading , and photography took precedence however , this year i started hanging out with elizabeth we became fast friends , she reintroduced me into the world of theatre she showed me phantom of the opera , the th anniversary edition i fell in love the costumes , the voices , and the phantom thus starting me on a musical craze , i will be covering a new favorite , 'dear evan hansen' in a different post anyway , i loved it so much we decided to watch it again , and this time i decided to do it in proper phantom style i tried my best to make our basement into something resembling the phantom 's lair i did it all last minute so try not to judge it too harshly basically i just got as many candles and fairy lights as i could the food was the focal point at least to me , we also had popcorn and a veggie platter we got my mom to signal us when she was coming , and i had my sister start playing the phantom saying bravo , when she walked in her reaction made it all worth it see the exercise equipment , it 's a basement there was only so much i could do we had a phantastic night ! i will stop now , sorry not sorry
