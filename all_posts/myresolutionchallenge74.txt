i ve lost count of the times i ve reinvented myself i m like a brunette version of madonna but with less muscle , droopier boobs and a non existent toy boy reinvention is not always a bad thing we may wish to alter our health and wellbeing following an illness perhaps a change in career direction may become necessary due to redundancy , or we might want to grow into a more mature mentality after hitting a respectable age as i look back over my life and its many trials and tribulations i realise that instead of reinventing myself i should have been happy with who i was i had an insane belief that i needed to bend my character to fit other people maybe i was a chameleon in another life ? whatever the reason , i ve spent the last ten years trying to find out who i truly am one of my more recent reinventions was to give up alcohol for good ! ! now , if you know me at all , you will understand the magnitude of this task i liked a drink or two or three i was a party girl who could knock back several bottles of plonk and keep a room entertained with my loud silliness of course , this frivolity did nothing for my mental health and for every good night out i had , i suffered from many more dark thoughts so , on new year s eve i had my last drink i honestly thought this would be a hard challenge to stick to but as the year rolled by i found it easier and easier to be tee total parties , birthdays and weekends were suddenly pleasant affairs where i could remember every conversation i had and wake up at a reasonable hour the next day as a fully operational human being the only fleeting moment of doubt i have had over the last seventeen months came recently sunday th may to be exact the reason ? it was my birthday i wasn t upset that i couldn t have a glass of bubbles with breakfast , or a cocktail over dinner no , the reason i had a tee total wobble , was when i surveyed the birthday cards on my mantelpiece flowers , hearts , sequins , birds and an assortment of frilly borders stared back at me the beautiful messages from my loved ones remained the same i was filled with love and gratitude that i have such an amazing bunch of people in my life but have i turned into a boring old fart ? ! the cards i used to receive years ago were all funny hilarious cartoons and wine related quips ! oh , how times have changed , but when i think about my facebook timeline , i realise something i have stopped sharing all the funny cartoons , and the i love cooking with wine , sometimes i even put it in the food jokes they used to take up the majority of my posts and shares so , it would appear that my alcohol free lifestyle has changed me in some way what a shock i am more than happy with who i am now i'm proud to be a member of the tee total brigade , and i wo n't be hitting the drink again any time soon the benefits of being alcohol free , for me , outweigh the pleasure of drinking but , for my next challenge , i vow to find the funny side of life once more if you follow me on facebook be warned i m on a mission to reinvent myself !
