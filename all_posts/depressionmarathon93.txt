despite continued laziness at home , which i'm still letting go rather than worrying about , i had a good week this week work went well we are still incredibly busy , and we have some challenging patients on our caseload , but we also have some delightful , interesting patients , too i work with good people we work hard , keep the needs of our patients first , enjoy our patients and each other , and laugh quite a bit i feel lucky to work with such good people it certainly makes going in to work on these very busy days a lot easier it 's been cold and icy this week , so running has been a bit of a challenge it did n't even make it above degrees fahrenheit around here for several days making things worse , it rained right before the temperature dropped , so all roads , sidewalks and trails are still covered in ice i hate the dreadmill , but i was forced to run inside twice this week jet and i just came in from an icy run it was degrees with a brisk wind , and the footing was often treacherous , but i was happy to be outside worried about jet 's feet , i brought him home halfway through my miler we tried to run outside yesterday , which was a few degrees colder with an even stronger wind , but when jet got cold feet i cut it short and finished my run at the gym despite the challenging conditions , i managed to run days for a total of miles i'm happy with that the highlight of my week was picking up my year sobriety medallion although my anniversary was december th , i did n't have the opportunity to get to my meeting and pick up my medallion until tuesday it 's important for me to pick up my medallion , as it allows me both to be an example for the newly sober alcoholic and to thank the others in the room i e everyone who have helped me along the way i could n't get sober alone it took a village i'm grateful to have found my village i'm also grateful my mood is good , my house is warm , my achilles allows me to run , and my coworkers are fun professionals things could be worse i 've got nothing to complain about today
