for the moment , it appears that i'm an expert on internet addiction to video games candy crush and angry birds in particular i had a great time as a guest on antonio mora 's show consider this on friday night , when i was interviewed with time magazine reporter eliana docterman we were the final segment , a lighter side close to the pm news , and it aired around pm a driver came to pick me up , someone was at the studio to do hair and makeup , a studio man to rig me up to a microphone and earpiece , and there were a half dozen calls with producers in new york to discuss what topics i was and was n't able to discuss , plus a few calls for is the driver there ? are you on your way ? are you at the studio ? more minutes , more minutes i'm sure it would have been even more fun if i 'd been on the set in new york , but it was pretty good from the remote studio in baltimore , even with my stage fright i felt like a celebrity for an hour there , and i felt like i could discuss the topic , but i did not feel like an expert on internet addiction what really helped was when the producer told me that the host thought he was addicted to a phone game brickbuilder i said he should mention that and it would be a great springboard for discussing what makes something an addiction when the show finished airing , antonio said to me , you know , i do think i was addicted i played it all the time , in the elevator , every chance i got i asked him how he finally quit and he told me that his blackberry was upgraded to a new model and he would have had to carry an old blackberry just to play plus , he had mastered the game and it was no longer challenging an addiction ? that 's like an alcoholic saying they stopped drinking because the liquor store next door closed and it was too much effort to drive to the one down the street i 'll say what i said on the show according to the apa , the jury is still out on whether internet gaming is an addiction it 's been placed in a category under conditions warranting further research and experience we banter the term addiction about freely , as a joke , and so when of gamers polled say they are addicted we do n't know what that means in studies of young asian males , there is some evidence that those with problems with gaming have pathways in the brain that light up in similar patterns to those addicted to drugs or so says the apa often , people play phone games because they are fun ! it 's a form of entertainment , and some people have trouble stopping when they are doing fun things that does n't make it an illness or a disorder something is a problem when it 's a problem that 's what i said on tv , i may have said other things as well behavioral addictions , such as candy crush , do not have the obvious biological underpinnings of an addiction to alcohol or narcotics or other drugs where there are physical signs which accompany the withdrawal of a substance the body is dependent upon changes in heart rate , sweating , diarrhea , elevated body temperature , or even seizures but we 've come to include other , non biological areas of dyscontrol as addictions such as gambling so why not video games ? it may be hard to figure out who ca n't stop and who wo n't stop in terms of problems , these games are often not a problem for the players , but for the people around them teenage boys in particular like to play video games for hours on end , and their parents may be troubled by this if the teen stops other activities to play , such as going to school , getting acceptable grades , or making expected progress towards life goals , then it may well be a problem worthy of attention , whether that attention entails removing the game from the phone , or removing the phone from the kid , or seeing a therapist well , i 'll stop there i'm not much for dsm criteria if you have a behavior you ca n't control and it 's interfering with your ability to live a productive or healthy life , then get help throwing a disorder into the dsm seems to do a few things first , it gives the problem some credibility so insurers will pay for it 's treatment a good thing , and second , it relieves part of the responsibility of the individual to control that behavior maybe , sort of because they have a 'disorder , ' and that may not be a good thing it may call attention to a problem so that people will know there is help available , but we do n't want everyone who deviates from the norm to be labeled as disordered if your a normal weight person who is addicted to chocolate , and 'has to have a candy bar every night' but is otherwise well nourished , then enjoy your candy bar , call it an addiction if you like for fun , but it 's not a disorder if you think you 're addicted to candy crush , here are a few things to ask yourself are you missing work or deadlines at work because you are playing , in such a way that it has focused some negative consequence upon you such as being fired , a demotion , a write up , the loss of grant because you did n't get the proposal in on time , or the wrath of your boss ? is your partner more then momentarily annoyed because playing has interfered with your activities in the relationship or around the home ? if you 've been divorced only because you 've given your life to candy crush , you have a problem do you enjoy it ? if you 're playing a game that does n't give you pleasure , rethink this and if you decided you do have a problem , remember you can always delete the app
