our memories live in so many places in musty photo albums and diaries , in boxes full of the memorabilia of generations before us our memories live in stories we tell each other about the past and about family members no longer alive our memories live in our hearts my brother mike called me not long ago to ask me to start a project to bring to life some of the people his children will know only in old photos you know so many of the stories and the people in those photos , he said i wish you would do more than just label them although that 's important , too could you maybe make little memory books so my children will have some idea about who these people were ? i want them to know aunt molly from her childhood on and how we loved her and what an impact she had on our lives he 's right that i know a lot of the stories our parents , aunt molly and other long departed relatives told when i was a little girl , my favorite stories were the true ones i would pester my mother , my father , aunt molly , grandma , aunt evelyn and aunt ruth for stories about when they were children for my mother , her mother and her sisters evelyn and ruth , these were stories about close family life on a kansas farm , in the days when farming was a family tradition not a corporate enterprise and in a small town where friendships spanned generations for my father and his sister molly , childhood stories revolved around early loss their father died when they were very young and early hardship as my father struggled to support the family as a child actor in hollywood films and vaudeville they lost their mother when molly was a teenager and my father a young college student and they both worked their way through ucla and shared a lifelong bond forged in hardship and in love , despite their considerable personal differences while planning and procrastinating on this family memories project , i came across some wonderful digital scrapbook software that is making my task much easier it is called mymemories com and it offers wonderful software suites not only for memories in general but also for weddings and for photo albums with a special flair and templates for scrapbooks , and memory books for all occasions i'm using the my memories suite software for my photo and text memory book for the truly creative , music and videos can be added to the mix you can even record your own narration for your family 's story to go along with the photos and videos ! i 've started small with a test memory book on aunt molly who was , of course , my very favorite family member i'm using a lovely , nostalgic template but have removed some of the beautiful art flourishes in order to have more room for text it 's very flexible that way here are my first test pages those of you who have read my previous writings about my beloved aunt molly will understand how much this fledgling memory book will mean to me and my family i'm going to be adding a lot more pages and more decorative flourishes to this book as i get more confident and inspired but this is my tentative beginning as i 've been working on these pages , i 've been thinking of so many of you who are so much more artistically talented than i am and all the beautiful projects you might like to make there is a lot you can do with this software , i'm finding you can keep a memory book or scrapbook as an online project or you can arrange to have it printed into family treasure to hand down through the generations if you feel inclined to try such a project , too , i'm offering a giveaway one reader will win a my memories software package , valued at how do you enter ?
