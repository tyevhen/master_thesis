i'm healing fairly well i spent most of the weekend inside , sitting , icing , reading , and watching tv it was beautiful outside , so i hobbled around a bit in the driveway there was n't much for me to do out there , and i was n't sure i was supposed to drive yet anyway today i did n't care i got in my car and took myself to the gym i spent minutes lifting weights people were staring at me hobbling on my crutches from machine to machine , but i did n't care it felt good to move my body i probably should have gotten myself there earlier i stopped into work to say hello i'm hoping to get back to my job soon , as i do n't know how these bills are going to get paid if i do n't financially , i'm stressed i hate financial stress , and that 's all i'm going to say about that ! my mood remains good , but i do miss running i'm anxious about my recovery there 's no guarantee the surgery will cure me to the point of running again , but i try really hard not to think about that instead , i'm looking forward to being out there in the sun again , running , and painfree that will be a glorious day
