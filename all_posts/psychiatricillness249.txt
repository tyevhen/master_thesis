i had another good day today i managed to get up ok this morning so i have taken my tablets late again tonight work was ok i got lots done i sat in the orchard for lunch , as it was a lovely sunny day i ate my lunch alone though and i think i missed a couple of possibilities to join others it was a lovely day , when i was in the office i opened all the windows wide , few wasps came in but i did not mind o the weather has been gorgeous ! by the time i got home there was a really good thunderstorm and large hailstones i love weather like that although my friend thinks i am a bit crazy i went to the pub with my friend after work today , which was nice she is confident that the baby will not come while her husband is away as it has not fully turned this is good thing , as i would not know what to do i am keeping my phone with me until her husband is home ! bedtime for me , nite !
