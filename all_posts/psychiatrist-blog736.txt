we talk about ducks here on shrink rap , but in my 'real' life , i like giraffes i was very excited when today 's american journal of psychiatry arrived in the mail and there were two giraffes on the cover ! and if that was n't wonderful enough , henry put the cover up on my facebook page with the cover of shrink rap in the background and mama giraffe saying to baby giraffe , because i'm your mother , no playtime until you finish reading ! how 'd he do that ? well , i liked it , so i thought i would share it with you if you did n't catch it , our book was reviewed in the johns hopkins magazine by kristen intlekopher three authors could n't ask for a better review , so please do read it ! you 'll need to scroll past oysters , cell phone radiation , and political order , but this review made my day someone asked if i would friend jesus if he were on facebook i ca n't imagine i would ask to be his friend and i'm not sure what i would do if jesus sent me a friend request who thinks of these questions ?
