someone on slashdot wrongly called unipage a possible replacement for pdf it has no relationship to pdf whatsoever it 's also not a file format so what is it , then ? it 's simply a way to serialize a web page and its contents , making the page self contained with no reliance on outbound links images are stored inside the page in data url format see rfc , which of course makes the whole scheme incompatible with ie then again , the adobe svg plugin for ie does support data url , so it may be possible for some clever soul to write a script that uses embedded svg islands to work around this ie limitation in semi transparent manner so to speak
