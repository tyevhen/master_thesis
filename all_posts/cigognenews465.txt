i have written about hijacking before when there is sexual excitement the lower brain levels are activated along with whatever strong imprints live there the strong stimulation resonates with the early imprint and reactivates it it now joins the sex act and forces the run off of sex via the imprint it merges seamlessly with the sex act , the build up and final release so that the person can no longer tell which is which in the same way that some emotional stimulus in the present activates deep brain structures , and again there is the run off of sex through the imprint example a man had a depressed mother who never smiled nor showed any joy he needed some show of recognition , some bit of joy to see him , some piece of emotion that meant he was important to her what stimulated him in sex was staring at pictures of nude women showing joy at the sight of their nude man here was the merger of primal need and sex the only way he could discharge the tension was through the ritual that fulfilled his need symbolically sexual discharge relieved the tension of his need otherwise how could he get relief ? the only way was to feel the need exactly for what it was , relive the pain and discharge the feeling in a real way a primal another man , and i should say , men , because it is so frequent , had to dress up in women s clothes and masturbate or have his girlfriend dress up in a bra and panties and masturbate him why ? his mother was left by his father when he was five years old she left for work every day , but left her clothes on the chair in the bedroom he started out rubbing her clothes all over his body a way to feel close to her later , as he became sexual he would either dress up in women s clothes , or use them to masturbate with and find relief through sexual discharge again the merger of need and sex relief through a symbolic channel sex looks real but for the neurotic it becomes symbolic channel for relief as excitement in sex builds so does the need for symbolic channels and the very early imprint is so strong that it drives the obsession it becomes compulsive he can t stop , not because he is so sexual but because he is so needy and needs to relieve himself through sex so when a therapist tries to treat sexual compulsion as a sex problem she may be way off treating the wrong thing treating the symbolic outlet instead of the need when a young girl is shushed a lot and quelled from showing great enthusiasm it affects sex because her sexual expression is also suppressed as her enthusiasm in sex builds so does the repression the result is abortive sex , lack of climax , and frustration in short , sex is an expression of all of ourselves , not just the sex organ it is at the core of our being and altering sex life and sexual neurosis means that a lot of later pain has to be relived before we can significantly affect sex check out your own fantasies and rituals and see how it tells you what needs were fulfilled early in your life
