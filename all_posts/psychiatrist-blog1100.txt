i got my wish i got to read the rest of the nytimes magazine article , the holy grail of the unconsious by sara corbett about carl jung , on the patio with coffee , a bagel and lox , on a gorgeous sunday the article left me thinking perhaps it left me longing and maybe this will be more of a journal entry then of a blog post you 'll forgive me for being a bit raw i read the article and i was drawn in i want to read the red book the soon to be published work of jung about his own exploration of his unconscious much of jung 's journey occured during a difficult period in his life , and corbett writes whatever the case , in , jung , who was then , got lost in the soup of his own psyche he was haunted by troubling visions and heard inner voices grappling with the horror of some of what he saw , he worried in moments that he was , in his own words , menaced by a psychosis or doing a schizophrenia he later would compare this period of his life this confrontation with the unconscious , as he called it to a mescaline experiment he described his visions as coming in an incessant stream he likened them to rocks falling on his head , to thunderstorms , to molten lava i often had to cling to the table , he recalled , so as not to fall apart i wonder , if i read this will i just dismiss jung 's words as products of an illness , not worth analysis in their own right ? humanity has had a complicated relationship with the ideas of people suffering from mental illness and it sounds like jung was indeed tormented sometimes they are revered as holy , sometimes they are dismissed as disorganized , other times they are seen as evil my best guess is that i will feel the red book is over my head , too philosophical , too complex for me to understand the book can be pre ordered from amazon , and for , well , i'm thinking about it i'm thinking , too , about visiting the rubin museum to see the exhibition with the original red book but i know very little about jung , and it 's not jung , or even the red book , that really grabbed me about this article the story included the stories of some people , one of them dr stephen martin , a jungian analyst and founder of the philomen foundation dr martin has one of jung 's hankerchief 's framed in his office he 's devoted himself to jung , he believes in him with all his heart corbet writes just as i had , stephen martin flew to zurich the week the red book was taken from its bank vault home and moved to a small photo studio near the opera house to be scanned , page by page , for publication a separate english translation along with shamdasani s introduction and footnotes will be included at the back of the book martin already made a habit of visiting zurich a few times a year for bratwurst and renewal and to attend to philemon foundation business my first morning there , we walked around the older parts of zurich , before going to see the book zurich made martin nostalgic it was here that he met his wife , charlotte , and here that he developed the almost equally important relationship with his analyst , frey rohn , carrying himself and his dreams to her office two or three times weekly for several years people are searchers , some more than others some people are content as is , they look for nothing others scour their worlds , looking looking for what ? i suppose it depends on the individual and i suppose that many who search have no idea what it is they are looking for so there is a piece of me that 's jealous of stephen martin , without ever having met him , without knowing a thing about him except for these excerpts in the nyt magazine why ? i suppose because he seems to be someone who is able to believe in something so strongly , so wholly , and with such devotion i imagine someone who devotes themselves to a cause and a belief with such certainty and reverence , feel sure that jung had the answers in corbett 's article , he likens his devotion to a religion , and it 's hard for me to imagine ever believing that another human being has something worthy of this kind of worship if that 's the right word i think i'm jealous of what dr martin believes he has found whether it 's right or not , he still has the ability to believe so completely in the rightness of someone and something , and presumably it 's because jung gave him something he 's found worth having jung is not what i 've been looking for i might might read about his journey , or i might want the book just to have it , because some things are worth having just to be had , even if i never read it , even if i never open it and maybe dr martin is just one more tormented soul , but for today a day which started with a bagel and lox and an absolutely gorgeous morning i wanted him to be someone who searched and found what ever it was he was looking for
