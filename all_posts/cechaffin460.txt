after the retreat , i had a few days of consciousness when i say consciousness i mean i was not dyssynchronous , a term i made up to describe how , especially in anxiety , we either get ahead of or behind ourselves , which in my case makes for many minor domestic accidents a bump on the head , some broken glass , a burn while cooking these sorts of things do n't happen when i'm present as kathleen says , there he goes again , galloping off in all directions at once how much of my mind 's busyness is due to anxiety and how much to my mood disorder and how much to my fertile imagination and how these three are related , no one can say but i remember as a young child , say five , how i could be present with a pool of leaves or while observing a caterpillar or capturing a lizard it is a dream of mine to be more present , to be in the moment without my mind floating away to other things nowis what 's important that 's where we live you can always take time to plan , but you must not grasp your plans too tightly , as if you could control the future you will always need to flex , to make adjustments , to make room for god there is also the knowledge of when you ca n't be present , or choose not to , or arbitrarily shift to being present with something or someone else certainly the composition of a sonnet does better without interruptions , but should a neighbor appear at the door , i can make a decision about either telling him to come in or asking his pardon to finish my work first it takes self knowledge to decide then the script and the choice are always made easier by mitigating circumstances , i e , your neighbor is weeping and holding a dead pet in that case you do n't have to worry about the sonnet at all as the man 's grief draws you away as it should and then you are present with a grieving man everyone knows what i'm talking about to not be present is how most accidents happen the miracle of mindfulness is what i mean , though i never finished that book i'm no mystic but i could sure use more training in this discipline , because it is no miracle but the unredacted state we ought to enjoy most of the time today 's sonnet broaches the question to be conscious and present , to treat all things as holy , the way you grasp a spoon or knife stay with it and watch your imaginings yield to this moment this is your life frame by frame it 's your story to tell , a one act play god made up for the stars the audience is dead , invisible so lose your understudy there 's no cause to think of who 's ahead and who 's behind this is your moment and it always was , when you forget your role , and deaf and blind feel your way through put the show on pause finger your spoon and forget about its use until the grapefruit comes revel in juice also , that sense of concentration in childhood to which i referred is demonstrated by another poem rooted as much as we arborealize , the central trunk should be a corpus callosum to dip into like water of heartwood , each twig accessible , the journey reversible red cheeked on my tricycle with a battered cowboy hat admiring a pool of autumn leaves wherever we go we should be able to go back and out another shoot flowering , up the green fuse to the white explosion and back i remember the scraping of palms on stucco at night , fearful pteranadon wings , or taking acid at fourteen naked in the big sur river , its bottom stones littered with sycamore gold depublished and available for publication at rodent neutral , craig erick
