today was a good day i worked a little over hours that is the longest i 've worked in well over one month needless to say , i was exhausted and slightly brain dead by the end of the day but it felt good to contribute to the welfare of my patients and to assist my coworkers again my mood held steady as well it was n't back to normal not even close but i was n't in tears or totally overwhelmed at all today so today was a good day it 's been a really , really long time since i 've been able to say that i 've been focusing on getting one thing done at a time today it was work and then a walk tomorrow i hope to run miles and then work hours i do n't usually work on thursdays , but i ca n't work on friday , as i'm doing a maintenance ect treatment on friday this will be my second of four maintenance ect treatments i'm not thrilled about the maintenance ect treatments , but i decided i had to do everything within my power to squash this depression episode before it literally killed me who knows ? maybe last week 's treatment contributed to feeling better today ? it 's possible it feels good to be able to say today was a good day i'm a long way from healed i'm still struggling in so many ways , but for today i'm just focusing on what i 've gotten done i worked i walked with puck i made myself dinner and now i'm updating my blog i do n't know what tomorrow will bring but today was a good day
