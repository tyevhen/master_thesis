when i read this study a couple of years ago , i applauded the recommendations the process of winding down the use of chimpanzees is not easy , but it is important in my opinion the three research analysis principles outlined in the announcement are a good first step in moving this process forward it is time to stop the indiscriminate use of chimps for medical research chimpanzees in biomedical research posted on june , by sally rockey today nih made an important announcement about the use of chimpanzees in biomedical and behavioral research after accepting the findings of an extensive institute of medicine iom study commissioned by nih , and reviewing the implementation recommendations from the council of councils and public feedback , nih leadership has decided to significantly reduce the use of chimpanzees in the biomedical research it supports , and expects to designate the majority of nih owned chimpanzees for retirement the iom study released in proposed three principles to analyze research using chimpanzees first , the knowledge gained by the research must be necessary to advance the public s health second , there must be no other animal research model that could provide this knowledge , and the research cannot be ethically performed on human subjects finally , the animals used in the proposed research must be maintained in natural habitats or appropriate physical and social environments nih supported research projects involving chimpanzees that do not meet these principles will wind down in a planned way that will avoid an impact on the animals and unacceptable losses to the science supported by these projects on this website you can find more on the recommendations accepted by nih , and a summary of the public comments received as part of our request for comments earlier this year we plan to prepare subsequent procedural guidance and technical assistance , as appropriate , to implement some of these decisions researchers should continue to follow the existing guidance regarding the submission of applications , proposals , or protocols for research involving chimpanzees until nih finalizes this procedural guidance we will be working closely with all of our stakeholders to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for research projects that will be affected by nih s decision
