yes , it is hard to believe that months ago i started taking dutasteride avodart at that time i didn t know what to expect , but i was hoping for something special if you have followed my journey , you know that my first couple of months were fantastic after that , things calmed down a little , but it was still good one year into my experiment , i was very thankful that things were still good i hadn t noticed any negative side effects and my strength and stamina were good i came down with the flu in january and it was a tough three weeks i was also on a blood thinner at the time for a blood clot in my calf combined , the two destroyed my strength i found it difficult to even lift a glass of water or stand for more than a minute fortunately , as i stopped taking the blood thinner , i was also recovering from the flu almost immediately i could tell the difference leg strength improved daily and within three days i was back to where i was before the clot and the flu boy , was i thankful in reviewing my daily journal , the one i started over two years ago , the consistency of strength and stamina is most apparent prior to starting the dutasteride trial , i had at least one down day a week where i felt more tired fatigued i just don t have them anymore i have also increased the length number of exercises and reps over the last couple of years instead of a gradual decline in my strength , it appears to have stabilized and i am doing as much today as i was two years ago additionally , my ability to swallow without choking has improved in december , along with my annual physical , checkup and blood tests , my doctor and i reviewed my last two years of taking dutasteride we decided that i should continue to take avodart for another year on february , i celebrated my second year celebrated ? yes , celebrated dutaseride is not a cure for kennedy s disease and , it is not an effective treatment for everyone but , it works for me and for that i am most thankful
