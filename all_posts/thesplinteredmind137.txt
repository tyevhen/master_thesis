this week i'm trying to find the humor in being me to outside observers there is a lot to laugh about , but on the inside i'm a wee bit tired of my ad hd ness laughter can come reluctantly when i feel like a dope of course , there 's a lot about ad hd i absolutely love , like the boundless energy , the wild creativity , the absentmindedness well , ok , i do n't really like that one , but i 've learned to live with it what i have n't learned to live with are the stupid mistakes , or should i say learned to like because i live with them whether i like them or not in the blink of an eye i can make a mistake so ginormous i 'll be feeling the hurt for weeks overcoming ad hd with humor becomes very difficult in those moments case no phonebook forgetfulness every time i needed to call the neurologist i could n't remember his phone number i 'd have to look his number up via google because i could n't find it in my yellow pages so two months ago i finally decided enough was enough why had n't i added this guy 's phone number into my address book ? i fired up my pda to add his number and then had this sinking feeling that i should look his number up there first voil ! there it was how long had his number been in my pda ? all those times looking his phone number up the hard way and i had it all the time right where it was supposed to be verdict roll your eyes stupid , and easy to laugh off case no whoopsies a few months back i was doing some tinkering around gmail preferences and accidently deleted my main gmail address i'm not sure what i thought i was doing , but there i was feeling hot embarrassment again this email address happened to be the one i used to manage my web domain and gmail would n't let me recreate it what a great time to forget my domain password , too apparently , i chose a new password so secure even i ca n't crack it to make changes i have to prove to the registrar that i'm the actual owner by means of faxes , hair samples , dental records , and personal affidavits of authenticity by the nurses who helped change my first diapers all for want of a brain with some impulse control verdict investigation ongoing with undiscovered repercussions potentially most stupid mistake and terribly embarrassing when talking to tech support case no maybe they wo n't notice ? i jot down notes for future columns and post date them all the time to work on later , but last christmas i absentmindedly published a few of them about ten minutes later i discovered my mistake and quickly unpublished them two months later i was playing around with blogsearch google com and discovered to my horror that google had indexed my goofs , especially one in particular it went a little like this gerry told me about rex and brandon and how useless they are how badly they handle their ad hd how badly their ad hd rules their lives how they ca n't hold a job i flushed red with embarrassment and felt as if my hair was on fire the little snippet cut off my punch line i 've never had problems like that right it was n't clear at all that i was setting up a joke part of my self deprecating humor i exaggerate a bit and paint myself as a numbskull for laughs in this case , i did n't think the joke was very funny involving other people in the gag felt mean spirited and gossipy so i deleted the entry never realizing it had lived on for two months afterwards i worried that rex or brandon might take a little stroll in google 's blogsearch and find my gaffe i finally managed to get google to remove the entries , but it was nails and teeth until then verdict like being boiled alive in a vat of greasy embarrassment when an otherwise intelligent person does something randomly stupid , it 's hard for the ego not to take a hit however , in my experience self recrimination only feeds low self esteem which spawns more mistakes therefore , i am proud to say i have learned to accept bloopers in my life as par for the course i do n't blow them off as insignificant , but neither do i allow myself to slip into self loathing over them they simply add character and the perfect cure for boredom so that time when i slipped into work after hours to check on some source material then slipped back out but left the store unlocked was nothing more than a harmless display of ad hd charm sure , i was fired and permanently destroyed a friendship , but i was building character and just as soon as i straighten out my internet domain mess i 'll probably laugh at that blunder , too , providing i actually get to straighten it out i have faith , however with all the experience i have in making stupid mistakes this is just another goofy bullet to dodge i 'll just have to live with the pound of flesh it takes as it strafes by tags technorati absentminded add adhd ad hd cognitive behavior therapy coping strategies embarrassment forgetfullness gaffe goof mistakes
