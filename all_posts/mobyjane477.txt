i just want to say , this morning , that i know how hard it is to do a dumb little exercise when depression hits i got hit with one this morning when i woke up and i could n't believe the pain like the end of the world and i didn't want to do any exercise actually , as i look back and try to remember , i did n't want anything i guess maybe you could even say that depression is the inability to want anything i never thought of that before maybe lack of desire , lack of the ability to want anything may be the same as despair maybe sometime for an exercise i 'll try and want something easy to say that now because i'm not depressed i do n't know if that will occur to me when i get hit with depression at any rate , for me , i have committed myself that depressive feelings , despair , any kind of disturbing thoughts is not an option for me so i started in with my old standby , yes , we have no bananas , yes , we have no bananas then i morphed into , , , , who are we for and i kept at it for a couple of minutes then i got dressed and went out to do some gardening i think i stopped doing the exercises as i was getting dressed , as i was thinking about getting dressed , and what part of the yard i was going to weed by the time i got downstairs the depression was completely gone i also thought , later on , i wonder if i had not done the exercises and just let the depression go if it would have continued or ended on its own i do n't think i want to try that as an experiment , at least not right now i spent too many years periodically not being able to get out of bed for two weeks and i have decided that no more than seconds after i get hit , i do an exercise i think it is important to catch depression right at the very first before it has a chance to leave its stain on your brain
