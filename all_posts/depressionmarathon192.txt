two months of pain , desperation , fatigue , isolation , low motivation , debility , low energy , and low mood it 's been two months since this depression relapse began it 's been two months since i 've worked two months since my life was hijacked i 'd like to have my life back i 'd like to be released from this little spit of hell any day now i try not to worry about how long this relapse will last it does n't do me any good , and it 's a waste of precious energy to think about it but lately i have been worried about something else as this relapse continues , i'm fretting about what kind of example i'm setting i write this blog to educate people about depression , but i also aspire to offer hope to fellow sufferers that 's why i voluntarily speak to the public , why i 've been open to interviews for television and radio , and why i participated in the healthination videos i want everyone to understand major depression , and i hope to set an example of someone living well with this horrible illness it can be done unfortunately , i do n't feel i 've been doing life very well over the past couple months i mean i'm doing the best i can , but the longer this relapse lasts the less well i feel i'm doing i feel i 've offered less hope and more hopelessness lately more anger and frustration than resilience , i think i guess i could argue that hopelessness , anger , and frustration are all part of the journey , but i worry i'm doing more harm than good by writing so vividly about it perhaps my expectations are unrealistic , but i have expectations , nonetheless i want to be an example for those of you suffering i want to be an example of healthy living , resilience , and perseverance through the difficult times but lately my resilience has been put to the test this has been a rough ride generally i like rides , but this one has tested my limits i'm praying for relief soon in the meantime i 'll continue to do the best i can i 'll keep forcing myself to get out , to move , to exercise it feels impossible , but i know i have to hang on if not for me , than i at least must hang on for you carry on , my friends
