i apologize for the delay in posting this week the road has been rough i 've been overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness , saddled with dark , disturbing thoughts , handicapped by the energy of a sloth , and stupefied with delayed mentation i 've been evaluated and reevaluated on a daily basis by multiple professionals , all of whom expressed concern over the level of my despair things have been almost unbelievably difficult , yet here i am life goes on at the request of a couple professionals , my mother flew in to stay with me after i was released from the hospital last week she is here to help out and to keep me safe she is assisting me with reintegrating into life , as my brain is severely disabled in the aftermath of ect treatments , and possibly simply as a complication of the depression i literally could not be more stupid ! i cannot remember anything ! i feel like i 've been dropped into my world without the benefit of any historical perspective i cannot remember when or how many times i 've been hospitalized over the past weeks times i could not remember the fact that jet had surgery on his elbow approximately two months ago i ca n't remember race results which have previously been second nature heck , i ca n't even remember running most of the races i ran this past summer ! i'm clueless , and it sucks ! i have to ask my mom or my friends for every detail of my recent past , and even after they inform me , the details often remain totally unfamiliar it is frustrating , unsettling , and bewildering i hate it i do not wish this level of depression on anyone someone asked me the other day if i wanted to die i 've determined that i do n't care anymore , but i wo n't take my life , as i care enough about the others around me that i would not want to bring them such hurt my thinking , however , pulls me in that direction i am using what little energy i have to keep putting one foot in front of the other and move in the direction of life instead i appreciate your time here , dear readers i appreciate your thoughts and prayers your recent comments are so appreciated i am humbled by your words thank you all so much you all help me more than you can or will ever know thank you i only hope i am able to impart a tiny bit of wisdom somewhere within this pain at least then there might be some purpose i can only hope until next time , my friends , i 'll keep on keeping on as best i can thanks for hanging in there with me
