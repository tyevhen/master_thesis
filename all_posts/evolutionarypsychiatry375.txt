in the west a few centuries ago , mental illness was considered the result of personal or spiritual failure those who suffered were often considered punished by god , and incarcerated or otherwise treated cruelly think of bertha antoinetta mason locked away in thornfield manor in france in the early s , phillipe pinel and jean etienne esquirol introduced the idea of the traitement morale , that is , using empathy and compassion as treatments , and they began to develop basic diagnostic categories a few years later , in germany , kahlbaum and kraepelin , who worked in mental asylums , began documenting and describing psychotic and cycling mood illness some of their descriptions are still used as diagnostic criteria in the dsmiv today it 's important to note that these doctors felt psychiatric illness was biological , that is part of an organic disorder of the brain , much like a stroke or epilepsy some of the disorders , such as hebrephrenia a giddy type of schizophrenia found more often in young people were extremely common back then , but incredibly rare now catatonia a type of movement disorder associated with schizophrenia either frozen movement or frenzied , uncontrolled movement was also much , much more common in kraepelin and kahlbaum 's catalogs than today towards the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century , there was a large scale increase in the number of psychiatric inpatients thousands upon thousands of people ended up in psychiatric hospitals there was speculation at the time that the human race was degenerating as a result of some unknown natural selection process kraepelin traveled to java and noted that mental illness was rare there , and felt the domestication of the human race was to blame unfortunately , he ignored the effects of poverty , poor hygiene , poor nutrition , and lack of education as possible causes of mental illness his ideas were very influential , and since there was no pharmacological treatment at the time , many countries began measures such as sterilizing anyone with mental illness to stop the decline of the human race psychiatric authorities saw themselves as advocates of the mental health of the population and some advocates of racial purity , rather than as medical doctors who treated individuals it is toward the end of this time that weston price made his famous journeys , and thus the name of his book , nutrition and physical degeneration , and his preoccupation with the decline of physical , moral , and mental fiber , as it were , in the s we know what happened next in germany , the eugenics movement became the systematic extermination of millions of people , all for the sake of a non existent and meaningless racial purity among those murdered were the mentally ill one who fled nazi persecution was sigmund freud , and his ideas as to the cause of psychiatric illness were almost entirely different than the psychiatrists of the th and th centuries he theorized that mental illness was caused by unconscious and repressed desires , and exacerbated by family situations particularly problems with mothering and coping patterns the treatment , therefore , was therapy back then , psychoanalysis a large group of psychiatrists and psychologists were influenced by his ideas , and london and new york became centers of psychoanalytic thinking in the s and s in the next decades , psychotherapy advanced by leaps and bounds , and today there are or different kinds in my opinion , the best book about the history of psychotherapy is freud and beyond by the s , it became clear that mental illness had both biological and psychological underpinnings however , even to this day , there remains a false dichotomy that all psychiatric illness can be cured if one works hard enough and has a good enough therapist , and that psychiatrists do n't care about psychology or therapy and only want to stuff you full of pills truth be told , social , biological , and psychological underpinnings are all extremely important , and all must be kept in mind when recommending appropriate treatment i believe that all psychiatric illness is biologic , meaning rooted in neurotransmitters and membrane potentials , but that genetics , environment , nutrition , and psychotherapy impact how the brain works the brain is better understood now than ever , which is to say it is still poorly understood in many respects the vast complexity is nearly unfathomable in my mind , the study of nutritional and evolutionary paradigms which may predispose us to psychiatric illness have been neglected in favor of psychology and the psychiatric medications in the next post , i 'll focus more on the changes in major depressive disorder over the last century , and speculate as to some nutritional causes
