currently , lamictal is undergoing phase iii trials as an add on treatment for schizophrenia here s what a recent review had to say about research done to this point on lamotrigine as an add on treatment we found five relevant trials total n , but no usable data on service outcomes , general functioning , behaviour , engagement with services , satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes overall , reporting of data was poor those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response n , rct , rr ci to there was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve n , rct , rr ci to there was , however , a significant reduction in the panss total scores n , rct , wmd ci to , p , positive symptom sub scale scores n , rcts , wmd ci to and negative symptom sub scale scores n , rcts , wmd , ci to most cognitive measures showed no differences n , rcts , rr not attaining bacs composite score of ci to so the panss shows change , which is good , but on the other hand there was no usable data on a number of important variables this brings up the issue of what is clinically relevant what is the relationship between panss scores and real life patient functioning ? i m not claiming to have the answer if panss scores are changing yet mental state however it was measured is not also improving , what 's going on ? the question is important if we have nothing but a single measure indicating improvement , does this mean a drug really benefits patients ? alan kazdin discussed this point much more brilliantly than i could in an article in the american psychologist recently what made this of particular concern to me was the fact that no usable data were reported , across five trials , on a variety of other aspects of patient functioning was this just a lack of curiosity on the part of investigators or were data suppressed ? i ve not dug deeply on this one , but it is a question worth thinking about
