so here i am , telling the truth for the first time , ever , publicly i have been ashamed to tell people about this for so long that i am literally and those of you who have heard me rant about the correct use of literally know i really mean it crying at the keyboard because it was the hardest thing i ve ever done to get over years and years of humiliation and despair to admit that i needed help so here it is i m alesia holliday and alyssa day and i have battled depression all my life wow that was really fucking hard i can see why maybe aa makes you stand up and admit to being an alcoholic over and over perhaps repetition lessens the terror ? perhaps desensitization lessens the pain ? i don t know i hope so i m finally speaking up and speaking out because i can t be silent any longer i think my life might hang in the balance i had a birthday in november and it hit me hard so hard because all i could think was how am i going to slog through so many more years of a life like this ? i call depression the black pit , because it s so damn dark down there it s the horrible , hideous a m of the soul , where all the worst bits of self torment and self sabotage and self hatred throw a big fucking party and jump on my head you re not good enough your next book can never be as good as the last one you re a terrible person , writer , wife , mother , daughter , sister , human being i don t think anybody really understands depression the doctors think our brain chemistry is messed up , and we can fix it with medication the therapists think it s a behavioral issue and we can fix it with therapy probably both are true , to varying degrees maybe all i know is that it s something that can kill people by destroying all hope , and that it s probably going to be almost as hard , or even harder , to fight my way out of the black pit as it was to just lie in the bottom of that damn pit in the dark hoping to disappear but i know i have to try i have the best friends and family in the world , but when you re in the black pit , they don t know how to help because they can tell you it will get better , but you don t believe them or they can cheer you on to climb out , but it feels like the sides are coated with slippery oil and no matter how hard you try to climb out , you re just going to slide back down maybe they ll even throw you a rope , but the thought of trying to climb a rope is impossible when you haven t had the strength to take a shower for three days i actually had this conversation with myself once you have to wash your hair i i don t have the strength to do it you have to do it i can t you have to why does it matter if i have clean hair ? i m such a loser but what if you die here on the couch with dirty hair and everybody knows you were too much of a loser to wash your hair ? so i washed my hair because some tiny part of me wanted to keep everyone from knowing i was hurting so much and so far gone because , thanks to society s stigmatizing mental issues like depression , i was too humiliated to even admit that i was hurting until i hit that birthday and realized i didn t have the energy to keep fighting , over and over and over until i realized my subconscious had been screaming at me for a while , because the last three stories i d written all had main characters die until i admitted how much i needed help so i told my family and my doctor i told my agent and my editors i told my friends i cried so many tears that i think my tear ducts are broken and a tiny , tiny , tiny miracle happened so many people told me that they re on my side and that they love me and they support me , even though , deep down , i still felt like i didn t deserve support or love because depression is an evil monster who gets his claws around our mind and heart and gut and never , ever wants to let go well , fuck that i am getting help and , for the first time in a long time , i see a glimmer of light and hope for the first time in an even longer time , i don t feel like a complete fraud who is pretending to be happy my editors have been amazing , but the next league of the black swan book had to be pushed back from may , because i was completely unable to finish it in time i promise to let you know when it s rescheduled , and i appreciate your patience and kindness and understanding more than i can ever say my novella i wrote nearly two years ago , alejandro 's sorceress , is waiting for me to be able to look at it with clear eyes so i can finally post it for you i'm trying i hope it will be very soon i 've started meds , and i 've started therapy , and both are helping i'm trying to find my balance , and just feeling a glimmer of hope instead of being crushed under the weight of hopelessness is a miracle and today , another miracle occurred i wanted to write i did write and the words i wrote in my story didn t lie there , flat and lifeless on the page , forcing me to delete them and start over like they do when i m in the black pit instead , they danced and sang like stories are supposed to do quietly , still , and a little shaky on their feet , but there was definitely singing and dancing i m alesia , and i have battled depression all my life hey it was easier , just by an infinitesimal bit , that second time let s try it again i m alesia , and i have battled depression all my life but now i m getting help , and i m climbing out of that damn black pit is going to be better , and i m never going to hide in a corner , ashamed and hurting , again i know it s going to be a climb , and there is no instant , magical cure but this is a start , and just like that blank first page of any new book a fresh start feels like it holds hope , and light , and promise please , please , let s smash through this stigma about depression , so nobody has to be ashamed to ask for help , ever again please , please , anybody else out there who s hurting please reach out for help , right now don t suffer in silence or shame for even one more day let s make depression our bitch , instead of the other way around with hugs , and love , and finally a little bit of hope , alesia here are some resources the national institute of mental health http www nimh nih gov health topics depression index shtml pbs has compiled a list of resources here http www pbs org wgbh takeonestep depression resources html and if you feel the least bit suicidal , please reach out immediately you can call the national suicide prevention lifeline at talk if you are in crisis , and be connected to a trained counselor in your area , or find further resources at their website http www suicidepreventionlifeline org
