posted by clinkshrink i suppose i could rant quite easily now , as a matter of fact about the cost of re certification exams i mean really , what are they spending a registration fee on ? it 's a computer test , for heavens sake no one even needs to score it i know what programmers get paid so i can tell you that money ai n't going to the techies who built the thing if the project was outsourced to india they could have hired over computer programmers for the cost of one physician 's registration fee i suppose i could be comforted by the fact that i'm supporting indian families , but somehow that just does n't cut it right now when i'm mainly concentrating on not failing the test
