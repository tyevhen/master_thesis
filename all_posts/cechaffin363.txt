today is not the best day to try to describe the change in consciousness from depressed to normal at least as normal as i know of normality as i did not sleep well , it 's raining , and i'm recovering from a cold to tell the truth , i do n't know if i really can describe what it is like to be depressed and then not depressed my first thought is what a miracle ! i'm not depressed ! and then i go running about starting new projects and trying to make up for lost time , as if , in not being depressed , i should immediately demand something of myself what i really need to do is to enjoy not being depressed the taste of good food , the love of my wife , laughter , good literature , music and all the rest though i am not capable yet of describing the process , i can give examples while depressed i could barely read the paper now i'm reading thoreau , dostoevsky , tolstoy and poetry while depressed my only real writing was this blog i could do nothing else now i 've written two good essays , one already accepted , and had three poems accepted and one just published while resuming work on my thriller novel not only that , i 've applied to audition for several music venues this is what i do when i'm not depressed i 've been much more sociable as well kathleen says i can be very charming me ! imagine ! what is the difference ? first and foremost i do n't think about myself all the time , i'm not lost in a conversation about all my deficits , shortcomings , failures , wasted life , and all the other melancholy inhabitants of a diseased mind now if i find i'm starting to have a conversation with myself , i tell myself to shut up , and it works previously my brain told me to shut up and i could n't help but listen to the endless , pointless conversation about myself i look different i make jokes i feel stronger physically i'm quicker physically depression is a very physical disease , and bodily changes are striking from old photographs my friends can easily see when i was depressed and when not that 's a beginning i 'll try more when i'm feeling a bit better ce
