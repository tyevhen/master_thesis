i 've spent my life searching for meaning i realize now see posts below that i 've been looking in the wrong places i should have turned my bucket upside down , found a cozy closet , put a clothespin on my nose , and settled in with a good mentally ill prisoner or two okay , enough on the wonders of correctional psychiatry and please do forgive my sarcasm teasing clinkshrink is a lot of fun so can i ask , why are we the only blog in america that is n't asking why chris was voted off american idol ? ?
