i poke fun at the fact that my wife is a vegan , but it really does not bother me i have always tried to support her and for several years while we lived in pennsylvania , i only ate chicken or fish and no red meat at all i survived just kidding and actually did not miss eating red meats much anyway for about two years , my wife even went macrobiotic she was probably the healthiest she has ever been and definitely felt the best i supported her venture and actually found myself enjoying her cooking to digress a little , the macrobiotic approach feels that food and food quality powerfully affect health , well being , and happiness , and that a macrobiotic diet has more beneficial effects than others do the macrobiotic approach suggests choosing food that is less processed macrobiotics emphasizes locally grown whole grain cereals , pulses legumes , vegetables , seaweed , fermented soy products and fruit , combined into meals according to the principle of balance known as yin and yang whole grains and whole grain products such as brown rice and buckwheat pasta soba , a variety of cooked and raw vegetables , beans and bean products , mild natural seasonings , fish , nuts and seeds , mild non stimulating beverages such as bancha twig tea and fruit are recommended nightshade vegetables , including tomatoes , peppers , potatoes , eggplant also spinach , beets and avocados are not recommended , or used sparingly at most , in macrobiotic cooking , as they are considered extremely yin back to the point , on our way to georgia our new home i saw a billboard for steak n shake when i lived in georgia in the 's , i would eat at a steak n shake once or twice a week they made great hamburgers and wonderful shakes well , the billboard said that if i took the next exit , there would be one right around the corner something i am not certain what took control of the steering wheel i soon found myself stopped at the drive thru speaker and ordering a double steak burger with everything and a large chocolate shake with every bite , memories of my younger years flooded through me i felt like i was in heaven but i also was feeling a little guilty well , ever since i crossed over to the dark side , i have enjoyed my red meat and shakes i justify it by telling myself that i need the protein i still enjoy chicken and fish probably prefer fish to anything else , but something keeps on taking control of my body when i approach a steak n shake or hardies because i constantly complain in a kidding manner to neighbors and friends that i am starving , they break down and bring me leftovers the ones with meat in it my wife has become accustomed to my ranting and just ignores me when i get on one of these kicks well , i found out that yesterday , when she was with three other friends on a shopping trip in the mountains that they tried to give her gas money she refused the money , however , and commented that if they really wanted to do something for her , they could bring me their leftovers the ones prepared with meat victory ! score one for the home team !
