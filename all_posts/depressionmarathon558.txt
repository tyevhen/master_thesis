i had an interesting day it was a busy day and a good day it started with a meeting with my therapist i talked about i 've been writing about lately , my mistrust of the future , financial stress , and worry about work as usual , my therapist calmed my fears and supported me after that meeting , i had the wonderful opportunity to speak about my journey with depression to a class of health and human services students a friend of mine is the instructor , and i 've spoken for her several times after telling my story , the students and i had a great discussion i'm grateful to all the students for their interest and thoughtful questions speaking , educating others , is empowering for me , so i left there feeling worn out but good once home , i wanted to take a nap , but i pushed myself out the door for my run instead i was scheduled for a speed workout , by mile , which is exactly what i did i have some tendonitis in my left ankle that really bothered me , but i hit my pace nonetheless this is where my day got really interesting on my way home , literally half a block from my front door , i ran into an intersection full of money ! that 's right , i said money , silver money all over the place ! i spent about minutes in the middle of the intersection , dodging a few cars and a mail truck , picking up ! i figure i should go play the lottery ! since i ran through the intersection on my way out for my run , these coins were all deposited within the minutes in which i was running ironically , it was just two years ago that i picked up over pennies in this same intersection ! weird but i'm not complaining ! i ca n't wait to go running on thursday ! after napping , i ended my day with a stimulating aa meeting now i'm watching the ncaa women 's basketball championship , and then i 'll be off to bed i hope tomorrow is just as good and interesting !
