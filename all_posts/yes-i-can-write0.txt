i think it s fair to say has been a difficult year for a lot of us , both on the world stage and in our personal lives and for me , no matter how much i m struggling with depression , no matter how bleak things are looking , books are a source of comfort , a way to grapple with difficult topics in more removed settings , a strange glimpse of other possibilities and i wanted to share some of my very favorite novels from the past year they re all sci fi or fantasy because that s what i love best , but within those genres they vary wildly , from historical fiction with just a sprinkling of magic , portal fantasy that s just as much literary exploration of identity and abuse , a fast paced murder mystery in space , and a series of linked short stories that act as a damning critique of the way women are too frequently used and discarded in the superhero comic genre i tend to read both young adult and adult fiction without distinguishing much between the two , and i believe this list contains about a split i m not sure how a couple of the titles were marketed i hope you ll find something here to love as much as i did ! six wakes by mur lafferty a murder mystery on a generation starship starring clones with missing memories , this is the definition of a page turner i think i finished it in under two days the pieces come together for you as the reader at the same time as for the protagonists , giving you a genuine chance to solve the mystery , and skilled use of flashbacks serve to propel the plot forward instead of feeling like a frustrating diversion this is very much a plot focused story , and the characters , though some are intriguing , never have all that much depth but all in all , a very enjoyable read dusk or dark or dawn or day by seanan mcguire a beautiful little novella about a ghost who just can t seem to forgive herself for either her own death or that of her sister so she sticks around , takes in very old cats , and works at a suicide crisis call center but when other ghosts suddenly start disappearing , she realizes she needs to help her fellow undead , and in the process learns how to finally forgive herself fast paced , but also wistful , lyrical , and moving a lovely story the world is full of stories , and no matter how much time we spend in it alive or dead there s never time to learn them all they just go by so quickly seanan mcguire , dusk or dark or dawn or day all systems red by martha wells continuing with novellas this year i read quite a few good ones , martha wells new sci fi adventure is definitely worth checking out this is the story of an ai who , unbeknownst to its owners , hacked it s governor program in order to gain independence , a limited freedom which it mostly uses to watch soap operas because robot or not , murderbot as it named itself has some serious social anxiety , and is generally much more concerned with being left alone than with murder but when the small exploratory team on a remote planet that it s assigned to protect start encountering strange problems , and the signals from nearby settlements go dead , murderbot puts itself right in the path of danger for the people it s reluctantly started to actually like funny , sweet , and full of suspense , i can t wait to read more about the surprisingly charming murderbot in future installments of this series winter tide by ruthanna emrys it s been a long time since such a quiet , slow novel pulled me in so easily and completely when i say quiet , i definitely do not mean dull !

on the surface , this is a story about a young woman , jane , grieving the death of her aunt and surrogate parent , who accepts an invitation to a mysterious mansion but things quickly start becoming more surreal , and more strange how different would things be if you made a different choice ? or a different one ? or a different one ? many paths unfold , possibilities both bizarre and terrifying , as jane seeks to better understand herself and her place in the world highly recommended people tell you that what happens to you is a direct result of the choices you make , but that 's not fair half the time , you do n't even realize that the choice you 're about to make is significant kristin cashore , jane , unlimited the refrigerator monologues by catherynne m valente this linked collection of short stories is surreal , furious , and sad there are no happy endings here , as what unites the women protagonists is that they were all either the wives or girlfriends of superheroes or supervillains or superheroes in their own right , and that now they re all dead taking direct aim at the fridging of women in the superhero genre in order to further the stories of men , this combination novella and anthology is disturbing and captivating buried heart by kate elliott this is the only book on the list that s not the first in series or a standalone instead , it completes a series which began with court of fives , about young athlete jes , though in this novel the athletics are in short supply civil war has broken out as various colonizing patron factions vie for the throne , and revolution is brewing as the commoners look to take advantage of the disarray to once more claim control of their own country jes growth through the previous two novels has been a pleasure to watch , but that pales in comparison to this final instalment , where we see her truly come into her own , and finally realize she has to start picking sides and taking stands seeing the surprising roles her whole family play in the rebellion was also one of my favorite parts of this book , and it felt very fitting , because such big themes throughout have been family , loyalty , and doing what s right all in all a very good conclusion to a very good series , and as always , i can t wait to see what kate elliott comes out with next honorable mentions , aka beloved series published previous years that i enjoyed re reading this past year the fall of ile rien series by martha wells , the raven cycle by maggie stiefvater , the spiritwalker trilogy by kate elliott
