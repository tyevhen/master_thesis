i'm having a little dip in my mood i think it has to do with the marathon i just completed i 've experienced this kind of low before , after a marathon , but it 's been a rare occurrence of course , i'm getting anxious about it i'm anxious about the fact i do n't find anything intriguing or interesting anxious about feeling lethargic anxious about feeling easily distracted and stressed anxious about feeling low i'm anxious , and a little scared , that this little slide could lead to an avalanche since returning from the race , i 've gone to work , but i have n't been out of the house much otherwise i skipped a social event last night , but at least i went for a walk instead other than that walk , i have n't done anything active no weight lifting , no running , no swimming and no biking about the only thing i have done a lot of is sleep i'm not so much tired as i am bored and lethargic sleeping is the easiest thing to do it 's not the best , though , and i know that i'm going to try to do something better today i'm planning to go for a nice , slow run this afternoon right now that goal feels far away , but i know i can do it i 'll at least take a walk no matter how difficult it is to get started , i know i 'll feel better after i go i 've got to go it 's beautiful outside if i do n't move , my slide may eventually turn into an avalanche i cannot take that risk this too shall pass like the rough patches during the marathon , i have to remember that they passed this too shall pass
