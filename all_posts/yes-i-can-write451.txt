well , sadly , not much i 've been recuperating , returning to my bad habit of staying up late and getting up late , and keeping my good habit of eating healthy i have not eaten chips a previously big weakness of mine for over a month now , and i 've been cooking a lot of my own food , and eating very little processed crap on saturday i had a marvelous time with my mom buying organic produce first we went to a local market , and get some peppers , greens , and apples there , before heading to a nearby organic farm that we had n't been to in years ! the owner still recognized my mom , since in my families more healthy past she was a regular customer when my sister and i were young , my family had a very healthy diet , but as we got older and busier , we slipped into eating the mainstream crappy processed food way too often then , however , i started being very environmentally aware and very health conscious , so we 're eating healthier again ! my mom spent a while talking to the organic farmer dude , while i talked to his university aged son who works for his dad which was pretty cool and now i'm a happy veggie who has lots of organic veggies to cook with ! on a not so great note , i still have n't fixed things so my cpictures download onto the correct drive , so it 's difficult to post stuff here oh well , an older photo will haveto suffice peace idzie you might also like food love learning to eat how life learning principles helped me montreal not back to school camp linkwithin
