none of the locals could believe it during a spring in which no day had yet topped degrees , maybe not even , some of them said , the story of the day was the temperature it felt close to degrees by the am start at the finish line of grandma 's marathon hours later , the thermometer read the first miles were the worst , hot and humid with sun , a marathoner 's worst nightmare around mile , the course turned toward lake superior , and thankfully the cool breeze was blowing in off the lake unfortunately , i was already toasted despite not wearing my watch , i started too fast in the hot sun by mile i had started taking walk breaks , as i already felt out of gas at mile , i met my mom i told her , if i make it to halfway , i 'll be content to walk it in from there one mile at a time that was my mentality if there was a water stop , i walked through it when there was n't a water stop , i focused ahead to the next mile marker knowing i would walk once i reached it and that 's how it went one mile marker at a time , one water stop at a time the miles between and were the longest i 'd already run long , yet i still had a long way to go i met my mom again at mile sixteen , and though i knew my boston qualifying time was long gone , i also felt a shift the mile markers had started to come more quickly i continued with my run walk routine , but the running was a bit easier i finally had some gas in my tank , and no wonder ! i was eating and drinking everything in sight ! still i was n't really sure i would make it until i hit mile at that point , i knew there was no way i would quit and i did n't quit i ran the second half minutes slower than the first , but i think that was purely a matter of more walk breaks my running segments may have actually been quicker i certainly felt better who knows ? if i had n't toasted myself early , perhaps that bq time would have been close to attainable attained or not , i'm happy with the result what felt , early on , like a hour and minute certainty , ended up a delight i nearly burst into tears when i turned into the finishing chute this is the first marathon i 've trained for and finished since fatigue has been my constant companion and plague as i turned that final corner for home , i knew that at least on this day , i had won and that was a glorious feeling
