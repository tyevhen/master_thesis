marie though i have known the meaning of my first name , cynthia , for a long time , i have not paid as much attention to the meaning of my middle name , marie i wrote about my first name the other day , which got me interested in knowing about the meaning of the rest of my name in my research on internet sites today , to get the meaning of marie , it was interesting that i had to jump around in different language forms of the name this is what i have gathered marie is the french and czech form of maria , the latin form of the new testament greek names mariam and maria which were from the hebrew name miryam mary is the english form of maria the usual meaning given by various sources for the name mary , is the hebrew m r r meaning bitterness other meanings suggested include rebelliousness m r y , or wished for child or beloved lady it was most likely originally an egyptian name , perhaps derived in part from mry beloved or mr love the name was also considered in the middle ages to be connected to the sea and the word mare , as in the term stella maris , or star of the sea , an epithet for the virgin mary from all of this jumping around , i find myself a little confused and a bit conflicted the meanings seem quite different from each other bitterness and rebelliousness are not meanings that i want to apply to me my heart wants to go with wished for child because i want to think that i was and am wanted , or star of the sea because then i would be something steady that people follow to find their way mostly i want the meaning of beloved because i want to be the beloved of others , and i know i am especially the beloved of god marie beloved
