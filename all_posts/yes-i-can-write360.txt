oh , in my last post i said i did n't have anything of my own to say , but that was because i forgot that today was earth day now , i am most certainly not a fan of earth day one day , out of all the year , to think about conservation , and to honor the earth , our one and only home , which just happens to be dying one day ? really ? yeah , that 's going to do a lot of good the only plus i see is that shows , articles , and similar things on environmentalism have been all over the place lately they 're all from a very mainstream perspective , of course , but even mainstream scientists are realizing just how dire our predicament is , and i ca n't help but hope that maybe , just maybe , all this stuff could cause at least a few people to look into things themselves , and perhaps make them decide to do something about it , something a bit more substantial than buying green paper towels i could write more about environmentalism , but it seems i 've already done that in the past , and until i think of something new to add which i'm sure i will in due time , i do n't really want to return to the same subjects i will , however , leave you with links to a couple of my old posts on environmentalism , green anarchy , etc anti civilizationism environmental quotes on the interconnectedness of life the problem with green an elaboration on the problem with green anyway , just thought i 'd add that peace , idzie you might also like more problems with green an interesting excert the interconnectedness of life green anarchy linkwithin
