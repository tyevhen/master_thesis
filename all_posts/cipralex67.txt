if you have just started with cipralex , you might wonder like me when things will really start to kick in , i can tell you that you 'll start feeling a difference after two weeks , at the beginning , lets say first month its more like on and off and sometimes it can be kind of annoying , you might even ask yourself does this thing work at all ? does it worth all the side effects ? ! the answer to both is yes , but it will take at least a month or two until you 'll notice things change , but do n't expect to just wake up in the morning and be someone else , that wont happen what will happen is more gradual thing , slowly you 'll notice that things that caused panic attacks and anxiety or depression before will bother you less and less i do recommend you keep a diary and write down the changes and the things that stays the same , this is what i do and it sure helps me to keep track of everything that 's going on , and do n't mess with the pills schedule or amounts , just keep with your plan best of luck , and never give up , remember you can and you will over come this and its very brave of you to actually do something about the thing that bothers you do i congratulate you on that , job well done take care and feel free to comment and ask questions or just share your experiences email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
