my friend , renee , in her continuing quest to domesticate me , invited me to make bread and jam with her yesterday renee enjoys cooking , baking , and eating i enjoy only one of those three , and it is n't either of the first two ! nevertheless , i took her up on the offer , as i figured eating may be involved ! that 's me , using all of my girl scout skills , measuring flour and mixing dough renee had to teach me how to knead the dough , which i confess may come in handy the next time my depression has me frustrated that dough would be no match for a disgruntled etta ! while the dough rose , we made blueberry jam it was another foray into domestication i never thought i 'd take it turns out making jam is not nearly as difficult as i imagined , although one does need the correct tools stirring boiling blueberries even i could do that ! pouring boiled blueberries into jars hmmm , really not so tough look at those delicate hands work ! after about three hours , renee let me take home this beautiful loaf of bread and jars of blueberry jam ummmm , ummm good ! thanks , renee !
