the years of to could have been the worst four years of my life my health was literally disintegrating before my eyes although i had been gradually going deaf since my late teens , in , my thirty eighth year , i lost all hearing in my left ear this crippled me i had to leave the church band , could not engage in social dialogue , stopped listening to music one of my greatest pastimes , could not hear the television , and almost drove my family crazy asking them to constantly repeat themselves otosclerosis , an inherited disease that causes the calcification of the bones of the middle ear , was the cause of this ailment yet of equal concern to me was the accompanying tinnitus although both ears suffered from it , my deaf ear produced a cacophony of continuous , deafening sounds , including roaring , thundering , grating , and an extremely deep humming that was extremely unsettling not long before losing my hearing in one ear , i was diagnosed as suffering from complex partial epilepsy , confirmed by undergoing mri and eeg scans prior to this , i had never heard of this condition , thinking the partial seizures to be a symptom of depression at this time i ceased taking anti depressants and took anti seizure medication , which had and still has quite horrid side effects i lost interest in almost all of my hobbies , entered a continual state of exhaustion , and both short term and long term memory deteriorated significantly during these years a recurring injury received from my childhood worsened to the point that i was frequently afflicted by agonising , throbbing pain for ten hours a day , for up to three months at a time an operation in healed this injury it was a sunday morning in november , when i had come down with the flu for the sixth time in a row , which may have had something to do with burning the candle at both ends recently that i reached a crossroads with the deafness , epilepsy , injury and apparent inability to return to any semblance of health , i felt the crushing weight of despair threatening to descend upon me this was the last straw i had a choice my life appeared to be in a state of utter disarray i could succumb to despair and slip into the miry pit of depression , or i could turn to jesus and rely upon his strength in my weakness , as he said to paul in cor , my grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness i chose the second option while i drove down canterbury road that november summer morning , i waited upon jesus and recalled something i had heard in a sermon my life was like riding in a bus , and the bus driver was jesus i was comforted by the fact that the bus driver always knew the destination and how to get there this was my situation in a nutshell although my life appeared to be a complete mess and out of control , this was not the truth the truth was that jesus was in control of my life i had nothing to fear jesus said in john , my sheep listen to my voice i know them , and they follow me i give them eternal life , and they shall never perish no one can snatch them out of my hand so rather than let these burdensome troubles drive me to depression , i surrendered them to jesus and placed my trust in him the pressures faded away and hope , joy , and peace prevailed may i ask you , the reader , a question here ? considering the breadth of my troubles at this time , does it seem too easy ? i know the bible says in james to consider it pure joy , my brothers , whenever you face trials of many kinds , but trust me , although i reach this place eventually , this is not my initial reaction to trials ! perhaps you are wondering why it did not take me days , weeks or months to learn to cope with these trials how could i , after going through so much , seem to shrug off their debilitating affects and yet live a normal life ? the only reason these afflictions did not drag me headlong into depression s merciless grip was because i had already been down that road , back in it began with an eight month period of living hell which included an endless cycle of debilitating anxiety attacks , chronic insomnia , crippling feelings of guilt , low self esteem , utter despair at what was happening to me , and much more as the days turned to weeks and then to months , i was crippled by the fear that this thing that had overcome me would never lessen or end here is an extract from my diary dated february th , at this time , i had no idea what was wrong with me oh lord , when will this end ? day after day , i remain trapped in this endless personal hell of pain and confusion i want to get out of myself ! to be someone else , anyone but me the me i know is gone , yet somehow i am still me i must escape from myself , but i'm trapped in a suffocatingly small , dark room i know there is sunlight outside i run , push , and strive to reach that light , but the room comes with me i cannot get out ! why ? because i am the room jesus , for what reason have you allowed this ? where are you ? how long will you remain silent ? they say that others who have been down this route have left signposts along the way to help those like me find the way out but where are these signposts ? by his grace and provision , jesus helped me overcome depression and live a normal life again and in learning how to cope with depression , jesus set me free so that i need never again succumb to its depths galatians it is for freedom that christ has set us free stand firm , then , and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery in conclusion , it was because of what i learnt during my trials of the early s , that i was able to endure the trials of to and through christ , overcome them the purpose of this blog is to encourage all myself included ! undergoing trials and tribulations to establish jesus christ as the cornerstone , or foundation upon which to build our lives , and through his strength , endure and overcome those trials in order to live life to the full john jesus says , i have come that they may have life , and have it to the full download a pdf booklet of this blog 's articles all verses from niv
