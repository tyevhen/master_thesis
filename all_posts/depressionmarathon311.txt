the fatigue i wrote of in my last post began to make sense when i awoke with the inkling of a sore throat yesterday i was scheduled to run miles with my friend , therese , and i felt well enough so we did go in fact , after running miles , i actually felt better my throat was no longer sore i was hopeful it was all going to blow over unfortunately , today i awoke in a heap of hurt my throat was sore again my body was tired , and i could hardly keep my eyes open i ended up cancelling an appointment and going back to bed i slept , and slept , and slept i finally got up around noon , and now i feel better again i think i may have just a bit of a virus trying to take hold , but so far i seem to be fighting it i went to an interview this afternoon it looks like i'm going to be picking up some regular , on call hours with another company soon i may begin as early as this week i'm not thrilled about having to drive minutes to get to the facility , but i am excited to get back to something resembling a regular schedule at least that 's what they 're promising we 'll see how it goes my mood continues to be good i'm feeling well i do n't want to get sick , because that sometimes causes my mood to drop i 'll keep piling on the vitamin c , resting , and doing what i can to fight this potential virus off but for now , i'm feeling good , and i'm stable , and my running is going well , and i'm getting back to work , and i have a lot for which to be grateful things are going well i'm happy about that
