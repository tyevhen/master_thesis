short post today , as my mood has taken a dive things are very dark today my energy is low my thoughts are negative and slow it 's difficult to move it 's been a long day i'm counting on this being a temporary crash i have to believe that i ca n't fathom going back to where i 've recently been i will not despite my hopelessness , lethargy , and fatigue , i 've been trying to move it took two attempts , but i did get a short run in today and i'm right now preparing to go to an aa meeting , despite the fact that being around people may be downright painful i ca n't go backwards there is just too much to lose i pray my efforts will pay off and my mood will bounce back soon
