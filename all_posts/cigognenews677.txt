there is an experiment where a subject in pain was given suggestions that he was no longer in pain , and he was n't but when given naloxone , which chemically undoes repression , the pain returned there is no mind over matter it is more likely matter over mind it all makes sense since there is the factor of resonance i have been discussing in all my work that thoughts resonate down to lower physiologic levels and set off commensurate biologic processes that quell the pain that the person is suffering from to think otherwise is to imagine that thoughts exist in space with no physiologic counterparts , not the facts is n't it incredible that we have pain and pain sets up the very thoughts that then trigger off pain killers in our brain ? then we can think different thoughts oh boy ! this therapy works don t forget , resonance is a two way street if only the cognitive insight therapists understood that and stopped treating thoughts as viable , discrete independent entities that can be changed willy nilly thoughts and beliefs are the final station of a process that can begin deep in the brain , very remote in history personal and ancient , wending its way upward and forward until feelings meet with their counterpart in a way , then , we do every day what we do in sleep we revisit our ancient phylogenetic past and also our ontogenetic past and then move forward in time to the present we are clearly evolutionary creatures creatures of needs , especially those that were not fulfilled in our therapy when we have a very disturbed patient we may use tranquilizers for a time to block the deepest aspect of an imprint , thereby allowing the person to focus on the present and perhaps childhood the medicine is not in lieu of therapy it is to treat memory , a memory that cannot remain in its proper setting in storage when a person s defenses are weak due to compounded lack of love throughout childhood , the past inserts itself prematurely into the present there we find serious mental illness that past can warp how we think and perceive , not because we have adopted unwholesome ideas , but because those thoughts are the result of a lifetime of experience so it isn t that two people just politely disagree it is that two people see the world in very different terms and they are very different individuals so how do we block the pain ? in many ways we block the thoughts about it , we block the feelings and also the force of it we drug different aspects of brain function when i took an mri i taught the technician to bang on my feet at irregular intervals so that i could not organize a coherent thought about my fear anxiety it worked i was so focused on anticipating the bang that i could not concentrate on fear the fear was still there only it never became a coherent force let me put this together again there is a resonance factor where all aspects of a memory are involved i assume that it may be due to the same frequency oscillations , and perhaps not aside from that assumption the resonance is absolute having seen it several thousand times in many hundreds of patient over many decades we see it in veteran patients who have deep access when a patient comes in complaining that he is not getting anywhere in therapy and she wants to quit we only discuss this cursorily , helping her into feelings where she feels so stuck in her early home life , and then perhaps months later , she begins a birth sequence where we can see that she is indeed stuck and not getting anywhere we see her writhing and squirming and grunting never expressing verbally that she cannot make it out into life it has a powerful valence as we dip into her history the tail of the feeling grapples with an earlier counterpart to the feeling and then she relives being stuck , over and over again it was a life and death feeling that she gets born and breathes it is again life and death when she has a problem in her life because the force of that memory rises radically to disturb her functioning something in the present resonates with her history , and then she becomes a prisoner of that history a prisoner of pain
