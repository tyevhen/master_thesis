i know the columns to the right of this post are messed up and do n't show until the very bottom , but this is a result of my attempt to put the book and a new picture at the top i'm so ham handed at amateur webmastering , i'm in a pickle with pixels some folks have ordered books already , thanks was n't the inauguration speech grand ? reagan played himself , which is why obama is more convincing he is himself a first generation african american raised by a white mother in kansas no wonder jesse jackson felt cheated obama was n't one of the real bros i wrote an inauguration haiku that caused a bit of a furor at a poetry board , though i thought it was crystal clear listen , slaves there 's a black man in the white house and he is your servant now i feel as if i have to explain it slaves all those americans with the whisper of slavery still in their blood the man in the white house is , of course , the president and whereas blacks were only in the white house as servants heretofore , now the occupant is a servant in the highest sense someone accused me of racism based on this poem , another said i was unqualified to write it some people ! although i have little energy to blog tonight , i have been seeing a ufo nightly i think it might be space junk orbiting lower and lower as it sinks into the sea , it becomes a glowing white disk that casts a silver reflection on the ocean while also pulsing red and green the local stations and coast guard know nothing about it if i did n't have two other witnesses i might question my eyes here 's another poem from the new book , one of my favorites in your hands the desert two lane flashes its white segments so quickly you forget the asphalt discontinuities and think the dashes connected toward some future rendezvous where night and morning join in a secret sunrise of stars that explains all the causalities that propelled you here but your eyes are sucked back to this moment , furious and finite as a fly seizuring against a screen the yellow smears on your windshield are souls you ve hurt without knowing the whistle through the window is your suspicion of yourself the radio plays country because you really are that simple when it s time to pull over you are no closer to but no farther from your goal in a waking sleep you imagine topiaries of exhaust in the shapes of visionaries jesus , blake , jules verne were they as rooted to the moment ? or did they veer off into the underbrush ? the wheel is in your hands published in eclectica i'm furiously networking to promote the book , a whole new learning experience by the end of it i should be an expert on what not to do one tip do n't expect your facebook friends to be helpful here 's a wonderful link to a video about how facebook friends would look in the real world facebook in reality it 's a hoot ! the editor of the re vamped pif called me tonight , a swell guy named derek alger he 'll be doing a panel on the short story at the awp conference in chicago not much more to say but congratulations , america ! let 's hope our support for obama does not waver in this time of tough decisions and uncertain futures i think it 's in to be patriotic again many will remind me that it never went out , but i beg to disagree i lived in mexico for three years while bush was president , and let me tell you , it was downright embarrassing over and out , ce
