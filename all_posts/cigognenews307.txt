so where is the mind ? is it identical with the brain ? there are some writers in neuroscience who inadvertently believe they are identical the brain secretes the mind others think the mind is separate and acts on the brain this debate has gone on for the millennia it is rather important since there is new research that claims that the reason there is depression or anxiety is because of changes in dopamine or serotonin in short , it is all in the brain and these afflictions result from alterations in chemical production in the brain that is why they will never find the answer because it is not in the brain it is in the mind it is how the mind affects the brain where the answer lies there is a book on the subject that seems to go off into mysticism but is worth reading brain wars , by m beauregard harper one press he believes that the mind affects the brain and that they are not identical , yet , unless i missed something , there is not a good definition of what the mind is i think he equates it with the neo cortical mind so for him the mind is thoughts and beliefs for me it is much more than that there are several minds , each interacting with the others and consciousness means that all levels work fluidly with each other you need the contribution of each level to make consciousness the distinctions about brain and mind are important when neglected they lead to some strange conclusions in psychology if we think there is no mind then all we have to do is study neurology to find answers to many neuroses no unconscious running things all we see is behavior and if we change how we act and think our attitudes then we can get well neurosis here is all a matter of unhealthy attitudes change the attitude and , voila , we get better this problem lies under the rubric of reductionism everything is reduced to the basic brain function there are no different levels of reality only one , the apparent , observable one so they keep it simple , too simple yet it is often equated with true science putting the facts together no leap beyond the facts , no imagination , no thoughts of what could be science for them is confined of what is observed since there is no mind in their scheme there can be no interaction between mind and brain and when i use the term mind i mean all levels of consciousness so either we are strictly neurologic machines or there is something else going on that helps us understand who we are and why we act the way we do i opt for something else going on you see when science is so strictly confined to facts we can only produce correlations things goes up when that goes up therefore there is not a lot of room for a deeper analysis , a flight of imagination , soaring into what could be it becomes statistics bound it can be counted while feelings often cannot this close adherence to facts has in some ways bound psychology and constricted what it could discover it could not find the truth beyond facts scientific reductionism is the b te noir of psychology so we have mind which is produced by the brain but seems to have its own existence that can affect that brain the interaction between the two is the appreciation of beauty , the smell of the rose identical with the brain ? is the judgment of someone who is interesting identical with the brain ? or does the ensemble of brain function give rise to all this ? and once it gives rise can it affect the brain that gave life to it ? if you take hypnosis it is clear that thoughts introduced to lower brain levels can affect the brain so that a hand put in cold water seems hot or that a coin put on the hand and told it is very hot can leave burn marks another bit of evidence the placebo effect , giving neutral , benign pills to those who are told in their minds that it will kill pain and it does and the thoughts use the same pathways in the brain that the pills would use thoughts affect brain function if we think something might help , even god , then it can help the mind can be deceived can the brain be deceived ? what happens is that what is in the mind can activate the brain to produce natural painkillers it can think it is in pain and change brain function to deal with that imagination and there may not be any pain at all except what the mind has been convinced exists also , a dentist may drill teeth because the person has been suggested that she will feel no pain and she does not so where is the reality ? in the drill ? in the mind ? does it hurt if the person cannot feel it ? no the mind takes precedence as it does in so many situations where people believe what they are told rather than what they see before them at a burial one can see the body float to heaven even after watching it go into the ground does reality take precedence ? i think not is the mind deceived or is it the brain ? it is the mind that believes something so strongly that the brain registers the belief rather than the reality pet scans show that infusing a belief into someone that their pain is being reduced will show increased activity in regions known to block pain the mind here controls the brain can the brain control the mind ? yes those with sham knee surgery could walk more easily later on even though they had incisions but no surgery their minds controlled it all the evidence is overwhelming it is also true that the brain controls the mind if we are low in dopamine we will have certain personality traits controlled by brain function but the mind can cause an increase in dopamine output if it is convinced to do it thus , they are mutually interacting entities the brain can interact with the mind , just as the mind can interact with the brain expectations of the mind can activate nerve networks to enhance dopamine production how could we ignore the mind and explain the human condition ? one of the interesting findings reported in the book is that attention deficit children have a high amount of theta waves in the frontal lobe why is that ? my guess is that there is first line intrusion , long slow theta waves from the brainstem are suddenly found in the frontal area and that it is this intrusion that distracts and keeps the child from concentrating there is an input from imprints going back very far into the remote reaches of the brain that surge into present day life the problem here is that it can lead to , change the mind you can change the brain , philosophy which then slops over into cognitive therapy so what mind are we dealing with ? it is clear to me that it is the lower levels of consciousness that directly affect the brain we see this in therapy when patients get down into first line their ideas change radically they are trying to strangle me deep hypnosis that allows a body to go rigid and not feel the pain of surgery must affect the brainstem i have seen hypnosis where the body is so rigid it can be placed like a pipe between two chairs and kept there with no fatigue what beauregard points out is that in a quantum universe there is no mind body split it is one the mental and physical world merge but that , how and where we observe , can change the object we are observing he points out that in neurofeedback one can control seizures by mimicking certain brainwave patterns we have to believe that mental activity is not identical to brain activity there is a mind that seems to rise above brain function to interact with it i do not think that we can equate mind with awareness because mind is so all encompassing and in all its complexity affects the brain that is why deep childhood and womb life pain can , in my opinion , affect brain function decades later producing alzheimers disease we will never see that in studying the brain alone , but we will see it when we study the humans that carry that brain
