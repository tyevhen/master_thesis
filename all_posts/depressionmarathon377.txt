i'm still in the hospital i had my fifth ect treatment today i'm planning to have one more treatment on friday and then head home my parents are now in town , on their way south for the winter , so i 'd like to spend some time with them right now they are at my house taking care of jet for me i think my mood has improved slightly , not as much as i 'd like , but i think it is slightly better i worry that ect will eventually lose its effectiveness i mean how many times can you go to the well ? i have nothing on which to base that fear it 's just fear , and i hope i am wrong perhaps i should instead focus on the fact that it appears to be working once again i'm grateful for that i do n't have much more to report not much happens in the hospital i should be continuing my training for new york city , which is now weeks away , but i 've yet to get on one of the available treadmills i 'll try to make up for it by running long this weekend i'm just going to run new york for the experience , anyway it wo n't be about racing on that day that 's all i 've got i so appreciate all of the comments i 've received from you , my readers , on my last few posts thank you so much know that your comments do make a difference i am one lucky woman here 's hoping things continue to move forward and upward
