from today 's new york times patterns making patients happy does n't make them well eric nagourney writes , researchers reported yesterday that when it came to medical treatment , the satisfaction expressed by a group of elderly patients had little correlation with the quality of care they had received based on a review of their medical records we all know the type the guy who works a million hours , puts in overtime , sleeps in his office on weekends , yet still seems to be always drowning and while yes , he does work a million hours , all anyone really notices is that he 's consistantly late in the mornings , or takes a few too many days off for perpetual emergencies we also know the other guy , the one who is calm , unrushed , in at , out by , and somehow creates an image that keeps you from asking if all his work is really done , we just assume he 's efficient and no one opens his drawers a lot of life and a lot of doctoring is about perception here 's a story years ago , an acquaintance had an awful accident with a severe vertebral injury resulting in paralysis at the scene he was transported to a local hospital where a scan showed bone fragments in the spinal canal the patient was then brought by helicopter to a major academic center where a renowned spinal surgeon the only one in a multi state region deemed capable operated it was a long recovery period , but the patient was able to return to work within a few months , and was eventually able to resume skiing by anyone 's measure , his recovery was remarkable the family , however , walked away with nothing but venom for the surgeon apparently he was callous with a cavalier bedside manner to hear their tales , i had to wonder if , in their minds though not in the patient 's ambulating legs ! all the good he had done was n't erased , or at least discredited , because of some intangible personality flaw or insensitive word the first time i see a new patient , i ask a lot of questions i start by asking for permission to take notes just for the first session , i know it 's a little disconcerting to talk to someone who is writing , but it 's helpful to me and i end the minutes of interview with a single final question do you have any questions for me ? i ask i end this way so the patient wo n't walk feeling rattled by what might amount to an interrogation does it work , does it create a sense that i am approachable , that our efforts need to be teamwork , that perhaps i have some answers ? i 've no clue most people come back but it leaves me with the perception that i tried !
