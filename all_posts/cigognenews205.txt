our lower brain and brainstem were designed originally for immediate , rapid reaction it is survival and supreme defense as the brain developed and added on higher levels of function , all the way to the top neo cortex , we got help in sussing out danger and responding to it our mechanisms became more elaborate and arcane on the way , what happened down deep in the brain became more indecipherable so we no longer knew what was bothering us thus , deep imprinted terror on the level of the brainstem sent its message up high and suddenly it became transformed into anxiety then we began treating anxiety as some mysterious affliction , never understanding what it is and where it came from we did not know because we had never taken patients down to the brainstem level , and therefore had no idea what lies down there so we guessed and developed fancy theories about it , which had to be wrong because it remained a mystery but there were and are clues so let s see , what is one clue ? first line dangers which awaken primitive terror mean that menace is close , danger is approaching and we must react the closer that danger the more our primitive terror reactions but , but as our brain evolved we became alienated from the real danger , our deep imprints , and sent the message on high to the neocortex and what does the cortex do ? it gets all wound up ready for action but what kind of action ? no one knows but it remains on the qui vive the cortex churns away in a constant frenzy and how do we treat it ? we give medication that works where ? on those lower levels where terror is organized and what does that do ? it stops the frenzy and we just thought it was a cerebral frantic state that we had to deal with we offer , don t pay attention put your mind elsewhere try mediation , etc etc , ad nauseam what do we do ? we follow orders we learn how to relax , as if that were possible when the lower brain is in a flurry of activity we do anything to deny and divert attention from the real problem traumatic memory that required frenzy and being battle ready the system helps out because our biochemistry works on the gating system and tries to keep it closed so that we never find out what the source is and the devilish part is that now we must wend our way down to that source through the various levels of the brain , slowly , methodically so as not to overwhelm things there is no way to get down there immediately those who did so , using lsd paid the price too often of psychosis , as the brainstem threw up its hidden cave of primal demons and overwhelmed the neo cortex , preventing it from functioning properly it manufactures bizarre ideas , delusions , to cope with the upsurge of imprints we treated the delusions , some therapists , tried to meet those delusions and tried to change the patient s ideas by that method always ignoring origins , the key to cure and those origins were and are behind so much of sleep problems and nightmares we cannot fall asleep cause our brains are ruminating on this or that , and we cannot get off it we cannot stop the input from below from our primevil beginnings and we have nightmares because in our brains the danger is immediate and life threatening , which it is , and we need be alert to protect ourselves we need to be aware to watch out for the danger we become hyper aware in order to block unconscious imprints aware to defeat the unconscious that is why those who become intellectuals have fled to their heads and never feel the danger that activates them can we treat psychosis ? sometimes , but the damage is done and the patient too often needs to remain in a controlled environment we don t have that the same is true of marijuana , although i am told the new marijuana is safe i do not know enough about it to agree or disagree , but the long time pot smokers i have seen over the years behave like those who took lsd both drugs chip away at the gating system , weaken it and thus prematurely allow deep imprints to mount and disrupt everything and what is the last line of defense against the mounting danger ? delusions we call upon the last developing part of the brain to whip into action to manufacture a defense let s be clear as the terror from down deep nudges the higher levels into action the whole system responds to danger and what is the danger ? feelings you mean feelings , our own feelings are a danger ? let me explain the imprints from the first weeks of gestation are monumental they are psychosis producing now as they mount to the thinking , ideational cortex , but back then when they militated into childhood psychosis a mother taking drugs , smoking and drinking from the start the more of these gating weakening drugs we take the more the deep levels bump into the higher ones the danger becomes immediate hence an anxiety attack we cannot relax in the face of danger , and we should not , as then we will be in terrible danger the weaker the gates the closer the danger and the higher the terror anxiety level so we have two choices we can strengthen the gates by offering ssri s prozac , the same brain chemical that was depleted in the original combat during gestation and birth in short , boosting the gates again to block feelings and pain or we can do what makes more sense help open the gates in a safe way so that the primal forces finally have egress , and finally we can heal and relax let me be clear there is new research that indicates that the key repressive painkilling chemical mechanism in most ssri s is serotonin this was recruited to help in the battle early on in the womb and now when we run out we get more from outside those precious pills the research states the defective serotonin interacts with stress during the fetal stages which increases basic long term risk see http www sciencedaily com releases htm they reported that a certain receptor for serotonin was examined to see what it did in the formation of brain circuits , and in particular , those cells that regulate excitement it helps dampen too much input and neuronal action in other words , it helps reduce potential cerebral hyperactivity this keeps serotonin on track , helping to find its place in the developing cortex where it can function best it seems to have a role in the correct assembly of neuron tracks when serotonin receptors are impaired the whole gating system is affected trauma certainly damages the serotonin system pregnant women who take drugs can damage or modify serotonin neurons all to say that very early on we begin to weaken that most crucial gating system and there is no going back the damage remains and later on we find those with add and severe anxiety states we never know why wait a minute ! yes we do we need to get it right about evolution because visceral reactions , come from the viscera which are organized at the beginnings of our lives , down deep in the brain so clearly , we are anxious long before we are aware of it or can give it a name and when we do we give it the wrong name anxiety instead of deeply embedded terror worse , then we try to treat this anxiety without knowing where it comes from or what it really is still worse , the ideas about it , our name for it , came along millions of years after it started its life to reiterate the same traumas that severely damage the fetus and his brain are the very same that mount with the use of pot and lsd to again produce severe reactions most often psychosis and delusions they are not different causes just because they are produced at different times they are the same with disastrous reactions at different stages of our evolution they are crazy making
