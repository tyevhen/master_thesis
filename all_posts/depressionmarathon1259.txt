last week i posed a simple question , do you refer to yourself as depressed ? while a few people answered the question , the actual topic discussion continues through today on my site as well as others i attempted to explain my reasons behind the question in the following two posts this is one of my soap box issues see here if you 'd like a hint at one of my other sudsy talking , er shouting points that is , depressed is a feeling depression is an illness for this reason , i never refer to myself as depressed depression is an illness that screws up my brain , but it does not preclude happiness in other words , i do n't have to be depressed feeling to experience depression illness i can experience happiness and still have depression , just as my neighbor can experience increased energy due to improved blood counts and still have cancer cancer is a broad category of illness there are certain shared characteristics which define an illness as cancer , but it is unlikely that any two cancers are exactly the same in symptomotology or in patient experience so , too , it is with depression depression is a broad category of illness there is commonality between each of us , but we are not all afflicted with identical symptoms , and our individual experiences may widely vary that got me thinking perhaps it is time to define depression the illness according to the dsm iv , there are separate diagnosis codes i e diagnoses for depression , from depression nos not otherwise specified up to major depressive disorder , severe , recurrent with psychotic features to qualify for the depression label a person must either have a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a week period the mood change cannot be caused by chemical abuse i e alcohol or a medical condition and the person 's functioning must be impaired as a direct result of the change in their mood in addition , there are nine specific criteria an md will look at when diagnosing unipolar depression i learned a patient will receive the diagnosis of major depression if of those criteria are met sources on the web simply state a majority of the criteria must fit psychcentral has a nice summary of depression here , and allpsych online succinctly describes depression here but then again , you can find those technical descriptions just about everywhere ! i think we learn more from listening to each other i invite you all to share your personal depression definitions here leave them as comments , and maybe , with permission , i will post some of them , too as we get more and more descriptions , we may see how variable this singularly defined experience depression depressed actually is i 'll include my experience tomorrow
