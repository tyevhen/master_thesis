it 's been a long couple of days around here lots of reminiscing and grieving going on paul 's wake was thursday night and his funeral yesterday running has been far from my mind i have n't had the energy , which is why it was really important for me to get out on the road this morning after hitting the snooze button for an hour , i finally got out of bed and made it to our track club 's group long run my legs , i do n't think , are fully recovered yet from last week 's marathon i ended up running alone most of the way this morning , but it was still helpful to run with the group despite my tired legs , i made it miles a bunch of us went out for breakfast , and then i ran two more miles with puck once i got home miles total i'm pretty happy with that it was n't easy it 's nice being out with the group again i still have to push myself to go to things like meals after funerals or breakfast with a crowd , but i'm doing those things despite my isolation tendencies i know , in my brain , isolation is n't good for me , but it is so damn much easier ! i'm hoping pushing myself will eventually make being more social easier but i'm dubious i'm getting used to being back in the world again being social , going to group events , running all of these things make me realize , again , how much depression takes me out of my world i feel like i 've been gone for months , and in a way , i guess i have it 's weird i'm trying not to get overwhelmed with simple daily life i'm waiting for the moment when i no longer feel like a stranger in a strange land it 's a process , i guess and i'm grateful to be moving through the process rather then being stuck in the muck the muck sucks
