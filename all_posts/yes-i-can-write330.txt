just wanted to share a snapshot of life tonight we came home from a visit to my grandmother 's house at am , to find that flora , who 's an old and now sick doggy i have n't gone into that on this blog i'm not sure why in short , she has a brain tumor , and is on meds that are helping for the moment that 's been a big stress lately , had pooped and peed all over the floor not fun to clean up now , however , that the cleanup is done , i find myself rather amused by our late night activities inspired by iron chef , a show we stayed late at my grandma 's house to finish watching , my sister , who is so not a cook , is making a cheese sauce from scratch , with no exact recipe , just a bit of help from my mom ! emi even seasoned it with herbs from the garden actually , just a few minutes ago , i was interrupted in my writing of this post , and asked if i could go get her some more rosemary and thyme ! so out i tromped into the wet grass , flip flops on my feet , my toes quickly freezing , not quite bright enough light attached to my head , to search through the plants in the garden to find the right types of herb she 's now cooking broccoli to dip in it also , since my father is out of town for a couple of days , the classic rock station is cranked up , despite the fact that it 's am ! ah , unschooling oh , and this is my current facebook status a moth just landed on my hand , poked at my skin with it 's mouth , antennae twitching curiously , tilted it 's head , seemed to clean it 's leg , then fluttered off all of this happened in about five seconds a creature both utterly beautiful and utterly strange and for a few seconds of my life , i was completely engrossed in it 's delicate world here 's to the small moments in life , the interesting things that happen late at night , and finding happiness in even the rockiest parts of life peace , idzie you might also like flora loved and missed so , so much christmas ' pasta and emi 's new blog new poetry and the miracle of my sister cooking gasps linkwithin
