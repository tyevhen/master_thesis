there are some late findings that contrary to the notion that muscular dystrophy and other so called genetic diseases are direct descendants from heredity , it may be that they are not that is , nearly all of us have the mutated md gene in our systems what seems to make it manifest in us is what happens in the womb and at birth epigenetics i am of the belief that nearly all of us are pretty normal and that it is adversity that changes us and deforms us in the case of md we all seem to have the capacity to be abnormal depending on experience i think that may be true of many of the so called genetic diseases from allergies to migraine and high blood pressure and the bad experience happens so early , in the first three months of our lives in the womb , that we cannot distinguish it from pure genetics that is why it is so critical that we understand how gestational life can effect us for the rest of our lives whether the carrying mother is anxious , depressed , takes drugs or drinks alcohol whether she sips cokes or drinks many cups of coffee , the baby s life is being malleated during this period and it will run the rest of our lives in a major way whether we suffer multiple sclerosis , migraines or high blood pressure whether we will have constant seizures or whether we have impulsive act outs that makes us behave before we think this is of such magnitude that it must be taught in schools so that we begin to understand both behavioral and medical disease it will help doctors understand some of the causes of the diseases in their patients and it will redirect therapists to periods in our lives that are truly crucial no more the useless focus in the here and now when so much can be explained way back when no more the idea that by changing attitudes we can change emotional disease no more guesswork a bit more science
