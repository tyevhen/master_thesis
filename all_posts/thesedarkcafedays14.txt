days have n't been too dark lately , but they have n't exactly been light either you know how you get your hopes up about something or someone but then your happiness gets tied to that idea or that person ? well , i'm guilty of that i'm sitting in my school hallway and silently crying i'm on crisis text line because i was shaking and i wanted to puke but i have class later so i ca n't go home and i was starting to think about ways to end it all but knowing that i should n't end things over a stupid little thing like this an hour and a half ago , i went through the effort to come to campus extra early so i could try and get a chance to talk to him i should 've just stayed home i do n't know why i keep putting all this effort into these relationships that wo n't work why ca n't i learn that when the other person does n't put any effort in , it 's not worth doing the pursuing ? i should have listened to my mom 's advice that a relationship that 's supposed to work should be easy , should work out well but i was infatuated anyways , i walked in , my heart pounding , going out of my way yet again to try and talk to him , and he was talking to another girl a loud girl asking about another woman asking if she could set him up with this other girl saying she was hot she said something about how he has a crush on so and so it was enough to know he had moved on , if he was ever even interested in me i do n't know why i still tried to talk to him i guess because i had gone through all the effort to go there and i did n't want to feel like i had n't tried the conversation was n't anything special and just in the way he talked to me , i could tell something had changed i got that sense of pity , of him wanting to be polite but not really being super interested in talking to me i know it 's stupid i know it 's small but it 's the cumulative effect of over and over having the same story play out girl meets guy girl observes guy from afar and slowly grows to admire him girl imagines them together and develops embarrassingly strong feelings for him , but they do n't interact much girl tries to overcome her shyness and talk to the guy , but they have little more than occasional conversations but her friends all say they would be so cute together so she keeps hoping guy never shows interest or straight up chooses someone else girl feels like a piece of shit nobody once and hates herself for not being outgoing and bubbly and sexy and normal that 's happened so many times , i 've lost count so now that it 's happened again , can you blame me for feeling a little worthless ? more than anything though , i feel stupid i feel mad at myself for falling into the same trap , telling myself the same lies , devaluing myself again by chasing after someone who does n't make an effort to do the same for me in the mental health world , people talk a lot about triggers usually they think that reading about something traumatic you 've gone through will trigger you to have upsetting thoughts or other negative emotions i have n't found that to be true for me , personally i 've found my biggest trigger is experiencing rejection i got a lot of rejections in the past literal ones like , we do n't want you in our club and more indirect ones like , i told another friend my big news before you , or i 'd rather date this bitchy girl than you sometimes people do n't come right out and reject you , but they get the idea across pretty well regardless by just ignoring you or not answering your messages any more or whatever when i was going through my hellish depression , i was also experiencing rejection rejection on a larger scale of realizing that i was never really accepted into the school i had been attending for three years they just tolerated my existence , but i was never really part of their community or one of them rejection in the sense that friends were showing that they did n't really care about me enough to be there for me when i needed it most but most of all , rejection from a guy who i really cared about he seemed interested at first he came to see me play a concert , we had nice conversations , he checked in to see if i was okay a few times when i was depressed in turn , i tried to talk to him , get to know him , learn about the things he was interested in , support his music , send him encouraging notes but ultimately i felt him slowly drift away and found out halfway through the year that he had decided to date a particularly unpleasant , jealous girl that was all happening as my mind and my life and my happiness was rapidly unraveling it was n't the cause of the destruction , but it sure added insult to the injury it multiplied the pain infinitesimally i turned to self injury to try and deal with the pain so deep and intense i could n't communicate it or even figure out how to endure it people do n't understand unless they 've been there so when i experience rejection again , in whatever form it comes , i fall apart i unravel it 's my trigger i ca n't even help the emotions they 're just a reaction i ca n't control friends judge me , wondering why i have such a strong reaction to something so small as a conversation that did n't go well , and i can never get them to understand it 's because of my past the crisis text counselor sounded more like a robot they fed me the lines i 've heard all the lines this month is my three year anniversary in counseling i know all the right answers , but i ca n't just give them to you right now because i'm hurting i know you want me to just pull it all back together so you can do n't have to feel uncomfortable , but i'm hurting right now and i just need you to let me hurt and be on my side , in my corner my friend told me i need to grow thicker skin , to be positive , to believe things will work out in the future she told me she had endured actually breaking up from a real relationship but she was okay now i felt disrespected i felt betrayed how dare she compare our experiences to devalue mine and i 've been through loads of shit , even if i 've never been through a breakup i know all the answers i also know my own history i know my heart i know the hurts its seen and the places that never healed quite right so they just burst at any tug at the seams i feel self conscious about how sensitive and emotional i can be , but at the end of the day , i do n't think i want thicker skin because then i 'd be the kind of person who tells a girl crying alone in a school hallway to have a thicker skin i just want you to be okay with me not being okay right now
