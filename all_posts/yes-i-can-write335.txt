i feel like i suddenly have a lot to do , since i 've taken on several new projects i 'll talk more about that in later posts , so i'm sorry if it takes me a while to respond to comments ! the real reason that i'm writing this post , however , is to introduce a new space of mine on the web , where i 'll be posting book reviews and , for once , it wo n't be difficult for me to update it , since all of the material i'm adding is already written ! for two years now , i 've been writing book reviews for the magazine homeschooling horizons the magazine went on a hiatus this year , but it 's coming back this fall , and i 'll most likely be gathering unschooling articles for it as well as writing book reviews ! , but they 've never been posted online so now they will be ! i introduce to you frequently magic i hope you enjoy ! peace , idzie you might also like review of for the sake of our children review of reasons why i'm an unschooler ways to help someone love reading how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! linkwithin
