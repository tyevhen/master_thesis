the slow movement is a way of life that believes faster is not always better the overall perspective is that one can find balance and fulfillment by slowing down the pace of life author carl honore says slow philosophy is not about doing everything at a snail s pace it s about seeking to do everything at the right speed savoring the hours and minutes rather than just counting them doing everything as well as possible , instead of as fast as possible it s about quality over quantity in everything from work to food to parenting you 'll be hearing more about the slow movement if you have n't done so already slow schools , slow food , slow rights slow cities i think it 's a great message that offers old school ways to live a meaningful life i 've always been a bit of tortoise , so this is right up my alley i do n't have an over scheduled life , rush to do things , or enjoy face paced diversions i'm easy like sunday morning international day of slowness is coming soon , uh , i mean , slowly arriving on june st be a part of it for a day or maybe more
