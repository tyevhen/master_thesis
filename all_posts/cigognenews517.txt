inducing unconsciousness it is indeed remarkable that a few words traveling through the air , penetrating the ear as sounds , even monotonous gibberish , can cause a person to effectively lose consciousness and fall into a trance these sounds apparently pick up a meaning in the brain which radically reduces the highest cortical functions of the nervous system once these sounds acquire meaning , they begin to exert a biochemical and neuroelectric force to shut down transmission among many nerve cells consciousness is severely restricted and the person pays attention to a very narrow range of stimuli this is no different from what happens to a young child who is being admonished by a parent and told to behave differently those words can cause the child to alter her feelings about herself and to change how she behaves , all unconsciously in other words , ideas can shut off , distort , and alter aspects of consciousness this happens , however , only if the person giving the ideas has authority in the eyes of the person accepting them and is the dealer of love and the remover of possible pain it is what occurs when a charismatic individual convinces someone to believe in outlandish ideas thus , there may be little difference between a cult leader talking to a disciple , a parent talking to a four year old child , and a hypnotist talking to her subject in each of these situations it is possible to render the person unconscious in a selective way one sure way is to manipulate need unfulfilled need for love , safety , protection , direction and guidance , warmth and against whatever the future may hold someone who has imprinted terror needs to find someone who will stave off the demons whoever they may be someone who will pave the way and make our journey in life safe the neurology of unconsciousness key structures in the limbic emotional system , or the second line consciousness , mediate in what occurs in both hypnosis and in the neurotic trance the amygdala and the hippocampus are involved in making feelings conscious and in making feelings repressed and unconscious dissociating feelings from acknowledgment the hippocampus can retrieve emotions and with the help of the thalamus , can keep them out of consciousness it is what accomplishes entrance into the hypnotic state peter brown notes that the limbic hippocampus is heavily responsible for the disconnection from conscious awareness the amygdala can activate emotions and can keep current input from triggering off those emotions the thalamus and basal ganglia , brown writes , help by refusing to relay certain information from below to higher levels in that way , too , we remain dissociated there is yet another system that keeps us alert and consciously vigilant , and that is the reticular activating system of the brain stem if that system is blocked we are less alert and critical some sleeping pills work directly here in the lulled , parasympathetic state of a beginning trance , it is that alerting system that goes off service but it is primarily the limbic system , where the emotional level of consciousness is organized , that decides whether to make a feeling fully conscious it is here that dissociation can take place it is here that the rhythms of the brain can be slowed down into the theta slow rhythms indicating the predominance of a lower or second line level of consciousness at work here is where the input from the hypnotist enters and is accepted unquestioningly as the brain rhythms slow even more into the delta range , down to or cycles per second , the person can enter a deep trance where even suggestion no longer enters she is out , no longer in this world she is rigid and unyielding she is operating on the first line only , where survival functions dominate the left hemisphere of the brain , with its severely diminished activity , is now practically useless there is no critical capacity whatsoever attention is narrowed only to the voice of the hypnotist and what he is suggesting , and even that is at a minimal level all of this is no different from discussing the various levels of consciousness operating in neurosis , and how imprints of trauma can occur on the two lower levels of consciousness which for a lifetime thereafter drive our behavior and symptoms no hypnotist in the world can overcome or erase a first line or second line imprint because early trauma is impressed into the neurophysiologic system as a permanent memory those imprints which alter our brains and our physiology must be addressed in any psychotherapy therefore , there is no hypnotist who can cure any neurosis a hypnotist can , perhaps , attenuate symptoms , by combatting the imprint with suggestion after suggestion day after day that can have some effect , but it is not permanent manipulating the first or second line is not the same as imprinting an event hypnosis can have short term effects which endure because of other factors such as reward , external motivation , punishment , etc nonetheless , one cannot imprint suggestion it takes a very high valence or force of an event , something that threatens our life or our integrity to be imprinted imprints occur during the critical period when need must be fulfilled when we are not loved or held in the first months of our life on earth that will be imprinted , together with the changes in certain hormones of love such as oxytocin and vasopressin there will alerations in the hormones of stress and they will reman as permanent souvenirs until we go back and redo and undo the imprint that caused so many deviations in various of our systems all of this is not meant as any exhaustive discussion of the neurology of hypnosis , which is well beyond my purview it is only to show that the same mechanisms involved in neurosis are the mechanisms involved in hypnosis hypnosis , in short , is a condensed and circumscribed , temporary neurosis it involves dissociation as a sine qua non it involves disconnection and blind obedience it involves uncritical behavior as if one were on automatic and in neurosis one is on automatic , automatically running off the program laid down by one 's caretakers in childhood if we were never close during the formative months of infancy it will be imprinted so that later we will be unable to form permanent emotional attachments to others
