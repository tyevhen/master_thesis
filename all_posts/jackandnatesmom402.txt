some video of nate playing one of his games , which basically consists of running in a pattern and laughing hysterically in the second one , he also shows some of the self stimulating stiffening that i have mentioned in the past , as well as the other sound that was actually our first red flag that something was going on mainly b c of our experiences with jack , it 's a repetitive sound that he makes with his tongue , see if you hear it it was concerning because it started replacing babble and language i am putting this on here so i have it to look back on when it 's no longer relevant ! oh , and of course , repetitive behaviors or not , the kiddo is just stinking cute ! ! ! note if your receive my blog via email notification , you will need to go to the actual blog to view the videos in most cases i suggest you do it you will see a huge difference between the first set and the second set of videos i have also posted a few early videos of nathan below it almost breaks my heart to watch them but i want this documented as well when we go for our evaluations , if they want to see what i mean by changes , here it will be , for them to see without question and it 's nice to remember the time before the worry set it , i wo n't deny it i am so so glad we took these videos , especially since it was of no special occasion , just every day shenanigans the first one is from march of , so nate was months old the second is from december , he was year old note the eye contact , the sustained attention , the conversant babble kills me
