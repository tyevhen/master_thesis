and , honor them today , tomorrow and every day when i returned from my second vietnam tour in , i was greeted by war protestors in the san francisco airport i still remember the feeling as i walked down the long corridor from the plane to baggage claim those of us in uniform were yelled at , spit upon , and called all kinds of names including , warmongers and baby killers it was a rude awakening and not the kind of welcome home we were looking forward to fortunately , on my second leg , the pilot walked up to me when i first found my seat and asked if i wanted to move up to first class i had never flown first class before and it was quite the experience i felt honored and the food sure was great my brother , don , who was a korean veteran , picked me up at the airport he took me to an american legion post for a drink when i walked in , my brother embarrassed me by announcing that i had just returned from vietnam i was immediately surrounded by wwii and korean veterans asking questions , thanking me for my service , and buying me drinks i felt pretty special we then drove to my home town and my brother took me to the vfw post as we entered , he again announced that i had just returned from vietnam and , once again , i was surrounded by other veterans it was a great feeling to be supported , but i couldn t shake that initial feeling of being hated by the protestors in san francisco fortunately , our returning veterans today are not experiencing anything like those of us who returned from vietnam yet , many soon discover that returning into society is often difficult and not very rewarding i don t believe we do a good job of helping our veterans reorient into civilian life these men and women should be honored and rewarded for their service to our country they , along with their families , have sacrificed so much and deserve more because of what they have given i am not a person who believes in all the entitlement programs that are available today that being said , i do not think we do enough for our veterans and their families and , we , as citizens , employers , managers , and owners , could definitely do more so , please , honor our veterans today , tomorrow and every day
