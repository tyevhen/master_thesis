trigger warning this summer has been been very similar to the last , in the way that i really struggled i will be totally honest and that i have been very depressed and suicidal this summer and i think it 's all down to the circumstances alongside the base principle that i do have mental health problems i do love to come home from university and see my friends and family as i truly miss them when i am away and they bring so much happiness , but at the same time coming home brings back some traumatic memories which seem to hit me as soon i walk in the door and i feel this is the reason i struggle so much i wish i could be like my mother , who went through this all with me , and put it in a box somewhere and move on with it but , i have n't quite got to that stage yet and the wound still feels very raw , after all of these years coming home for christmas , i find is one the happiest times i think it must be because of the length of time i spend at home a month this seems like the perfect amount of time for me and perhaps next year , if i move back home , having a full time job will take my mind off things i have found that by being at home for three months without a hefty job , and friends that are n't always available to see , leaves me with my own thoughts , especially when there are some people around you that trigger these traumatic memories every time you see them i find it very hard to overcome these thoughts when i come home , especially this summer and the last as although i filled my time , it just was n't enough for me and i just ended up in this spiral of depression , suicidal thoughts , attempts and self harm , the same as this summer but , when i am at university , my mental health seems to improve and i very rarely feel as depressed or anxious as i do when i come home and i know that 's because of my past but , it does make me sad because it 's not the fault of mother 's and i do feel the guilt of leaving her in a house by herself when she ill , and that adds to my pressure but , i know as well that she wants the best for me and i ca n't thank her enough for all that she has done i feel a lot of mental health problems can be reactive , and this what mine are when i come home and it 's just about weathering the storm i have some fantastic times when i am home over the summer , but i also have some more than challenging times and that 's what i struggle with the most but , it comes to a point where you have look after yourself and your mental health and although others may be suffering , to just keep living can be a sensitive challenge and if that means that i have to do what 's best for me , and remove myself from these circumstances of my old home life , then that 's what i'm going to have to do and if you feel a similar way , i suggest that to heal , you do a similar thing if that 's possible even though times can be tough , i am still here and so are you and that just shows that you can do it best wishes , amy xx
