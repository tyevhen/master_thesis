a confession a year ago i was recommended to a naturopath for stem cells he was even near my house but i never went to him because naturopath didn t sit right with me i was resistant had mental reservations , and was prejudiced and then a few weeks ago my old md called me and re recommended anew this same stem cell group so i went just after going to cancun for adipose tissue stem cells which did nothing and cost a fortune so now it is months into the new stem cells and for the first time in years i talk and am out of pain and this is a naturopath what does this tell me ? stop with mental prejudices and resistance it kept me from getting well for over a year and they were recommended by a proper medical doctor the same is true of most medical doctors who cannot see and adopt the new this is especially true for shrinks , several hundred thousand of them in america after my books , published in countries , not one has come to us and wanted to know more about our work thousands of scientists downloaded my scientific articles in the world congress of psychiatry it is considered one of the most downloaded pieces in their history , yet not one has contacted me i have found that most mds stay in their groove and never seek out other alternatives and the question is , why ? one answer is , i have the tools and will use it hither and yon , whenever i have a patient this is true in psychiatry where i have the shock machine , the favorite pills , the rigid adherent to one single therapy often with no basis in deep science and what is wrong with that ? it is therapist oriented , not the patient it is he who has the power and the magical therapy he is the holder of all the secrets and we the patients remain powerless their tool is applied to all kinds of patients with no acknowledgement of individual differences so what is wrong ? doctors are doctors , without a broad perspective they are rarely inclusive , mostly exclusive my prejudice came from the fact that when i grew up there was nothing else our md was the be all and end all of status so therefore i began to suspect anyone who was not a real doctor on the other hand , the natural healers i have known , whom i call booga booga merchants , were not high on science they were more loosey goosey which is not a bad thing they were open to everything sometimes too open so that they lacked the discipline needed their open mind became a sieve and they used every vitamin in the book to treat patients they purveyed received wisdom and they too often say , that you have to believe to make it work a bit of circular reasoning so if you are slightly skeptical it won t work and they say , aha ! , you see so that field attracts believers and people who through wish fulfillment think they are doing great and say they feel wonderful who can argue with that ? nevertheless , my current naturopath is curing me which previous md s could not do over many decades they lacked the essential curiosity and willingness to look at all kinds of solutions , not just their bag of tricks so when i had surgery , and when it did not work the doctor washed his hands of my case he never explored about what others might do for me why ? because they do not know what others in the field do , and mostly , they are not interested this is what i call medical rigidity so here is what happens as we mature the zeigeist and all its ideologies , perpetuated by the medical establishment spin a web of ideology inside us which then takes charge and directs our choices we are now driven by inner forces and i for one , avoided the one thing that could cure me how tragic what is even more tragic is that the big pharma and the health institutions prevent them from even using the term stem cells so what cures is banned not because it can help but because they flouted the regulations of real science double blind studies with plenty of subjects , and plenty of controls , done at reputable science centers , blah blah the top guys don t even want to look at the actual people who have been cured they want statistics and proper procedures following the rules is the summum bonum why all this ? because they can keep a monopoly on the whole business of science and extracted from their feelings , what they see and feel does not count in my field , no one who has spent years on his studies is going to say , oh yes , i get it i will start to learn something new all over again so it is not mental resistance so much as pocket resistance and energy resistance let me diverge for a moment today in science they reported that children who suffered emotional neglect were more likely to suffer stroke later in life now if those researchers were to read a bit more they might stumble on my work and the notion of enduring imprints that lead to stroke they lack curiosity they remain in a medical cloister about what is out there about what more there is to learn they lack a broad frame of reference , so what has been known for fifty years is ignored this is typical everyday there is a new study stating the obvious researchers could not feel what was right because they lost touch with that baby inside of them they should guess that early neglect would lead to disaster , and they should say to themselves , maybe i should follow up on that ? first , you need to feel what is right living in your head for too long robs you of the innate sense feeling maybe it is not lack of curiosity ? maybe it is just indifference ? no matter , science and humanity will suffer from it
