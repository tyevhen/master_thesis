i have little to say , i know few read my blog anymore , it 's not important i'm journaling separately as i felt i had little to say about my disease anymore i'm struggling at eight kilorats now and can only say it is beyond any suffering i know here 's an excerpt , unedited , from today 's journaling my soul has been eclipsed by a monster too big to describe , a hairy ape of melancholy that squats on my head like a bag of turds and turns all my thoughts to sewage what do i say to this monster ? why do you make me weep so ? why do you turn all my thoughts to shit ? i don t know i ve never known no matter how many times i go through depression , it never seems to get any better i have a dim faith that it will , based on the past , because it is cyclical , but my dim faith is much overridden by my current symptoms i feel i am a symptom , or a collection of symptoms , more than i am a person let me list them negative obsessive thinking that has me living in poverty or on the street self castigation for being a nothing and having achieved nothing weeping spells , especially in the morning when i wake and later in the afternoon around pm , not to mention a late morning attack if i get up early an inability to know what to do next with myself indecision about everything paralysis of motion a sadness so deep no surgeon could extirpate it a fear of everything , of opening my e mail , of any human contact a strong desire to leave this pain and leave this world , though my inner moral compass and my loved ones prevent me a questioning of god , frequent prayers for healing , for help , to no avail giant horse pills of fish oil i gag on in the morning , i couldn t swallow them today the foreboding of the end at all times a lack of faith in anything , in the sun rising , in my next breath a feeling of falsity , that i am a fraud , that i never accomplished anything , that without external structure i do not have enough ego strength to function fear of human contact , fear of being loved and so forth and so on ad nauseaum the weeping spells overcome me like seizures while in safeway yesterday i nearly had one but forestalled it through concentrating on my breathing i fantasize about joining a monastery or somewhere where an external discipline might give me structure and hope when i put this down on paper it seems so extremely trivial , like someone need merely say , wake up and smell the roses , stupid dark sonnet xxix i fear disintegration into glass , into a million cubes orbiting free , reflecting only scenery as they pass , without a central hub , without a me the ego is a very slippery boss few know the limits of his grand purview i know the limits he is what i ve lost all whirls in a pestilential stew a piece of me there , another here who will collect the fragments in the pot ? another year , another half a year where what i thought i was is what i m not dear brother , if your self escapes your skull , pray you do not disintegrate to null kilorats , craig erick chaffin
