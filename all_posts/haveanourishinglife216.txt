every day seems to present itself with a new challenge just when i think i am getting the hang of things and feeling prepared , i am caught off guard inevitably , something happens in my psyche and i have to re evaluate my attack strategy whether or not you struggle with a mental illness , change is an ever present reality in life throughout all the changes in my life over the past ten years , i can look back and see that my depression has manifested itself in many different forms many times , my experience felt less like normal change and more like a continuous circle drilling ever deeper and deeper into despair it is not uncommon for people struggling depression to also struggle with other mental disorders such as eating disorders , anxiety , and obsessive compulsive disorders , just to name a few looking back on my darkest of times , i admit that i was also very extreme with my eating behaviors once i felt like i had my eating habits under control , i had extreme panic attacks then once i eased my anxiety , i was obsessively counting everything under the sun then , it would start all over again needless to say , i was not doing well i lived in a different world than my peers in my head , my default setting went something like this i am unhappy , therefore , it must be because i am fat no matter the situation , if i felt unhappy , my brain told me it s because i am fat to this very day , i have to beat down those ridiculous thoughts as they pop into my head if i am sad about not having a job , it s because i am fat if i am unhappy at a party or gathering , it s because i am fat if i am depressed about the state of the world , it s because i am fat was i born that way ? i don t think so i am going to take a good guess and say that it comes from my commercial catechism commercials and society , in general , tell me that i cannot be happy unless i am flawlessly beautiful , extremely thin , and have perfect hair and being the gullible person i am , i let that belief run and ruin my life yes , i felt fat , but , more importantly , i felt unlovable because of the way i looked i felt that i did not deserve love because of my appearance i did not even deserve to love myself this belief dictated how i lived my life i tried to fix my depression by fixing how i looked on the outside appearance was my first priority if i thought i gained weight , i could not show my face in public if i didn t exercise , i was weak if i wasn t stylish , then i was a laughing stock if i ate desserts , then i was a failure for the most part , now i can recognize these ridiculous thoughts and not obey them from time to time , however , i still make poor choices i am still a work in progress did anyone wake up with a super bowl hangover ? you know , lots of good junk food and mindless eating in front of the television ? all i wanted to do today was starve myself to make up for my eating sins i felt groggy and sluggish this morning my default button kicked on and told me it was because i am fat really ? i thought we were done with this ? so , i took a deep breath and tried to distinguish the facts from the feelings let 's evaluate yesterday , i ate more junk food than i normally do in one day i stayed up late and didn t get enough sleep this weekend was busy , not my usual routine it s monday need i say more ? i watched tv i don t normally watch a lot of television i am , yet again , feeling down because i don t have a job and , it s , you know ladies , that time of the month so it is clear that there are a lot of other factors that could be contributing to my bad mood i have to remind myself , again , that starving myself will not make me happy if i don t believe it at first , i have to keep repeating it over and over until i do believe it fake it till you make it even if you do not deal with a mental disorder , from time to time , you might find yourself wanting to cope with the blues in an unhealthy way the best thing to do is to separate the facts from the feelings you don t have to use extreme measures to get your mood up sometimes all it takes is a few deep breaths other times you might need to show yourself more love if i am struggling with a downward spiral mood , i try one of the following mood boosters taking a walk i drop everything bundle up and leave the house , even if it is just a walk around the block once or twice journal sometimes you just need a good vent on a piece of paper reading blogs or self help books articles nothing too heavy , when i am down i can t handle using too much brain power or things just shut down tending to my garden in the summer , this has become my favorite coping skill doing the dishes it is mindless , yet productive , and i feel a sense of accomplishment after it s done watching a funny movie ah , the magic of laughter going to confession there is a cleansing power to this sacrament it s hard to get there , but when you do , the effects are so good for your mind , let alone , your soul playing the piano or any instrument if you can play one i play canon in d when i am in need of an outlet the song is different every time i play it sometimes , it s fast and loud and angry other times , its soft and sad and makes me cry other favorite mood boosters talking to a friend on the phone , or having coffee with someone boy , do i like coffee what are some things you do to help lift a bad mood ? leave a comment below i would love to hear about it until next time , take care !
