when i was a child , i lived across the street from a neurologist the neurologist shared his office with a psychiatrist , and i was told that one day , a patient walked into the office and shot the psychiatrist last week , in italy , a psychiatrist was stabbed to death by a patient we do n't think about how dangerous it may be , but being a shrink has some risks actually , being a person has some risks , and in baltimore , fourteen people have already been murdered this year , more than one per day with that as a prelude , i was on vacation briefly in december a quick trip to visit family in the hotel , i reached for my phone and looked at my twitter feed after all , it 's one of the ways i get the news only i'm thinking of news in terms of local and federal levels , not personal information about my friends i read a tweet from clink , and realized , oh my , she 's been assaulted by a patient this she puts out on twitter it was late , i texted , and in the morning i called are you okay ? she was okay , and she still is okay , a little shaken i'm glad clink is okay and if you 'd like to read her perspective on it , she wrote about on patient assault an insider 's view over on clinical psychiatry news
