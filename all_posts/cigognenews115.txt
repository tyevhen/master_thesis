there have been a number of people who have committed suicide who seemed at the pinnacle of success so what is going on ? and most of us thought that once we choose a profession and follow it and succeed at it , becoming an expert and well known , that would be fulfilling we would feel like a success wrong when we have deep rooted lack of love , rejection , indifference and missing touch early in our lives we cannot feel like a success usually because success and fame are ephemeral notions not part of our systems success is not a feeling , loved is fame is other people s idea of success it is in a way their feeling admiration , humbling , important , etc and why does the person , even most accomplished , never feel satisfied nor fulfilled ? because all of his fulfillment and all of his admiration is symbolic it is not the love he needed early on it covers it over , sits on top of the real need and leaves an emotional vacuum in its place it is the imprinted pain that cannot be erased no matter what kind of success is there and it drives him for more and more finally at the top of his fame he feels still unfulfilled and a failure there is nothing more to gain , nothing more to try for he looks at all his billboards and feels empty what does it mean ? i don t know what else to do to feel good it seems that life is empty there is no point suicidal thoughts thrust their way in the pain that drove it all is still alive and gnawing inside it says , sotto voice , you are not loved and that is all that matters you have failed at what matters most to be adored , admired , encouraged , held and caressed that is the malaise that speaks of something missing all your drive was to try to feel loved , and you are , but not by the people who really matter to be loved early on , is what sets the stage for your life it makes you feel confident but not driven it offers daring and enthusiasm and a joie de vivre it allows you to try but never in desperation symbolic love has to be repeated over and over exactly because it cannot fulfill why not ? because it sits on the painful imprint of no love that imprint has only one goal in life to be relived exactly as it was laid down it will never leave until it is lived again , fully , in its original context it cannot its goal is a constant warning of unfinished business the pain from very early on has to be felt and dealt with in all its agony yes , there is agony from deep , deep pain that was transformed into an imprint that becomes a primordial part of us it now confuses us , distracts us , and above all , stops our concentration oh yes it depresses us because we live with an enemy in the house that we cannot shake off it lives with us and in us it claws for its liberation it wants freedom to live the pain , believe it or not yet we do what we can to stop it no wonder most psychotherapy is aimed at repression , rationales , understanding but never deep feeling they get a bit of relief which the patient settles for but no cure so what does the successful person feel ? very little down , unhappy and unfulfilled he has to with no other choice because those feelings will not leave even for mercy s sake the imprint knows no mercy it wants conscious awareness somewhere inside even while the top cortical level does what it can to imprison it conscious awareness means deep feeling plus ultimate understanding of what it is enough rearranging of the chairs on the titanic we must replace things to be healthy we must join feelings with their thoughts and make ourselves whole fame won t do that i have treated enough stars to know that , and my patients also know it there is no substitute for extirpating the imprint none leaving the imprint and you are leaving misery there so let s go over this again when there is a basic lack of fulfillment early life , gestation and birth and infancy , there is an imprint of lack of fulfillment that stays and is embedded deep in the brain , almost in accessible but the feeling is imperceptibly accessible feeling unfulfilled and we drag it and it drags us into into the race for fulfillment it has be symbolic because once embedded and out of reach we will fill ourselves with substitutes symbols we cannot know the real lack and what it is that is why the system insists on reliving later in life it understands real integration and liberation and it finally stops the terrible drive to feel like a success that is different from being successful that is the drive to do things right a little more relaxing
