my busy day is finally winding down i had lots of things on my to do list , and i think i got them all done ! here 's the rundown after ordering some new physical therapy textbooks while drinking my coffee this morning , i ran off to the gym to swim two thousand yards today that 's lengths of the pool i count lengths rather than laps when i try to count laps , i get lost , and i'm just anal enough that i need to know exactly how far i swam ! after a bite to eat , i was off to my allergist for my yearly check up fun i took a short mid day nap , made some phone calls , walked puck and went to the dq ! ! ! , and finally tackled some tough yard work i had to dig up a large cherry tree , which i planted two years ago , and move it about four feet i 've decided to build a low , wooden patio , and the tree was in the way barely ! it 's now in its new location i hope it lives i had to cut a few roots to get it out of the ground so far , it looks okay my back was pretty sore after all that digging and hauling the last thing i wanted to do was workout , but i had minutes on the bike awaiting me so i watched some basketball and rode to nowhere afterward , i ate a late supper before sitting down for my time with you phew it was a good day i'm tired , but it 's a good tired it 's nice to finish the day with a completed list goodnight , friends
