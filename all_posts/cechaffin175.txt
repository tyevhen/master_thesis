this is my rd post since i began the blog in july of how does my blog differ from a diary ? first , i do n't always write about what 's important to me but what i think might interest others i write for an audience , not my bedroom shelf my audience , after two years , amounts to visitors per day , though those are spread across all my posts , due to search engines that track things like poetry and depression thus by sheer longevity my blog becomes a bit of a reference document , as a recent visitor struggling with bipolar disease demonstrated , who just discovered it what 's funny about my wanting to write about what interests others is that i get more attention when writing about my actual life than when i wax philosophical or poetical i think this is likely because people are starved for authenticity so often the authenticity that brings initial attention to someone is quickly swallowed up by commercialization once a personality has become a celebrity , he soon becomes a commodity , and then you know what to expect and the personality is likewise constrained by its image a small time blogger has no such restrictions maybe my blog is more of a diary than i think i write more when i'm depressed , for the therapeutic benefit of gaining distance from myself through words in that state i need comments to prove i exist , while at other times i have faith that i do and the urge to objectify myself in words decreases then blogging becomes more of an occasional diversion these mood factors means my blog must be terribly uneven except for the unusual length of most posts , as i find it hard to write less than words once i get started better perhaps to think of this blog as a public diary , one meant to be read by others i do n't report everything , my privacy restricts some matters , but when i do describe my life , i try for direct honesty laced with humor blogging about blogging must be the nadir of blogging , forgive or not i could cut this post short if i simply posted a poem from my upcoming book , one this blog has not seen as if below the first cross of the brain s junction with the cerebellum and the second cross of the neck s junction with the shoulders is a third cross where spine meets pelvis , the first chakra , site of the commonest human ache and cause of disability , a small price to pay for going where quadripeds ca n't the way of craving and surfeit or the way of denial and longing , the way of narcissus or the way of christ as you alternate between serving self or others best trust your heart and not think too much step as if you already stepped where you are about to step , balance as if you already balanced where you are about to balance , write as if your words mean something , speak as if they do it 's possible that in posts i already posted this i 'll have to search the archives to be sure tried , did n't see it how many mice does it take to screw in a light bulb ? two , if they 're small enough ka ching ! flowing in the river of life , ce
