i receive this email from my brother today and it came at a good time yes , it is simple , common sense advice , but it never hurts to be reminded once in a while those of us living with kennedy 's disease know how stress can exacerbate our symptoms we need to be aware of our tolerance for stress and act accordingly a young lady confidently walked around the room while explaining stress management to an audience as she raised a glass of water , everyone was sure she was going to ask the ultimate question 'half empty or half full ? ' however , she fooled them all how heavy is this glass of water ? she inquired with a smile answers called out ranged from oz to oz she replied , the absolute weight does n't matter it depends on how long i hold it if i hold it for a minute , that 's not a problem if i hold it for an hour , i 'll have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day , you 'll have to call an ambulance in each case it 's the same weight , but the longer i hold it , the heavier it becomes she continued , that 's the way it is with stress if we carry our burdens with us all the time , sooner or later , as the burden becomes increasingly heavy , we wo n't be able to carry on as with the glass of water , we have to put stress aside for a while and rest before picking it up again so , as early in the evening as you can , put all your worries aside and focus on your family and friends do n't carry the stress around with you through the evening and into the night then when we 're refreshed , we will find it easier to carry the burden
