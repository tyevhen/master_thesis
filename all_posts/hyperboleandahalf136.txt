dear readers i had a really creative spurt today i probably should n't say spurt , but whatever anyway , i wrote , like , letters to things , people and myself it may sound stupid , but i promise that it 's brilliant you 'll just have to see it for yourself i swear to god , i was laughing so hard at myself that i got a headache you may be wondering what this is all about it 's simple , really i write letters to things , some of which are offensive the letters , not the things except for a few of them and then i post a few of them at a time and you laugh and tell your friends that i'm a genius and then i get famous and rich and i do n't have to look for a job anymore because looking for a job is a fruitless and painful process that is making me feel like i should just become an alcoholic so that i at least have something external to blame my failure on are we clear ? okay thanks for reading allie dear me you sounded like an idiot just then you are confusing your readers and alienating them by pressuring them to make you famous it is not their responsibility wait , yes it is but you should make them want to make you famous instead of writing stupid little letters about how poor you are and how they should make you rich and famous out of pity i know that you have lost pounds in the last two weeks because you ca n't afford real person food , but you do n't need to tell other people that they do n't have money either and they 'll just feel bad for being unable or unwilling to help you which will make them retreat into denial about your existence and then they wo n't read your blog it 's kind of like how you feel about those starving children commercials which is a topic that pretty much every funny person in the history of the world has joked about , but you are going to go right ahead and do it too , just because you think you did it differently you did n't , by the way you just said some unexpected things afterward that 's like putting a hat on jesus and saying you invented him good catch with the capital h stop being a pompous asshole okay , i 'll agree with you that it is a good idea to test out how people will react to the words jesus and asshole before you post your other letters i know how excited you are to post them , so i commend you for showing a little self restraint your audience will appreciate the awkward but present segue into the more offensive and disturbing branch of your sense of humor well , you better post some of those letters you were talking about maybe post some of the really short ones it 'll be like a preview but whatever you do do not post the jesus one or the one about mexicans i know , i know , i know they really are n't that offensive , but people are really easy to offend and you want to be famous , remember ? you do n't get famous by being honest at least most people do n't maybe abraham lincoln but not you you have to ingratiate yourself to everyone i know it 's hard to restrain yourself , but just do it , okay ? please , please , please , please do it just for a little while just until you find out how many followers you 'll lose from swearing and taking the lord 's name in vain pretty please ? okay i have done all i can i hope you choose to be smart about this good decisions are like making a deposit in the bank of your future really ? that 's the best you could come up with ? you better hope that people think you are really funny because you definitely do n't have a future in advertising or inspirational speaking carry on allie dear cup thank you for being waterproof i 'll talk to you later ! allie dear superballs i am and a half and i do n't have a job please stop looking so goddamn fun thanks allie dear inventor of watermelon flavored things have you ever eaten watermelon ? just wondering allie dear me you did it ! you did n't offend anyone 's religion , ethnicity , culture or sexuality ! i mean , if the inventor of watermelon flavor is one of your followers , he might be kind of pissed , but you managed to not offend people in swaths i think that is an accomplishment go have some cake allie
