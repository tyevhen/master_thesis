mccue , waheed , urcuyo , orendain , joseph , charles , and hasan just published a study in the british journal of psychiatry suggesting that haloperidol haldol may be more effective than some of the newer , dramatically more pricey antipsychotic meds link to abstract on journal 's site here or just read below background there is little information on the comparative effectiveness of second generation antipsychotic agents aims to determine if any of five second generation antipsychotics or haloperidolis more effective in treating acutely ill patients with schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder method a sample of newly admitted patients were randomised to open label treatment with aripiprazole , haloperidol , olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone or ziprasidone for a minimum of weeks measures of effectiveness were improvement in mental status so that the patient no longer required acute in patient care , and changes in brief psychiatric rating scale bprs scores results by the first measure , haloperidol , olanzapine and risperidone were significantly more effective than aripiprazole , quetiapine and ziprasidone changes in bprs ratings were not significant among treatments conclusions haloperidol , olanzapine and risperidone are superior to aripiprazole , quetiapine and ziprasidone for the acute treatment of psychosis in hospitalised patients with schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder my view at worst , it appears that haloperidol was as effective or more effective compared to the new meds , yet is about of the cost hmmm and it ai n't like haldol is a wonder drug this is one of a number of recent articles that has found the second generation antipsychotic meds have been highly overrated feel free to check out my prior posts on the topic , including this , this , this , this , and this
