after robin williams died , my facebook feed was full of ads for the national suicide prevention hotline there 's a reason for this when celebrities commit suicide there may be an increase in suicide , copycat acts if you will publicizing means for help does help after kurt cobain 's death , calls to such centers went up and suicide deaths went down i 'd like to write about what happens when people call suicide prevention hotlines if you have , will you tell me your story ? or if you work for one , i 'd love to hear about your experience to write , i may need to be able to contact you i do n't need to publish your name , so perhaps an email rather then a comment ? shrinkrapblog at gmail dot com be safe and thank you !
