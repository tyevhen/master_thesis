the wc dist auth w org list today received an interesting proposal for a new protocol , tentatively dubbed jsop by its authors david n scheler and julian reschke of day software as the name hints , jsop would be based on json and would be a restful protocol designed to facilitate the exchange of fine grained information between browsers and repository based server apps as such , it 's one of the first proposals maybe the first ? to make extensive use of http 's new patch verb why does the world need jsop ? for the past number of years i always found myself in the situations where i wanted to exchange fine grained information between a typical current browser and a server that persists the information , explains david n scheler in most cases for me the server obviously was a content repository , but i think the problem set is more general and applies to any web application that manages and displays data or information it seemed that every developer would come up with an ad hoc solution to that very same problem of reading or writing fine grained data at a more granular level than a resource for example , what if you want to modify not just a resource but certain properties of the resource ? webdav is often an answer in such situations or you might be thinking atompub in the case of cmis , but the fact is , it can take a lot of effort too much effort , some would say to achieve your goals using webdav , and in the end , html forms have no native understanding of property based operations as n scheler puts it , webdav and atompub are not very browser friendly , meaning that it takes a modern browser and a lot of patience with javascript to get to a point where one can interact with a server using either of the two so in other words , something as simple as setting or getting attributes on a folder should n't take a lot of hoop jumping you should be able to do things like request get myfolder json http response createdby uncled , name myfolder , id da a a adbfbb type folder or request get myfolder json http response createdby uncled , name myfolder , id da a a adbfbb type folder child grandchild depth depth in the above example with nested folders , notice that the get is on a url of myfolder json notice the ' json' , indicating that the server should return folders levels deep suppose you want to create a new document under myfolder , delete an old document , move a doc , and update an attribute on the folder all in one operation with jsop , you could do something like patch myfolder http newdoc type document , createdby me olddoc movingdoc otherfolder mydocument lastmodifiedby me where means to create a node property resource , means delete , means move , and means update jsop proposes not only to be javascript friendly but forms friendly so for example , imagine that you want to upload a gif image and update its metadata at the same time , using an html form under the reschke n scheler proposal , you could accomplish this with a form post post myfolder my gif http content type multipart form data boundary content length content disposition form data name data content type image gif gifa ! , s f content disposition form data name jsop diff content type text plain lastmodifiedby me exif cameramake apple , cameramodel apple bottom line , jsop promises to provide an easy , restful , forms friendly , javascript friendly way to do things that are possible but not necessarily easy right now with webdav or atompub it should make working with repositories a snap for mere mortals who do n't have time to master the vagaries of things like cmis or webdav in my opinion , it 's a much needed proposal here 's hoping it becomes a full fledged ietf rfc soon
