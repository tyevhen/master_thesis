it was a hard winter it started even before that , perhaps in october , right before i left to work in baton rouge one patient had a serious suicide attempt , several were in crisis , even the patients who were fine were having trouble getting out the door at the end of the sessions treatment resistant depression had become one of my favorite terms , but there were also a few people with mania and psychosis who were having a tough time so it continued through the winter one patient called at least times a day i finally told her to stop this improved the quality of my mental health remarkably , another e mailed , up to times a day , patients called or worse , their relatives called they cried , sometimes they even sobbed i mentioned it to a few colleagues and they all had the same response my practice , too ! one friend told me her emergency phone line usually gets calls a month , now she was getting a day , including calls from a patient on another continent , all while she 'd taken on news patients that week and her husband was out of town , leaving her with their young children to negotiate she beat me out for the most suffering psychiatrist award and i brought her chocolate something in the air ? yet one more effect of global warming ? i felt discouraged , overwhelmed , and i wondered for the first time if i really loved psychiatry as much as i thought one friend , a bit more seasoned than i , expressed surprise that it took me this long i 've been in practice since , another wrote , i wonder why i ever thought sitting with troubled people would make for an interesting career i quoted her often was something different about my world , i wondered , or was i just perceiving everything differently after all , i am a psychiatrist , i do work with troubled people , at any given time someone out there is in crisis , maybe i was more sensitive , maybe it was n't global warming in march , i went to an all day seminar on bipolar disorder ross baldessarini talked about the wonders of lithium i 've used it a fair amount to as an augmenting agent , but more recently , i think i 'd forgotten about it , or given in too easily to patient 's initial refusals i started to re think all my troubled people , ah , i gave more of them lithium it 's definitely helped a few , including one of my more distressed patients who had been refusing it for months before things are quieter now i'm not sure if it 's springtime , the longer days , the alignment of the moon , or more lithium lithium is a hard sell to listen to the experts , you just start people on it i 've found it takes at least separate discussions to get someone to try it in the last weeks , one patient called me in tears insisting i 'd made her so much worse just by suggesting she take lithium , another man started shaking and said , doc , you 're making me really nervous lithium has gotten a bad rap over time , and for some reason it 's so much easier to get folks to try anti psychotics it 's an element , natural , just a salt has gotten me nowhere in a few cases , i 've resorted to asking patients to take one pill , just one pill , and call me right after they 've swallowed it the first dose is the hardest , or so it seems i have to promise i 'll let them stop if they have side effects or as i sometimes put it , intolerable side effects and i keep the levels low , sometimes really low you have no new messages i love the sound of the mechanical lady on my voicemail is it just the calm before the manic storm , i wonder maybe , but for the moment , i 'll take it
