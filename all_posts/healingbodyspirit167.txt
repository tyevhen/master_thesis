in the whirlwind of our lives , i sometimes forget what life was like before we found each other but then i silently watch as you work in the yard , sit at the computer , carry a grandchild on your shoulders , kneel to pray , cook an omlet and feel the spark of fire i felt years earlier in the sunset of our years , as we walk hand and hand together i treasure our love i find no fault in you and when i count my blessings , you are at the top of the list
