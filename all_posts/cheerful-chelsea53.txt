i got snap happy over my venus flytrap ! i'm not always the best at looking after myself , if i'm having a down day , week or month i often begin to feel useless and get frustrated due to feeling like i ca n't do the 'normal' things others can however , i manage to get myself up for the day if i have certain responsibilities or things i 've committed to sure i'm not the best at getting up and feeling peppy over going to see my doctor , mostly because of some of the things they 've said to me in the past when it comes to having to be there for other people or my pets i just know i have to find the strength within myself to be there its certainly not easy if i 've been stuck in that head space for a while , but i 've had a support system around me for a long time now this support system has been responsible for looking after me when i just do n't care about my own welfare , they make sure i take my medication , check that i have enough of my prescription , help me get to places if i need to pick something up that i fancy but just do n't feel strong enough to drive myself they mean a lot to me and do so much for me without even having to be asked its not easy living with depression , but we must also remember to think about those who stick by us , they may understand our illness and want to help but its not always easy watching someone suffer these people may well feel equally as exhausted as we do so , whenever they need something from me , i try to put my worries and wallowing aside to be there for them its a process , adjusting from being looked after to being the one that 's taking care of someone else will take time i 've been lucky enough to have been able to look after the most adorable hamster ruben and our puppy toby since january i do n't want to miss any time with them , so i try to make my days as long as possible to spend time with them so i do n't miss any of their 'firsts' , i do n't want to just hear about them from others looking after pets has given me more of a structure to my day , something which i have previously written about in the post linked here having something else to look after can be great for someone with depression , obviously its not a decision to be made impulsively and there are many aspects to be considered before committing to having a pet there are many factors that prevent people from getting pets such as allergies , financial and time constraints , a busy work schedule or if you live in rented properties that do not allow pets consider my alternative on a slightly easier day when your mood has lifted from the depths of depression , try to head out to a garden centre or even a supermarket and have a nosey around their plant sections you can usually find some small houseplants in supermarkets , them always have an abundance of orchids ! usually for fairly reasonable prices orchids certainly are n't the easiest to look after , but they are beautiful i was gutted when mine started losing it 's flowers , but i 've manage to re pot it and i 've even seen a few more leaves sprout out , its still alive yessss ! there seems to have been an surge in bloggers and instagramers posting photos of their cacti and succulent plants , and i 've been hooked by those posts too these plants are relatively low maintenance , incredibly hard to kill off and can be really pretty ! even if you do n't think they are particularly pretty perhaps set aside some time to diy some regular terracotta pots , i picked some up for p each from a garden centre head over to pinterest for some inspiration on decorating some plain pots just adding some colour to your environment , having some aerate the room and being responsible for something can be a small step towards giving your days more structure and perhaps taking the steps towards looking after others on your stronger days yes , i'm aware that plants are a major step down from looking after pets , its nothing like being greeted with a lick across the face but , you also wo n't get nipped when a chew toy is n't available , and no poops to pick up either !
