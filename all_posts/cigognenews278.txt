this is the first of a series of articles i wrote on depression the whole article has been published by ans the journal for neurocognitive research in october to see the full text http www activitas org index php nervosa article view introduction depression has been considered a mysterious monster , even in professional circles where it is still deemed an enigmatic illness the condition has proven so resistant to treatment that one therapeutic approach , based on cognitive behavioral principles , calls itself taming the beast , an anagram for treatment modules in biology , emotions , activity , situations and thoughts gilson freeman , today , however , the most common treatment strategy is also the simplest it involves the use of antidepressants , now the third most widely prescribed type of drug in the country , often administered by general practitioners untrained in psychology mojtabai olfson , when neither drugs nor therapy are effective , some psychiatrists resort to that holdover from horror movies , electro shock therapy , which is gaining renewed acceptance under a different moniker , electroconvulsive therapy ect until recently , ect was considered the last resort in the battle against the beast it was used when psychiatrists concluded that the only option left was to blast the patient s brain with electrical energy now , psychiatrists have gone beyond applying shocks from outside the skull and have opted for an even more radical alternative brain surgery mayberg et al , to say the least , it is a most drastic attempt at a solution the procedure known as deep brain stimulation dbs involves drilling four holes in the brain with screws inserted into the skull surgeons then plant electrodes near the center of the brain in a region called area , part of the subcallosal cingulate gyrus which has been identified as a having a key role in major depression activated by a pacemaker in the chest , the devices emit a steady stream of electric pulses to stimulate the area , thereby easing the otherwise entrenched symptoms suppose , however , that we could access deep brain centers without any physical or chemical intervention and make alterations in the circuit perhaps even rewire it in a natural way i submit that primal therapy does just that it is possible to found a natural , non invasive way to access the same deep brain structures that are affected by surgery and or tranquilizers and my opinion is that it is possible to successfully treat many deep depressions , and measure results through brainwaves and biochemistry for a detailed discussion , please see my book , why you get sick and how you get well the healing power of feelings janov , by finding this psychotherapeutic avenue to the affected brain areas , we can avoid many misdirected approaches , especially the risky use of surgery and heavy drugs certainly , natural feeling methods are to be chosen over a serious brain surgery it is not that depression is refractory to psychotherapy it is that psychotherapy is refractory to depression in its current state , psychotherapy in many of its approaches is too superficial to change anything profoundly it isn t that depression cannot be touched by therapy because it is such a serious and unfathomable affliction it is that conventional therapy is not designed to probe the depths of the unconscious where generating sources lie and today it seems that the only way conventional therapists can get to those deep lying imprints is through surgery or jolts of electricity the crucial concept of the imprint and its corollary , resonance , the gateway to deep brain levels , is explored in detail below the reason we , as a profession , have had to resort to such drastic and dangerous measures is because most treatments thus far have addressed the neocortex actually , the front left tip of the neo cortex , the prefrontal area since clinical approaches such as talk therapy and behavior modification concentrate on the cognitive part of the brain , they may neglect the source and the site of the real problem the success of the surgery itself , with some percent of patients reporting their depression lifted , should tell psychotherapists that the site of the problem may lie deeper the most serious cases are rightly referred to as deep depressions because the problem often emanates from the antipodes of the brain to be clear , my opinion is that a psychotherapy for depression that fails to probe the depths of the brain , the depths of the unconscious , cannot be successful the generating source remains untouched diagnosis in psychotherapy too often is a matter of nomenclature , one that may not accord with neurology and the body that houses it conventional diagnosis is often symptom based , focused on external signs labored movements , lack of interest , and a bewildering array of other symptoms detailed below while ignoring root causes i propose a diagnosis , however , that encompasses the system as a whole neurobiology , behavior and psychology as an ensemble , an integrated view some leaders in the field acknowledge that psychology as a profession is in need of a radical overhaul the debate about the confounding state of psychotherapy seems to escalate with every new edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders d s m , considered the bible of mental illness and treatment this year , on the eve of the publication of the d s m , the first revision in almost years , the calls for a whole new way of thinking in psychology seem more urgent than ever on both sides of the atlantic , there have been recent calls for a complete paradigm shift in the way we understand and treat mental illness in a prepared statement on the eve of the d s m s release , the british psychological association stated it was unhelpful to see mental health issues as illnesses with biological causes on the contrary , there is now overwhelming evidence that people break down as a result of a complex mix of social and psychological circumstances bereavement and loss , poverty and discrimination , trauma and abuse , stated dr lucy johnstone , a clinical psychologist who helped draft the association s provocative statement doward , meanwhile in the u s , dr thomas insel , director of the national institute of mental health , based near washington , d c , states that there can be no progress in the field so long as we continue to use the d s m as our guidebook he claims it leaves out the complexities of neuroscience , biology and genetics the manual is even counterproductive , he argues , because it is used to deny funding to researchers looking for the real causes behind afflictions such as psychosis and depression , simply because their research proposals cut across the d s m s outdated categories dr insel is one of a growing number of scientists who think that the field needs an entirely new paradigm for understanding mental disorders , concludes a recent new york times article about the controversial manual , though neither he nor anyone else knows exactly what it will look like belluck carey , according to my view the last part of that statement is fully true , the paradigm already exists i am not a lone voice in the wilderness , but my opinion based on my experience and four decades of work is that for example primal therapy , that was in focus of my work and experience is one of them that offers precisely the new paradigm that is needed in modern psychology but as with all new revolutionary theories in science , the status quo is slow to recognize fundamental changes in any field , and loathe to adopt them see the article by agustin gurza on primal therapy and scientific revolutions , originally published in the journal of primal therapy gurza , and more recently posted online as an appendix to my book , grand delusions gurza , what this paper seeks to address is precisely that paradigm shift , probing for causes and generating sources that have been neglected in our work i agree that we need to reorient our field and provide a new understanding of mental illness , which i take as my task what i am proposing is a total paradigm shift not only in our view of this affliction but also its treatment we need to reframe our thinking about it , and recognize that what is missing is the why ? we need to ask what is depression , and where does it come from ? why is the patient depressed ? since i first published the primal scream the cure for neurosis in , the subtitle became the lightening rod for criticism because we used the term cure nobody dares speak of curing mental illness yet the issue seems to be a double bind we utilize therapies that cannot cure , and then look askance at those who claim to have found one cure is not an opprobrious term what is opprobrious is that we have given up on proper therapy and made it an unacceptable word cure is not a term to be avoided in the interest of pure science it is a state to be sought after assiduously we owe it to the millions who suffer from depression with no real hope of finding their way out of the darkness depression has been a mystery for a long time because we have ignored the connection between a patient s current mental and physical health and long ago imprinted traumas experienced in childhood but also in the womb and at birth that left us with a narrow range of choices either drug the patient or operate on him preferably , we need to help him plunge deep into that unconscious we need to help the patient find the nexus between his current state of depression and its deep lying sources only the patient can make that connection inside himself our task is to help him gain access to those deeper levels of brain function history will provide us with the answer history is the cause and history is the savior
