have you ever heard of a year old baby tooth ? you have now i have one in the front of my mouth unfortunately , it 's gotten so loose over the past year it seems it could fall out at any time but i ca n't complain it has given me years i think that goes about years above and beyond its tour of duty the permanent tooth just never came in , although it is sitting there above the baby tooth , waiting well , my year old baby tooth is now in its final moments of duty it will be pulled tomorrow , and thus will begin an month process of hopefully pulling the permanent tooth into place i'm not terribly excited i'm not excited because the month process includes potential oral surgery and eventually getting braces it all starts tomorrow actually , it began last week when i procured the loan to cover the extensive cost of all this orthodontic work tomorrow the baby tooth will be pulled , and i will be fit with an appliance which will create room for the permanent tooth it will cover the roof of my mouth , so i guess i'm going to have a lisp for a couple days that 's what the orthodontist said , anyway after this appliance does its job , hopefully , i will then be fit with braces braces ! fortunately , they make clear ones now , so i wo n't have a totally tinseled smile i'm hoping everything goes according to plan , and i 'll be the proud wearer of a new smile within two years besides anticipating braces , i 've been doing well my mood is holding steady i saw my doctor today , and she agreed to decrease the fat med again i'm very grateful for that i also lost pounds since last monday , which made me very happy i 've added more strength training to my routine , and i think that 's helped my running is also going fairly well i ran miles on saturday and miles total last week that 's the most i 've run since getting back to it about one month ago it 's still more difficult than i 'd like , but it 's getting better , so i have a lot to be grateful for today one foot in front of the other , i'm moving forward
