i 've got a date tonight , a tinder date to be more precise and it 's filling me with anxiety i met up with the girls the other night one of them has been unhappy in her job for years but finds the thought of interviewing for a new one flippin scary that 's exactly how i feel about all this dating malarky i would happily face a super scary interview rather than this date tonight interviews and jobs i'm ok at , dating and boys i am crap at what is all that about ? quite honestly i ca n't face another situation where i'm seeing someone , spending time with them and then it does n't work out i know that 's kind of shooting myself in the foot , you 've gotta be in it to win it and all that , but that 's just how i feel at the mo i know this sounds deep but i do n't want someone else coming along who makes me lose all sense of emotional control i have myself quite a solo routine going on at the moment i fill my evenings and weekends with the things i want to do with no thought of anybody else i do n't worry if i'm going to be let down by some guy or why he has n't text back or if all he is interested in is getting some sure i want to find someone , a best friend , my very own boy but at the moment i'm happy single and in control that 's right , i just confessed i am actually happy ! purely for the reason of an experience an online date and potential blog content i am not going to cancel on this date tonight as much as i would love to go home after work and watch a film on the sofa in my pjs , i am not going to i am going outside my comfort zone and meeting a complete stranger for a drink in some bar in london and what if he cancels ? well that 's what i would call fate
