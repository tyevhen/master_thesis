a few nights ago we all snuggled in the big chair as chris read paige her first bedtime story outside of the womb it was called on the night you were born by nancy tillman it describes what all the different animals in the animal kingdom did when your little one was born how they rejoiced there is also the strong message that there is nobody in the world like your little one that he she is the only one in existence all the illustrations were unbelievable ! it was such a sweet story , of course i cried all the way through it sigh the tears are still a flowing at every little thing ! paige seemed to really enjoy the book and stared at each page as it was held close to her face she liked the pages with the words best , probably because they are black against white she fell fast asleep soon after it was a sweet family moment and i look forward to many more like it in the future ! save you might also like the firsts one week ! here comes the sun linkwithin
