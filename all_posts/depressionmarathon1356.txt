i think i am heading up the sides of the slippery slope of my rut rather than the slip n slide cliffs of a few days back , my rut now is less angled , less wet the footholds are occasionally slick but sometimes firm i washed the dishes a firm foothold i scarfed down pan of brownies topped with a pint of ice cream look out below ! i took puck for a short run good footing i could n't organize my meds , put away those damn clothes , or finish a work project oops , i slipped but , hey , i will take a shallow , damp rut over a steep , soaked cliff any day of the week ! progress , not perfection progress , not perfection wow ! i never could or would have been satisfied with that a few years ago it 's not something i could have even wrapped my mind around sure , i may have been able to say it i could certainly teach it it was okay for you but me progress not perfection ? no way ! tolerating , even embracing progress , and letting go of perfection is another example of this horrible illness positively impacting and changing my character and my life remarkable i hate the illness but i am grateful for the character building it has forced upon me
