i got an e mail from my husband today he sent along a review by dorothy rabinowitz of a soon to air hbo series called in treatment and suggested i sub blog as the show plays so dorothy rabinowitz writes it is odd that the network that has tried long , hard and haplessly to come up with anything remotely equal to the power and creativity of its blood drenched sopranos saga has finally succeeded in a series entirely shrouded in the quiet of a therapist 's office , where the only threats come from words , revelations , the assaultive force of unwelcome truths they are an arsenal of terrible power as deployed in the battles waged hour after hour in the intimacy of the consulting room the arsenal that drives so much of this series that is , in its invention and artistry if not in its nonlavish production values , a worthy successor to the sopranos a show about psychotherapy that ranks with the sopranos ? i'm on it five nights a week , starting monday , from to five nights a week ? i 'll do my best , that 's a lot of therapy to watch for someone coming home from the office it better be good the psychotherapist is played by gabriel byrne pictured above and his therapist of course is played by dianne wiest if i do n't get to it in real time , there 's always tivo clinkshrink tells me she ca n't watch it , no cable roy may be under the floorboards again , and i'm not sure what kind of reception he gets there
