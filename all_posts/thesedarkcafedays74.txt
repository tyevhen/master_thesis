i 've been sorting through some old files to try and quell my computer 's protests that i do n't have enough disc space and i found quite a few things i wrote during my darkest cafe days a year and a half ago i thought some of it might be worth sharing on here in case they could be of use to anyone else going through similar things reading it over , i guess i should forewarn people that there is some rather violent imagery and language if that might bring up issues for you this particular set of lyrics i wrote about my frustration and hurt over the neglect dare i say betrayal ? maybe that 's too harsh of my friends when i had clearly communicated that i was hurting it 's unedited but honest i do n't think the lyrics will ever make it into a song of what i write does n't but i always hesitate to even think of calling my stuff poetry because i know that stuff has rhyme schemes and meters and other sophisticated structure but here it is i had a wise man tell me one day people are just a liability i scold what an awful thing to say but now i'm losing the ability to deny the doubts in my own mind i 've gotten so disillusioned if you did n't love them you 'd leave em cuz they 've left bleedin' one too many times you gotta earn your way in this world you gotta fight for him if you wanna be his girl laugh hard , talk loud pretend you know what you 're talking about love is a reward , it 's conditional broken hearts are turned away from the hospital everyone keeps track of sin that 's what i 've learned on the outside looking in people are posion do n't too close or you 'll end up crying when the doors are closed you swear it 's worse than dying call it cynicism it 's my prison i shiver from all the draughts but i stay in hopes it 'll keep me safe whoever said ghosts were phantoms that lurk around your house no , they 're the memories locked in your head that you ca n't get out good men are just pretend they take you round the side shoot a bullet in your back leave you suffering but alive tell you to put your head in a sack then they wave when they see you again and just like that you 're supposed to be friends i want to believe the truth just like i wanted to believe in you but i 've been burned so many times and you were just another lie i told myself i want to hope i know there are ways to cope i would be stronger if i said no but i am weak , okay i am weak and i guess i tell myself these lies because i hope someone will come and tell me they 're not true i hope someone will come and tell me i love you r g , early my thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the orlando tragedy as well as the other awful happenings of the past week hate and guns the worst human inventions let 's be a part of bringing more love to this world i know i need to work on doing so i am starting to maybe have the tiniest glimmer of possibly believing in love again there is a good man out there but who knows if our paths will ever intersect overall , i am hopeful again , contrary to how i felt when i wrote these lyrics , though i do n't blame myself for writing them at the time but i hope i can offer hope in saying that even those painful , deep wounds of being abandoned by friends are healing pretty well they 'll never go away , but they are n't raw like they used to be , getting inflamed anytime they were rubbed the wrong way i am learning to stand on my own two feet and hold the hands of those who do love me and let go of those who have shown they do not so take that , everyone who did n't respond to my email saying i was leaving school i hope you all learn to be good friends one day i know it 's hard when you do n't know what to say , but it 's still good to say something now i'm rambling
