i thought it would be a little bus but it was big too big for my almost yr old there were safety harnesses inside , just not what i was expecting today was nate 's first day at his new school he liked the bus and that was all he liked we 'll get there , just more adjustments nate , blissfully unaware that i was about the throw him under the bus sorry i could n't resist i set myself up to have a crappy day although i really did n't mean to i had scheduled myself to volunteer in jack 's classroom today long before i knew that nate would be switching schools today too and i did n't want to back out at the last minute so after i put my precious cargo on the bus and had a good cry , i went in to jack 's school and played what 's gnu with the kids it was kind of fun i finished up around , got home around and got a call from nate 's teacher at about she said that somehow the transportation people had only gotten a request for nate to be taken to school , not home i guess they thought he would hitch it ? so he was sitting there all by himself with the teacher i went to go get him and the teacher let me know that he cried most of the morning and only calmed down during snack that 's my boy we love our food i know it will get better this was just not how i wanted his first day to go did i mention that the sitter was n't able to come today ? so nate and i made calls together all afternoon some days i wonder what the heck i think i'm doing today was one of those days just felt incompetent all around the best part was when i was driving to get nate and the all christmas radio station started playing run run rudolph perfectly fit the theme of the day !
