in friday 's new york times there 's an article entitled pharmacists take larger role on health team the article discusses pharmacies that are expanding their revenue by adding services to their usual role of dispensing medication in addition to watching for drug interactions , pharmacists are recommending alternative cheaper medications to patients and offering life style advice for chronic conditions in some pharmacies they work with nurses to monitor diseases such as diabetes and hypertension as one pharmacist in the story put it , we are not just going to dispense your drugs we are going to partner with you to improve your health as well why is this happening ? business forces , of course once pharmacists did a lot more than they do now they used to manually make medications compounding pills and tinctures and unguents in a time intensive process now , they dispense packets of pills that are mass produced in factories that 's a lot of education just to stand behind a counter and fill a prescription the profession becomes more attractive when it is framed in terms of patient counseling and fundamental health care interactions also , health care plans will pay for it medicare pays to a minute for a medication management session with a pharmacist , according to the time story not bad one person in the story claims that pharmacists could do as well and better than a physician for less money this is a claim doctors hear periodically there are n't enough doctors to go around , so other professions try to fill the void rather than train more doctors , it 's quicker and cheaper to grant lesser trained professionals similar privileges there 's a standard rationale that 's given we 're not competing we work under supervision we know when to refer all of this may be true as a whole , but not necessarily for a given allied health professional supervision usually is n't on site , and it does n't necessarily mean that each case is being discussed with a physician the we know when to refer part should mean that there is a written policy or procedure documenting the limits of the scope of practice or the criteria that should trigger a referral to a physician and a means to ensure that those procedures are being followed all of this means that an additional layer of bureaucracy with its attendant costs will accompany the broadened scope of practice why do n't we just train more physicians ?
