today 's post may read like an ad for tweepi com , but i can assure you , i get no kickbacks of any kind from tweepi com i just happen to like their app , and i like it well enough to recommend it in fact , i'm willing to go so far as to say , if you 're serious about twitter and you 're not using tweepi com ? you 're crazy this is one over the top great tool there 's a free version and a couple different flavors of paid versions it 's all good you can get great utility out of the free version , and the company is on the up and up you do n't have to worry about them hijacking your account or letting anything bad happen i 've used them for years and have had nothing but a wonderful experience including great customer service when needed go ahead and authorize the tweepi com app and get started with the free version if nothing else , you 'll find tweepi is a tremendous time saver when it comes to finding , and then unfollowing , people who are n't following you back the app 's dashboard partial view looks something like this there are many other options these are just the top few buttons tweepi has a follow list option , for example , that lets you follow every person on anyone 's curated list of authors , top tweeters , special interest accounts , etc , and there are force unfollow tools that will let you gang block spammers and dubious accounts the list of features is extensive go check it out suppose you click the flush button you 'll be brought to a view of all the people who are not following you back click image to enlarge the columns are configurable if you want or do n't want to see a bio , or the number of friends followees the person has , etc , you can easily change the visibility of columns also , you can sort on any column and or filter columns in various ways to suppress non english users , for example , or not show users who have more than or less than a certain number of followers the free tool shows a maximum of tweeps rows of data at a time unless you tweet a marketing tweet for tweepi , in which case you get to see at a time but if you pop for one of the paid versions , you get to see or people at a time to unfollow people , just start clicking the unfollow buttons in the paid versions of tweepi , there 's a gang unfollow feature click one unfollow button , then shift click another one to click a range of buttons , but twitter made tweepi take the ganging features off the free version and probably do n't even know it 's still in the paid versions , but that 's another story if you get tired of click click clicking unfollow buttons , make yourself a little bookmarklet containing a few lines of javascript magic name of button class cl x button litebutton wrapper x btn action button inline block x component x btn text icon butts document getelementsbyclassnamecl for var i i ! butts length i butts i click alertbutts length clicked this code forces a click on each button , all in one go , so that clicking the bookmarklet , once , is all you have to do to click all buttons on the page technically not quite true for whatever reason , i find that in chrome and firefox , this code clicks only buttons that are currently within view onscreen maybe the dom is lazily loaded ? i still have n't figured it out it 's not such a big deal , though scroll to the bottom of the screen before clicking the bookmarklet be sure your bookmarklet code begins with javascript , which is a necessary part of any code driven bookmarklet you have to provide the javascript url scheme , or else the browser does n't know where to go you knew that , right ? i could write a book on how to use tweepi to manage your twitter account it 's a super powerful tool , it 's free , it 's reliable , and i 've used it to manage a very large twitter account with great success in only a few minutes a day i ca n't begin to calculate how much time and effort tweepi has saved me on that basis alone , i recommend it to you have you joined the mailing list ? what are you waiting for ? i want to thank the following great tweeps for retweeting me yesterday click into these profile pics and follow these people on twitter ! they retweet !
