hey there ! hope you all had a great weekend ! ours was splendid as we spent most of it babysitting our month old niece she was such a sweetie and a bundle of energy ! it was amazing to realize paige will be doing all those things in another year we even managed to get an impromptu picture of paige with santa claus while getting some shopping done yesterday there was no line to see santa and we thought what the heck ? so , we have a great cliche photo of paige staring at the camera with the classic deer in the headlights expression as santa smiles away she happened to have on her red and cream deer winter sweater on so she looked very holiday it 's her first christmas , so i felt the need to indulge in the santa experience especially when there was no line to suffer in ! i was thinking about all the activities i do to keep paige occupied during the day or the fact that i need to think of more i wrote about this in an earlier post for when we do n't have mommy group or errands and i came up with new ideas to add to my arsenal ! the activities i 've done with my month old have been looking at books and reading them aloud , playing with paige and her toys , allowing her to play with her toys alone , letting paige slither all around the living room rug her version of crawling so far , jumping and playing with the toys on her jumperoo , going for walks , singing songs nursery rhymes like itsy bitsy spider and others where i make up arm movements to keep her interested , baby einstein dvd watching , time for standing while i hold her waist , time for sitting up while i guard her from falling lots of time doing this lately , time in front of the mirror where i make funny faces and entertain her , trying new foods , going around the house as i point out and name things , and today i 've added dance party where i play jack johnson music or other fun music that i dance all around the room while holding her i swing her left and right and we fly in a circle and i dip her ballroom dance style it 's a great workout for me and fun for her so , we do that for a bunch of songs and i found this fabulous website called kneebouncers that offers a whole bunch of games for infants to play they just involve baby sitting in your lap and they hit any old button on the keyboard to make things happen on the screen there are lots of different games that are basically cause and effect since something fun happens when baby hits a key when i 've done all other options , i do this with paige and she really enjoys seeing the bright colors and cute animations sounds find the website here enjoy ! save you might also like a miracle ! play kitchen toys ! linkwithin
