maybe i am living one day at a time maybe i'm actually accomplishing that goal i talk the talk my intent is to walk the walk but how do i really know ? is there proof ? yesterday , i mentioned that i was feeling better my friend indicated she was pleased then she noted that this most recent downturn did n't seem to last as long as some previous episodes what was it , maybe weeks , she asked ? two to three weeks ? ! i was astonished i thought it had been days ! was it that long ? it was n't that long , was it , i asked incredulously ? it was i checked my blog it was about weeks so what does it mean that i thought it was only days ? hmmmm the fact that it was weeks and not days may mean a lot of things it might mean i'm not very observant maybe it indicates my forgetter works really well , but my memory sucks perhaps it 's a sign of how low i got this time around all are interesting , viable theories if i look at it more positively , though , it could mean i'm actually experiencing life one day at a time forgetting the past and not worrying about the future i think i 'll look at it like that after all , when i feel like crap , one moment at a time is quite enough !
