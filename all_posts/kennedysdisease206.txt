on saturday , october , dr taylor of st jude children s hospital was the guest on our kda chat room as i reported earlier , a paper was just published recently and dr taylor joined us to discuss the findings and potential implications because of the length of the chat , i am breaking the article into two parts the actual paper can be read by following this link neuron the press release can be read at this link eurekalert below is part i of the chat with dr taylor part ii can be read this coming friday jpt we just published a paper that we have been working on for about years and i think out results have important implications for how we try to treat kd as many of you know , the dominant hypothesis in the field , not just kd but also other polyglutamine diseases as well , related to the formation of aggregates that may be toxic the question we asked ourselves years ago was how a single mutation polyglutamine expansion could lead to so many different disease for example , the mutation that causes kd is the same as the mutation hat causes huntington 's disease , but they are nothing alike in many of the poluglutamine diseases there are aggregates of the affected protein although i do n't think this has been formally shown in kd and the feeling has been that this aggregation is causing the toxicity , but since the diseases look so different , we figured there must be something about each specific disease protein the androgen receptor in kd that specifies what cells are affected in each disease the huge clue staring us in the face with respect to kd is the fact that only males are affected and we learned from several studies in that the basis for make specificity is higher levels of androgens in males and we puzzled over that for a few years , thinking maybe androgen binding to the androgen receptor ar promoted aggregation but that was n't what we found another thing that normally happens when the ar binds hormone androgen , testosterone , all synonyms for our discussion it moves into the nucleus of the cell so maybe nuclear localization was necessary for the mutant ar to do its dirty work and that turned out to be true ! but why would that be ? one idea was that ar was more prone to aggregation in the nucleus or ar was more prone to cleavage in the nucleus which might promote aggregation and that has been the placeholder hypothesis for many years now and this hypothesis has been he basis for treatment development strategies the idea has been to try and increase elimination of mutant ar by exploiting cellular protein degradation pathways and there 's no doubt that accelerating the degradation of mutant ar is beneficial it 's just hard to do outside a model system , but we got to thinking what is the actual target of toxic ar in the nucleus ? is hormone binding the only normal function of ar related to development of disease ? the more we thought about it , the les likely it seemed that simple aggregation would be sufficient to differentiate kd from other disease with the same mutation we decided to systematically evaluate every piece of ar that we could to see if any of them contributed to the development of disease to do this we needed to make hundred of different versions of ar , each differing by one or two amino acids but we also needed a system in which to monitor the effect of all these changes to make a mouse model of each , and evaluate the phenotype of each , was impossible for us it would have taken years we could have used cell culture , but i have limited confidence in cell culture systems for kd for a number of reasons , and it 's also a very non physiological system so we used a simple animal model that has been the workhorse of genetics for over years the fruit fly ! as many of you know , we introduced mutant form of the human androgen receptor into fruit flies and they developed hormone dependent neurodegeneration that correlated with polyglutamine length essentially , this is a fly model of kd this model captures all of the molecular events that are initiated by hormone binding and culminate in neurodegeneration flies are small , cheap , develop quickly , and have large litters , so we began making hundreds of transgenic fruit flies each carrying a slightly different version of the human ar gene this project was mostly conducted by my graduate student natalia nedelsky with help from lots of folks , most notably mara pennuto note part ii will be published on friday in part ii , dr taylor further explains the implications of their findings as well as discusses the two potential treatments asc j and igf based upon the current findings
