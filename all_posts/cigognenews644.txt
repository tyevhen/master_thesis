there are critiques of primal therapy as not having enough science behind it apart from the fact that we have done four brainwave studies , neurochemistry and physiologic studies , having done several double blind studies discussed in primal healing , there is yet another aspect to all this apotheosis of science before the observations of jane goodall and her seminal work on chimps in the field there were hundreds of statistical studies of chimps and apes but until she had living experience there was not much progress her work involved clinical observation and inductive logic and her impact on the field was revolutionary i think our situation is similar to goodall s we have done the usual statistical work but watching how it all works out inside human beings is critical further , seeing how we can reverse early traumas is of major importance we can see what causes migraines over and over again in our clinical setting patients come in all down and migrained and relive oxygen deprivation , leaving without the symptom we never suggested the correlation , we only observed and wrote about it we worked in the field , as it were this is not to deride science on the contrary , it is to state that science has many shapes and forms or in the case of high blood pressure , we watched it rise and fall with the reliving of early pain in particular , reliving anoxia or hypoxia and that the deeper we go in primals the more migraine and high blood pressure can be eliminated these are biologic truths , something beyond facts that clarify the overarching truths there are layers of truths it is possible to explore and relive more recent hurts but the migraine will not disappear until the prototype is addressed migraine , then , will stop occurring when the original reason for it has been experienced that is , during birth when oxygen was insufficient , engendering the massive constriction and then dilation of some of the brain s blood vessels this is the reason why it is so important not to have a personal agenda for our patient if we do , the patient will go to where we decide instead of where her biology dictates because once there is a migraine the system knows that we must address oxygen impairment they are tied together we will start reliving only related pains and finally descend to remote causes we don t have to decide anything her biology will decide for us but if we don t pay attention to this basic biologic law the patient will suffer that is , symptoms are related to specific causes not immediately apparent we are a therapy of nature , of following basic biologic laws , not an intellectual theory to be superimposed on patients we need to trust biology , not defy it we need to know that human need is the kernel of civilization and the jewel of any psychotherapy when we find need we will find deprivation and when we find deprivation we will find neurosis and when we relive need and its deprivation we will resolve neurosis
