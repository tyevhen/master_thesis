do n't crush my chips i loved the talk on root tech today about the father , hank smith , who has family rules on how to fight nicely do n't call names do n't touch so meone who does n't want to be touched no hitting , , , , etc and other famil y rules you can express feelings and use i messages you can leave the room , and then he took a bag of dorritos and said negative things to the bag then he squeezed the bag of chips and crushed a chip for every negative thing he said then he would hold the bag up and say the bag looks okay on the outside , but inside there are crushed chips people are like that on the outside they look okay , but inside they are hurting so they have a saying in their family do n't crush my chips when they feel hurt
