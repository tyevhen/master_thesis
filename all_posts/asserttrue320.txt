late in life , tolstoy wrote a number of non fiction works having to do with spirituality and christian morality these books eventually got him excommunicated from the orthodox church in probably no single work sums up the beliefs that got him excommunicated better than the kingdom of god is within you available online free , in several formats , here what are these radical beliefs ? tolstoy insisted on a literal interpretation of jesus 's moral teachings the sermon on the mount , in particular , specifically jesus 's injunction against the use of violence even in the face of evil tolstoy believed that when jesus said resist not evil and turn the other cheek matthew kjv he literally meant to practice love even against those who come at you with evil intent this , of course , has far reaching consequences it means no military service , for one thing tolstoy was convinced that only through the practice of non violence can the tide of violence in human affairs be ended tolstoy at work in his study , by ilya efimovich repin mohandas gandhi was profoundly influenced by tolstoy 's writings he read the kingdom of god is within you when it came out in and again , in south african jails , in the early s indeed , gandhi listed tolstoy 's book , as well as john ruskin 's unto this last and the poet shrimad rajchandra raychandbhai , as the three most important influences in his life when gandhi opened an ashram in south africa to house the families of imprisoned indian workers , he named it tolstoy farm the kingdom of god is within you is tolstoy 's definitive statement of his understanding of christian moral teachings it is a shocking book , even today , for many christians in that it paints the overwhelming majority of christians and christian leaders as hypocrites and perverters of god 's word it raises many interesting questions , such as who is the better christian , one who believes in the virgin birth and jesus 's resurrection but does n't practice non violence , or one who rejects the miraculous events surrounding jesus but accepts his moral teachings without modification ? the kingdom of god is within you will stir an inner dialog in anyone who reads it and on that basis alone , i recommend it
