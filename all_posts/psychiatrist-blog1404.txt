i'm not sure where i'm going with this story or even why i'm telling it i 've convinced myself that it 's okay to tell it , even though it 's a real patient story , and i 'll confabulate some details , but basically it 's true i have n't seen the patient in over ten years , i do n't recall his name , i'm not sure if he 's even alive it 's one of those stories , however , that sticks in my head one i think about from time to time , one that makes me wish i could tell it to the people it involves so john not his real name was an elderly , but not old , gentleman he laughed easily and found joy in many things he and his wife of years had many wonderful things going on in their lives he talked about his father who had come to this country from europe his father had very definitive ideas about how john should live his life and the rules were spelled out quite clearly as a young man , john had fallen in love with a young woman and he 'd wanted to propose his father disapproved and wanted him to put his education first the young woman married someone else and my patient met his current , and only , wife he 'd long ago lost touch with his first love , but he did know what had become of her she 'd become quite prominent in her own career and john knew that she still lived in town he had spent years thinking about this woman , feeling he 'd made a mistake , pining for the one that got away his wife was kind and attentive , and they got along well , but he 'd lived out his adult life quietly wondering 'what if ? ' and why is this a blog worthy story ? in fact , i 've wanted to write about it for years , i' m not sure what has quite stopped me so the patient told me his first love 's name i knew this woman she is the mother of one of my friends i did n't know her years ago , but in the here and now , she 's a cranky soul and , if you ask me , my patient is better off with the lovely wife he has the funny thing is that my friend 's dad is a lot like my patient i wondered then if i should say something what would i say and would it help ? i did n't , by the way i was afraid it might make things worse and that i would regret having opened this door it 's always a little awkward when my worlds intersect
