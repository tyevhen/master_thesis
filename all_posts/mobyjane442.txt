dear a b today i was driving my kids to camp and i was feeling sad and in pain like most of the time and i hated the feeling so much and then what came up was a very simple exercise from out of nowhere , counting people names with letter a , b , or what letter i wanted i did the exercise times and all the bad feelings went away and a joy came to me and i felt full of energy so is n't this good news that i am learning the away out of it ? e dear e what a good exercise ! you 're on the right track is n't doing an exercise better than suffering ? it is hard to pull yourself away from suffering it takes a lot of courage and even more important , to remember to do an exercise at all is a great breakthrough a b curtiss
