are you sleepwalking through life ? is your first thought in the morning your dream of going back to bed that night to get through the day as quickly and painlessly as possible , in order to escape back into the realm of dreams that night , and forget your life as much as possible ? this is a living death going through the motions this is a life that is void of purpose from what is your purpose ? does this sound familiar ? this was my life when depression was kicking my ass i could n't find any purpose as long as my symptoms were knocking me flat i could n't see any reason for the excruciating pain often still ca n't when i am in the middle of it and that led me to see suicide as the only way out i did n't succeed i remained among the living dead for a long , long time my depression has not released me i am not yet free but i believe one reason i am now often able to withstand the ferocious attacks is because i have discovered a purpose this blog in a way , i'm now able to use depression 's own crippling strikes to strike it right back writing has always been an effective escape for me , but now i have you reading , commenting , and hopefully finding comfort in the very pain that transforms my keyboard you are not alone , and i am not alone i have a purpose , and by offering connection , humor , or support to you , i receive support , too how cool is that ? ! recognizing our true purpose what really drives us can allow us to make dramatic changes in our lives determining what one s purpose is and vowing to pursue it to the fullest can lead to a true renaissance in our personal and professional endeavors from what is your purpose ?
