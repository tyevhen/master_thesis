i'm posting this because roy fell asleep at the wheel and missed the xanax article on the front page of yesterday 's new york times in abuse of xanax leads a clinic to halt supply , abby goodnough writes about a clinic where they 've stopped prescribing xanax because to many people are abusing it goodnough writes it is such a drain on resources , said ms mink , whose employer , seven counties services , serves some , patients in louisville and the surrounding region you re funneling a great deal of your energy into pacifying , educating , bumping heads with people over xanax because of the clamor for the drug , and concern over the striking number of overdoses involving xanax here and across the country , seven counties took an unusual step its doctors stopped writing new prescriptions for xanax and its generic version , alprazolam , in april and plan to wean patients off it completely by year s end if you want to know how the shrink rappers feel about xanax , do read roy 's post on why docs do n't like xanax some of us it 's been our all time most popular post so i was a little not a lot surprised that this was news i 've worked in four public clinics i 've never seen a prescription written for xanax , and for the most part , the clinics where i 've worked have had a sort of non stated ban on prescribing controlled substances it 's not that benzodiepines and stimulants are never helpful , but in the clinics , the issues concerning abuse , and the drain on the system gets to be very hard , plus we worry that the harm these medicines can do will be worse than the problems they 'cure ' it 's very rare that i 've written for controlled substances , and i 've never written for xanax in a clinic , or seen a chart from another patient where xanax was prescribed i 'd be shocked by the article , but during the two weeks i was in louisiana after katrina , i did see many patients who had been on high doses of long standing xanax that were prescribed by docs at community clinics , so i know it 's done but you know , clinkshrink does n't like benzos at all , ever per the benzo wars , if you 'd like to hear us shriek at each other , and the rest of us shrink rappers do n't like xanax in particular time to wake up , roy
