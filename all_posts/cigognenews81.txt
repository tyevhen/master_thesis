this is the first of a series of articles i wrote on the difference between abreaction and feeling in therapy it is a crucial point in primal therapy the ability to distinguish between abreaction and a genuine feeling is an essential skill of good primal therapy the difference between the two is stark , but in practice it still can be deceiving feeling is the key to cure , while with abreaction there is no chance of getting well yet , despite this crucial difference , the therapist is often unaware of what is going on , and certainly the patient is equally unaware the insidious part is that abreaction feels like a primal , looks like a primal and smells like a primal , but is far from a genuine primal in clinical terms , abreaction is the devil because it does n't allow patients to get better they remain forever prisoners of their pain in an abominable , endless loop of hurt and hopelessness once abreaction sets in , it becomes a neurosis on top of another neurosis and it is unshakeable it takes months to even try to undo it the danger cannot be overstated we have now seen many patients who have gone to mock primal therapy and are stuck so badly in abreaction that it is almost impossible to extricate them from it if left unchecked , abreaction can even lead to pre psychosis and psychosis it is the job of the therapist to distinguish between abreaction and real feeling to some extent , that is a skill based on the instincts of a trained clinician and acquired by experience for some patients who are mired in abreaction , that skill can mean the difference between successful therapy and staying stuck in mock primals that lead nowhere the good news is that there are also scientific ways to know the difference we can often tell how if a real feeling has been resolved by changes in cortisol levels , vital signs and other biochemical indicators first , to avoid confusion , a definition is in order within primal therapy , the term abreaction means something quite different from its original meaning within freudian psychoanalysis in this psychoanalytic sense , abreaction is simply defined as the process of releasing repressed emotions by reliving an old traumatic experience on the face of it , that classic definition is close to what we would call a primal , although true reliving in our therapy is far beyond what freud had imagined in primal terms , abreaction has nothing to do with any genuine reliving experience on the contrary , for us abreaction is destructive to any feeling therapy because it becomes a defense against real feeling , as i shall explain in detail shortly i must emphasize that abreaction is a non feeling event it looks like feeling , often to both the patient and therapist , but there is a qualitative difference it produces awareness without consciousness , a difference i shall explore in detail in a moment to a well trained therapist there is a hollow ring to abreaction it doesn t smell right a patient may unconsciously use abreaction as a defense against feeling , slipping into crying the minute she lies down , or simulating a birth primal the key difference between abreaction and a true primal , of course , is connection , which takes place in a primal but never in abreaction before we delve into this , however , let me briefly review some of the basic principles of primal therapy these theoretical cornerstones provide the framework needed to understand abreaction as a deviation from a successful coarse of treatment gordon marshall abreaction a dictionary of sociology encyclopedia com july , http www encyclopedia com doc o abreaction html
