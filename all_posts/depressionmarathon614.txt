it is said , if you take the action the mind will follow it 's kind of like faking it until you make it it 's what i 've been forced to do for the past several days as best i can , i'm taking the actions in hopes that my mind will follow with the exception of yesterday , when i was dark and virtually catatonic , i 've been trying to put one foot in front of the other so far my mind has stayed put this will be a short post because i do n't want to whine besides , i 've not got much else to say my mood is low yesterday was long and solo i did make it to the pool for a swim , but just leaving the house brought tears to my eyes this morning , after some encouragement , i made it to an aa meeting that brought temporary relief , just enough to get me into the grocery store the tearfulness returned somewhere in the produce aisle i hastily made my retreat home again , i'm still trying to do the next right thing right now it 's laundry one foot in front of the other i wish my mind would get on board
