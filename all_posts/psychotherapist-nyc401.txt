you work in an environment that , overall , tends to be negative with many dissatisfied and complaining coworkers if you ca n't find a way to take constructive action to change the things that you and coworkers might not like , until you can make a change , rather than resonating with a negative environment , you can use your imagination to practice the bubble technique where you picture yourself surrounded by a protective see through bubble many of my therapy clients have found this to be effective , especially if they do n't have offices where they can close the door to take some time for themselves or if they work in a cubicle to use the bubble technique , you use your imagination to feel as if there 's a clear bubble around you that does n't allow the negativity that 's floating around the office to get to you although this might sound a little woo woo at first , after people get good at imagining this bubble , they feel a sense of relief to be able to delineate a space between themselves and others in the negative environment the importance of self care it 's important to be able to take care of yourself around coworkers who are habitually negative so you do n't become physically and emotionally depleted by them aside from the bubble technique that i mentioned above , many therapy clients , who tell me that they have negative coworkers at their workplace , have found other creative and effective ways of taking care of themselves the importance of self care some of them , who work in places where it 's permissible , wear headphones at times to listen to relaxing music and to make themselves less available when they know that a particularly negative coworker is around finding your own way of coping with negative coworkers will allow you to focus on
