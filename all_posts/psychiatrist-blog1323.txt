i'm going to tell you that i have n't found that treatment termination goes quite the way they say it should go in the textbooks by and large , my patients have n't had a pre defined end date where we process the meaning for months beforehand then stop , never to see each other again psychotherapy , i 've found , ends in a more fluid and phased out way without a whole lot of talk about the meaning of ending so people come in pain and distress i usually suggest they come weekly , at least until they feel better , and we continue with that until they say they 'd like to come less often , then we go to every other week , then monthly , then call me when you want to come in it 's hard for me to figure out my schedule more than a month ahead , so there are people who call when they do and everything is n't planned out , and there are people who finish with regular therapy session who still need medications and they come in for a session every few months sometimes , i realize that i just have n't heard from someone in a long time i think more about the people i'm seeing and not so much about the people i'm not seeing , so sometimes i realize after quite a long time that i have n't seen someone sometimes the pharmacy calls for a refill and this jogs my memory if i realize someone 's fallen off my radar , and it has n't been so long that i'm embarrassed to call , i call often this prompts someone to ask for an appointment sometimes i hear that all is well and they 're fine once in a while , i do n't reach a real person and i never get a call back if it 's someone i only saw briefly , i do n't worry about it people know how to find me patients sometimes reappear years later , some only come when they 're in active distress and the rest of the time they do n't want to talk whatever so every now and again , someone i 've been meeting with regularly and for a long time simply disappears they do n't return calls and i have to let it go no one wants to be hounded or stalked by their old shrink a couple of times , i 've had the sense that the disappearance is more meaningful than i'm done either they 've canceled a regular weekly therapy session to fade into the sunset , or they 've disappeared more benignly , but after years of treatment and no response to my i 've been thinking about you phone calls it 's unsettling to me i wonder how they are and i'm usually left with the nagging sense that something must have been said in the last session that was upsetting , but now can never be addressed oh , and i guess i can also wonder if they disappeared because of something on the blog
