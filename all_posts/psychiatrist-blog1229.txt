so i was bitching to roy what , me bitch ? and he responded with what does n't kill us makes us stronger or some version thereof roy , nietzsche , one of those smart guys said something like that they actually even kind of look alike one thing about being a psychiatrist is that most of us believe that what we do , or hope to do , relieves suffering we believe that the treatments psychiatry has to offer make people better and relieve their psychic torment sometimes they work , sometimes they do n't , and sometimes the remedy is worse than the disease francis bacon in medicine , the patient 's history begins with the chief complaint as doctors , we often view our job as being to address that complaint hopefully to make it go away often it is an ache or a pain , physical or mental and yet , our society clearly values growth through suffering what does n't kill us makes us stronger when we take away the torment , do we stifle the soul ?
