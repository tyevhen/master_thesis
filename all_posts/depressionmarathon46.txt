it 's a big day i have a date a what , you ask ? yes , i have a date believe me , i'm just as surprised as anyone an acquaintance i 've known for years called me out of the blue a few days ago he asked me out we 're going to dinner and a baseball game tonight i'm excited , and flattered , and scared to death ! my crisis of confidence began as soon as i hung up the phone with mister obviously , not his real name his call pushed so many fraidy cat buttons for me to name a few i'm not a girly , girl i have short hair i do n't wear make up i do n't polish my nails i do n't even own a dress i had a hard time even finding something sort of appealing to wear if i'm not in my work clothes , i'm in running gear or sweats which begs the question , what does he see in me ? do n't men like all of those things ? i know some men do n't necessarily care about girly ness , but the bigger fear dating brings out in me is one in which you all may identify depression i 've been thinking about it a lot over these last three days i feel defective depression makes me feel defective on some level i know i'm not , but that is n't necessarily going to be the opinion of everyone deep down , i guess i still struggle with feeling defective because of my mental illness i 've been battling the defective thoughts and trying to convince myself i'm actually okay for days now i 've been reminding myself mister would n't have asked me out if he did n't want to spend time with me and he 's certainly seen me in running clothes and a baseball hat more than once over these last several years but that deep feeling persists it 's discouraging and somehow i feel like i , of all people , a blogger and speaker attempting to wipe out the stigma of depression , i should n't feel this way and that thought does nothing to quell my fears , no matter how rational or irrational they may be so my worry thoughts continue , but i'm trudging through and going on a date tonight despite myself it 's my first date since d and i broke up over years ago i'm going to say a prayer before i leave , do my best to stay in the moment while i'm out , and above all enjoy myself i 'll let you know how it goes
