i was n't familiar with neal 's yard remedies until last summer when my mum took me into their covent garden branch as soon as i walked in the door i could tell it was going to become a brand i 'd be obsessed with i did n't go in looking for anything in particular , but as soon as i saw their vast array of lotions and potions , i just knew i needed something the sales assistant suggested i try their bestseller and all time customer favourite wild rose beauty balm , and boy am i glad i did ! up until this point , i was n't familiar with beauty balms at all , so i was intrigued when i found out it had a variety of uses ! this product can be used as a rich cleanser , gentle exfoliant or deeply nourishing balm ingredients include high levels of rosehip oil which we all know is the messiah of skin care combined with geranium , starflower , hemp and rosemary oil to help decongest and enrich the skin , restoring its natural radiance upon first look the product appears as a hard wax , however after contact with the skin , the warmth of your hands causes it to melt into a luxurious oil , one of the nicest aspects of this balm ! i can honestly say , this product has changed my skincare routine for the better ! not only is it perfect for getting every last patch of dirt and grime off of my face , it is extremely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished my favourite use for this little miracle is as an overnight moisturising mask when my skin is feeling particularly dry , i slather the balm all over my face and head to bed by morning , my skin is soft , radiant and feeling a lot less dehydrated aside from its traditional uses , this balm works great as a cheekbone highlighter , eyebrow tamer , lip balm , cuticle softener , spot soother , acne scar reducer i mean , it 's a true multi tasker ! ! however , at this product does not come cheap , but i do believe it is worth it and will most definitely be making a re purchase once i get through the rest of my current jar ! s b x related posts i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue
