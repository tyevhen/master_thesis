a few days ago i gave a detailed front to back tutorial on how to do a bit of bio hacking i showed how to quickly get the amino acid sequences for versions of the hsp dnaj heat shock protein , as produced by different organisms , then create a graph of arginine content versus lysine content for the organisms all bacterial and archaea the resulting graph looked something like this lysine and arginine mole fraction in the dnaj protein of microorganisms in this particular graph there are points , because i went back to uniprot and added more organisms to the mix , to see if the trend line would hold true the correlation actually got stronger r the graph clearly shows that as lysine concentration goes up , arginine concentration goes down does this graph prove that lysine can take the place of arginine in dnaj ? that 's not exactly what the graph says , although it 's a worthwhile hypothesis to check it out , you 'd want to look at some aa sequence alignments to see if arginine and lysine are , in fact , replacing each other in the exact same spots in the protein , across organisms certainly it would be reasonable for lysine to replace arginine both are polar , positively charged amino acids i should point out that the organisms in this graph vary greatly in genomic g c content the codon aaa represents lysine , and experience has taught me maybe you 've noticed this too , if you 're a biogeek that lysine usage is a pretty reliable proxy for low g c content if you check the codon usage tables for organisms with low gc genomes , you 'll see that they use lysine more than any other amino acid in clostridium botulinum , aaa accounts for of codon usage in buchnera it 's low g c means high lysine usage likewise , organisms with low g c quite often have a disproportionately low frequency of ' cpg ' dinucleotides in their dna much lower than would occur by chance the technical explanation for this is interesting , but i 'll leave it for another day suffice it to say , organisms with low cpg tend , by definition , not to use very many codons that begin with cg , all of which code for guess which amino acid ? arginine to see if the arg lys inverse relationship holds for higher organisms , i gathered up dnaj sequences for plants the results same idea as above , but this time using data for plants instead of bacteria same negative relationship however , note one thing the scale of the graph 's axes do not match the scale of the axes in the previous graph further above in this graph , we 're seeing a very narrow range of frequencies for both arg and lys fortunately , zunzun 's interface makes it easy for us to re plot the plant data using the same axis scaling as we had for our bacterial data by constraining the x and y axis limits , we can re visualize this data in an apples to apples context the plant data , re plotted with the same axis scaling as used in the bacterial plot further above if you compare this graph carefully to the first graph , at the top of the page , you 'll see that the points lie on pretty much the same line just for fun , i went back to the unitprot site and searched for dnaj in insects arthropoda , which technically also subsumes crustacea then i plotted the bug data using the same x and y axis scaling as for the bacteria same graph , this time for insect dnaj sequences the insect points tend to cluster higher in the graph , and much further to the left than for plants , indicating that the arthropods seem to like arg and do n't much care to use lys the moral , i suppose , is that if your diet is lacking in arginine , you should eat fewer plants and more insects
