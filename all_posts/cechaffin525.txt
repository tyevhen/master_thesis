i post the next poem for lkd , who has had struggles with faith as i have it may be minimalist , but for me it 's true , a sort of christian existentialist desideratum creed i believe in god the computer who programs the universe or at least keeps the trains running and in jesus the archetypal man who was doomed to suffer but prayed to get out of it just like i would and i believe in god the spirit when my hopes are crushed and an old friend calls out of the blue and i believe in the forgiveness of sins because punishment only makes them worse and i believe in life everlasting because its alternative , non being , i find inconceivable maybe my creed is n't what they teach in catechism , but it 's where repeated bouts of chemically induced suicidal despair have brought me i frankly admit that i have problems with the second person of the trinitiy if i read paul right , however , we no longer know christ after the flesh he 's become the universal christ through the holy spirit ever since the resurrection it 's supposed to be all about the holy spirit how , by yielding to the spirit we come to incarnate a portion of divinity ultimately that means loving your neighbor because it 's your nature , not as a moral exercise rob mackenzie noticed that i had lamented that poets did n't know the craft anymore and that few could write a sonnet in minutes he took the challenge and produced one in i produced the one below in ten go to rob 's site to play , or follow him to poetry free for all where a thread erupted is a ten minute sonnet like a two minute egg ? tectonic illusions arches and blowholes it is not the land that s being eaten here but sea bedrock is rising here , a great hand over hand extending northwest or roughly ten o clock the bedrock s hard to carve but harder still for the pacific plate to buckle under , submitting to the north american will it s lucky our state isn t torn asunder yet when you look out at all the dark islands with their tunnels , arches , and mysterious caves you d think the flowering meadow of the highlands was being assaulted as the sea enslaves things are not always as they appear the land is dining on the sea how queer ! i was at kilorat yesterday do n't know why i guess i'm still recovering the outer personality of my tootsie pop looks fine but its center is still dark the melic poetry tutorial is open for new students , see the link in my blog 's list of links references on request thine , ce
