i had a hugely happy moment the morning of october rd in portland , or the american foundation for suicide prevention had an out of the darkness walk to raise money for suicide prevention i had decided that i would start a team for the walk i called it wolf pack for life i thought maybe one or two people would join me , but our team ended up having fifteen people and over people donate to my cause my parents drove three hours to be there , and my sister even flew up from california just to walk with me the reason that this was such a happy moment for me was because it was a celebration of the fact that i am alive today these friends and family members had to go through so much worry and pain when they knew that i was buried in the blackness of depression and bipolar disorder thirteen or so years ago , i tried to kill myself every day for years at every moment i had to make that choice whether i would kill myself then or stay alive for a few moments or a day longer it was truly hell for me over the years of that darkness , i got help in many ways and slowly , slowly stepped back into life i can say now that i am happy to be alive ! and the openness i have about sharing my story is helping others what a gift ! so , as i walked with these people that loved me and were physically showing the joy that they have in my life , i was so touched and glad that i did n't die by my suicide attempts as my sister and i walked past the memory garden that was set up for people to put pictures up in memory of those they lost by suicide , my sister looked at me and said simply and earnestly , i am glad that you are not up there tears immediately came to both our eyes , and all we could do was stand there in the middle of the crowds embracing each other tightly the memories flooded us both , but the joy and relief washed over it all i can not live this life alone it is the relationships and journey together that make it worth it all
