the national comorbidity survey showed that among adult patients surveyed adhd existed comorbidly in percent of those with a depressive disorder , percent of those with bpd and percent of those with an anxiety disorder so i start taking adderall , a preparation of mixed amphetamine salts , and bam ! my crying spells stopped , i can stay home alone and be productive , and cleaning and organizing have never been so easy ! i thought having three trains of thought at once was part and parcel of my bipolar disorder now i think it is a symptom of add the paradoxical effect of speed on add and adhd is counterintuitive , but the treatment response is kathleen has always told me that i have a busy mind but now i can take one thing at a time , i can plan , i do n't feel so rushed and fearful over each new task like i did just ten days ago in my family of origin i was the worst of slobs , but because of my high academic aptitude i was nicknamed the absent minded professor although my parents noted unusual powers of concentration in me , i e i could read a book with chaos all around , when it came to cleaning up my room i was flummoxed and once i cleaned it i could never maintain any kind of order this was hard on my brother , with whom i shared a bedroom for years , as he was of an opposite nature literally one half of our room would be neat and the other a pig sty , i being the pig since to of children are estimated to suffer from adhd , that means that a bipolar child , particularly a male , has five times the chance of having the disorder lucky me ! i thought i could n't have add because , for instance , during my senior year at ucla i worked three jobs and maintained a full load and a average without difficulty , thinking this a sign of some level of organization , though in truth i was rushing about in an agitated depression , seeking anything to fill my mind with something other than my mind to experience a brain that mainly assays one line of thought at a time is an incredible luxury for me it is so much better than being driven by the chthonic winds of my associative whims my late daughter , rachel , who suffered mightily from add , always insisted i had it as well i think the girl was right , god bless her if there is a silver lining to this depression , it has to be the discovery of this other diagnosis all my life my chief defect has been impatience i always felt pushed , pressured to do things in the shortest amount of time they had to be done yesterday ! now i am calm my thoughts are not running ahead of me i ca n't tell you how surprised i am at this i thought my extreme impatience and fidgitiness were due to bipolar anxiety , not add now i think otherwise here 's a lesson i suffered manic depression without being diagnosed until the age of i suffered add without being diagnosed to the age of if i had been treated for both at an earlier age , god only knows how my life would have played out for one thing , i think i would have been better liked , as my impatience feeds into my critical nature so that i share my opinions too frankly and too often i 'll beat a dead horse until it 's powdered bone ! so if you have serious questions about your mental health , do see a competent psychiatrist even if you are successful by the world 's standards rejoice with me , provided this experience holds i have a strong sense that it will what will really be interesting is seeing those close to me notice my personality change maybe you ca n't teach old dogs new tricks , but you can get around it by giving them new drugs ! unrateable , ce
