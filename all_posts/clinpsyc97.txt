or so she said i 've written about key opinion leader , university of cincinnati child psychiatrist melissa delbello a few times here , here , and here one key point was she was quoted as saying trust me i do n't make much in regards to income received from astrazeneca for giving favorable talks for its antipsychotic drug seroquel i had missed that in , she claimed she was misquoted in an interesting piece on inside higher ed university of cincinnati spokesperspon puff said that delbello s comment in may that she did not make much money from drug companies had actually come in response to the reporter s question about how much money she was given for making a single , individual presentation her comment was misrepresented and then repeated by sen grassley added delbello i was and have been misquoted by the nyt the times reporter , gardiner harris , could not be reached sunday to respond to the suggestion that he had misrepresented delbello s comment puff also said that the implication of what sen grassley said was that she was disingenuous in what she was paid she has been completely open in disclosing her payments she s made complete disclosures to the university and its irb furthermore , she s made full disclosure to the senate finance committee additionally , dr delbello has disclosed her funding at all speaking engagements and she s disclosed in the patient consents of her studies i wonder if she has made disclosures about her company msz associates that senator 's grassley 's investigation claims was set up for personal financial reasons and well funded by astrazeneca also , does the above mean that delbello disclosed that she has personally received hundreds of thousands of dollars from astrazeneca and other sources in the consent forms for her studies ? i have to admit i'm pretty skeptical about that , but i could be wrong as far as full disclosure to the senate , grassley 's most recent findings seem to contradict this claim hey , maybe grassley is just making things up , so either delbello is being unfairly persecuted or her story is simply not adding up why am i making such a big deal about this ? well , such a gigantic hidden conflict of interest does n't exactly engender my faith , and delbello is a person who can take at least responsibility for the widespread treatment of children with antipsychotic medications due to her research findings that some claim support the use of antipsychotics in kids and her many marketing speeches for astrazeneca and others , the landscape for badly behaving children is changing , and likely not for the better , , pharmalot reports that the university of cincinnati is unresponsive to his requests for comment perhaps they 're going for the time honored tradition of remaining in silence under the belief that this publicity cannot possibly last much longer
