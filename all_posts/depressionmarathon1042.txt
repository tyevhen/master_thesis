the scooter crashed to the ground once he abandoned it just moments before he was racing down the path , his push foot flying forward and back he could n't have been more than eight i slowed my car to see what had so urgently caught his eye i assumed he was running toward something quite intriguing i was surprised when he stopped at a simple sign beside the path no motorized vehicles allowed on path that was his aim i watched with amusement as he jumped , and jumped , and jumped , each time tapping the top of the sign , just because he could apparently pleased with his success , he returned to his scooter and resumed racing down the path i smiled as he retreated from view what a simple lesson , i thought stop , notice the small stuff , and create success whether it 's tapping the top of a sign or getting out of bed today , anything can be defined as success does life have to be more complicated than that ?
