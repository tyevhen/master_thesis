hi ! i m aimee from http imnotdisordered blogspot co uk amy , has kindly asked me to write a guest post about being an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital to give some insight for those who have never been admitted i was first sectioned in when i took my first overdose in response to auditory hallucinations and i remember having absolutely no idea what was going on i d heard horror stories about our local psychiatric hospital and the police and hospital staff kept using terminology that i had never heard and didn t understand no one thought to explain it all to me in my second admission , i was sent to a picu for the first time a picu is a psychiatric intensive care unit and once again , the seriousness of this was never explained to me , i just remember being told that the doors were locked a unit that is meant for some of the most mentally unwell people was used because i kept escaping from the open ward and the police told hospital staff they could not keep looking for me every single time i ran that picu was where i met my first inpatient friend she persuaded me to finally tell people about my trauma and although i also had my first experience of seclusion a slightly padded room that you are usually kept in after needing to be restrained and sedated there , it still wasn t a particularly memorable experience my third admission was the result of a psychotic episode in which i d become completely lost and consumed with my hallucinations and delusions i was kept on a picu for about three months and i saw a lot of poorly people , one of which , assaulted me i was later told that this admission was used to determine whether i had psychosis from then early until summer , i never spent more than a month in hospital though i was admitted many times as i continued to overdose , self harm and experience hallucinations i was eventually diagnosed with bpd borderline personality disorder and on one of my numerous admissions , a doctor advised that my community team begin looking into a specialist hospital for me i didn t even know places like that existed ! the first hospital i was assessed for , refused to accept my risk and i remember thinking i m never going to get better no one will give me the chance then finally , i was admitted to a specialist ward in a private hospital , two and half hours away from home i 've been here for months now and as clich as it sounds , it s been a rollercoaster ! being an inpatient for so long has its positives and negatives probably the best thing has been that it s meant my doctors have gotten to know me properly which has meant they ve got a better understanding of things another positive is that because it s a long term ward , i 've made some amazing friends and i'm actually getting better because that s what this ward is for all of my previous admissions have either been about keeping me safe or trying to break my cycle of self harm , so no hospital has ever actually tried to work through the causes for all of this the two main negatives that i see are being away from home for so long and it s sometimes quite an intense environment to be living in there s always going to be some girls that do n't get along and i 've witnessed many arguments and even a few physical fights there s also the odd upset from staff when there s a lack in communication organisation or a let down but ultimately , i m so grateful that my funding was approved for me to be here this hospital has genuinely saved my life
