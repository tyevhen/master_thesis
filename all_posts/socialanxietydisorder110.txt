please help im very serious ? i am getting very depressed about it ? hi there guys , im a year old female and i m not very happy with my life i have absolutely no social life or that much friends i only have one that is sorta close to me and just several other acquaintances from school but i never hang out with them back in high school , i wasn t confident at all , infact i was extremely insecure , still am today due to my extreme shyness , i closed myself off from social events which required alot of interaction with other people i couldn t even do a presentation properly without shaking my hands or avoiding eye contact i don t have good communication skills since all my life i have avoided people ive never been able to hold a conversation or run it smoothly in social situations i always think too much in my head and then i get rush of anxiety attacking me and it just makes it worse ! because of it , ive been feeling down lately and my words always come out wrong i cant even express myself its annoying because people look at me weird and then its too late to explain in school its so awkard with my collegues because we always exchange these two words hello , how r u hi im fine , u ? and it stops there it makes me feel so horrible and i feel like everybody thinks im boring or something i have even closed down my facebook for the reason because i dont have any socialising photos in albums like everyone has and i dont want people to know so i always tell people its hacked when they ask me but i feel like they are suspicious of my life i think part of that problem lies with my parents my mom is extremely overprotective and very veryy strict her and my dad are just mainly concerned about my safety and just me succeeding in school every single day its a routine going to school , coming home going to school , coming home thats it boring life she doesn t want me dating anyone also i m not allowed to go clubbing and im years old ! she thinks something horrible will happen and she doesn t trust those scenes she just wants me to focus on my studies im studying to be a nurse just talking about these problems with my mom doesn t help and she never listens to what i have to say she ends up yelling at me and thinks she is doing what s best for me my dad is a bit reasonable and listens to me but he too thinks that clubbing isn t right for me so my weekends are never exciting , im always just at home having a non productive life plus i don t have much friends to have fun with moving out isn t an option either since im not financially stable to do it plus my parents help me with other fees which is my only advantage while living with them having a part time job and studying nursing is hard to do , so i don t work and my parents help me pay for whatever i need i feel that when i eventually move out , i won t fuction well in the real world or if im by myself since my parents have done everything for me i feel like im going under downhill and i have never had a boyfriend either i don t see myself as pretty even though people may say so i just dont understand why this is happening to me ? i feel like death is my option if this carries on for longer i seem to be the loneliest girl behind my mask and i cnt really hide anymore i feel like time is passing by me faster then ever and i wont be able to stop it and i feel like nothings going to improve why why me ? i really deserve some friends but i feel like people always misunderstand me for no reason when im nice to them , they just shut me off like they hate me ? i dont what to do anymore answer if possible , move out of ur parents house and break away get a job and rent out a little apartment also u should force urself to take a public speaking class , maybe this summer ? i know this is going to be super hard but the only way to get over this is by talking maybe start when u go to the store and ask an employee where something is then the next time u go out talk to people you don t know change is the hardest thing in the world and in order to stop feeling this way you have to force urself to try to communicate sources me ! i used to be just like you i am in the process of doing some stuff i mentioned above it is so hard but it is so worth it ! good luck question i dont have a social life ?
