when you first find out you have this rare condition , you often feel all alone in this world accepting that you have kennedy s disease is often difficult so it is natural that you want to reach out to find others that also live with the condition unfortunately , this is often difficult yet , it is important because it helps us move towards acceptance for many of us , knowing that others have this condition and they are surviving helps we also need to hear from the horse s mouth others with the disease that it is okay to feel the way we do often it is the spouse or a caregiver that makes the first inquiries and , when a person reaches out for support , they immediately run into problems they find there are very few people who have ever heard of the disease another issue is that it is almost impossible to find a local support group some place where you can talk with others that have the same condition is very difficult , if not impossible to further complicate the problem is your family doctor probably has never treated nor even even heard of the disease i had to educate three of my doctors so where do you go when it is finally time to reach out ? for me , it was the kennedy s disease association and its twice a month chats when i first joined the chat room i found it difficult to open up i wanted to come across as being strong i can handle it because i had not totally come to grips with what having this condition means what i found in those first few chats were others , just like me , that were seeking answers and support as they moved towards acceptance they were also looking for a place they could express their concerns and fears without alarming the rest of the family and , most importantly , i wanted to hear from doctors and researchers that there was the possibility of hope for a treatment or cure today , i am probably considered an old salt a navy term for ten years i have been attending these chats and participating in the kda forums yet , these chat rooms and the forum are still important to me they are not only educational , but they are a way to help others as well as seek answers and socialize make friends i know that i am not alone in my quest i also know that others have found ways to survive and thrive while living with this condition called kennedy s disease and today , i just wanted to say that you are not alone
