i was surfing the ny times website and came across this article by ronald pies , a psychiatrist in the boston area dr pies talks about a wonderful nurse he worked with in the psychiatric emergency room and his surprise when he walked on to the inpatient one morning to find this same wonderful nurse , now admitted as a patient with a severe major depression dr pies talks about wanting to save his colleague , and recounts how over the course of an week admission , the patient 's symptoms did n't respond to two different anti depressants he later runs into the patient , now cured of his atypical depression by an outpatient doc who recognized his atypical symptoms and more appropriately treated the patient with an maoi an older type of anti depressant dr pies laments that he missed the diagnosis because the patient was a vip of sorts , that he did n't get approached in the same way , with the same freshness and thoroughness , that a stranger would be , and he refers to jerome kroopman 's book , how doctors think , as a reference for the celebrities get worse care phenomenon we 've talked about these issues here at shrink rap , asking whether docs as patients fare worse , and we even discussed a new yorker article by dr kroopman a few months ago here at shrink rap , we do it all i thought i should write a blog post about this nytimes piece there 's a lot to write about we could talk about atypical depression , missing diagnoses , the use of maois in treatment today , treating people we know oh but it 's august , i'm feeling lazy , i let it go and then today , i was reading clinical psychiatry news , kind of psychiatry 's version of a tabloid , and i saw a letter by the same dr pies he wrote to discuss how the term shrink is demeaning , how we should n't use it this , of course , inspired me to write this post , i'm still not sure what it 's about there are some words that feel very powerful , some that squeeze me shrink is n't one of them obviously i do n't generally refer to myself as a shrink except in shrink rap posts where it flows out pretty easily but when others do , i do n't cringe if it 's supposed to be a derogatory term , demeaning , hurtful or vengeful , laden with stigma and rife with belittlement of my chosen profession , none of that has jelled in my heart the term evokes nothing in me , it 's not what i feel when i hear people utter racial or religious slurs should it be ? did i miss something big ? i know roy is n't nuts about the term shrink clinkshrink , i'm guessing , has incorporated the word as part of her internalized identity i do n't know dr pies i wonder if he 'd like shrink rap , of if he 'd just cringe at the title , shun the three psychiatrists who use a derogatory term so lightly , ducks and all gosh , are we just a bunch of quacks ?
