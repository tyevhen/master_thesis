depression takes over the mind and the body the invasion begins in the mind , it takes away all of the joy we once felt for life , our favourite hobbies and interests fall down around our feet and we skirt past them in the days that i felt marginally better i longed for ways to maintain the high i ate all the wrong things , i 'd gorge myself on sugary things to get that sweet hit only to end up feeling terrible about my body image the low moods made it difficult for me to leave the house let alone exercise on a regular basis since then i 've managed to introduce some simple habits in my everyday life such as getting up at the same time each day , taking toby for a long walk or completing some kind of housework ultimately i wanted to feel like i had achieved something at the end of the day it took me a long time to stop comparing my day to those of others who went out to work in the city each day the things i do , i do for them and it enables them to come home and feel at ease or so they have a weekend free of housework chores i 've finally started to feel like i have a purpose i 've been afraid of failure for as long as i can remember , be it exams , losing a friendship or falling of the waggon whilst on a healthy eating kick whilst i was at university i attempted to do something to improve my fitness i started running in the evenings which helped for a while i could only go when it was really late , in near darkness and when there were very few people around due to my anxiety about other people seeing me it helped for a while until i started getting excruciatingly painful shin splints my pursuit of feeling fit , healthy and a bit lighter has followed my rising and falling moods doctors love to remind patients that exercise can help alleviate symptoms of depression unfortunately it is n't always that easy , it requires the right conditions i never felt able to walk into a gym , i was too self conscious and knew that all the effort i should be exerting on the machines would be spent feeling anxious instead , i opted for an at home exercise plan insomnia and teleshopping make for fantastic partners , or rather money robbing crooks ! i 'd be sucked into the paid for adverts displaying some fitness models and some real life examples of people using some fitness equipment or following a dvd and getting great results i 'd be convinced within minutes of the minute segment unfortunately i learnt the hard , and expensive way that you ca n't jump from not exercising in years to attempting a full on , intense exercise program i understand that some people are the exception , that they can achieve amazing results through commitment and determination sometimes there are those who have other factors working against us as much as i wanted to feel and look better i struggled to get past the warm up routine for some of the programs i attempted slightly disheartening it left me in a sweaty mess debating whether to sit down in the shower or just collapse onto the bed the key is to start at a low level , reduce your expectations , save time and heartache by choosing a lighter workout plan i like dvds that work through different levels allowing me to progress to a higher intensity when i'm ready even if they say you should graduate to the next level after days , only do it if you 're body feels ready i often get anxious about progressing to level , i worry that i 'll struggle with the new moves and that a slip will send me into a spiral that causes me to stop exercising for a week or more putting me back to feeling unfit panic not , watch the next level over and over until you understand how to do the moves , even take the time to practise them at a slower pace to familiarise yourself with them to summarise , my top tips are take your time to feel ready to exercise again do n't pursue an intensive exercise plan if you have n't worked out in a long time as excited as you may be to feel ready to get active again do n't set yourself up for a fall by pushing yourself beyond your capabilities developing fitness and stamina takes time , you 'll soon be breezing through work out moves that you initially found challenging move up the levels as and when you feel ready , listen to your body and do n't be disheartened if you see others making progress faster than you , you have n't seen their journey to that point , it probably took them a long time too ! feeling that rush of endorphins after exercising is n't always the norm doctors often talk about it as being fantastic for combating depression but i rarely feel the hormonal rush they describe focus on how you feel after the workout regardless of endorphins ! you finished it , well done ! you are a magnificent sweaty beast you are slowly but surely kicking your depression to the curb your body might ache the next day but we all know it 's a satisfying feeling start up a sticker chart or tick chart for each time you workout , it soon builds up and gives you an extra boost if you feel like you are n't getting anywhere
