thank you to anon who sent us a clip to this interesting article in the montreal gazette about all the fish in the st lawrence river who are being exposed to anti depressants though human waste william marsden writes in antidepressants found in fish it 's very hard , sauve said the question itself is quite interesting you ca n't ask a fish whether it is happier or not one of things they can do is use cameras to look at the male behaviour will it have the same behaviour in mating or feeding ? then you have to go back and look at its normal behaviour it 's quite tedious work and difficult quebecers purchase about million antidepressants a year that works out to about one in four quebecers taking one pill a day that does not include the amount prescribed by psychiatric hospitals hmm i'm not sure what to say should we be more alarmed about what the meds are doing to the fish and just how happy should a fish be ? or the idea that quebecers average a one in four rate of taking anti depressants ?
