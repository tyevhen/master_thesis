on the american medical news site , here 's an interesting article about a recent study about social media use by physicians according to a survey by quantiamd , nearly of physicians use social media , much more than the general public most social media use about is for personal reasons a third of physicians reported getting at least one facebook friend request from a patient , but most of these requests are turned down for me the most interesting thing was that only of physicians reported using a blog for professional reasons that seemed low to me not too much more to add , just thought i 'd put up a link to the article
