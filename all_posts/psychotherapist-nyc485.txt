coming out to your father as a gay man can be emotionally challenging in many families , there 's a real risk that you 'll be rejected i 've worked with many gay men of all ages in my psychotherapy practice in nyc who have struggled with this issue of course , i 've also known both gay men with heterosexual parents who did n't have a problem when they came out to them but if you 're on the fence about coming out to your father or you 've already come out and it has placed a strain on your father son relationship , you already know how emotionally challenging this can be for both you and your dad the following vignette is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality alan alan knew from the time that he was about years old that he was gay growing up in a traditional family in the midwest , he did n't feel he could talk to his parents or brothers about it and he felt lonely and confused alan felt especially worried about what his father would think if he knew alan was gay his father was a kind man , but he was also conservative in his values alan did n't want to be a disappointment to him when he was in his teens , alan tried dating girls , but he knew he was n't interested in girls he had crushes on boys , but he did n't dare tell his friends he did n't know anyone who was gay , so he continued to have a lot of questions about his sexual orientation until he moved to nyc to go to college , and he met other gay young men fathers and sons coming out to your father as a gay man it was such a relief to meet other young men who felt the same way that he did he went out on dates , but he was too afraid to get sexually involved with any of the young men he dated he kept his gay social activities a secret from his family he thought his mother might understand because she tended to be more open minded than his father but it was all so new for him that he was n't comfortable with his sexual orientation himself , so he decided to start therapy after we started working together for a few months , alan began to feel more comfortable as a gay man he realized that before he felt more accepting of himself , it would have been hard to come out to his parents to make it easier for alan , we developed a plan where he would start with the person he thought would be the most accepting and easiest to talk to alan chose his younger brother , who tended to be more liberal than the rest of the family and his younger brother was encouraging , supportive and happy that alan came out to him one by one , alan called his brothers and , to his surprise , each one of them told him that , even though they might not understand it , they loved him and wanted him to be happy feeling a little more confident , he spoke to his mother , who told alan that she had sensed from the time he was a young boy that he might be gay she was tearful and told him that she worried about him getting hiv alan told her that he had not been sexual with a man yet , but he assured her that he would be careful then alan asked his mother how she thought his father would react if he came out to him his mother was silent , and then she said she did n't know she thought that his father might need time to get used to the idea but she thought , ultimately , he would come around until then , alan 's experience of coming out to his family had been mostly positive he knew that coming out to his father would be the most challenging part of coming out as a gay man although his mother never pressured him about it , alan knew his father wanted him to get married to a woman , have children , and lead a traditional life rather than coming out to his father over the phone , alan decided to do it in person when he went home for a visit before he went home , alan had several sessions to talk about his fears about his father rejecting him this caused alan a lot of emotional pain before he went home , alan purchased a copy of the book , now that you know a parent 's guide to understand your gay and lesbian children , which is written for parents of gay children the original plan was for alan to have the talk with his father on his third day at home but the day came and went and alan was too afraid to talk to his father so , that night , he wrote his father a letter telling his father how much he loved him and how much he valued their father son relationship he also told him that he was happier than he had ever been now that he could be himself and he hoped his father would understand the next day , when they were alone sitting on the porch , alan handed his father the letter and asked him to read it his father hesitated , at first , to open the letter alan 's heart was pounding in his chest and his hands were sweating , but he urged his father to read it then , he watched a frown come over his father 's face as he read the letter , folded it back up again , and walked away silently into the garden alan continued to sit on the porch he felt numb and frozen in place he did n't know how to interpret his father 's reaction he was afraid his worst fears had come true and that his father was upset he watched the sun go down , and continued to sit in the same spot until early evening when it was time for dinner , alan 's mother told alan and his brothers that their father was n't feeling well and he would n't be coming down to dinner alan felt tears stinging in his eyes , and he decided he would pack his things after dinner and leave a few days early as he was packing that evening , he heard a knock on the door when he opened the door , he saw his father standing there , eyes averted , looking at the floor alan did n't know what to expect , but he let his father in they sat together on alan 's bed , silently , for what seemed like a long time then , his father spoke in a hoarse voice and said , i do n't understand it i'm going to need time , but you 're my son and i 'll always love you he reached over and gave alan a big hug then , he left before alan could respond alan left the book for his father to read he continued to work in therapy on his coming out process he realized that it had taken him a while to feel comfortable with being gay , so he knew it would be a process for his father too getting help the coming out process is different for everyone if you 're struggling with your own
