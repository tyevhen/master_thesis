the corpse the corpse was dragged into the public square where dogs fought over it , chomping on feet and rolling in the dirt to pull some meat from the unyielding body , lying bare bare because it had been analyzed by all the best minds money could recruit , who pulled its clothes off like some winter fruit and broke their teeth on them , and thus surmised the thing , though dead , maintained some special power , resisting all decay like a vampire , mocking the immortality we desire by its intransigence a steel flower the corpse s name ? iraq do you recall the wounds from vietnam ? double them all as i 've said before , i rarely write political poetry or polemical poetry , a bit of a contradiction , since once you become polemical your poetry nearly always descends to mere verse but truly , nothing has pissed me off as much as our new iraq policy since nixon went on television to justify bombing cambodia since a poet must write what he feels , i keep spouting these anti war poems i fear that posting one on a listserv i belong to had me removed , as it was perhaps too controversial but they have n't written me , i just get no further mail since i shared men in suits with them and this a men 's group dedicated to peace ! to that i say , fuck 'em i do n't care if you have a relative in iraq fighting to me , supporting them means getting them out let 's not spend time justifying our occupation as geopolitically necessary to say this , one must confront the chorus of , then our men died in vain not at all they died for our nation , but nations make mistakes they died believing , i think , that they were doing the right thing but military discipline allows for little freedom of thought , a necessity for the chain of command in battle , and thus suppressed by the military culture one needs an ideology to fight , if only us vs them i submit in iraq it is now us vs us and the democrats are blowing it they were elected on an anti war surge , and now they wring their hands about funding while the president brags on minutes that he 'll have the additional troops in place before funding can be challenged , and afterwards , congress wo n't be able to cut off funding because that would endanger the additional troops what self fulfilling poppycock ! and yet , it is true bush will beat them to the punch because the executive branch can move so much faster than the legislative branch i could go on but i 'll stop my anger is a good sign for recovery from depression coming out of a depression one often gets very angry anger is empowering , sorrow is exhausting i wo n't rate myself for fear of falling thine , ce
