i worked a few extra hours today , and things are getting better there i'm feeling a little more comfortable , but my confidence is still lacking i do n't like that , but i'm hoping it gets better as time goes on as well i do n't usually work on tuesday , my speed work day , so i had to get up extra early this morning to complete my workout it was a gorgeous , cool , sunny morning perfect weather for a fast run i ran x meters at around mile pace speed work is always tough , but as usual , i felt really good after finishing i'm a bit more motivated since running fast at grandma 's , as i now know i have the potential to go even faster i'm grateful to feel well enough to do the work i spent the evening volunteering at my track club 's track meet we hold track meets every tuesday for weeks every summer they are primarily for little kids we must have had more than kids there tonight it was amazing it 's so fun to watch the littlest ones , years old and younger , run or meters i like to hand out ribbons , which are given to every participant there was also an adult one mile event tonight i did n't run , although i probably should have , because i had already run hard earlier today oh well next year it was a nice , busy night i'm doing well my mood continues to hold steady , despite the stress of the new job i'm hoping to reduce , back to pre hospitalization levels , some of my meds my meds work wonders , but i always like to take as few as possible anyway , it 's nice to be feeling well it 's nice to have enough energy to run and work it 's nice to be a part of the community again i'm grateful to be doing well very grateful what more can i say ?
