accept endure by acceptance you de fang the monster of the mid brain who dwells in your very dna , the inevitable inheritance of the reptile within , which accuses us constantly of failure in our dark times depression is an evil in need of healing to accept evil is not to bow to evil to deny evil is to bow the devil cannot fool those who believe in him the chief human problem is not lust , or desire , as buddha averred , no it is imperfection , how we hold ourselves accountable for aspects of our nature ungoverned by will , how we punish ourselves for lacking the wisdom to avoid tragedy only after the tragedy has passed there is no predestination but living out our natures to suffer our brokenness is the ultimate acceptance , knowing the self that survives is the true self , undeterred by the opinions of others , immune to reputation , inured to criticism though always ready to examine itself if not mood impaired too many fail at suffering because they lack endurance suffering begs for the easy way out , whether by religion or a bottle of booze unendurable pain can be endured if not , the human body will pass into unconsciousness the worst part of suffering is fear fear makes pain more painful in its apprehension this is living in the future all we can bear is the present if we can endure the present for one more minute , we can endure for another , and stitching minutes together we can endure for as long as required in the case of a good man , suffering is rarely deserved to link behavior to just deserts is a fatal mirage , one that job shattered one must accept illogical , individualized suffering as no more than one s due in this life humility demands this blaming god for our suffering diminishes him blaming ourselves feeds our narcissism blaming others is futile , they are only agents what we can do is endure , when all pride is gone , when all options are spent , when suicide endeavors to seduce us with a false peace accept endure thine at kilobunny , ce
