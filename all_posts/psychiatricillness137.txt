my offer has been accepted , i have done all my sums and have the mortgage approved in principle i was really worried about my credit rating but it was in the top category ! this is the river out the back of the flat , my living room and bedroom over look the river ! i ca n't wait ! the flat is currently empty so there is no chain and i could be in as soon as the end of february ! i had an embarrassing awkward moment this afternoon i went to see the financial advisor to apply for the mortgage he was trying to sell me all the insurances he asked if i wanted critical illness cover i just said no and wanted to leave it at that however , he kept trying to sell it so i just said i would not be accepted for it he kept going so i said i had a medical illness he still kept going and wanted to know what type ! i said psychiatric but he just kept pushing ! ! ! in the end i asked what the problem was and why all the questions , the insurance is not compulsory , my mortgage had gone through with a top credit rating ! he moved on after that ! i spoke to my friend who is also a financial advisor and knows my history i discussed the insurance i have through work and she does not think critical illness cover is worth it given my history i have sick pay for up to months anyway and critical illness cover has a terrible reputation for not paying out i'm not worried about skipping this i will check my benefits at work and check i have the maximum benefit available through my flexi pay scheme they do n't ask any questions as it is done on a corporate level ! i am starting to imagine where my furniture is going to go , i hope i do n't get gazumped !
