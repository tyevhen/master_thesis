a phrase about love is thrown around a lot , that being we accept the love we think we deserve in my case i'm frequently rejecting the love i possibly deserve i'm often trying to convince robbie that he needs to find the receipt and get an exchange due to receiving faulty goods when i'm in a really bad place i 'll consistently do a few things i 'll eventually reach out to robbie , usually with some kind of cryptic message rather than saying i'm balling my eyes out , come help i 'll sob uncontrollably and almost choke on the amount of liquid pouring out of my face and saturating my pillow i 'll somehow choke out the words i ca n't do this anymore , it hurts so bad , and just let me die none of which are pleasant phrases to hear from the person you love there have been many times when i have pushed robbie away i say hurtful things because i want to protect him twisted logic i want to protect him from me , from 'it' when i'm in that state i decide that hurting him is the only way to convince him to leave me regrettably on a couple of occasions in the past i have physically pushed him away something which ended up causing me more pain all of this is to no avail what actually hurts him the most is finding out that i 've been suffering and have n't told him he only ever wants to help , finding out too late is what truly wounds him to all those suffering and still have loved ones that remain by your side , do not push them away their love should be accepted as resilient as they may seem , if you we continue to push them they may just let you defeat them one day learn to accept the love that is present in your life , the love you obviously deserve
