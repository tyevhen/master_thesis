one of the most unhelpful labels that a therapist can pin on a client is the so called help rejecting client or , worse still , the help rejecting complainer no matter how a therapist tries to qualify these labels by saying that he or she understands that the client is n't intentionally rejecting the therapist 's recommendations or that the client is responding this way out of fear , there 's no way around it , these labels are pejorative and damaging to the therapeutic work and i ca n't help feeling that using these labels is a way of blaming the client , making him wrong and making the therapist right generally speaking , clients who are referred to as help rejecting are often seen as finding reasons why interventions the therapist attempts in treatment wo n't work or responding to the therapist 's treatment recommendations with , yes , but no doubt , when this happens , it 's frustrating for the therapist and the client reconceptualizing the so called help rejecting client i think it 's time that mental health professionals reconceptualize these outmoded labels and begin to think outside the box better yet , i think we should retire the terms help rejecting client and help rejecting complainer in much the same way we retire certain baseball uniform numbers let 's agree to stop using these labels i'm not saying that therapists are actually calling clients help rejecting to their faces it 's more of a term used in psychotherapy literature , although i 've also seen it written about in certain therapy blogs for the lay public therapists need to be creative and think outside the box many people might disagree with me , but i think that even if a therapist never utters the words he 's a help rejecting client , just thinking about the client in this way has the potential to sabotage the therapy after all , if the client is help rejecting and the therapist 's job is to help , what 's left to do ? the client 's fear and ambivalence there are clients who are ambivalent about treatment and about making changes if you 've lived your entire life relating in a certain way and engaging in certain behavior , even if behaving in these ways has caused a lot of emotional pain , it 's scary to venture into unknown territory to change if a client is afraid to make a change , it 's up to the therapist to help the client to feel safe the old maxim of starting where the client is comes to mind this could mean that the therapist might need to get out of his or her comfort zone to try something different it could mean working in a different way from how he or she would this is why it 's important to have many different ways of working because therapy ca n't be a one size fits all endeavor it could also mean seeking a consultation with a more seasoned therapist in some cases , the therapy might take longer than the therapist and client anticipated at times , it might be frustrating for both the therapist and the client but the therapist ca n't go any faster than the client is willing to go engaging the motivated part of the client that wants help most people understand that , as human beings , we 're complex even when we say we want to change , there 's often a part of us that does n't want to change at all it 's up to the therapist to understand the part of the client that fears change and to engage the part of the client that came in wanting help at the start of therapy , the more dominant aspect of the client might be rejecting what the therapist has to offer but , usually , underneath the fear and ambivalence there 's an aspect of the client that wants to change but does n't know how after all , if a client spends the time and money to come to therapy every week , there must be some aspect of him or herself that wants to change or s he would n't be there therapists need to be creative gone are the days when the therapist can take a neutral stance with the client good riddance to the days when the therapist sat back and just said , uh huh , retraumatizing the client as he poured out his problems ! therapists need to be creative in their work therapists need to learn to be creative in their work to help the work come alive they need to be a presence in the therapy room rather than being neutral clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing there are many creative ways to overcome therapeutic impasses with clients who are ambivalent and or fearful about change i often find clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing to very useful in helping clients to soothe the part of themselves that fears change and connect with the aspect of themselves that wants to change talking about these aspects of self without helping clients to connect to where they 're feeling these emotions in the body is very limited talking about it often becomes an intellectual exercise that does n't lead to actual change helping the client to have a felt sense of these conflicting aspects of him or herself makes the therapy come alive in a way that regular talk therapy often does n't helping clients to use their imagination helping the client to use his or her imagination in an embodied way can open the door for the client to have a felt sense of internal and external resources to invoke helping clients to use their imagination over time , clients can learn to use these resources to have a corrective emotional experience that was n't available to them before at that point , the client has access to more of him or herself to do the work to make changes i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or send me an email josephineolivia aol com photo credit alicepopkorn via photopin cc photo credit h koppdelaney via photopin cc hoto credit adam swank via photopin cc
