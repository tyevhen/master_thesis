the sooner this year ends the better only in this year of weird health dramas hello , blowing a disc coughing in bed ? ? , only in this year would a routine viral illness , perhaps the flu , still have me down days later with no end in sight ! i 've already missed full days of work i actually did make it to work today , but i could n't do much , as i have not been able to talk for the last days that 's right , i can only whisper , and when you work with geriatric adults , whispering does n't get you very far i am so incredibly frustrated ! i'm feeling a little better , physically , but still quite uncomfortable and tired not being able to talk , however , really sucks ! it 's costing me money in lost wages , and worse , it 's very isolating i'm stuck in my house , alone with jet , and i'm unable to even phone my friends for support or idle chit chat i 've never been a big text messenger , but i guess i should start getting used to it like i said , it seems this illness has no resolution in sight i'm probably being melodramatic now chalk it up to exasperation this year i 've fought and clawed my way back from debilitating , months long bouts of depression , hospitalizations , a major back injury , back surgery , a four month absence from work , and a month absence from running after losing a majority of the strength in my left leg and core , i was just getting back to feeling strong and whole again and to top it all off , i'm a week away from my th birthday ! this is not how i wanted to celebrate i apologize for my negativity this is not the type of post i like to write , but i wrote it anyway i'm human i know this is a temporary condition i just wish it would speed up and pass my patience is wearing ever more thin words of encouragement , or wisdom , will now happily be accepted
