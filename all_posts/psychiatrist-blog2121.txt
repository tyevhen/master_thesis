posted by clinkshrink while studying for the recertification exam i came across some interesting relevant facts and figures in a mortality study of maryland prisoners , male inmates had a lower all cause death rate than the maryland general population correctional deaths from aids and other causes have also dropped significantly over the past twenty years , according to the bureau of justice statistics not coincidentally , this decline occurred over the twenty years since the u s supreme court mandated medical care for prisoners in the landmark estelle v gamble decision makes you wonder how much mortality rates could drop in free society if people made their minds up to commit to broader access to health care
