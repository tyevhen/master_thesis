do i really need to worry about hillary s emails ? yes she will be indicted informedvote wordpress com this is the single most comprehensive explainer you 're likely to read on the hillary e mail scandal , and one reason it 's such a compelling read is that it 's written not by a clinton critic but by a supporter and yeah , it 's hard not to get the impression that clinton is guilty as fuck of violating u s code but before you say she did n't do anything prior secretaries did n't do , for heaven 's sake do some research other secretaries had private e mail accounts , but no other secretary had a private server off site , in a basement , operating without encryption for months of course , the question of whether guilty or not she 'll be indicted remains moot some say the justice dept is simply waiting for the right timing whatever that is a more difficult question , given the facts of the case , might be how doj can credibly avoid indicting someone who so obviously compromised national security in such a blatantly negligent fashion the smoking gun here comes in the fact that foreign actors apparently did intercept some of clinton 's messages early in , before the secretary began using encryption it 's breathtaking , to me , that she ran a server , for several months , without a security certificate and without ssl capability the complete absence of it mis governance here is astonishing for more on the smoking gun , see the following was an asian government reading hillary clinton s emails in february ? wapo from the article there now seems to be a very real probability that hillary clinton rushed to install an encryption certificate in march because the u s intelligence community caught another country reading clinton s unencrypted messages during her february , , trip to china , indonesia , japan , and s korea again , it 's not so much a question of whether clinton violated the law she clearly did and it 's perfectly valid , imho , to ask whether obama himself was n't negligent in this situation as well it 's a question of whether , and when , she 'll be indicted , and how deep the rabbit hole goes and then there 's this beyond top secret hillary clinton emails used in russian court against ukraine pilot eutimes net more evidence that clinton 's server was , in fact , leaking top secret information to foreign eavesroppers how hillary loses politico com to fumble this , she only has to make a few key mistakes but guess what ?
