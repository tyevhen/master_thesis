whoa this pregnancy is zooming by with zest ! this poor little babe being the third i think he 's already getting shortchanged , especially in this space ! no pregnancy posts or bump progress shots ! that 's what happens when you are caring for two small children and working on a side business there just does n't seem to be enough time in the day for all the things i 'd love to do sigh ! things are progressing nicely with him i'm huge already just like my last pregnancies at this time , ha ! i waddle around and am already hurting everywhere ! i hope months will go by fast ! the kiddos are excited to meet this little baby they hug my belly , kiss it , and talk to it every day and it just melts my heart ! i was scared about the prospect of having a third child at the beginning , but now i realize i have other little ones who can help provide entertainment as needed i think you know what i mean , wink i already know what i'm doing and i do n't feel so alone like a deer in the headlights i have so much to talk about when it comes to this pregnancy and the time keeps getting away from me it 's been filled with a lot of emotional and personal drama that i never anticipated that 's what 's so funny about life , is n't it ? so many ups and downs and we navigate them as best we can despite all this , this entire experience has made me stronger than ever so i can be grateful for that even in my darkest trials , i feel like god is guiding me to the best outcome and i 've learned to trust in that i 'll gather my thoughts and share a few more posts on this topic soon as i think being transparent could help lots of other people like me i 'll see you soon ! ! ! save
