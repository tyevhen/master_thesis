in the january issue of the aapl newsletter there was an interview published with a well respected experienced forensic psychologist and correctional clinician , joel dvoskin he described correctional work more eloquently than i have ever heard before when i finished reading this , i kind of wanted to stand up and cheer to me the moral thing , the ethical thing , is not to cut and run it is to maintain one 's dignity and professionalism in the face of bad circumstances it is to understand the difference between reasonable flexibility and selling out it is speaking with honor and humility even in court about how it ought to be , and resisting the understandable temptation to sink into self righteous and angry denunciations it is protecting your own hope against all assaults , because hope is the most precious gift you share with your clients i think this should be framed and hung on the wall of every correctional psychiatrist 's office if we had offices
