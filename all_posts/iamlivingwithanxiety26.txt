today i will be on an airplane just a few months ago i would have dreaded the upcoming experience while i am far along in my recovery journey and would not have tried to avoid the trip , it would have been a very uncomfortable activity but i have learned that it will be just that uncomfortable not excruciating not unbearable just uncomfortable dr low frequently reminds us that we crave comfort , and when we begin to dread discomfort we develop a vicious cycle of fear and anxiety i now understand , through my recovery training , that should i experience chest palpitations , intense sweating , blurry vision , and other intense symptoms , i should accept them as merely feelings and sensations , which i cannot control i can control my thoughts and impulses i am often amazed by how quickly the sensations will dissipate when i do not work them up i acknowledge that i am feeling nervous about the trip today i am a little shaky and my stomach is jittery yet i am not concerned about these sensations because they are an average experience before i fly of course , i do not like them , but i m not letting them bother me they will wax and wane throughout the day , but by not working them up i will minimize their impact and proceed with my day in the past i would want to call someone to discuss my agonies for hours now i know that such a bid for comfort rarely resolves symptoms and , in fact , enhances them i am bearing the discomfort and fulfilling my work responsibilities i am moving forward in my recovery journey i am taking control away from anxiety and for all of that i heartily endorse !
