first , let me say thank you to everyone that sent me well wishes and good vibes for my trip to guatemala overall i am really glad that i went it was truly a trip of a lifetime that helped strengthen my marriage and my relationship with my kids the first three days were unbelievably perfect i had no anxiety whatsoever i enjoyed everything the land there is absolutely gorgeous and the people are so humble , kind , and hard working the food was delicious and i was eating soooo much ! i kept marveling at how well everything was going it was too good to be true it was awesome ! i was actually starting to think i may gain weight on the trip we had to do a lot of driving and by a lot i mean alot ! and the roads are constantly twisting and turning around the mountainside and i am prone to getting carsick everywhere we were going was at least an hour and a half away from our hotel so by day three i was so grateful that i was feeling so well and happy then came day i do n't know if i talked myself into it because of how happy i was , but i woke up with anxiety i was able to shake it off and still enjoy my day but everyday after that i woke up with anxiety until i got back home also , by day i started getting car sick which for me is a headache right behind the eyes and feeling nauseous so out the window went my appetite but i decided instead of letting it get the best of me i would just accept that this is my body doing its thing and i would just have to tough it out for a few days which i did i am glad the first few days were so amazing because i was able to experience what a vacation should be and looking at the silver lining for the rest of the time it 's good to be reminded that i can do hard things and that i can still enjoy life with anxiety if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
