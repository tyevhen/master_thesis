if you 've been following me on twitter , you 'll know that i have had my my first paid job ! i had been working there for a good few months and i did n't think i would ever get there having a paid job was the last goal on my hierarchy because i was just so petrified of the whole notion but , the way it worked out , one step after another meant to me that i just had to do it it was my final step for me , so i thought i had to go for it but i was petrified and i cried at least three times before even getting to the trial shift and even after the first phone call but i thought i had come far to even get the trial shift that i might as well continue it was n't as bad as i thought it would be because i learnt that people do n't expect you to be perfect and get everything right the first time round form my first shift itself , i was strangely more excited than nervous i 'll be honest that i was a little rusty as i had to take in a lot of information and for the whole hours , i was on edge , but i made it before i got the job i kept getting into a panic about the thought of it and i kept saying that i could n't do it and i just felt myself full of dread and anxiety and this was the way it was for first month of work i 'll be honest that the whole notion of a job was so overwhelming that it pushed me to the edge in the beginning i was doing way too many hours than which i could cope with and i got in such a serious and worrying mental state , that i knew i could either give up or do something about it , and do something about it is what i did i do n't know where the courage came from , but i phoned in sick and explained exactly why and what i struggled with and the necessity to reduce my hours , and as a result that is what happened i appreciated the fact that i was taken seriously , as an adult and as a human being my mental health is valid as the months passed , it did get easier and i was brought back from the edge and gaining in confidence the more i went , the more comfortable i became and the more i got used to it however , there were many a time where i cried during work , before and after as well having some breakdowns and panic attacks but , as this passed i picked myself up and tried again i now understand even more , that the things you think you cannot get through , you can ultimately , it took one bit of courage to overcome the anxiety but it was also something i had to give up because i could n't cope with the stress of final year university and a job and that 's okay even though i know i will still have anxiety getting my next job , i have gotten over the first hurdle which i never thought would be possible i feel that this was the right time for me to get my first paid job and now , it does n't matter to me so much what my other peers were doing in the past i am on my own journey it just takes that one bit of courage best wishes , amy xx
