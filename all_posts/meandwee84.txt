like i said the other day , i'm trying to figure out my artistic aesthetic and style i recently went on a shopping trip and realized a lot of the clothes i bought thanks for my mother 's day gifts chris ! seem to have a similar style that ca n't be coincidence ! so , i went around my bedroom and took a few pictures with my iphone of a few of my favorite new clothes , little color combos i like , and objects i love i 'll have to do this around the rest of the house ! i can definitely see a theme standing out yay ! here are some of the photos so you can see what i mean thanks for joining me and humoring me ! save
