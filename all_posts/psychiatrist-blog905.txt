this past weekend , in the heat of the night , lisa sanders , md wrote one of those mystery medical cases in the new york times magazine she walked through the puzzling presentation of a man with fever and a liver mass his physician friend was worried schumann was worried , too he lived nearly a thousand miles away too far to come and see his friend besides , the patient was posting all his test results for his friends and family , so schumann was following the case from a distance , and he still had no idea what was going on if he was the second opinion , then the patient clearly needed a third suddenly schumann had an idea what if they opened the mystery of his symptoms to other doctors ? what if they put his case on the internet on a blog read mostly by doctors and let some new eyes and brains work on this problem ? the patient was excited by the idea that afternoon schumann put the case on a blog glasshospital com he was writing and contacted kevin pho , who has a popular medical blog www kevinmd com , who then posted it , too within hours , a dozen comments were posted in response several pointed to a series of reports similar to this very case patients with large hemangiomas and persistent nightly fevers in several cases , simply removing the tumor stopped the fevers so like , how cool is that ?
