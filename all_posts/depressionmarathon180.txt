i'm happy to report that i'm now up to minutes of running at a time i returned to running november nd by walking minutes and jogging minute , five times since then i 've run times per week i 've slowly increased the running time , and pace , while decreasing the walking time tonight i walked minutes and ran minutes , eight times , for a total of minutes of running the highest number of total minutes i 've run so far is only minutes it 's not a lot , but it 's better than not running at all ! so far my right achilles is holding up okay it 's not perfect i can still feel some tenderness , which is a little discouraging , but i'm not having any pain , which is encouraging i'm hopeful i 'll be able to continue progressing without re injuring it in fact , i'm so hopeful i 've already signed up for grandmas marathon in june , it 's a long way off , so i have plenty of time to be patient and advance slowly patience , however , is not my best quality i 'll do my best in other news , work continues to go well my brain gets a little mushy toward the end of a long day , and i'm tired when i get home , but so far i'm tolerating the schedule fairly well could i tolerate more ? that is the current question , as my employer wants to make this a permanent gig i am currently an on call employee i control my schedule i usually work less than hours per week i 've worked on call or part time ever since i returned to work after getting sick years ago the primary benefit is being able to decide where , when and for how many hours i work but i do n't have any benefits i do n't get any paid time off and when the patient census is low , and the nursing facility is slow , there is no guarantee of working at all i do n't have a set schedule or guaranteed income now my employer is offering me a full time , at least hours per week , position i 'd have a set schedule and familiar patients i 'd have health insurance and paid time off and all the other benefits of full time employment but can i handle that ? the thought of it frightens me i'm not sure i 'd be able to do it they want me to decide within the next weeks so i could start in december it 's a lot to think about i 'd be giving up a lot of freedom , which comes in handy when i'm not doing well , but i might be gaining a lot of security and stability i really do n't know what to do there are pros and cons to each situation i 'll have to sort it out , but right now , i'm totally unsure and undecided it 's a great opportunity i just do n't know if i should take it
