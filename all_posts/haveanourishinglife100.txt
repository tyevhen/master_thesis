every catholic is obliged to follow his conscience however , your conscience is not your opinion your conscience is the quiet , inner sanctuary where you talk to god to determine what he thinks is right it is not , what do i think is right ? it is , what does god think is right ? janet smith when it comes to having kids , i had a lot of hesitations who am i kidding , i still do sorry for the lame pun who doesn t have even a little reluctance ? if you missed it , read wednesday s post on this topic after we got married , my husband and i prayerfully discerned god s will and decided to wait a few years the main reason was because i was struggling with severe depression however , even during that time , we were still open to life that means , even though we decided to wait , we put the decision in god s hands of the time god is god we are not he knows what is best for us and he will only give us what he knows we can handle a huge part of being christian is placing your complete trust in god in every aspect of your life including your fertility fertility is a gift , it s natural it s not a defect i did some research about artificial birth control and depression because my counselors and psychiatrists pushed me to go on the pill while being treated i think this is standard procedure you might be surprised at what i found the pill , the most common form of chemical birth control today , has hormonal side effects click here for a more detailed study on the pill if you don t have time to read the article , below is a short explanation of how it works and what it does to a woman s body chemical birth control stops a woman from ovulating because it supplies the body with imitation hormones that trick the body into thinking it is already pregnant if you re pregnant , you don t ovulate some of the time , however , the woman s own hormones win the battle and she does ovulate if she would then conceive while on the birth control , because of the inconsistent hormone levels from the pill , the uterus would not be able to support the new life , and she would have a miscarriage before she even knew she was pregnant that is why the pill is called an abortifacient it intentionally and directly causes a chemical abortion if by chance the woman would conceive the most common side effects of the pill are irritability , depression , weight gain , and low libido among many other more , life threatening side effects it s right on the label , if you don t believe me chemical birth control can either cause depression or make depression symptoms even worse isn t knowing this information counterproductive for treating depression ? it s like this example my doctors encouraged me to stay away from alcohol , a depressant substance alcohol could make my depression symptoms worse if i would drink alcohol while taking the medication , i would be , literally , cancelling out all the benefits i would receive from the anti depressant medicine i would be wasting my time and money had i not given up drinking so why then would birth control be ok ? in addition , psychologically and spiritually speaking , birth control takes away your trust in god by using any form of contraception , you are telling yourself that you know more than god when it comes to this topic if you are a christian , then you are going against your beliefs every day living with that kind of spiritual division is intense , whether or not you are aware of it so , what about the question of responsibility ? overpopulation ? women s rights ? third world countries ? wouldn t taking birth control be the responsible thing to do ? on the contrary , i would argue that taking artificial birth control is not responsible it completely takes away your responsibility by using contraceptives , your actions no longer have consequences no consequences , no commitment , no responsibility even in the context of a marriage relationship , all contraceptives and birth control methods diminish the sacredness of the bond between husband and wife i love you but god works with us , not against us he is on our side he wants us to do the right thing , but he is not going to do it for us you might have heard the phrase , god can t steer a parked car birth control is like trying to drive around with the parking brake on so , when it comes to having kids , we are completely placing our trust in god s plan these past few years , if he had decided to trump our waiting decision , then we would have known it was what he wanted only he can create a new soul out of nothing chromosomes from the male , from the female , but the soul doesn t come from either one of those the immortal soul is created by god at the moment of conception i tell you what it is way more peaceful knowing that god is in control not birth control practically implementing this belief is called nfp , or natural family planning click here to read more about nfp and if you want to read the catholic church s stance on this topic , read pope paul vi s encyclical letter , humanae vitae you can read it online if you click here and lastly , if you would like more information regarding how contraception if affecting our culture , check out prof janet smith s audio cd , contraception why not ?
