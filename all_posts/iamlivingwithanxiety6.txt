lately i have been reflecting on the concept of leadership in mental health when we re anxious , it s easy to adopt a woe is me attitude we often turn to others for comfort in my case , i would ask my loved ones the same questions over and over , seeking some sort of relief while irritating those who only wanted to help i thought medications alone would quickly relieve my symptoms i was quickly disappointed in essence , i was adopting a passive attitude toward my mental health i was hoping that outside forces , whether they be friends , family members , therapists , or pills , would relieve my symptoms and make life more bearable what i didn t realize then , but i learned later in recovery , is that anything meaningful in life takes effort and will power we celebrate high school and college graduations because it takes hard work to achieve those goals we don t wait around for a promotion to advance , we have to talk to the boss about why we deserve greater pay and responsibility with something as important as our mental health , we can t assume that things will simply get better or that others can transform our lives the path to sound mental health begins with self leadership on this point , dr low was clear for our symptoms to abate , we must practice recovery techniques to improve our lives i emphasize the word practice because information alone doesn t lead to meaningful change you can read about improved mental health all day long , but you will not get well until you practice techniques , deal with uncomfortable feelings and sensations , and learn to control thoughts and impulses to do this demonstrates self leadership the concept of leadership has been enormously empowering in my recovery journey all the tools for wellness are right with me all the time , and i have the power to improve my life friends , family members and , in some cases , medications can certainly be important adjuncts to one s own recovery practice yet to truly embark on an active recovery , on the path to wellness , one must embrace self leadership , let go of a passive attitude , and embrace change , despite the road bumps one might encounter along the way
