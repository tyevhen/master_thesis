view larger map it turns out that tom stafford , co author of mind hacks , is a rock climber he wrote a nice blog post about the psychology of perception and climbing entitled rock climbing hacks in this post he gives some of the neuroscience background to what climbers call 'route finding' , in other words the ability to pick out handholds and footholds as you go up a wall i really appreciated this post after this past weekend when i climbed to the summit of some of the best rocks in the mid atlantic somewhere midway up the several hundred foot rock i learned that my idea of a 'good' foothold had changed dramatically suddenly a good hold was any little nubbins of a protrusion that i could use to balance on my big toe and a 'good' handhold was one that i could hold onto just enough to stay balanced on my toes miraculously , it worked and i did n't fall pretty cool
