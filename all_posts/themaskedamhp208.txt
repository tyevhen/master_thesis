detention under section of the mental health act only requires one medical recommendation it should be used only in a genuine emergency , where the patient s need for urgent assessment outweighs the desirability of waiting for a second doctor code of practice there should be evidence of an immediate and significant risk of mental or physical harm to the patient or to others danger of serious harm to property or a need for physical restraint of the patient cop in years of working within the mental health act , i have used sec on only occasions and only once in the last years most of those took place in the early years of the act , when it was often impossible to get a second medical recommendation within a realistic time frame , especially in a rural area when hospital bound consultants would still say be a good chap and bring them in under a , and i ll convert it to a when you get here i ve written on this blog about the first time i used sec emma , posted on th july and the most recent time i ve used it mavis , th april here s another example william was he had learning difficulties and had been placed in a care home in our area for about a year he had a history of impulsive and aggressive behaviour , and this had been getting worse over the last few weeks he had assaulted two staff members and had been arrested , then bailed back to the home two days later , he assaulted three more staff members and was again arrested he had again been bailed , but this time the home was no longer prepared to accommodate him his consultant psychiatrist had arranged for a bed in a low secure private hospital and made a request for assessment for admission under sec mental health act one might have imagined that this was a comparatively straightforward assessment of a man with learning difficulties at least there was a bed sometimes a bed for a patient with learning difficulties can take weeks to obtain , leaving the amhp unable to complete an application because there is no hospital to put on the form , and sometimes having to obtain further medical recommendations because the first ones have run out of time but as i obtained more information , my heart sank firstly , the consultant had not actually provided a medical recommendation , and was not currently available secondly , william was not at the police station , since he had been bailed and the staff had picked him up and he was not at the care home , because they were refusing to take him back , and he was refusing to go back at the time i received the request , he was being driven round the county in the home s minibus , in the company of four of the staff it was the only way to keep him happy and prevent him from beating them all up so somehow i had to arrange for the assessment of an aggressive and impulsive man with learning difficulties and epilepsy and diabetes who was only being managed by taking him wherever in the county he had a whim to go , otherwise he was going to assault even more staff the consultant , who had seen him and who could have furnished a recommendation , was unavailable it did seem to be a matter of urgent necessity to admit him to hospital it seemed logistically impossible to get two doctors in one place at the same time as the patient , and would involve unreasonable delay so i arranged for the assessment to take place at the gp s surgery i contacted the staff in the minibus on their mobile , liaised with the gp , and we all met up in the car park within an hour of receiving the call the gp and i persuaded him to come into the surgery , where we interviewed him although he remained calm with us , this was probably more because of the novelty of the location , and the fact that he was supplied with a plate of biscuits he did , however , become touchy when asked anything about the care home , and we felt we needed to finish our assessment at that point with the gp s lone recommendation i made an application under sec and rang the hospital to inform them that he was on his way but that was too easy , wasn t it ? we re a low to medium secure unit , the admitting nurse told me we only take patients who are detained under sec or sec , or under part iii of the act relating to mentally disordered offenders what do you mean ? i asked i explained the situation to the nurse as clearly as possible , aware that , now william was back in the minibus and expecting to go to hospital which he said he preferred to the care home , he was again getting twitchy , because he liked to be in a moving vehicle , not in a car park if a patient has a lawful detention , i think it is immaterial what particular section they re detained under we ve never had anyone here on a sec there s always a first time for everything isn t there ? a sec was the only way i could see of getting him to a safe place once he s admitted , we can get it converted to a sec within hours this conversation continued for several more minutes at one point the nurse transferred me to a social worker i had a similar conversation with her , stressing that the longer the delay , the more agitated the patient was likely to become in fact , i was myself beginning to get an inkling of the agitation william might be feeling however , the social worker did seem to have a better grasp of the mental health act , and of my predicament , and eventually she conceded that a section was , essentially , a section , and he could be admitted and within minutes of william s arrival at the hospital , the consultant miraculously made an appearance and supplied a second medical recommendation
