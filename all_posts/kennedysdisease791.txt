this week the mda announced the awarding of more research grants of particular interest to those of us living with kennedy s disease sbma is the following grant testing a potential therapy for spinal bulbarmuscular atrophy sbma scientists at the university of michigan medical school in ann arbor are completing preclinical studies in a mouse model to establish the safety and efficacy of a new type of therapy to silence activity of the gene that is mutated in sbma below is the abstract of the research noted in the above announcement it should be noted that dr lieberman serves on the kennedy s disease association s scientific review board rescue of metabolicalterations in arq skeletal muscle by peripheral androgen receptor genesilencing giorgetti e , yu z , chua jp , shimamura r , zhao l , zhu f , venneti s , pennuto m , guan y , hung g , lieberman ap abstract spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , a progressive degenerative disorder , is caused by a cag glutamine expansion in the androgen receptor polyq ar recent studies demonstrate that skeletal muscle is an important site of toxicity that contributes to the sbma phenotype here , we sought to identify critical pathways altered in muscle that underlie disease manifestations in arq mice this led to the unanticipated identification of gene expression changes affecting regulators of carbohydrate metabolism , similar to those triggered by denervation arq muscle exhibits diminished glycolysis , altered mitochondria , and an impaired response to exercise strikingly , the expression of genes regulating muscle energy metabolism is rescued following peripheral polyq ar gene silencing by antisense oligonucleotides aso , a therapeutic strategy that alleviates disease our data establish the occurrence of a metabolic imbalance in sbma muscle triggered by peripheral expression of the polyq ar and indicate that alterations in energy utilization contribute to non neuronal disease manifestations
