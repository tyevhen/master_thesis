it 's hard to believe it 's been a week since i last wrote here sorry about that it 's been an up and down week , disappointing at times and encouraging at others unfortunately my mood has not changed much that 's been tough , challenging , and disappointing to make matters more complicated , i 've been sick with a flu like , upper respiratory illness for the last days , and it 's really knocked me flat at times nevertheless i have been a bit more active over the past week that has been encouraging i'm getting back into work i 've worked every other day for around hours today , i was actually busy for hours , which is the most i 've worked since getting discharged from the hospital a couple of weeks ago the low mood combined with the respiratory illness made working that long a little more difficult than i would have liked that was frustrating , but i think i would have handled it better if i had n't been sick , too i'm definitely not back into full form yet , but it is nice to be working a few hours again i 've also been running a few more miles recently , although i did miss a couple of days entirely due to my illness i shortened my long run from the scheduled miles to miles on sunday , but even was probably a couple of miles too far i took monday off to recover and came back tuesday with a surprisingly good miler i planned to run today , but the combination of longer than planned work hours , cruddy lungs , and rain convinced me to nap instead i sure hope to get past this upper respiratory illness soon it was tough enough motivating to run when just combating my low mood i really did n't need another obstacle like i said , i'm disappointed my mood is still quite low my mom has been here with me for two weeks , but she 's on her way home tomorrow it 's been nice having her here , but i am looking forward to having my tiny house back to myself my mom has cooked up a storm and filled my freezer with good food while she 's been here i'm not sure what to expect from my mood once she leaves i do know one thing , though , i wo n't have to worry about cooking i'm grateful my mom was willing and able to come stay with me hopefully , i 'll continue to feel and function better and better after she leaves
