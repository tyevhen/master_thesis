i found out about an inaugural marathon today it 's an inaugural marathon in nearby minneapolis unfortunately , this inaugural marathon is scheduled for may st i do n't know why i'm so tempted to run this race , as it likely would be a really dumb thing to do ! perhaps one obvious reason is that it is the 'inaugural' running it would be cool to be part of a marathon 's first running , especially a marathon which has potential , based on the twin cities marathon , for long term success another reason may be that it will be run alongside the mississippi river in minneapolis i e beautiful and finally , i think i'm just getting impatient i'm tired of running miles , like i did today , for nothing other than training i want to get to the marathon already ! it 's a long process to get ready for a marathon , and at this point it 's not all that fun racing would be a lot more fun ! besides , my thinking goes , i'm supposed to run miles on may st anyway why not run those miles in another race ? once i got to miles , i could shuffle my way to the finish , collect my inaugural bling , and go home sounds simple enough , huh ? of course , may st is only three weeks before my 'real' marathon , grandma 's and i hope to qualify for boston at grandma 's , a goal i will likely put in real jeopardy by running a marathon just weeks prior but then my brain thinks , oh , what the heck ? how big a deal can three weeks make anyway ? maybe i 'll qualify for boston in minneapolis ! i think my brain is getting too big for my head ! ! perhaps i need some feedback regarding these imprudent thoughts if i allow my brain to keep on a runnin' , i'm afraid i 'll be running on may st ! any thoughts , anyone ?
