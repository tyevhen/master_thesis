sometimes things just don t work out the way we want them to for example , a project i have been toiling over at work is not yielding the desired results i ve invested many hours in it , including many after the normal business day is over despite my best efforts , i can t seem to make the progress i want i was working myself up over this situation i wasn t sleeping much my mind was racing my mood was sour and i felt quite dismal just recently i spotted that i am trying to be exceptional , a condition dr low warns us to not try to attain i have an exaggerated sense of responsibility to this project although the results are disappointing , i must acknowledge that the situation , on balance , is average not every project i work on will have stellar results i am practicing internalizing these concepts , and for that i am endorsing i understand them intellectually , but my perfectionist streak pushes back i am reminded of the everyday saying of don t let the perfect be the enemy of the good although this situation is disappointing , dr low would remind me that such everyday trivialities are never dangerous with this in mind , i am finding some peace in the situation
