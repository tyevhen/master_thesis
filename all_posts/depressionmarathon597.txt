it 's my birthday wow , i'm getting old ! i remember when i used to think was so old ! now i'm a bit into my 's yikes ! i am blessed i have everything i need , but it is a little tough for me to get older i ca n't help but think about every year that passes , and what could have been , if not for depression altering my life i'm grateful to still be a living , active participant in life but i ca n't help but feel there is so much more i could be doing d and i had a conversation along these lines yesterday he is a real worker bee he is very career oriented and quite successful he 's been working , and working hard , for over years i , on the other hand , ca n't seem to work days in a row without having a meltdown whereas i used to work full time , i now manage only part time employment with success i 've tried working more , but i get overwhelmed , tired , and out of balance very quickly i want to work more i 'd like to be a whole lot more financially comfortable than i am i plan to work more i just do n't know when that plan will ever go into effect d and i both know this is a major difference in our lives we discussed it yesterday i worry he misses out on some of life by spending hours at work i apologized for some recent comments i 'd made which indicated just that i also explained why i no longer work full time i'm sure it is hard for him to understand i did my best to explain it , but for someone with as strong a work ethic as he has , i know it 's probably difficult to comprehend regardless , it was a good conversation covering something i think we 've both been worried , or at least thinking , about we 've had a nice time together this weekend it 's been so great seeing him two weekends in a row it will soon be three weekends in a row , as i'm going to spend christmas with him and his family next weekend ! we 've relaxed more and talked more this weekend , and i 've been happy last night we spent hours at bill and cindy 's house for dinner there were six of us , as my sponsor and her husband joined us for the birthday celebration as well bill and cindy made an amazing , huge prime rib meal everything was beautiful i was so grateful to be surrounded by so much love and that 's what i need to keep in mind this birthday not what i can no longer do , have , or be , but rather what i can do , what i do have , and who i can be i am blessed i have a life filled with satisfying work , people i love , activities i enjoy , and a lovable , loyal dog i have everything i need
