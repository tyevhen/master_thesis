my depression is a multifaceted illness emotions run the gamut from hopelessness to irritation to numbness the overriding emotion over the past days , however , has been unrelenting , discouraging and debilitating sadness i am just sad i 've been sad all weekend i ca n't shake the sadness i continue to receive treatment in my local inpatient psychiatric unit i had another ect treatment this morning yet here i sit , sad as ever the sadness permeates through me and from me it feels like it fills my soul sadness makes my movements slow , my speech limited , and my processing of information stunted it 's a little unreal the world is moving about me , but i'm existing in a weird state of suspended animation within it i'm praying for a lift in my mood i'm praying for some light to pierce the darkness i'm praying the interventions we 're employing make a difference soon i'm tired i'm tired of feeling slow and sad i'm tired of living in this artificial environment i'm tired of battling this illness with little to show for the fight success would be a nice change of pace eventually , the sadness must abate i 'd like the sadness to abate
