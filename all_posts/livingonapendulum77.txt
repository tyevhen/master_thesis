i recently went for my annual physical i should n't call it annual , cause i procrastinate as much as i humanely can and wind up doing it maybe every years or so , depending on how forceful the physician can be considering i had severe cervical dysplasia that turned malignant during treatment and they had to get aggressive to save my life , i really am the poster person for knowing the importance of getting a physical including the dreaded pap smear on a regular basis my cervical dysplasia has not recurred in about years or so , but that does n't mean it will never come back with a diagnosis of cin , which is also sometimes called carcinoma in situ , the dysplasia will be treated aggressively , since by definition all or almost all of the epithelial layer is dysplastic , and the next step would be cancer http www baymoon com hpvinfo library bldyspcin htm if the abnormality has progressed to the point where it has become malignant , the diagnosis is cervical cancer , and will go through a different round of evaluation and treatment for more information about cervical cancer , see that section of this site , or the information below http www baymoon com hpvinfo library bldyspcancer htm i know when i went a few years without a physical , i did become quite afraid that it might have come back and progressed to a higher level stage but it was only the fibromyalgia rearing it 's ugly head anyway , back to the physical usually when you go get a physical , it 's an annoying routine , you usually do n't expect anything to come out of it especially the way that my former doctor did my physical , she did not even bother with blood tests , just pap smear , weight , blood pressure and heart rate this time my physical was all inclusive , with the above mentioned , plus breast exam , blood test for everything under the sun being a new doctor he probably opted for the full screening as he saw in the imported file that i had complained about various things , checking my lung functions , asking a multitude of questions he had requested the blood test be done prior to the physical to he could have them on that day during the physical , he brought up the results of my tests he was somewhat concerned with the readings for my creatinine , sodium , chloride and potassium he asked me if i had ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease when he asked i thought he meant polycystic ovary syndrome i responded no both counts the answer is no , so everything turned out ok so he decided to sent me for another blood test to see if the results are repeated sometimes the results can be due to a mistake or a fluke we discussed my blood pressure which he wants improved and my cholesterol ratio was about , so he wants to see that improved too my ldl is ok , a little high but within normal range , however my hdl is a little low gotta eat more fish and not tuna my heart rate is which is pretty good for an old fat out of shape person ! ! ! as for the blood test , technicians do n't like me i have small , deep rolling veins on top of that , my hands and arms tend to be swollen lately the poor technicians have a really hard time finding veins in my arms , and even in my hand they tend to get rather nervous cause when they miss and have to restart it can get rather painful both technicians , the first one as well as the second one had a really hard time finding a vein poor things anyway , now i have to wait a month to find out if my kidneys are fine after all they probably are my aches and pains are usually related to me fibro and are all in my head , no reason for things to be different now well thanks for reading
