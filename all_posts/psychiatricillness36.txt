a dog , to whom the butcher had thrown a bone , was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go as he crossed a narrow footbridge , he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror but the greedy dog thought he saw a real dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own if he had stopped to think he would have known better but instead of thinking , he dropped his bone and sprang at the dog in the river , only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore at last he managed to scramble out , and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost , he realized what a stupid dog he had been if i am offered a new job tomorrow should i take it i feel miserable and isolated working for a large corporate company , i had an interview last friday which went very well and i will hear tomorrow whether i got it or not ! the company is much smaller , the job has a probation period and it will be a lot of work i have not done before however the people are more my age and more outgoing which would help socialise decisions decisions
