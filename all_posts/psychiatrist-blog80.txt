we talk about mental illness based upon a standardized set of symptoms , where the symptoms co occur in groups clusters syndromes in ways that enable us to cluster them together i e make a diagnosis , treat the illness we 've defined , and have some means of predicting outcome i e of people will have full remission of their symptoms within months we talk about these clusters of symptoms as being illnesses or disorders , and we look for biological correlates changes in brain chemistry , anatomy , metabolism to divide those people who have the disorder from those who do n't in the hopes that someday we will have tests to tell us who will respond to various treatments it would be very nice to get rid of all this trial and error medication cocktail stuff and just have a test that says meds wo n't work for you , you need tms , or no point in using an second generation antipsychotic , go straight to clozapine so far , no great breakthroughs in terms of either diagnosis or treatment predictability , but give it time so there was an article in the new york times on january nd titled is the drive for success making our children sick ? vicki abeles talks about how childhood stresses lead to illnesses , including ulcers , as well as more medical illnesses as children age into adults abeles writes stuart slavin , a pediatrician and professor at the st louis university school of medicine , knows something about the impact of stress after uncovering alarming rates of anxiety and depression among his medical students , dr slavin and his colleagues remade the program implementing pass fail grading in introductory classes , instituting a half day off every other week , and creating small learning groups to strengthen connections among students over the course of six years , the students rates of depression and anxiety dropped considerably but even dr slavin seemed unprepared for the results of testing he did in cooperation with irvington high school in fremont , calif , a once working class city that is increasingly in silicon valley s orbit he had anonymously surveyed two thirds of irvington s , students last spring , using two standard measures , the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale and the state trait anxiety inventory the results were stunning percent of students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression more alarming , percent suffered moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety this is so far beyond what you would typically see in an adolescent population , he told the school s faculty at a meeting just before the fall semester began it s unprecedented worse , those alarming figures were probably an underestimation some students had missed the survey while taking advanced placement exams okay , so wait , at least half of a group of students surveyed were moderately to severely depressed ? what about mildly depressed , and were moderately to severely anxious ? and the symtptoms abated when the stress disappeared ? this does n't make sense are our disorders illnesses brain diseases as some like to call them or are they part of the spectrum of normal reactions to stress , pressure , and likely lack of sleep ? in a clinical setting , i 'll tell you that sometimes it feels really clear cut there are people who get sick and they get severely psychotic , or they markedly change from their usual personality they shut down and lose their usual vitality and ability to function they are n't showing up for those ap exams they become so symptomatic that they become someone totally different , and there is no 'hiding' their illness in other cases , it 's not so clear cut people come in complaining of symptoms of depression , loss of interest , sleep changes , libido changes , suicidal thoughts , and any mix of symptoms that meet criteria for a disorder , and they attribute their distress to a given set of life circumstances but they 're functioning in their usual roles , and they are able to mask their symptoms the rest of the world may not know how badly they feel if they are coming to see me as a psychiatrist , they often want medications , and medications often help would they need medications if we could remove the stress ? often they say 'yes' but we ca n't make that happen maybe you 're thinking about school stress and pressure to achieve , but there are other stresses illnesses , financial burdens , divorce , family chaos which do n't go away by dropping a class or giving up tuba if the studies cited above are accurate and i did n't look at them and the symptoms are persistent , then this does n't fit with our idea of mental illness it comes to be about a normal reaction to stress , a need as noted above to change our environment , and a question as to what gives resilience to those few who do n't have symptoms
