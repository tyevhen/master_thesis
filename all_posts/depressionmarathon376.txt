after my sixth ect treatment in the last days , i got out of the hospital today my parents are here with me , which is nice they 'll be staying nearby for the next couple of weeks before heading south for the winter i wish i could say that everything is great , that my mood has returned to normal , but i ca n't nevertheless , i would have gotten stir crazy had i stayed an inpatient much longer it was time to come home being home is overwhelming the side effects of ect , namely loss of my memory , make getting resettled very difficult it 's like i 've been dropped into my home , today , with no background as to how i got here i do n't remember what sent me to the hospital again i do n't recall what my employer knows or does n't know i have to re read my own blog in order to understand how i made it to today it 's extremely unsettling to have no context for my own life ect stupidity is the primary reason i 've made the decision to discontinue ect six treatments is a fair course , anyway , but it 's the possible long term impact on my brain which really concerns me if ect makes me this stupid in the present , what damage will it do years from now ? nobody knows the answer to that question i 'd feel a lot better if i had an answer to that question in other news , i need to get back on the road i 've got the new york city marathon coming up in weeks i could not motivate to get on that damn hospital treadmill this week , so i have n't run since last sunday 's miler i 'll try to get out there for at least miles tomorrow we 'll see how it goes and now i'm going to settle into my favorite chair and watch whatever the hell i want on television it 's nice to be home
