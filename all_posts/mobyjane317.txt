dear a b i had an interview the other day and i was nervous about it somehow , after i met the woman who was interviewing me , i became even more nervous , and did a poor job of presenting myself i have thought of nothing else and am so embarrassed as a friend of ours recommended me what will she tell him about me ? she asked me a few questions and at one point i became flushed and began sweating i am so embarrassed i am normally outgoing and confident i am qualified for the position , but found the atmosphere and professionalism of woman my age intimidating how can i stop this and why does it happen ? thanks , l dear l probably the first problem is that you were not expecting to get nervous so you did n't prepare yourself and have some self support set up in case it happened and , second , it is human nature to get flustered now and then you can see how even politicians and commentators , who interview all the time , get flustered too public speakers sometimes screw up in front of an audience how can you stop it ? you ca n't stop being human if i were you i would chalk this up to every dog has his day and this was not my day and move on you can do damage control and get closure if you want by admitting to your friend that it was an off day for you , and you royally screwed up the interview and are terribly embarrassed about it forgive yourself for being human and move on it 's not the end of the world we all need to be humbled now and then so we realize that , as smart as we think we are , we 're just ordinary humans after all and there 's always the possibility that it was n't as bad as you thought but i have always found it more helpful to just figure it was as bad i as thought and go from there since there will always be people who are ahead of us or behind us in some way , all of us are subject to being intimidated now and then i can' t believe i used to find psychiatrists intimidating well , to be truthful , i used to find almost everybody intimidating because i was such a sucker for wanting everyone 's good opinion i got over most of this by getting in touch with my repressed fear chapter ten , depression is a choice i still can occasionally find extremely wealthy women intimidating in some ways because they are a part of the world i know nothing about , and therefore i do n't know how to maneuver myself around in a conversation and kind of hold my end up when the conversation turns to cruises that only cost , , african safaris with their favorite guide , and golf club dues that are a bargain at , a month etc i have to really struggle for some common ground where i feel some sense of solidity i remember talking to one very wealthy woman about my daughter 's upcoming wedding and how i was so busy with the different aspects , etc she responded that she would give me some advice as she had just finished with a very successful wedding her solution was to hire a wedding planner and just turn everything over then all you have to do is show up so i was a little nonplussed since my daughter and i were trying to hold down expenses and obviously my idea of the kind of conversation we were having was not going to go anywhere why did n't i just fess up that money was an object hey , i have some pride , too as for your interview , if you want something from somebody , usually there will be a tension set up that could escalate remember , we are a herd animal , and it is hardwired into us that for our survival we must be part of the herd so this can trigger no matter what , what always saves us , is if it is possible to just be ourselves but when it comes to job interviews , the world is not set up that way , and sometimes we have to put our best foot forward and impress people and sometimes we fail failing is honorable what is not honorable is never putting our neck out and not risking ourselves you tried and failed it is a time to both take your lumps and give yourself credit for putting yourself out there next time will be better because of this experience who knows , maybe you 'll be a better person for having to go through it and another way to think of it , it could have been worse you could have congratulated yourself on a great interview , and later found she was n't at all impressed remember , there 's no accounting for taste a b curtiss dear a b , thank you for the thoughtful response and so many options to consider i have taken comfort in that , at least , i did not do anything bad or immoral what is with my turning red and heating up ? i hate that most of all because it is visible that i am uncomfortable can i learn to stop this ? any herb supplement to de anxiety myself before something ? i can and should send the woman a thank you for meeting with me email should i say anything about the bad interview ? thanks again , l you can tell her that you had an off day and do n't think you were very impressive the turning red and heating up are the body 's natural reactions to stress chemicals the only thing to do about it is not produce the stress chemicals in the first place learn some positive affirmations and anti stress and relaxation exercises to calm yourself down when you first begin to feel under stress a b dear a b what would be your suggestion for a positive affirmation ? if i know it 's from you maybe it 'll work better thanks , l dear l i can do this my forces are with me
