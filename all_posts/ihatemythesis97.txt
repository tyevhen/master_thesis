taking a break from writing , i called a former colleague to chat among other flashes of juicy gossip , she told me that the company just hired my replacement and gave my coveted promotion to somebody else up until that point , i had been too consumed with the elation of quitting my job and the pressure of finishing my thesis to think of the sacrifices i made in order to graduate now , a wave of emotion hit me in the stomach it was n't sadness but loss , if that can be a feeling though i certainly do not regret my decision , it 's a reminder that whenever something is gained , something else disappears i wo n't think about the apparent illogic of departing from my true chosen career path in order to gain a sheet of paper that says i'm qualified to do something i no longer really want to do since it 's impossible to un jump when you 're already falling , the best way i can honor my former life is to get my sad self back to work due to anonyminty , i cannot reveal my degree nor my careerer path , but they do both tie together , just not exactly that is to say , while my degree does n't perfectly match my career , it 's not a complete waste of time thesis progress of pages written that 's only for chapter , the full thesis is much longer
