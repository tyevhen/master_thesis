i 've had an interesting day today it 's my day off , and i had lots of errands and chores to cross off my list i got up around am with great intentions but immediately knew i was in for a slow start i just could n't wake up i tried i ate breakfast and had two cups of coffee , but by am i was sleeping once again i slept from and then got up but could n't wake up i laid back down i slept again from and each time i got up i was overwhelmed with somnolence at i got dressed in my running clothes for my now long overdue trip to the gym getting dressed did n't help i did n't get out of my house until pm ! it was a bit ridiculous apparently my body needed rest today i guess i should be glad i had the time to give it despite the slow start , today has been a good day i'm having a little celebration right now i just returned from my first run in weeks i got on the treadmill at the gym with great trepidation , walked for five minutes , and then set the pace for minutes per mile that first mile was pretty tough everything hurt i think i was so nervous about my right calf seizing up that i was altering my gait and causing other areas , like my left knee , to get sore by mile two i had relaxed a bit and was able to run without pain i completed one mile segments with one minute walk breaks between each mile i ran and walked for minutes total i'm happy to report i'm pleasantly tired and still pain free right now i'm feeling happy and hopeful i'm hopeful i can get back on my training schedule , get back into regular running shape and start racing again i 've got grandmas marathon penciled in for mid june if i do n't get back to training soon , i wo n't have enough time to prepare i love grandmas i want to run it yet i'm going to try my best to take things slow , give my body a chance to adjust to training again , and hopefully continue to run injury free patience is not one of my best qualities , but i'm going to do my best
