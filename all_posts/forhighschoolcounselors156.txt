in our middle class world , we do n't think twice about using the terms mug , biscuit , or picasso in our culture , these words all have a common and benign meaning however , according to the book , gang related signs , signals and slang of modern gangs and organized crime , these terms have a very different meaning for gangs which is often dark and nefarious for instance , take the word mug in our world , the word mug represents a cup used to hold hot beverages , but for many gang members it can mean sexual intercourse , idiot , or identification of another gang member now take the term , biscuit a biscuit usually means a hot roll made from dough however , for gangs it often identifies a gun lastly , when we think of the term picasso , we see him as a vibrant painter , but for gang members it can mean a face slashing ouch ! the gang image portrayed by hollywood the baseball gang really ? for the majority of school counselors , we fail to understand the world of gang members or why someone would want to join a gang in fact , gangs do n't seem that bad on television or movies the first time i saw hollywood 's interpretation of a gang was the cult classic , the warriors this movie starred the handsome michael beck , as the gang leader of the warriors , who was trying to get his group back to coney island after they were falsely accused of killing cyrus , leader of the gramercy riffs throughout the movie , you have several gangs clowns , baseball players , women running after our heroes until they were finally able to prove their innocence and the real shooter was caught you never see what happens to the shooter and his gang , but intuitively you know they were killed at the end of the movie , former eagle , joe walsh , sings a top rock song and our hero walks off into the sunset with a girl he picked up along the way thirty six years later the film , the warriors , is still popular with our current youth in fact , while i was writing this post , i asked my teenage son where the phrase , can you dig it came from and he had no trouble identifying the movie also , a comic and a video game have been made from the movie however , the movie is not without controversy during the initial showing of the movie in , movie theaters had to hire extra security because youths were bringing guns to the cinemas after a showing in , three deaths were associated with the film and two of the deaths were gang related killings no cyrus , we do n't dig youth joining gangs violence off the screen the worst recent movie theater attacks gang film the warriors sparks violence hollywood biker fast forward thirty years to another gang related show called sons of anarchy soa the show is based on the world of the outlaw motorcycle clubs omc however , unlike real motorcycle gangs , the characters are suave , have perfect teeth , and have good hygiene in the soa series , the members are all white like most omcs and they are portrayed as cool and glamorous in addition , the show elevates the status of the one percenters or the small percentage of bikers who are involved in organized crime i e hell 's angels and mongols also , the series shows law enforcement as corrupt and easily manipulated by the bikers like cops need more bad press due to the popularity of the show among bikers and the one percenters , the national gang crime research center makes several predictions about how it can impact biker culture because the show glamorizes the one percenters , many bikers may be enticed to join outlaw gangs like the mongols real biker there is a chance that these bikers will simulate the soa identity and participate in crime and violence drugs and prostitution due to the simulation of the soa persona , these bikers may assume the colors of omcs when they ride therefore , they may be confronted by the one percenters as wannabes and become victims of gang attacks sons of anarchy although the warriors and sons of anarchy are creations of hollywood , gangs are a real part of american culture and a threat to our youth the fbi has identified several gangs in america that pose the greatest threat due to their involvement in prostitution , drugs , sex trafficking , pornography , violence , and involvement in terrorism dangerous american gangs history of dangerous gangs in america the rise of dangerous gangs in america began in the 's from the mass immigration of ethnic groups from eastern europe to the northeastern and midwestern us due to the lack of jobs and economic poverty in urban areas , youth consistently engaged in violence among ethnic lines overtime , youth gangs dissolved , but reemerged with the migration of african americans from the south interracial violence occurred when white youth fought to keep black youth out of their neighborhoods following the influx of african americans to the cities , a great migration of hispanics arrived in the southwestern united states it was during the 's that gang demographics changed in the united states with two thirds of the gangs becoming black and hispanic gangs came to national attention in when a white police officer pulled over year old marquette frye on suspicion of intoxication following his arrest , the watts community , in south central los angeles , erupted into violence with rioting by street gangs after the riots , the street gangs decided to organize under the black power movement which was eventually disbanded by the fbi from the lack of leadership in the black community , the youth in the south central los angeles formed the gang called the crips quickly a rival gang formed in compton area called the bloods and violence spilled into the neighborhoods since the 's , the number of gangs has grown astronomically to include over , groups who regularly recruit youth in the schools , neighborhoods , and online to keep their groups alive and thriving history of street gangs gang history timeline pbs crips and bloods reasons why youth join gangs although there is no universal definition of a youth gang , the national school safety and security services identifies four characteristics that must be present in order to be classified as a gang these characteristics include frequent interaction in the community and or school involvement in illegal activities common identity ethnicity , beliefs , interests common method of identification colors or clothing although we may not understand the reasons why students decide to join gangs , researchers have found multiple reasons researcher buddy howell says that there are multiple negative factors that push youth into gang involvement as well as perceived positive reasons that pull them into gangs these pushes and pulls are risk factors that make it more likely that an individual will join a gang and include individual factors include problem behaviors in schools , impulsiveness , negative life events , abuse , and victimization in fact , early aggressive behaviors in nd or rd grade stealing , lying , fighting , and blaming others can be individual factors that can predict push factors for future gang involvement also , researchers found that the availability of marijuana in the community increases the odds of joining a gang by early precursors of gang membership a study of seattle youth family factors can push youth into gangs the examples include divorce , family transition , disengaged parenting , inconsistent rules , and poor parental supervision school factors like poor school performance , low school attachment , constant suspensions expulsions , and labeling students as slow learners can push students toward gang involvement as they are looking for acceptance that they lacked in the school environment peer group influence or the association with delinquent peers can cause youth to feel pressured whether they believe the actions are wrong or right to act out their antisocial beliefs and separate from their mainstream peers community factors include poverty , neighborhood disorganization segregation , high crime , and marginalization can push students into gangs maslow and gang membership about half of the kids who display these risk factors do not actually join a gang , but just try the gang out to see how it fits however when a student has an accumulation of risk factors in multiple domains , the more likely the youth will be pushed into joining a gang surprisingly , students are generally not forced to join a gang , but are enticed by positive opportunities or pulls like money , girls , drugs , and power youth involvement in gangs usually starts in late elementary or early middle school when kids are between the ages of or the decision to join takes about months to a year with the mean age of initiation into a gang around age gangs on social media gang members showing signs on facebook although gangs exist in schools and communities all over the world , youth do n't have to go looking for gangs to be able to join a youth who lives in a school or community without the presence of gangs can merely go to facebook and type in gang slang to access a gang site many of these pages exemplify gangs who are involved in racial hatred , drug dealing , sex trafficking , pornography , arms sales and much more although these are public pages , one must know the terminology to find them buried deep within facebook since gangs thrive in anonymity , it is often difficult for the regular civilian to detect them in neighborhoods or schools since they are cyclical and ever changing , community and school leaders often do not recognize the signs of gangs in their schools therefore , they tend to deny or downplay their presence also , gangs thrive in environments where there is animosity toward authority and law enforcement , distrust , and lack of social order since the death of michael brown in ferguson , missouri in , gangs have used the disillusionment of the youth of the area to recruit new members their presence was noticed by civil rights activist delia bell powell who was interviewed by newsweek magazine the gang members who ve been here among the protesters are not something we

been a school counselor , i have had several students involved in gangs i want to share stories about two of my students several years ago , i had the opportunity to work with a gang member he was born into the gang and his family was heavily involved in drug dealing we never spoke about the gang , but i knew he was involved due to comments he would make about fighting other students for disrespecting him or his boys often , he was suspended for fighting , constantly hung out in the bathroom , and he was failing most of his courses when we would meet to discuss his graduation plans , his parents would never attend the meetings and he would change the subject to other topics often he would talk about his beliefs and philosophies like how the world would end when aliens attacked our planet , how his boys would take over the school , or how stupid the police and the administrators at the school were in their decision making however , he always came to see me and we formed a good relationship i always tried to encourage him to finish school and go to school to pursue his passion for cars during his last year of high school , he was expelled for drugs and was forced to move i am not sure if he graduated a second gang member was a girl who was initiated in the gang by sex she was a sweet young lady , but involved with a group of boys in another county eventually , she ran away from home and joined the gang full time fortunately , she was found by the police and returned home to her concerned mom being fearful she would return to the gang , her mother sent her to live in another state with relatives i asked her to email me and let me know how she was doing in her new school her involvement in a gang has made me more aware of girl gang involvement which has
