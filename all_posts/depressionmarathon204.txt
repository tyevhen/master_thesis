i'm up early as per usual here on the inpatient psych unit i'm waiting for my fifth electroconvulsive therapy treatment or ect last week i chose ect as my treatment option for several reasons ect has worked for me in the past , although it did n't work the last time i tried it during my relapse two years ago the ect procedure has changed it 's now done in a way that spares one 's memory and cognitive abilities , which have been major negative side effects of mine each time i 've had ect treatments and finally , the only other option seemed to be a major medication change i like the meds i'm taking , changing them and assessing whether new meds were working would have taken a long time i was way too miserable i could n't comprehend trying anything that would potentially take a long time so after careful deliberation , and consultation with just about everyone i knew , i decided to give ect another shot i believe i made the right decision after just two ect treatments , i was visibly better my slow movements and speech pattern had both sped up it was no longer exhausting just to breathe after three treatments , i had multiple visitors who could n't believe the difference in my mood and appearance i , too , noticed a difference i was beginning to feel lighter and so far i'm thrilled to report i 've had very little cognitive side effects my memory seems to be holding that 's been a huge relief the decision to proceed with ect seems to be paying off as i sit here awaiting my fifth treatment , i'm feeling a glimmer of hope i 've got a long way to go to get back to being me , but this has been a good beginning the doctors are even considering discharging me and allowing me to complete my treatments total as an outpatient going home is an appealing , albeit worrying , thought as well as i am taken care of here , i hate being hospitalized i miss my house , my dog , and my work routine but facing them all again at this point is a little scary however , i am feeling hopeful i'm hopeful i will continue to improve , i 'll continue to gain strength , and i 'll continue to gain the confidence i need to get back to my life the cloak of gray is lifting i pray it continues thank you for your prayers , my friends
