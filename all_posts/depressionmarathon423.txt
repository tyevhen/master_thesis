i 've taken lots of pictures of jet over the past months he 's months old now , and he seems to be going through a bit of a growth spurt he 's also a nut ! he 's incredibly curious and playful and he rarely tires he can entertain himself for hours by tossing a toy , a stick , or even a leaf around the room or yard after tossing it , he chases it , pounces on it , grabs it in his mouth , shakes it side to side , and then starts the process all over again it is hilarious to watch he 's quite the clever comedian he makes me laugh out loud multiple times each day i am so grateful we found each other four months ago here are some recent pictures looking handsome in my kitchen stalking who knows what in d 's backyard i'm not doin' nothing ! i interrupted jet while he was burying his bone notice the dirt on his nose wrestling with jet on the milwaukee waterfront , as d tries to get a good picture of us i lost the wrestling match , but the kiss more than made up for it !
