i 'll be honest , i ca n't stand it when i go to see a doctor about my mental health and the first thing they say to me is 'have you tried exercise ? ' now i know that they 're not trying to do any harm , but from personal experience and from hearing many other people 's stories , exercise is not the answer to a mental health condition in fact when you 're in a dark depressive episode and you exercise i do n't find that it helps me much , if i can even get out of the door at all however i have included exercise into my daily routine for a few years now and although it is n't a cure , it can make you feel a lot better i have found that exercise too much can give you the opposite effect of what you want it to have , but including exercise into your daily routine can make you feel more awake and happier in yourself , as well of all of the benefits inside that you do n't see what i do n't agree with is people thinking that exercise is the answer to all mental health conditions , because it 's not but i do think including it somewhere in your week will make you feel a little better exercise can be hard , but you can also make it fun and meet new people you do n't have try and be an athlete working at your own pace is good enough to feel the endorphins ! let me know what you think , amy xx
