this will probably be short i'm over at the home of my friends , bill and cindy they are making me dinner , which is so nice , because i 've eaten here for the past two nights as well i'm too whipped to make anything on my own , and i think they must sense that it 's nice to have good friends i'm whipped because i'm on my own this week , at my job , for the first time no other pt training me i 've got to schedule my own patients , figure out my own paperwork , and answer my own questions on top of that , i 've worked the past two days in a row while also trying to maintain this crazy training schedule i'm tired ! speaking of training , yesterday was a good training day , but a bad day for my bike i got up really early , am , to get to the gym for a strength training class then i rode minutes of my scheduled minute ride on the stationary bike after working hours , i rode my tri bike minutes everything was great until i stopped when i stopped , the distinct sound of air leaking hit my ears it turns out , not one but both tires were quickly deflating i could n't believe it i had n't ridden over anything visible i even retraced the last feet of my ride to look nothing ! now i know i should be grateful that this happened at the end of my ride , and i am it would have really sucked if i had had to walk several miles carrying a bike ! but with changing jobs , money is kind of screwed up at the moment , and tires are expensive ! oh well that 's the end of my pity party i 'll get them replaced when i can , and i 'll move on thanks for letting me vent onward and upward , i will move i have tomorrow off , and i plan to sleep well tonight tomorrow calls for a good interval swim and minutes of running the workout will be great , but the nap following the workout will be spectacular ! carry on , friends
