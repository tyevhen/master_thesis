tonight i learned that king george died when my friend bruce was in kindergarten bruce and i learned lots of other things about each other as well he was geeky kid , eats more than anyone he knows , and still has trouble sitting still i wondered why someone who ca n't sit still would become a psychiatrist so once a year the shrinks sponsor an event to schmooze with the state legislators just a way to get acquainted , and we 'd like our representatives to deal with relevant proposed legislation in a manner that helps mental health causes it 's a political action kind of thing , cocktails , appetizers , not much more last year i did n't go because of the lousy weather last year i was a little smarter this year , i set out in a car with bruce , my friend , my driver for the night , and we had already called one doc who 'd been sitting in traffic for hours still , we went election day the roads are a mess we set out at without traffic or ice , it 's a minute drive we sat we talked we changed routes we never got out of traffic this was the perhaps the longest worst traffic of my life ? it 's midnight , and since this morning i 've been in a n outfit that constricts my breathing okay , at pm , we surrendered to gridlock , sitting with the engine off , the bump from behind of the car that slid into us , the calls to check in with other shrinks in gridlock the first sight of food and we texted our surrender , then pulled into paul 's cafe they 'd stopped seating minutes ago so here 's my plug for paul 's cafe they listened to my quick whine about and a half hours in traffic i tried hard to look pathetic , offered us any table , great service , delicious stuffed shrimp , a fine glass of wine a five star shrink rap review and we two shrinks even talked about the blog and podcast , even if bruce is not a blogger , or even a wannabe blogger i did n't make the reception i did n't make it to the meeting that followed i did learn that the death of king george impacted a kindergarten child in the bronx it could have been a lot worse
