friday was my last official day at school years of education has finally come to an end and it 's the strangest thing for those of you who 've read my post on school , you 'll know that i 've had severe struggles with it who would have thought i 'd ever be writing a post about leaving school at the end of an academic year , rather than writing a post about leaving because my condition meant i had to i guess it 's an accomplishment ! but , it 's still weird to think i 'll no longer be looking out of my bedroom window unless i fail have to retake ! hoping that one day i 'd be able to make it to school , just like any other person it 's the weirdest thing and i almost ca n't explain it i spent days in turmoil because i could n't get to school and all of these past two years trying really hard to get into school only recently has it become easier , but just when i'm getting used to it , it 's time to leave years is a very long time and it 's difficult to write about it in so little words i suppose i could say that i 've learnt a lot , i 've grown as a person , there have been awful times , but there have been brilliant times and all of it i will never forget i know i 've missed a lot over these last few years , whether that be making memories or learning in lessons and even though it 's painful to think of it , i know that i 've got memories that i can cherish best blogger award ! i will never forget my teachers either and it 's true to say that most people do n't over these past couple of years especially , i have seen how much effort is put into keeping the school running and students going and i am extremely grateful my teachers have been amazing and i 'll never forget the support they 've put in place to help me through some extremely difficult times they , alongside my family and friends have kept me going if you follow me on twitter , you 'll know i tweeted about the 'best blogger award' friday was our leaving assembly and as part of it , various people were given awards a few months ago , my teachers found my blog and thus the award was given for blog writing , helping others and recognising my general struggle i really appreciate the thought i suppose it 's time to conclude this post well , it 's come to the end of an era and it has n't quite sunk in yet i 'll never have another lunchtime at school or a lesson , but as sad as it is and as fast as time is going by , this is the end of another chapter which i know i can revisit it 's so strange , as i remember the first time i met one of my teachers when i was like it was yesterday i'm now and i'm wondering where all of the time has gone it goes so incredibly fast if there 's one thing left to write , it 's that life is short and it does sound cliche , but it 's true time is incredibly precious and it 's stops for no man i hope that you spend it wisely and do what makes you happy if you find yourself in a difficult place at the moment , whether that 's in terms of mental health or not , please keep going i know you feel time is passing you by and you have lack of control , but you will get there in the end i spent many a day thinking that the only way to survive was to quit school , but i held on and i'm here now at the other side it 's true to say , i 'd never thought i 'd see the day thank you to everyone who has played a part in keeping me going over these past few years throughout school you know who you are ! it has been an extremely hard and without the support , i do n't know where i 'd be it 's true people really do leave an impact on your life and it 's important to cherish them until next time , amy xx
