pharmagossip has a link to a good review regarding how atypical antipsychotics stack up to their much cheaper generic competitors suffice to say the review is not flattering , though i 'd say it 's more positive toward the atypical meds than is deserved of course , i 've been ranting about these overpriced , under effective , and dangerous meds since the inception of this site in september we 'll see when the results of research will be able to override the drug reps , infomercials , er , continuing medical education , misleading journal supplements , and the like in other words , how much research must be published showing the atypicals are overrated before prescribing practices change and serious resources are placed into researching better medications for psychosis ?
