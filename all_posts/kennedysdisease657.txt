last saturday , ed meyertholen , the kda 's resident biology professor , was the kda 's forum guest as always , ed provides information in a manner that is understandable to almost any audience below are some of ed meyertholen s comments and answers to specific questions concerning crispr and irna research to read the entire forum discussion , follow this link http www kennedysdisease org index php provide support chat room transcripts chat room transcripts february i am not a crispr expert , but the technique has been quickly in the science view of quickly several years improving and it is expected that it will continue to do so i do not think we will see this in humans for a while years in kd , i can imagine there may be issues on specificity what cells to send crispr to , nerve cells or muscle or both and then one has to develop the procedures to specify the cells the crispr work is very new and i do not know if anyone is working on it in kennedy s disease i suspect that someone will be soon nonetheless , i think that it has great possibilities and i am usually not too optimistic what happens is that they use a virus that normally attacks a specific cell type like muscle , remove the dna from the virus and replace it with the dna needed to get crisrp to work the virus with the crispr dna in injected into blood , goes to the muscle cells and instead of injecting viral bad dna , injects the crispr dna the crispr dna then lets the muscle cells make the crispr proteins which then should and in the mouse , did alter the dna in those cells only dna in other than muscle cells is not affected kennedy s disease may give rise to other issues the androgen receptor the mutated protein is made in many cells and may have effects sexual issues , gynomatica sp , so we might want to alter the gene in other cells as well it has great possibilities but it is not ready for prime time yet this is the crispr paper http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed there was another paper from nih kurt 's lab where they used irna to block the synthesis of the mutant androgen receptor and found that the mice got better this is similar to work from laspada and from lieberman that had been published a few years ago these were done in conjunction with drug companies and i would not be surprised if there would be a clinical trial i think that there is one starting using the same technique in huntington 's disease now the other techniques with irna or iso 's are much closer to clinical use if i remember correctly getting to nerve cells requires getting past the blood brain barrier issues kurt 's paper is here http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed photo http www science ca images altman rnase jpg
