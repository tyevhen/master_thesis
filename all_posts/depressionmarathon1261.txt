do you ever have one of those days where it almost hurts to be inside your outsides ? where your skin feels like it 's one size too small , and the seams are rubbing in all the wrong places , and you just know there are blisters forming in very inconvenient places , but there 's nothing you can do about it ? and that makes it even more frustrating and annoying do you ever have one of those days where every word you speak is just shy of conveying the point you are trying to make ? where the descriptive terms you need have not yet been created , or you ca n't locate them in your cluttered mind , or even if you can , nobody seems to understand what you 're trying to say ? and you 're sure what you want to say is not worth hearing anyway , because every word out of your mouth makes you cringe with disgust and self loathing do you ever have one of those days where you want to shred your constricting , ugly skin and strangle your whiny , irritating voice ? where you want to run and hide from the ugliness that is you because one more moment of that you is going to make you puke , or scream , or homicidal do you ever have one of those days ? or even one of those moments ? i did i do last night and it is continuing today ick ick ! i guess all i can do now is pray god , help me get away from me ! i ca n't stand me much longer ! help me get away from me before i make myself puke ! not very poetic , but i'm not feeling very poetic right now , and i think it gets the point across do n't you ?
