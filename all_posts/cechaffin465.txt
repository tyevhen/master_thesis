today is john lennon 's birthday as the radio keeps reminding me i wonder if he ever went through the problem of owning his name my name , craig chaffin , is rhythmically equivalent to his a spondee followed by a trochee i do n't remember ever liking my name most of the craigs i ever knew were dorks think of how many famous actors , writers and musicians are named craig what ? you ca n't think of one ? my mother had two criteria for her three sons' names that they begin with 'c' to match our last name that they could not be shortened or easily turned into nicknames my older brother had his name , christopher , changed by common parlance into chris and irony of ironies , my younger brother , clay , had his name turned into dobey by his own family after the clay used in traditional southwestern construction craig alone went unmodified craig alone fulfilled my mother 's stated criteria why do n't i like my first name ? first , because of the echo of a sulphurous egg , whether the raw variety tossed on halloween or the easter variety that eventually turns rotten my mother hated to waste anything , so after dyeing easter eggs she would chase us down for weeks afterward trying to get us to eat our art when i mention easter eggs i smell not only the egg but the vinegar in the dye for these and other reasons i do n't like the egg sound in my name it 's that visceral and that simple , though i do n't mind eating eggs now and then maybe here 's a good place to post today 's sonnet , which illustrates the difference between poetry and verse , as it is merely verse owning my name you , craig erick , time to own your name you re running from its homonym , the sound of egg within the craig , the childhood shame of being called egghead , when friends would hound you with professor , brainiac and the like while you desperately wanted to be cool , so much you walked to school , leaving your bike at home since bikes were not as a rule you never cared too much what others thought but when you ran for president of your school you made up buttons craig the egg your plot succeeded for a semester you would rule also as quarterback , lead in the play until depression washed it all away my first name also feels or looks round to me , like someone with a lollipop for a head i call young anorexics like lindsey lohan lollipop girls because with their skinny bodies , round faces and big hair , they remind me of lollipops i think the open 'c' and the closed 'a' and 'g' contribute to this notion visually , not to mention the sustained ay of the vowel , encapsulated by the 'c' and 'g' curves pictures of me as a young child show a round head accentuated by a butch haircut the sound of craig thus has two negative connotations for me the association with 'egg' and the idea of a very round head enough craig for a day thine at one kilobunny , craig erick
