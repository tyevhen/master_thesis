i love poetry i have for a very long time from the time i was little my mom would read to my sister and i she 'd read everything ! fiction , poetry , the newspaper so before i was even reading books more advanced then readers on my own , i was writing poetry soon , i was reading and memorizing poetry when i was eight or nine i memorized all of the highwayman by alfred noyes , and wowed all of the parents when i recited it at a homeschooling talent show p last night , my mom and i got talking , and i wondered if i could still recite the highwayman i got most of the way through before i stumbled , so pulled out one of my poetry books to see where i was going wrong and once i had a poetry book in my hands , of course i could n't read just one ! i read all of the raven by edgar allen poe , which in my opinion is a great read aloud poem with a really cool rhythm to it , and the solitary reaper by william wordsworth the verse what'er the theme , the maiden sang as if her song could have no ending i saw her singing at her work , and o'er the sickle bending i listened , motionless and still and as i mounted up the the hill , the music in my heart i bore , long after it was heard no more is truly beautiful , as far as i'm concerned i also discovered i still know stopping by woods on a snowy evening by robert frost perfectly whose woods these are i think i know , his house is in the village though by the time i got to bed , it was am ! i also wrote a new poem last night , which can be found on my poetry blog as usual when i read the masters , my poetry just looks so awful in comparison oh , and yesterday my mom cleaned out a drawer , and of course my cat thought that the empty hole created by the lack of a drawer was the perfect place to hang out in minni is just so darned cute and lovable ! peace , idzie
