i have received a few emails asking whether i have my wheelchair yet and how i am doing with my writing today 's post will address those two topics plus a couple of others what happened to spring ? about two weeks ago , our temperatures were in the sixties and seventies i immediately noticed how good i felt again my left thumb and index finger once again functioned correctly leg strength was substantially better and i had far less aches and pain i tend to forget how winter temperatures take its toll on me until something like this happens unfortunately , this week we are having a difficult time rising above the forties my legs , feet and fingers are constantly cold everything i mentioned above has reverted to wintertime normalcy but , who is complaining fortunately , more signs of spring are popping up and blooming in addition , many of the critters that i follow on or around our property have begun the mating ritual perhaps spring is just around the corner i am writing again back in february , i wrote about my desire to start writing again well , i have been doing a lot of editing of older stories in my writer 's corner to help me get back in the groove i have also started outlining three potential stories the outline i am the furthest along with will be my third jason seaborne story it is a murder mystery with international implications jason confronts an old nemesis from his boozing days i have another outline about my teenage years initially titled , who would be out walking on a night like this ? it is a true story about a double date where the four of us ended up parking on a country road when a nasty thunderstorm pops up , we see someone walking towards us fighting the drenching rain and high winds another outline i have initially titled , living and dying at the sam 's club , will be a satirical look at what life is like for a certain sam 's club shopper still waiting for my chair well , it has been more than four months since my seating evaluation at emory and i still do not have my chair i just learned that all of the forms have been signed and submitted to my insurance providers for approval once approval is received , atg can place the order this process has been a real test of my patience in the past , i was spoiled by having a neighbor as a friend and medical equipment provider when i was forced to change providers , i lost that relationship and the entire process has moved forward at a snail 's pace the length of this process reminds me of the joke about a snail knocking on the front door of a house when the man opens the door , he sees a snail what do you want , the man growls the snail replies , i am starving , do you have any extra food ? the man , irritated that a snail has taken him away from the football game on tv , yells , no ! and kicks the snail off the steps and into the street a month later , there is a knock on the same door when the man opens the door , the snail asks , what did you do that for ? sunday 's guest post this sunday i have a guest post from stan highe he wrote a story about one of those changing moments in a family relationship as soon as i read it , i knew it was right for my living with kennedy 's disease blog it brought to mind some experiences that i had with my grandchildren as the disease progressed
