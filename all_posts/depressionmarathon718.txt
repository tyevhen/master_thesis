i'm feeling quite lazy today , and i'm okay with that although i started the day as usual with my morning meeting and a tempo run , i'm whipped right now i'm just up from my nap but still not awake nothing a little coffee ca n't fix , i'm sure i hope overall , i'm continuing to feel less sad , although i'm not going to go to church tomorrow maybe i'm being paranoid , but i do n't want to chance it i 'll go back again , but not tomorrow i'm enjoying feeling better , and i want to keep it that way tonight will be another test of the sadness after leaving an event issue i 'll be attending the track club banquet tonight i think i'm actually getting an award i believe another runner and i tied for our age group grand prix award it 's given to the top point getter first place points , second points , etc in a series of races run throughout the year it 's kind of neat to finish in the top three , although i am by far not the best runner in my age group ! by far i 'll be on guard for the sadness afterwards i'm three weeks away from the austin marathon now no wonder i'm feeling lazy i just finished three weeks of heavy training dah ! i'm looking forward to a lightening load of training from now until race day i ca n't believe i 'll soon be running my second marathon in three months , and then i have boston just two months after that i think the training has really helped me get through these dark days of winter i function so much better when i have a goal okay , my coffee is done i'm going to try to wake up and take puck for a walk he 's not a fan of my laziness but you know , sometimes it 's nice just to lounge after all the financial stress i 've been through lately , it feels really comforting to me today i hope all of you are being as productive or as non productive as you wish today take care !
