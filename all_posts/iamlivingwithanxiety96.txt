i am a perfectionist i'm not proud of this , as perfectionism is a basis for a lot most ? of the anxiety in my life being a perfectionist is exhausting , and i never feel fulfilled well , enough of that ! seeing the world through perfectionist spectacles leads to unhappiness and chronic negativity , as nothing is ever perfect enough this past week i 've been trying to dial down my perfectionist tendencies it 's not easy , as they are so ingrained in my personality and a big part of my anxiety disorder so i'm using the shrug my shoulders technique for example , say i'm upset because i painted a room with semigloss paint instead of flat long story i shrug my shoulders and say , oh well it 's good enough , moving on to something else of course , one side of my brain is screaming and demanding more analysis , evaluation , and remedying action , but i'm starting to listen to a quieter voice that 's been there all along saying , you know what ? it 's ok you 're ok it 's time to move on perfectionism is the scaffolding holding up my anxiety framework once i remove enough bolts the whole complex will come crashing down and the real , authentic , recovered , anxiety free me will be standing tall
