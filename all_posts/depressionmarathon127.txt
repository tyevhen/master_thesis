in my program of recovery we learn , life which includes deep resentment leads only to futility and unhappiness , and that , this business of resentment is infinitely grave it is fatal i have found this to be incredibly accurate and true in my life one of the greatest gifts of my sobriety has been freedom from resentments i use the word freedom purposefully , because that is exactly what it is freedom i never imagined i 'd be able to get through the trials and tribulations , the inevitable slights and inherent unfairness , of this thing called life without feeling resentful it 's like magic of course , i'm not perfect in fact , i'm writing this post because i 've been extremely imperfect over the last week one week ago i was reamed for minutes by the spouse of one of my patients she disagreed with my plan of care it was ugly despite my rising frustration and anger , i was professional and calm throughout our interaction i tried to offer compromises and solutions , but it eventually became clear she was only interested in her solution toward the end of our interaction she got personal and nasty i wanted to tear her head off i did n't the interaction ended i do n't even remember how , but neither of us went away happy unfortunately , the situation went unresolved until yesterday my boss , who needed to step in and educate the spouse about the realities of treatment and about appropriately interacting with therapy staff , was on vacation until yesterday in the interim , the patient , and his spouse , had returned for his regularly scheduled appointments multiple times the atmosphere was less than ideal i guess the situation is now resolved , but i'm still not happy in reviewing the heated conversation , i feel good about how i interacted with the spouse and the patient there was more than enough provocation for me to lose my cool , but i did n't i'm satisfied with that but internally , it 's been a different story i have n't been feeling quite so satisfied rather than satisfied , i 've been steaming i 've tried and tried and tried to let it go i 've tried to put out of my mind the nasty , unfair things the spouse said unfortunately , i have n't been very successful throughout this last week my feelings of resentment , and all the things i wish i could have said , were never far from my consciousness my resentment impacted my mood , my energy , and my sleep that really frustrated me last night i spoke about my feelings with a woman wiser than i she has years of sobriety she reminded me of one of the tenets of our program of recovery it 's on page in our book it describes the path from resentment to freedom it says , in part , we realized that the people who wronged us were spiritually sick we asked god to help us show them the same tolerance , pity , and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend when a person offended we said to ourselves , 'this is a sick person how can i be helpful to him ? god save me from being angry thy will be done ' i moaned , loudly , as she reminded me of this prayer over the past week it never even crossed my mind i protested pray for this woman who had been so mean and unfair ? that 's the last thing i wanted to do ! but i knew , from my own experience , it would work dammit i knew what i needed to do so my task now is to say this prayer daily , for two weeks , in order to free myself from my resentment i ca n't afford to continue allowing this woman to occupy free space in my brain if past results are any indication , and i have no reason to expect otherwise , as long as i do what i need to do i know i will again feel free it 's like magic
