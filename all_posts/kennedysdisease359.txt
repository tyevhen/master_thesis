i have been an outdoors person a nature lover since i was a kid hiking in the woods or mountains were my favorite pastimes i miss not being able to just go without thinking about capabilities , getting stuck , or worrying about the weather well , mike goynes called me yesterday to discuss the ultimate power wheelchair he found it online and wanted to share his dream chair there is an old saying , the only difference between men and boys is the cost of their toys this chair proves it is true ! it is the viking x all terrain wheelchair the six videos of what this baby can do are amazing i not saying that i would want to try everything they demonstrated , but it is something else to watch this bad boy appears to handle it all without much trouble it has four wheel drive and over of ground clearance that allows it to climb stairs or curbs , go up and down steep hills up to degrees and comfortably cross beaches of loose sand or mud while still turning on a dime , if necessary and , after watching the videos i can also see why you might want the four point seatbelt option even more fascinating is the seating system the viking x has an automatic digitally programmed vertical seating system that maintains a vertical position at all times weather climbing a hill or going down a hill the driver will always be able to maintain a vertical position the chair even comes has two sets of tires available standard and all terrain even with all these capabilities , it can still travel at mph and run for up to miles without needing a charge i had no idea how much this baby would cost , was my best guess i was shocked to see a sticker price of , with free shipping there is even a promotional coupon that takes another off the price yup , that is still a lot of money , but boy would it be fun a man s gotta dream , right !
