a few years ago , a small swiss startup started something that caught fire they had the idea that what people are really doing , on social media , is curating timeline news , and those timelines from twitter , facebook , etc should be available to view graphically , as newspaper like web pages , with links shown visually , in cognitively easy tiles graphic headline link blurb , a la buzzfeed , only , you know , less obnoxious ? what 's more , people should be able to syndicate their news pages to followers , who in turn will repurpose newsbits into their news pages , etc paper li was the result , and you see it every day in your twitter feed the joe blow daily is out ! fast forward five years paper li has raised million and forges ahead , with millions of users but they are falling behind quickly in fact , they 're history , just about what happened ? flipboard happened with a reported , new members a day rebelmouse happened scoop it happened all monster success stories or are they ? paper li claims to have million users , but a quick check of http www similarweb com website paper li shows them with a global rank of , and only million visits a month upstart rebelmouse has a rank of , and million visits a month , whereas scoop it ranks , , with million visits a month all of which pales next to flipboard 's global rank of , and million visits a month if we compare scoop it , paper li , and rebelmouse com for google searches , we get the reason i did n't overlay flipboard on this chart is that it flattens the other curves to invisibility flipboard utterly dominates does this mean you should give up your paper li account and switch to flipboard ? not exactly these sites do different things paper li is still a good easy way to publish your twitter feed as a news page that others can consume flipboard , as far as i can tell , does n't explicitly offer that mode of publishing , preferring , instead , that you aggregate news from around the web rather than straight from your social timeline the bottom line is that if you 're interested in making a web page out of your timeline , and publishing it for others , the best ways to do it are paper li and rebelmouse if you 're interested mainly in aggregating stories you 've spotted on the web directly into a news page and optionally pushing those stories to your twitter timeline , you need scoop it the best use case for flipboard is if you 're a consumer not so much a publisher of news and you want to gather diverse stories based on interests and search terms into your own custom newspaper that you can scan every day for major news , flipboard is da shit what you need paper li puts ads in your face and junks up the page if you want to insert your own ads on the page or have analytics or collaboration features , you need to upgrade to the pro version for month when would you choose rebelmouse over paper li ? um , just about always , i think paper li is ugly , puts google ads in your reader 's face , and offers no analytics in the free version rebelmouse offers good team collaboration features , gives you free analytics , is extemely well optimized for mobile , and looks great all the time rebelmouse has a cleaner design than paper li and offers many of paper li 's premium features in the free version all of the curation apps come with a bookmarklet that lets you designate web stories for syndication on your news page in real time , which is a cool bit of magic that keeps you from having to stay in the scoop it or other main app while you curate you can also use the scoop it bookmarklet to scoop stories to your twitter timeline , and have the rebelmouse feed powered by your timeline slurp the scoop generated tweet into your rebelmouse page got that ? okay let me try again while you 're looking at someone 's blog , you can scoop the blog , and it appears on your twitter timeline as a tweet but your rebelmouse page is listening to your timeline , too , so the story also magically winds up on your rebelmouse page so decide what you 're mainly wanting to do are you interested in making a nice web page out of your twitter timeline ? rebelmouse and paper li excel at that want to push stories , as you visit them , onto a web page and or a timeline ? scoop it want to create a custom news page that brings you fresh news from around the web every day automagically ? flipboard the feature overlap between these sites is extensive , and some do certain things better than others tip if you 're a marketer , a key area you 'll want to explore is the various sites' handling of e mail subscriptions and notifications my advice is to spend a few minutes test driving each one before deciding which one serves you best enterprise users seem to be lining up behind rebelmouse for its great collab features , analytics , and mobile optimizations scoop it can be instrumented with google analytics , but that 's something you do manually flipboard is great for mobile and has gained an enormous following in a short amount of time if the company ever goes public , it will be a huge sensation until the social bubble bursts paper li ? alas , poor paper li you started this whole mess , and look at you now just another wallflower at the orgy the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might not be complete , but it 's as good as i can do with my silly notifications scraping hack in any case , you should get busy following the folks shown below they 're fantastic twitter networkers , and they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links if you enjoyed this post , wo n't you pass the link along on social media ?
