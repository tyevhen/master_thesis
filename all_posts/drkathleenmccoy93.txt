i was in a hurry as i quickly read and deleted emails this morning there is so much to do today but one email attachment stopped me in my tracks it was a video from northwestern showing the class of during their first day on campus hearing warm greetings from the student body president and the current president of northwestern , celebrating as a group , learning northwestern 's songs , discovering the wonders of chicago and suddenly , my eyes filled with tears when i remembered my own first day on campus years ago that first day september , was a tearful day , too i had never flown before , never traveled alone , never been to chicago , never set foot on campus , had never known anybody who went to northwestern i was excited , but frightened , lonely and filled with anxiety i spent much of the flight to chicago weeping on the shoulder of a kind stranger , a sweet middle aged woman , who told me , over and over , what a wonderful experience this would be for me i burst into tears when a welcoming group of students greeted me in baggage claim at o'hare i cheered up considerably in the cab between two sophomores who reassured me that everything would be fine and advised me which classes were especially worthwhile i managed a smile when a handsome young man ran up to me at the entrance to my dorm and offered to carry my suitcase to my third floor room standing in front of the closed door of my dorm room , i took a quick breath there were two names on the door mine and my new roommate 's cheryl martindill i had n't known , until that very moment , who my first college roommate would be i did n't know anything about her i hoped we 'd like each other with a whispered prayer , i opened the door the first person i saw was not my roommate , but a stern and angry middle aged woman are you kathleen mccoy ? she demanded are you a catholic ? i nodded yes to both do n't put your suitcase down , she said you 're moving we do n't want our daughter rooming with a catholic my stomach dropped i felt ill i wanted my mother i stared at her , speechless the dorm director is on her way up to settle this mess , she said i nodded i 'd like to sit down until she comes , i said i'm really tired you can sit down , but do n't get comfortable , the woman said i made my way to a desk with no adornments the woman 's daughter was at the other desk , her back to me , pinning pictures on her bulletin board i fished a copy of the los angeles times out of my carry on bag and hid behind it , crying quietly , as the dorm director arrived and curtly told this woman that cheryl and i had been matched for a good reason and that we would be reassigned only if , after giving living together a fair shot , we decided it was n't workable cheryl 's parents stormed out of the room , headed back to grand rapids , michigan i sat weeping behind the newspaper , trying to get a grip before my roommate discovered that she was matched with a crybaby cheryl continued to organize her belongings finally , she tapped the other side of the newspaper gently i'm sorry about my parents , she said at last i do n't feel that way i'm glad we 're roommates i'm a journalism major , too , and i think it 's so cool that you 're from california i never knew anyone from california i snuffled really ? yes , really , she said and then , after a moment , she said the magic words want to go get a pizza ? from then on , we were the best of friends she said nothing about my red rimmed eyes we never discussed the first day for the rest of our college days , except to agree that her parents were impossible twenty five years later , i met cheryl and her two delightful teenage children at a scottsdale hotel where they were vacationing and had invited me to join them from l a as we sat by the hotel 's expansive pool that first day , cheryl suddenly asked me a question that took me back through the years were you crying behind that newspaper ? i laughed how did you know ? she smiled and took my hand because you sat there behind it for two hours , she said and you never turned a page ! we talked a lot that day about the past about our friendship with lorraine and lorie , who would be our suite mates the next year how beautiful and sophisticated new york native lorraine was and what a sweetheart lorie , who hailed from georgia , was we talked about our college lives and agreed that there were challenges , but many more good times we agreed that we had been blessed , particularly with our lifelong friendship but cheryl , lorraine and lorie were not blessed with long lives lorraine died suddenly at from an abdominal aneurysm and lorie from an auto immune disease before she turned and cheryl barely made it to her th birthday , dying of colon cancer two months later it seems impossible that they 're gone they live so vividly , so vibrantly , in my memories of our sweet beginnings at northwestern it all came back to me as i watched the video of the ebullient class years behind us would i want to live it over again ? not really , though spending a day being young and in the company of dear friends long departed would be an incredible joy i would n't want to be young and just starting out today my heart goes out to young people who face such high tuition costs and such a ghastly job market i feel especially sorry for those journalism students years my junior who are coming of age in the twilight of the print media era with so many uncertainties for the future my tears today are ones of tenderness for those first sweet college friends and for my scared but resolute younger self the tears are for what is irrevocably lost the seemingly endless future , the special people , the hopes and dreams that seem so innocent now so many of our dreams did come true , though not always in the way we could have imagined when we the class of were the new students on campus but time flies and life can be cruel and i grieve the disappointments and heartbreaks so many of my dear college friends have had and the fact that an alarming number of them died so young the tears come because they are still so present i can see lorraine so beautiful and sophisticated and wise , lorie laughing so warmly and readily at my dorm room antics and cheryl so loving and tactful during my tearful first hours as her roommate , offering friendship and pizza as she pretended not to notice my tears on that special day so long ago
