one of my fears about returning to running was injury specifically , i was worried that my weak left leg would alter my gait , which could cause an injury somewhere else and even though my left leg seems to have regained its strength , and even though i cannot detect a significant alteration in my gait or running form , i seemingly have an injury to my right knee i think i may have torn my medial meniscus my knee has been sore off and on for about a month , worse after running , but not so sore that i ca n't run in fact , it does n't hurt when i'm running , and my running is going well unfortunately , there have been a few occasions , the day after a run , when my knee has painfully locked up that 's the sign of a meniscus tear i 've been able to manually mobilize my knee , free it up quickly , and go about my day each time good thing i'm a physical therapist i was hoping to nurse myself through this , or that somehow it would magically heal itself , but i guess it 's time to call the doctor if the meniscus is torn , it 's a relatively simple arthroscopic procedure to fix it i 'd rather take care of it now before it gets worse or i cause myself another problem however , as long as it does n't hurt while running , and it does n't feel like it is getting worse , i'm not planning to quit running maybe that 's asking for trouble , but that 's me being a runner i am planning to call my orthopedic doctor tomorrow hopefully he can take a look at me soon , and i guess we 'll go from there i'm a little frustrated , but like i said , this is hopefully a pretty minor injury which can be fixed i'm still looking toward running a marathon again early this summer that 's my goal i need that goal to keep moving forward i want to make it all the way back i need to make it all the way back this , i hope , will only be a small bump in a long road
