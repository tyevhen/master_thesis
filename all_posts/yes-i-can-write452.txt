at this point many , many people have asked how camp went , or asked me before i left to update them on my experience once i got back well , it 's really hard to know where to start , it really is i 'll most likely end up having multiple posts about various aspects of camp , and various introspection 's to do with that , but for now here 's an overview the first day i arrived , i was bombarded with one of the most boisterous scenes i 've ever encountered people were rushing around everywhere , yelling in delight , exclaiming over changes in hair colour , style and height , hugging everyone both new and old campers indiscriminately , lugging huge bags around , joking i was honestly completely and totally overwhelmed that first day , it seemed like too much , and i started to retreat into my shell it was just too much for my introverted self to handle ! and so the week started the first few days , i broke down each evening in the daytime , i could be outside in the open air , and i was happy with that , but in the evening , with everyone all of them inside playing music shouting singing dancing and being crazy , the crowd energy really got to me and i simply could n't take it after the workshops started , it got a little better small groups doing or talking about specific things i could handle no problem but in the evening , it was still bad i 've always known that big crowds were not my ideal element , but i 'd never noticed how directly the energy of the crowd affected me as energy levels went up , my emotional state went down it was very interesting actually , since i 'd never noticed that before , never having been in such a high energy crowd with no one i know ! luckily , early in the week one of the staff suggested i get away from it all by going to the boathouse that was an amazing suggestion the first time i set foot in the upstairs of the boathouse , my spirit soared i was in love with the space old wood everywhere , glowing and scuffed by time old looms , spinning wheels , a wood stove , and other reminders of a by gone era lined the walls , and through the huge , always open windows that lined one whole wall the fresh vermont air blew , or more often drifted , around me the light streamed in , squares of glowing gold shone across the floor and i was happy that became the place where i 'd go when i needed to , a place where i could center myself another thing that kept me going was the amazing staff full of warmth , supportive words , a ready ear , and always ready to give a hug when needed , they were all amazing i called home every day , since i really felt i needed to hear my parents voices in the alien environment i was in , and it really made a difference that my mother was ready and willing to come get me at a moments notice i nearly did go when i got sick with a nasty cold ! but my mom came down a couple of days early and camped at a local campground , and both knowing she was coming , seeing her briefly when she arrived , and knowing she was nearby , really helped and , well , i started to enjoy myself more , and although my spirit was still curled up inside of me , the coil started to loosen i went to some truly interesting workshops one standout was a fascinating workshop on the bible non religious , simply who wrote what when , in what styles etc , among many other interesting ones although many people complained about it , i loved the all vegetarian , super healthy food ! and i loved my chore if you can call it that it was fun ! of serving lunch it was funny seeing the not so happy with the food meat eaters expressions as they looked suspiciously at bits of tofu ! something amazing that will stay with me always was the trust circle everyone came , and i really ca n't give much info on it , since only those present can ever know what happened , since it is an opportunity for everyone to say the things that are closest to their heart , the most painful , sensitive , important things they have it was emotional , powerful , and utterly beautiful i wanted to make really good friends there , and on the last day , i thought i 'd failed i was planning on keeping touch with one person , but i did n't think i 'd really made many connections but the final morning , as everyone was leaving , i kept remembering people i had to hug goodbye , people i wanted to say something to , people i would miss yes , i realized i was going to miss people there were people i felt like i was just starting to get to know , people whom i did feel a connection with , people i really wanted as friends , and people i was too shy to speak to , because they were too cool , too attractive , and i figured they 'd never want to talk to me but on the last night , before that morning , several older campers graduated from camp , and gave a brief speech each two things that two of the campers said really stuck with me , and made me think one recounted her first year at nbtsc , seeing all of these amazingly cool people , and thinking how uninteresting she was in comparison , thinking that they would never want to talk to her and then , a couple of years later , realizing that she was one of the cool people there were n't divisions , there was no cooler and less cool at camp the second thing that stuck with me was another graduate who said how he 'd always been shy , and although he 's gotten better , he 's still working through it he still does n't always get up the courage to talk to the interesting looking person sitting on the bench and i started wondering , what were all those oh so cool hot people thinking ? did they realize they were so cool ? were they nervous speaking to people they did n't know as well ? what an awful day to start thinking of that ! i never did really come out of my shell , but i feel like i may have been close to being able to when i left , at the cusp of being able to be me then i left so , if you 'd asked me half way through the week if i wanted to go back to camp next year , the answer would have been no now however , i'm not so sure i got home full of life , full of enthusiasm , planning on continuing to only eat healthy food , planning on joining a choir , on doing other i 've been planning to do and have n't gotten around to doing i also learned a lot about myself so , if emilie comes with me next year for moral support i'm sure she 'd love it there ! , i think i 'll go back i 'll try to open up , try to be me not a shy imitation of myself , try to talk to all the people i truly regret not talking to i miss some i did talk to i miss the woods i miss the boathouse i miss the missed opportunities i want to set them right , to try again and in the meantime , i want to use my current enthusiasm to follow my dreams the whole year long peace idzie
