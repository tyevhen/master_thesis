the american psychiatric association 's nd annual meeting just ended in san francisco last week these are day long academic smorgasborgs attended by a large proportion of the apa 's , plus members , in addition to other interested people there were about individual talks totaling about hours , not to mention the odd poster presentations to see an example of the first two days' worth of talks , skip to the bottom of this post we are thinking about bringing most of the meetings' talks online audio , video , slides , and all here 's my question do these talks have any interest outside of just psychiatrists ? how much would you be willing to pay on a per talk basis this is the non member price ? these would be streaming talks not downloads and payment includes access for months so it can be watched multiple times update no cme please tweet this survey , blog it , email it , circulate widely thanks how much would you be willing to pay for yr access to a single apa talk ? click all that
