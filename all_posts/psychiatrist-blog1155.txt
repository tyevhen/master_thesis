a lot of psychiatrists i know always have full practices and they do n't take new patients i kind of wonder what this means for those who do psychotherapy like me , does it mean that every slot is filled with a patient who comes at the same time every week , or even more often ? or some come every other week but those patients patients sync up perfectly ? i never feel totally and completely 'full' for very long my patients disappear oh , they reappear too , quite often well , they do n't disappear , but they announce that they are better and either do n't want to come any more or they want to come less often while most people start therapy in a state of distress and come every week , many people i see start to feel burdened by the inconvenience and expense of weekly appointments , so after some period of time , they start cutting back to every other week or every month , and some come less often then that , maybe only a couple of times a year if all is well and they need medications renewed and my patients who have standing times sometimes they are students and their class schedules change every few months , sometimes they change jobs and ca n't get that same time off , sometimes there is a meeting at work or a child 's school event to attend maybe we skip a session , but often we reschedule , something i could n't do if everyone were rigidily assigned to a spot sometimes patients move to other cities people get sick and go on vacation or my schedule is full and a former patient calls saying they need help again i never turn away former patients , i just do n't i usually feel flattered when that they feel comfortable returning to me a friend tells me that some psychiatrists are better than others at holding on to their patients this must be true , and i'm not very good at holding on when people want to leave treatment or decrease the frequency of visits , if i do n't think it 's a good idea , i tell them why i list the reasons like bullet points they 've heard if they choose to leave decrease the frequency of their sessions anyway , i usually just accept this and say fine if , a few weeks down the road , they are n't doing as well with less frequent visits , i say maybe we should go back to meeting more often ? do patients who 've left treatment return ? all the time , sometimes after years and since i 've been at it for a while , i have patients i 've been seeing for a long time , some for over a decade it does n't seem reasonable to say they must come for regular therapy sessions or see someone else they know me , and generally i let them come and go as they want , the least often rate may be my comfort level with writing a prescription in theory , i 'd have no trouble saying to a patient , look , you 've just had a huge issue hospitalization , suicide attempt , and if you wo n't come in as often as i 'd like , i'm not comfortable treating you but so far i have n't given many ultimatums usually i just present it as the patient needs to come more often until things are better and they just do it i talked about this in the post on the final in treatment session the tv therapists tries much harder than i do to hold on tight he 's successful with some patients , though he lost a bunch in both five week seasons psychotherapy is process over time , but sometimes people feel very much helped by only a few sessions and many sessions in the journey along the way can be total duds sometimes i wonder if it would be better to hold on tighter ? might i be able to do more for my patients ? might i make more money ? might i live a somewhat more predictable life ? the predictable life thing does n't suit me so well i like having flexibility some shrinks have week long waits for appointments , and i ca n't imagine having a patient call with a problem and saying i ca n't see them within days i also ca n't predict my own personal life more than a few weeks in advance and i generally do n't even give out appointments more than weeks in advance you want to come back in months ? call me closer to the time it seems like if i mapped my schedule out that far down the line , either patients would be calling all the time with i have a conflict or i 'd be calling them because a meeting was scheduled , an event 's happening at my kids' school , and over time , i 've moved pretty far away from a work day mentality i figure it suits me , but i do n't hold people quite so tight as maybe our tv therapist would then again , he has time to care for abandoned turtles and to just leave to take a patient to chemotherapy what do you think what holds patients tight ? and does that result in better psychotherapy results ?
