hello , i have just read your book brain switch there are no words about laziness please , explain me i am sometimes lazy to do something wash the dishes i have asked myself several times if i was afraid of something ? but no i am just lazy to do this job or am i afraid of something but i have n't knonw that yet ? sorry for my english thank you , a dear a if you are not wanting to do something , whatever it is , and focus on your feelings you will always detect some slight feeling of fear not fear of anything in particular the feeling of fear comes from previously repressed fear probably from childhood when you were helpless already in the cells of your body it is human nature to be lazy about doing something , it is not a great problem however , you can use this laziness to get in touch with old repressed fear and feel it with full acceptance , acceptance now available from your no longer helpless adult self , allowing old repressed fear to just finish finally hope this helps a b curtiss
