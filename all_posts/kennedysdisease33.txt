sometimes i become frustrated because i want to help more , but i am limited in the ways i can provide assistance an example follows a woman from georgia moved to a foreign country to work and eventually married a couple of years after their marriage , he was diagnosed with kennedy 's disease after five years in this country , they have decided to move back to her home in georgia since she is a u s citizen , there is no issue for her her husband , however , now in his mid 's , is not a u s citizen and our state department is refusing to issue him a visa because he has kennedy 's disease and , in their opinion , will be a drain on our welfare system even though the couple has a home , car , and bank account in georgia , it does not matter because they do not have jobs here in the states and health insurance coverage , he is considered a possible welfare case she has written many letters to our state department , provided information from his neurologist , and even hired an attorney , but there always seems to be some catch that the state department adds to the discussion before they will issue a visa they have told her that she can come back to the states and after she has a job and health insurance , she can reapply for her husband 's visa as you can imagine , she is not crazy about leaving him behind i will not go into the details , because they are not important in this post i will say that i wrote the state department on her behalf explaining that people with kennedy 's disease live long , productive lives and are often as healthy , or healthier , than the average person is i also said that since there is no treatment or cure , the degree of medical attention required because of his condition is minimal i went on to mention that since kennedy 's disease does not affect the cognitive ability of the individual , that there are many jobs perfectly suited for a person with this health condition in closing , i gave them the kennedy 's disease association website address and asked them to contact me if they had additional questions or concerns concerning kennedy 's disease this is a roundabout way of getting to the point of the post often , people judge others based upon their looks and physical capabilities a wheelchair , nasal voice , drooping mouth , or inability to walk normally i think you get the idea , can create a wrong impression in some people they do not see the individual they see the condition and make a snap judgment i am hoping the couple mentioned above can resolve this issue with our state department so they can move to the u s i also hope that the persons denying the visa learn something positive through their handing of this case for the few times we are unable to help , there are many other times that we do make a difference in someone 's life i just wish i could do more
