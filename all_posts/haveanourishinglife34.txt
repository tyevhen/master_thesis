my husband showed me a cool video the other day and it got me thinking you might have seen it it s the if this video doesn t convince you to put down your phone , nothing probably will video click here if you want to watch it i started to think about society and the humans who are a part of it and i really think that , if we knew what we were doing , we d act different how many times have you looked back on your own life and thought , gee , i wish i could have changed that or not done that one of my favorite jokes is if only i had some hindsight in spite of the modern conveniences of technology and the internet literally at our fingertips like the video says , we are losing touch with the real world unfortunately , most people might look back on their lives and wish they d lived more in the moment and less in their phones one of my biggest concerns is the instant gratification deep down in our hearts we might know that having it all instantly is not always a good thing but we justify it because there are a few good things that come from having the internet constantly at your side i e , directions if you re lost , pictures of your nephews and nieces , recipes for a quick dinner i believe that on the whole , however , our internet lifestyle is not helping us become better people , but instead threatening to take over our lives are you in control of the internet , or is the internet in control of you ? could you live without it for one day ? do you have enough will power to live without it for one day ? here are some reasons to try for more , see the above video rap smart phones and social media , in particular , are teaching us to be less present stats say that , on average , you ll miss years of your life because you re looking down at your phone or at a computer screen that blows my mind years ! the internet is teaching us to be bad listeners it is constantly flowing with information , videos , pictures , etc there is always something to look at , always something to be entertained by since the outbreak of the smart phones , an average adult s attention span is less than a goldfish s instead of more connection , it s teaching us to more isolated with social media , texting , skyping , you might ask , who needs real life , actual , face to face conversations ? well , everyone needs real , physical human encounters we are social beings meaning , we are made to live in community isolation leads to depression , despair , and potentially , worst case scenario , suicide instant internet makes people more selfish iphones , ipads , ipods it s all about what i want our smart phones don t help us serve others they only help us serve ourselves and , in turn , they help us get used to being selfish it is obvious to me that our society has become in the habit of being served instead of putting others before themselves just look at the lack of corporal works of mercy look at the divorce rate look at abortion stats my husband and i recently got internet in our home we had been utilizing the library ever since we ve been married more for saving money purposes , but a little for helping our relationship as well i wanted us to start creating family traditions and habits of spending time together without the intrusion of the internet however , since we ve done well with our budget thanks dave ramsey ! and with the baby coming soon , we decided it could be a good kind of change to get the internet nonetheless , i want to make sure that the internet works for us and does not start to take over our lives we are in control and not going to become controlled by it so , one way i am planning to achieve this is by putting limits in place i want to be able to say no when i want to say no how else can i do this if i don t practice on a regular basis ? so , i am posing a challenge to myself and to all those who want to have a more nourishing life it s about creating good habits or changing bad habits like matthew kelly says , our lives change when our habits change unfortunately , because we are habitual creatures , we don t change easily and even if we want to change , we often fail because our habits run deep if we really want to change the fact that the internet is our master , than we have to be intentional about how we use it my challenge is this give up the internet every friday since friday is already a day of penance , there s no better time to do it giving up the internet , even if it s just for one hour period , will be difficult i can guarantee that it s going to take some real guts and some real strength to accept this challenge however , you ll get extreme amounts of graces if you unite your sacrifice to christ s sacrifice on the cross this challenge will be one of the hardest things you ve ever done but i tell you that you are worth it i can promise you that your life will change for the better because of it if you can t do it , if you can t say no to the internet , then you are the slave and the internet is your master the lord said , i am the lord your god you shall have no other gods before me exodus jesus said , a man cannot serve two masters luke if you deny yourself just one day a week if you say no to the internet every friday you will strengthen your will power to make good decisions in the future not only concerning your internet behaviors but this practice will help you in all other weaknesses in your life you will start to be in control of worldly things instead of being controlled by the internet or other material possessions on the practical side , when friday comes along , shut down your computer replace your internet time with spiritual reading or prayer or any other good habit if your phone is the problem , block the data for the day or just until you remember not to browse on fridays post a sign on your fridge or at work or somewhere visible that can remind you of your commitment to make your life better remember no internet on fridays ! heck , create a calendar event on your phone that says get off the internet , and repeat it every friday several times a day pray to your guardian angel to help you remember your promise to sacrifice if you want to give up the internet on fridays but work a job that requires your involvement on the web or email , just keep it to work related tasks you can still strengthen your saying no power in this way it might be a little trickier considering it is right in front of you , but it s not impossible if you give in or forget , don t get discouraged just try again pass this message along to friends i m convinced that great things will happen if we stand together and sacrifice the internet every friday if you can t do it for yourself , do it for starving children , for those being persecuted for their religion , for the end of abortion , for stronger marriages , or for any other cause sometimes , it s easier to do something for someone else than it is to do something for yourself but i know you can do it ! i believe in you !
