microwave , we need to get a few things straight here first and foremost , five consecutive beeps is more than enough to alert me that you have finished cooking what i ve asked you to cook i swear to god , you beep louder than anything has ever beeped before at am , this kind of behavior is alarming and unnecessary another point of contention is that button of yours marked time if i want you to cook something , i cannot just start pressing number buttons no , that would be too simple instead , you force me to verify that i am indeed planning on using the number buttons as an indication of how long i expect you to nuke my food is this step really necessary ? i cannot be expected to remember this requirement of yours at the aforementioned hour of in the morning , and i just end up fumbling confusedly with your buttons until i remember oh yeah , the microwave can t understand even the simplest directions until i press time , which makes me even more irritated and unable to handle your ludicrous beeping you also seem to misunderstand the meaning of defrost when i ask you to defrost something , it means that i want you to make it unfrozen enough to cook on the stove which , by the way , is way better at its job than you it does not mean that i want you to cook the shit out of a quarter sized portion of my flank steak while leaving the rest completely frozen are you high ? why would i want you to do that ? additionally , you seem to define a day differently than i do where i come from , a day is equal to exactly hours , but you seem to be under the impression that hours and seconds is an acceptable approximation i assure you , it is not you have a clock in your stupid face for a reason to help me tell time so that i may be punctual in my activities when you get sloppy and lose track of a minute every day , it really adds up this is especially troublesome because i was brought up to believe that clocks should not be doubted in their ability to track the passage of time i trusted you , and you let me down i know that being off by minutes doesn t seem like much to you because you are a microwave and your life doesn t involve going places and doing things , but as a human , minutes can mean the difference between getting an a on a lab report and not even being allowed to turn it in to put that in perspective , do you remember that time i overcooked that piece of chicken ? remember how it made you stink for about months ? that piece of chicken was only overcooked for about minutes are you beginning to grasp the seriousness of this problem ? if you are unwilling or unable to perform the basic functions for which you were designed , i may be forced to replace you i feel bad about having to get rid of you , but i can t exactly keep an annoying chunk of beeping plastic around just for sentimentality and i could really use the counter space so now the ball is in your court , microwave if you don t want to end up being a chair for some dump dwelling vagrant , i would suggest that you reevaluate your behavior sincerely , allie
