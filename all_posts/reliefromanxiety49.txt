when you grow up , the world around you seems to create this criteria for every stage of your life and if you 're not doing it , then you must be falling behind it 's almost like the american dream which seems to be somewhat unobtainable battling mental illness is n't in the life that you 're supposed to have according to films and media , but that 's not what bothers me even though i should never try to obtain these goals that are somewhat impossible , my mental illness meant that i perhaps was n't at the stage of my peers i was n't passing my driving test at age , or having partners from , or getting my first paid job when i was although some of my peers were living their life this way , in reality there was nothing telling me that i had to be like that and i'm not even sure it was the majority acting like i thought they were nevertheless , these goals seemed to plague me for a long time however , i now feel for my age i have ticked off all the boxes that i am supposed to , but it does n't feel perfect i wish i had known that even with all of the goals ticked off on your list , it does n't mean that life is perfect and you 're the happiest you can be i accepted that was n't like others when i was growing up and that i was developing at a different time and on my own journey although this was hard to accept i was reaching my goals in my own time now , i feel i have reached my goals that i have been aiming for all these years and i 'll be honest , it does n't feel that i 've got my life together i thought having a paid job , a car , living independently , a partner and so on , would mean i had reached all these invisible and made up goals and it would be perfect but , life does n't work like that and puzzle pieces do n't come together to make a whole life is a lot more complicated than that i am proud of how far i have come and i am fortunate to have in my life today , but it 's ever changing and my anxiety and depression still throws up its difficulties but , if i am to learn anything from this , is that there is no date at which everything needs to be done you are on your own journey and you can do it in your own time and that 's okay best wishes , amy xx
