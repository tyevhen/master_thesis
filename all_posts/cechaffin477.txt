yesterday i posted this as a proem , or prose poem , something i generally avoid with the help of those who commented , today i recast it as a poem with the former version below it if you have the time , can you tell me which version you think is better ? sensing trees a redwood s autumn is not as dramatic as that of a deciduous tree if you prefer color to sound which brings to mind the old question of whether it s better to be deaf or blind blind is the answer a wise man gave me does that mean communication is more vital than safety ? the redwoods ply the edge of an expanding continent like icebreakers when wind strikes , their spent fronds fall like missiles pelleting the roof , each frond a lost church with needles for pews dead fronds lace my deck like fish skeletons gone pale rust rigid millipedes with neeedles for legs though acidic and hard to mulch the needles are members in good standing because they never desert the frond remember the blind vs deaf question ? would you rather hear or see the redwoods ? easy one what about as an infant with your mother ? sensing trees a redwood s autumn is not as dramatic as that of a deciduous tree , if you prefer color to sound which brings to mind the old question of whether it s better to be deaf or blind blind is the answer a wise man gave me does that mean communication is more vital than safety ? the redwoods ply the edge of an expanding continent like icebreakers when wind strikes , their spent fronds fall like missiles pelleting the roof , each frond a lost church with needles for pews dead fronds lace my deck like fish skeletons gone pale rust , rigid millipedes with needles for legs though acidic and hard to mulch , the needles are members in good standing because they never desert the frond remember the blind vs deaf question ? would you rather hear or see the redwoods ? easy one what about as an infant with your mother ?
