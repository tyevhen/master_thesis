clients who come to see me in my psychotherapy practice in nyc for anxiety and they ca n't connect their anxiety to anything in particular that is currently going on in their lives or in their history they just feel anxious all of the time for many of them , over time , their anxiety has taken a toll on their physical health , due to the mind body connection , as well as their personal and work related relationships while they might have been able to live with their anxiety for many years , they get to a point where it 's having serious consequences for them and they can no longer try to avoid dealing with it anxiety does n't always look like typical anxiety as i mentioned earlier , anxiety comes in many different guises sometimes , it might not even look like what you might typically think of as anxiety for some people who seem to be always angry and irritable , the underlying issue is often that they are anxious and they do n't even realize it they might not connect their anger or irritability with anxiety their attitude might be , this is just the way that i am i 've always been this way but when a spouse or a boss tells them that they need to do something about their anger and irritability or else there will be consequences the end of a relationship or marriage or job loss , they ca n't avoid facing that their way of relating is not working for them and the people around them clinical hypnosis can help with fear of dental work and medical procedures for other people , anxiety might mean that they dread and avoid going to the doctor or the dentist in fact , there are many medical doctors and dentists who are now trained in clinical hypnosis to help their patients overcome their dread clinical hypnosis can help with fear of dental work and medical procedures i 've seen many clients in my private practice in nyc who have avoided going to the doctor or the dentist for years because they 've had such high anxiety about these medical and dental visits as a result of their high anxiety , their medical and dental health often deteriorates to such a degree that a condition that might have necessitated a routine procedure years ago has now escalated into a serious problem that now requires the kind of treatment that they feared all along clinical hypnosis can be very effective in helping with pre dental or pre surgical anxiety hypnosis can also help mothers to be have a calmer and less painful child birth clients who learn to use clinical hypnosis learn how to calm themselves and create a relaxed state so that they usually have much better dental , medical and surgical outcomes than people with anxiety who have these procedures without hypnosis avoidance and performance anxiety avoidance is often a big part of anxiety overwhelming anxiety can keep people in relationships that are no longer working for them because they fear letting go and lack confidence that they 'll find someone else anxiety can also get in the way of going out , meeting new people or starting a relationship avoidance anxiety can also keep someone in a dead end job anxiety is also often a factor in performance anxiety in sports performance anxiety is often a factor in erectile dysfunction ed or premature ejaculation , often ruining relationships performance anxiety often gets in the way of people advancing in their careers because a promotion might involve public speaking and they dread it so , rather than seeking a career promotion , people often allow their anxiety to get in the way and they convince themselves that they 're not interested in advancing clinical hypnosis can also complement your current talk therapy treatment clinical hypnosis can be used as a form of adjunctive psychotherapy that means that you can stay with your current psychotherapist , who is n't trained in clinical hypnosis , and see a hypnotherapist to overcome a particular problem when clients participate in clinical hypnosis while continuing to see their current psychotherapists , the two mental health professionals usually confer so that they become a treatment team working for you depending upon the issue , you might only need clinical
