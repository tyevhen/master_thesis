i did get a chance to read over some interesting papers yesterday unfortunately , my home computer stopped working yesterday while i was on twitter that 's probably the universe telling me something our interventions seem unable to bring the dead pc back to life so i'm a little cranky also , since it is more difficult to link things on the ipad , it will probably take me a few days to link the papers in the mean time , you are just going to have to take my word for it what do you think is a macbook is really worth it ? it will not surprise you to know that folks have been looking at the o o ratio in adhd as researchers have been looking at the same thing in depressive disorders and other psychiatric disorders it may also not surprise you to learn that much of the early research is fairly useless , as adhd was not defined rigorously and things like medicine , iq , and education were not always controlled for however , since , more meaningful work has been done , and several smallish studies have found similar trends to the previous research the punch line is that folks with adhd tend to have significantly higher o o ratios in their bodies than folks without the disorder also , kids and young adults with adhd have lower dha when o supplementation has been tried typically just dha or epa and dha , it has been a bit of a bust just like the trials with alzheimer 's and several of the trials with depression some parents and teacher ratings noted less temper tantrums and better ability to pay attention , but more objective ratings such as cognitive testing and independent raters of behavior did n't notice any difference it is important to keep in mind that o supplementation trials have always been more successful in milder and earlier forms of illness mild cognitive impairment , depressive disorders not complicated with anxiety also , to my knowledge decreasing o at the same time has never been studied in addition , while sometimes the placebos are soybean oil or something like that , other times olive oil is used , and there is some evidence that oleic acid might also have beneficial effects on behavior and mood adhd strikes young and sticks around therefore it is a tough disorder that is in part hard wired , and in my mind , just o supplementation is unlikely to be of much benefit one more very interesting thing to keep in mind at least in these studies , overall the diets of the adhd kids did not differ significantly from the control kids diets were typically measured with day diet logs , so take from that what you will so the control kids ate just as much o and just as little o as the adhd kids in the study of young adults , the adhd kids were significantly more likely to take a vitamin pill , and their micronutrient profile on blood testing was actually better or not different than the controls with respect to magnesium levels , iron , folate , zinc , b , b , etc independent studies of many of those micronutrients showed benefit for adhd in kids who were deficient in small trials also yet despite the similarity in diet , the adhd kids still had more o hanging around in the body , and less o some other interesting things popped up while reading these papers in one study , the researchers looked for signs of essential fatty acid deficiency people who are too low in pufas in general will have dry mouth , thirst , frequent urination , dry and flaky skin , brittle nails , and dandruff sure enough , kids with adhd were more likely to have these symptoms , and the kids with these symptoms had a more out of whack o o ratio and less dha in the body their out of whack ratios also responded more robustly to dietary supplementation with dha than the kids who did n't have symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency however , the absolute levels of essential fatty acids in these kids were n't , in the strict sense , deficient , despite the symptoms how do we pull all this information together ? well , in my mind , something very important is going on in a subset of kids with adhd and their needs for pufas , and their utilization of them dha is vital for neuroplasticity , proper nerve communication , and nerve repair once more you will not be surprised that kids and young adults with adhd have signs of inflammation higher ferritin , higher il , etc etc etc the inflammatory process may also change pufa metabolism or utilization , while the pufa ratio could affect how the inflammatory process is played out one small study showed that families with an allele of a gene that was super robust at making a form of the inflammatory cytokine il had much higher rates of adhd it would make sense that certain families are genetically more prone to brain insults caused , perhaps , by lifelong dha deficiency or o excess while the brain is developing or it could mean that some of these families have problems with how o and o are transported or stored or something , so even sufficient amounts in the diet do n't add up to enough for them we also should keep in mind that the only large dietary study a dietary pattern study in australia , and we know that dietary pattern studies may be more problematic than they are worth showed a higher risk of adhd in folks who ate a western diet also , boys in the australian study and in these o o studies trended towards being more affected by diets or out of whack ratios , and benefited more from supplementation than girls clearly this issue is a rich area for more research in the meantime , it does n't hurt to get enough o particularly dha if you eat higher fat , enough o will naturally come along for the ride , so no eating extra o either next week one or more posts cleaned up and migrated to psychology today , updating this post to add references , and who knows what will come down the line so far as papers and new stuff and probably , a new computer sigh
