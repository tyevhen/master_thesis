you always think it ca n't happen to you addiction is something that happens to other people , other families let me first talk about anger , because it 's an emotion we commonly address in psychotherapy anger is a normal human emotion , but it 's gotten a bad rap , and the inappropriate expression of anger can make life very difficult when anger is recognized and used wisely , it can help us to solve problems , to stand up for what we believe in , and to change the world it 's never a terribly comfortable emotion , and often people strive to decrease their comfort by discharging anger so tonight i downloaded the angry birds app to my itouch oh , i'm not so sure about this i 've catapulting these little animated critters at piggys in pens all night i spent over an hour on level twelve i ca n't stop i posted on my facebook about it , and an old high school friend who 's now a physicist at stanford told me not to do it it 's like crack it 's late and i want to go to bed but what about the piggys in the stone pens on level ? does n't some angry bird need to smash them ? if you know any shortcuts , please do share not sure i 'll ever blog again
