i am getting a pencil neck the atrophy in the neck region is now evident i didn t notice it a couple of years ago , but it has become more prominent within the last nine months and , with the atrophy i noticed that many evenings and occasionally even in the afternoon my neck muscles just do not want to hold up my head sometimes i have cramping or pain , but most of the time it is just weakness that i experience i have seen this condition in several others with kennedy s disease and my brother has experienced the problem for the last ten years or so for some reason i thought i was immune i continue to perform neck exercises every day and they seem to help , but something has happened recently that i cannot explain i attribute some of the problem to working too many hours on the computer i know that several days this winter i spent more than four hours at the pc without any breaks a few days i probably spent close to eight hours working at the pc i found if i spend less time at the computer and schedule more breaks , the neck fatigue is not evident or not quite as bad this last week i spent an hour or so mid afternoon in my recliner using a neck pillow dog bone it seemed to help my questions for you are are you having any neck weakness issues ? if so , is there anything that you have found that helps ? i look forward to hearing from you
