in the first clinical tip we discussed the possible origin of the theory of the elements and the connection between the ancient four directions and the cosmological arrangement of the elements with earth in the centre in the second clinical tip we discussed the clinical application of the cosmological sequence of the elements in this third and last clinical tip i would like to address the relationship between the elements and the seasons numerology pervades chinese medicine very often with contradictions there is the number which is the dao , bearing in mind that the dao is part not only of daoist philosophy but also of the philosophies of confucianism and of the yin yang school there is the number which is of course yin and yang number is heaven earth person tian di ren i deliberately use the word person rather than man as ren in chinese does indeed mean person nan ren is a male person and nu ren a female one incidentally , the earth of heaven , earth and person is not the same as the earth of the elements the earth of heaven , earth and person is the counterpole of heaven heaven refers to a state of dispersal of qi and earth to a state of condensation of qi the earth of the elements is a neutral centre of the other four elements number corresponds corresponds to the four seasons number is of course the elements thus , these are the correspondences dao yin yang heaven , earth , person four seasons elements i mentioned contradictions earlier because the correspondence between these numbers and the phenomena they represent is not always smooth and the seasons and elements are a good example of this how do we fit into ? another very good example is the conundrum of channels but zang and fu so , how are four seasons reconciled with elements ? they are reconciled because earth does not correspond to any season , as it is the centre , the neutral term of reference around which the seasons and the other elements spin the classic of categories lei jing , by zhang jie bin has a very interesting statement the spleen belongs to earth which pertains to the centre , its influence manifests for days at the end of each of the four seasons and it does not pertain to any season on its own this confirms that the spleen does not correspond to any season and that its influence manifests for days at the end of each season again , it is better to refer to the cosmological arrangements of the elements rather than the generating sheng sequence in the cosmological arrangement , the spleen is in the centre and does not correspond to any season in the generating sequence , the earth has moved out between fire and metal and , as it comes after fire summer , it must correspond to late summer the association between earth and late summer has never convinced me what the lei jing says about the energy of the spleen influencing the end of every season is more convincing the earth provides nourishment , and it make sense that the spleen should influence the end of every season the same idea is also in the discussion of prescriptions from the golden chest jin gui yao lue , c ad by zhang zhong jing during the last period of each season , the spleen is strong enough to resist pathogenic factors thus , in the cycle of seasons , the earth actually corresponds to the late stage of each season although the earth element is often associated with late summer or indian summer , it also corresponds to late winter , late spring and late autumn clinically , the position of the earth in the centre makes sense as the earth is the origin of nourishment and the stomach and spleen are the source of post natal qi nourishing the earth and tonifying the stomach and spleen will tonify all other organs the association of the spleen with the end phase of each season also has some clinical relevance as qi and blood tend to decline at the end of each season especially autumn and winter and it therefore makes sense to tonify stomach and spleen then to tonify stomach and spleen , i use st zusanli and sp sanyinjiao , often with moxa on the needle if they are particularly deficient , i add direct moxa cones on bl pishu and bl weishu classic of categories lei jing , people s health publishing house , beijing , p first published discussion of prescriptions of the golden chest jin gui yao lue fang lun , zhejiang scientific publishing house , p first published c ad
