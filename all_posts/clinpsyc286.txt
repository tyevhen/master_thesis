drug wonks has a post saying that alex berenson 's latest reporting on the zyprexa scandal is likely erroneous because he is pulling information from just a few lilly documents indeed , it is stated once again , berenson uses the one paper out of several thousands of documents approach to depict lilly as a criminal corporation further , it is added on the heels of intense criticism of the nyt coverage of the duke rape case and the paper 's falling earnings , the berenson reporting is another example of the times decline ok here 's my challenge i 'd like drug wonks or , well , anyone to read the following posts read the lilly documents that are freely available and are linked within said posts then talk about how lilly is a good corporate citizen , and did not promote zyprexa off label here you go demented marketing of zyprexa ? marketing zyprexa as the new mood stabilizer zyprexa off label promotion ? zyprexa off label marketing ? part as for the well , we have n't seen every single document argument , please see my earlier post for why i think that argument is weak
