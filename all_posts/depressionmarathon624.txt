ugh ! it 's been a long week so far i 've been feeling like crap since saturday night i thought it was just a bad cold , but now i think it 's more likely been the flu my body has been aching so badly it 's kept me awake at night i had a low grade fever through yesterday and my head has been painfully stuffed up last night i was up coughing half the night needless to say , things have not been fun i hate lying around doing nothing , but i really did n't have a choice this morning my temp is back to normal i'm tired , but my body is aching less i have to go to work because i have four new patients who need to be evaluated i think i'm past being contagious , but i'm going to wear a mask so i do n't get anyone else sick once my evaluations are done , i 'll be back home resting again i also have my appointment with my orthopedic doctor this afternoon hopefully , i 'll finally have a definitive diagnosis and a plan for recovery my knee has been worse the past few days , and i 've finally made the decision that i wo n't be running on sunday it will be hard my friend kate will arrive friday night for marathon weekend i guess i will be her personal chauffer for the weekend i 'd rather stay away from the race all together , but obviously i ca n't do that with kate here to run oh well it will be nice to see kate again , and i'm sure she will love the race that 's all for now i'm off to ready myself for my day i 'll let you know the outcome of my ortho appointment send prayers for something easily fixable and have a great day !
