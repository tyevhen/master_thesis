it says , loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities it 's one of the official symptoms of depression yup , got it i do n't want to do anything i do n't want to write i do n't want to go to the store i do n't want to visit i do n't want to talk on the phone i do n't want to cook or prepare even simple things to eat i do n't want to clean i do n't want to change my clothes i do n't even want to open the door to get my mail ! it 's all too big , or too overwhelming , or just too uninteresting and it all takes energy i do n't have any of that right now sleep that 's the only thing at which i am currently proficient the funny thing is i'm not interested in sleeping either , but i can barely keep my eyes open most of the time despite my hyper somnolence , i 've been able to keep a few commitments this is how it goes i sleep , work for a few hours , and then collapse in exhaustion i sleep , struggle through a run , and then i sleep some more i sleep , go to an appointment , and then collapse in a heap it 's painful and exhausting to leave my house i'm battling just to maintain some semblance of normalcy i'm trying my best not to worry of course i am worried waiting for the other shoe to drop but i ca n't do that i 've got to stay in today i'm doing my best to keep moving forward , even if it means sleeping more than my fair share of the day i'm trying to do what my body will allow when it will allow it i wish it was n't painful and exhausting to leave my house i wish something , anything , held my interest but that 's not the case right now despite the apathy , i feel i 've got to keep pushing and that 's what i'm attempting to do it 's hard this illness is hard sometimes i hate it
