when i made the transition from paper to digital back in the s when palm pilots still roamed the earth and man was preparing for the impending yk apocalypse , i said good bye to that trusty old standby for todo lists the pen paper it was all digital for me , and i was prepared to spend as much time as was required to get my very complicated repeating todos to beep on cue and sync with the desktop for security it may have occasionally required hours to bang out syncing bugs , but i was living in the future , baby ! now that i'm older and wiser and finished selling a box of old palm pilots and sony cli s on ebay for , i realize digital is n't always better , and i keep a pen paper handy just in case but i still love living in the future i'm just smarter about it one smart trick i 've come up with is to create fast todo lists by using my iphone 's camera when i do n't have time to write items down iphones , smartphones , and most plain vanilla cellphones come with built in cameras that built in camera is perfect for on the fly list making late for a meeting , but need to pop by the store on your way back to buy a few things ? snap a picture of them on your way out the door do n't be fancy do n't launch your simulated analogue tintype app with types of papers and variable temperature settings just snap , snap , snap ! when you arrive at the store , open your photo album , go shopping , and delete each photo as you add the item to your cart you can group the items into one photo , or , as i prefer , run around the house and snap each item in its habitat do n't worry about people seeing pictures of your toilet paper roll you 'll be deleting it within the hour however , if you use cloud services and do n't want to clutter up your stream with these todo photos , use a camera app that keeps its photos separate from the system roll camera on the iphone is excellent for this just do n't let yourself be distracted by its dizzying array of imaging tweaks there are apps e g visuallist that let you create complicated folders of todo lists projects built entirely of photos , but i recommend sticking with your built in camera for quick and dirty todo list making with practice , you 'll be surprised how quickly you can create these lists without picking up a single pad of paper follow me on twitter as splinteredmind i also explore iphone photography with instagram as douglascootey peek and if you 're a glutton for punishment you can friend me on facebook as well , or find me on path where i explore my coping strategy process with varying results you might also like throwaway todo lists that organize your day adhd two ways to trounce todo lists clear the add friendly todo list todo lists for the win unless they make you feel like a linkwithin
