grief is part of life and part of poetry below a short poem about my daughter 's death from my new book , then a re posting of my walking the razor 's edge of grief and depression on rachel 's death the hole in the ground left by the tree the hole left by her life or my life or any life always lacks dirt enough to cover the uprooted root crown again loss is a coin tossed down a depthless well you listen for a splash that never comes published in abandoned towers from tears for rachel today marks two weeks since i was started on the magic bullet , abilify since i flipped into euthymia thursday , september , i have daily been grateful for a huge negative not to be depressed those who have suffered clinical depression know whereof i speak it brings up the old question , is the avoidance of pain superior to the enjoyment of pleasure ? as a manic depressive i say , yes indeed ! today is the second day i 've experienced a little morning anxiety and suffered some of the recurring thoughts about my future and my past , not to suggest they are of such a level as to be depressive obsessions still , it scares me it 's as if the ground beneath me has become a net rather than solid earth , that i see the open squares to the abyss and must tread carefully sometimes i need to cry but am afraid to this morning apparently not , as the tears have begun and i think , poor rachel ! my darling baby my sweet freckled redheaded sunshine that 's what i called her as a small child , my sunshine because she could distract me from my melancholy in an instant she was filled with so much wonder for life , her smile could illuminate my heart , he constant activity distract me she could rescue me from the vision of the net beneath my feet she was a tonic she was my sunshine oh , it 's true as a teenager and adult she was often a huge pain in the ass , but i think what parents most remember is the unadulterated nature of a child , their essential goodness from birth before it is spoiled by this world , by competition and the special cruelty of other children children are often emotionallly brutal but at least they tend to be more honest than adults so i grieve today perhaps this was the source of my anxiety , that i still need to cry yes , i fear weeping may lead me back to depression , but i pray not i'm seeing my shrink tomorrow so i can run these concerns by him yesterday kathleen scared me by asking , you 're not going to relapse , are you ? i said no , of course but that she would pick up on a diminution of my cheerfulness is also anxiety provoking it was n't like i was crying or bemoaning my state or anything i'm sure if warning signs continue , my doctor will bump up the abilify i am on the lowest dose , which , incidentally , is the most expensive mg how those drug companies know how to stick it to you ! to be fair , likely fewer are on such a small dose , why it costs more , supply and demand , etc still a months supply of mg abilify , even from canada , is ah rachel your absence makes me weep i know you exist , but i miss you in this world and i wonder what effect this will have on jacob , losing his mother at but we ca n't take on the sadness of the world like a saddle for a pack horse we can only adjudicate our own sorrows slowly i do n't know where people get the energy to grieve for darfur or burma i have enough on my plate then many idealists have thrown themselves into good works because of trouble inside and at home as has been well said , and it sounds like it should have been shaw , i love humanity in general but ca n't stand it in particular posted by c e chaffin at pm labels poetry grief
