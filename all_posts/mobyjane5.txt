dear a b i met you at one of your book signings a year or so ago i have referred back to your book depression is a choice many times i find it a valuable read , considering the alternative systemized approach of prescription drug solutions that have not enhanced my life it has been a tough battle and i want to win without prescription drugs dragging me down i would like to surround myself with like minded people can you offer any suggestions with cbt groups or perhaps an up coming lecture to attend ? i want to break out of this programmed mindset and see things from a different perspective thank you for any positive feedback suggestions new directions you might have on this journey thank you again , a fellow traveler dear fellow traveler , thank you for your letter the main thing to remember is that anything you do in a proactive way by thinking anything other than a depressive thought , is heading your mind in the right direction and if you keep heading in the right direction , since the brain always follows the direction of its most current dominant thought and you can make any thought dominant by thinking it over and over , you will ultimately be victorious when depression hits , you do the same proactive thinking , you might check into some of the possibilities at the deepak chopra center in carlsbad , ca they have many valuable programs and updates
