it is sneaky it creeps up on you during the prime of your life you initially deny its existence , but it just will not go away you begin to make excuses for your inability to do certain things , but something inside tells you there is something wrong then , when you finally admit that you might have it , fears work their way into your daily thoughts you begin to imagine the worst and , because the disease is not well known , you have no idea what to expect all you know is whatever is happening cannot be good as the disease progresses , you begin to pray for a miracle , or at least a treatment you begin to worry about your family s future you wonder if you will have to retire early ? and , if you do , what does that mean for the family s financial wellbeing ? little things begin to nag at you like who will mow the lawn or do the home repairs ? can we afford to send our children to college ? the concerns never stop , and , they continually grow in number as your strength fades your friends and family notice your concern and want to help but there is nothing anyone can do except hope and pray the reality is that the disease does progress fortunately , it progresses slowly there are also brief periods of stability the plateaus these periods are something you look forward to because they give you time to adjust to accept your current condition unfortunately , you are never truly prepared for the next progression another slide whether the symptoms begin in your twenties or not until your sixties , the only thing you know for certain is that it will get worse this is living with kennedy s disease because the progression is slow , the actual disease is not nearly as bad as the emotional aspects of learning to live with the disease our fears are our worst enemy once we learn how to control the fears accept our situation , we begin to adjust and start living again and , we find that there is life after kennedy s disease
