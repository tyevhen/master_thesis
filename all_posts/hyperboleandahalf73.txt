i was searching through my unpublished entries for something to post today and i found this and added some illustrations i wrote it way back at the beginning of september when boyfriend and i first moved to hamilton boyfriend was being all whiny yesterday about how we never do real person things like hang out with friends or wake up when it 's still morning or eat at the olive garden i was like i hate pasta and we do n't have any friends here yet but we can wake up early if you want boyfriend what time should we get up ? me i do n't know what time do successful people wake up ? boyfriend probably around seven ? me then we 're getting up at it might have worked out better for me if i did n't get so damn excited about nothing at night when most people are getting ready for bed , i'm sitting on my couch , vibrating with pent up energy i have no idea what i get so excited about , but whatever it is , it 's really , really , really exciting ! this problem is especially acute when i know that i have to wake up early whenever i have to wake up early , i feel like i'm getting ready to embark on a dangerous adventure i imagine that this is the same feeling you would get if you were trying to fall asleep the night before your first summit of mt everest like you 're either going to die or accomplish something amazing i try to talk myself down from this hyper excited state , but it usually only exacerbates the problem i say to myself go to sleep there is absolutely nothing exciting happening tomorrow you are probably just going to wake up , crawl downstairs and fall asleep on the couch but then i feel like i'm trying to trick myself i think this is probably just a cover up for what 's really going to happen tomorrow morning i'm probably going to die or win a million dollars ! around three or four o'clock , i will usually have exhausted my body 's stores of adrenaline and i 'll fall asleep instantly this is when i start having crazy dreams for some unknown reason , my crazy dreams usually start in an empty parking garage the parking garage has little or nothing to do with the rest of the dream , but it 's always there , like a portal to crazyland , signaling that the rest of the night is going to be full of flying and running and falling and spaceship crashes and boyfriend is probably going to cheat on me with a robot and then pretend that it did n't happen even though i know it did because he has a glowing green spot on his face since apparently that 's what happens when you sleep with robots and then i try to punch him in the face , but my hands are spindly and weak and it turns out that boyfriend is actually a shapeshifter because suddenly he 's a bear and instead of arguing about how he slept with a robot , i'm running away and trying to find santa claus because that 's the only way to survive a bear attack but it does n't matter anyway because now i have to fight a gila monster and suddenly there 's salsa music i get absurdly angry at the music it feels like it has been playing for hours and i am so sick of it that by the time i wake up and realize that it 's actually my alarm clock , i'm ready to fight an army of orcs with my bare hands my face and pillow are plastered with saliva my eyes are almost swollen shut because i was sleeping on my face i'm disoriented and angry obviously this is not the part i was excited about actually , i do n't even remember what that part was at that point , all i know is that i 'll never be excited about anything again because everything is stupid my alarm clock is stupid , my pillow is stupid , the sun is stupid , feelings are stupid , grass is stupid , oprah is stupid , bricks are stupid , birds are stupid everything is stupid and i hate it this feeling usually subsides a little once i get coffee , but on this particular morning , i did not get coffee because boyfriend was like do you want to go for a run ? me running is stupid boyfriend you do n't really think running is stupid me right now i do boyfriend okay , well i'm going me wait ! fine i 'll go boyfriend okay , put on your shoes me i 'll put on your face boyfriend that does n't make sense me you do n't make sense and then we started talking about face off okay i now understand why i did n't publish this before there 's no real ending to it i must have realized this when i wrote it , but for some reason i forgot i thought oh , i 'll just draw some pictures , edit a few details and write a nice little closing paragraph ! but i was wrong it 's not that simple i ca n't just be like and then we went running and it really sucked and i yelled at some cows just because they were there the end so i'm going to make up an ending after we finished talking about face off , boyfriend and i headed out the door to go for our run that 's when we noticed the zombies there was an entire herd of zombies in our yard ! we were like go away , zombies ! but the zombies were like no ! so we had to fight them boyfriend went inside and got his assault rifle and i just started punching and then boyfriend was like get out of the way ! and i dove to the side and he started mowing down zombies and our neighbors did n't even care because they were dead anyway , fighting zombies turned out to be really easy because zombies are slow and stupid and boyfriend and i are fast and smart we just shot their knees out and then kicked their heads in it was really violent anyway , we killed all the zombies and then went for a run and it sucked and i yelled at cows just because they were there p s i do n't know if there is a proper name for a group of zombies , so i just called them a herd of zombies but it 's probably actually something like a flight of zombies or a kindle of zombies or a bantam of zombies or something it 's almost definitely a bantam of zombies update i'm officially putting my support behind zeppelin of zombies submitted by going like , even though i hate alliteration a zeppelin of zombies just sounds so natural , especially since i used to get led zeppelin and rob zombie mixed up i know there is nothing even remotely similar or confusing about those two names aside from the tenuous connection between three letter first names and last names starting with z i probably should n't even admit it publicly , but i just did i confuse led zeppelin and rob zombie and that 's why i'm supporting the term a zeppelin of zombies at the very least , getting that term officially recognized would lend some credibility to my confusion , even if only retroactively since there is no official name for a group of zombies yet though a few have been suggested i propose that we act to get the phrase a zeppelin of zombies officially recognized update shit legion of zombies has also been suggested and now i do n't know which one to choose thanks maggie way to make something that used to be totally simple not simple anymore this may have to be settled with a poll
