i can t count the number of times i ve seen article headlines proclaiming unschooling no classes , no books ! i always shake my head in frustration i suppose when people hear that unschooling is not school , they jump to the conclusion that any and all even vaguely school like trappings of classes and teachers or even books , apparently must be thrown out the window not school must mean nothing that looks like traditional learning , and nothing that looks like structure the reality , though , is quite a different story unschooling might be against such school trappings as forced memorization and compulsory classes , but it s not against individuals choosing to learn in whatever ways they feel work best for them in fact , that s kind of what unschooling is all about ! it s the ultimate in individualized and personalized learning , which means while the lives of some individuals will look very carefree and unconventional , the lives of others might look very traditionally educational unschooling is characterized not by its lack of structure , but by its flexibility there are classes as children me and my sister went to co op classes and french classes and science classes in recent times i ve been to dance classes my sister has been taking ninjutsu for years , which at this point in time means two classes a week with an extra practice day thrown in unschooling is self directed learning , which means you choose what classes you take or don t take what it isn t is learning only by yourself with no help i d hope that everyone can recognize that learning in group settings can be helpful and fun for some people some of the time would i like to only ever learn in class settings ? definitely not but sometimes , it s really great , and no one should ever believe that unschooling means shunning a specific type of learning just because it looks traditionally educational it s all about choosing what works best for you there are teachers not only present in classes of various sorts , but also in one on one situations sometimes the best way to learn something is by seeking help from someone skilled , which means a teacher or mentor of some sort it may end up looking like a familiar school teacher student relationship , or as is more often the case , it might hopefully be a more mutually respectful and reciprocal relationship i have learned so much from other people learning in isolation would be a sad and , well , isolating thing indeed but by freeing ourselves from the need to be taught , i perhaps ironically feel that we can become much more open to all that is to be learned from those around us and those we seek out , both professional teachers , experts , and community members there are books in some cases , lots of books in my house , the house i grew up in , there are two over packed bookcases in the living room a bookcase stuffed with cookbooks in the kitchen two bookcases in my bedroom one in my parents room two bookcases plus towering , precarious stacks shoved everywhere they can possibly fit in my sister s room and i don t even know how many more bookcases are scattered around the basement point being ? between us , my family owns a whole lot of books the internet provides lots of useful information and access to a ton of terrific essays and stories , but there s still a lot to be said for both novels and nonfiction books it seems absurd that i should even have to say this , but generally unschoolers like books a lot while some people are never going to really enjoy reading books for pleasure or will be unable to due to learning disabilities , the vast majority will at the very least use books when appropriate to get the information they need we ve established that some unschoolers will appear more school like in their pursuit of knowledge , or in the ways they choose to structure their learning but while that may be one sort of structure , even for the most freeform unschoolers out there , the patterns of life will create a structure of sorts daily habits and rituals , visits and activities , will build a scaffolding for the unschooling life , a structure that evolves and changes over weeks and months to support the needs of each individual and the family as a whole unschooling doesn t mean doing away with any structure whatsoever it means creating a structure based on the needs of actual people , instead of following a structure designed for the needs of an institution this means that sometimes unschoolers will go to classes , seek out teachers , and read books and sometimes , they ll learn quietly by themselves , they ll teach themselves a new skill , and they ll play a video game however much or little structure their lives end up including , life learners are trying to open themselves up to as much of the world as possible to pick and choose what works for them , and discard what doesn t , all with the knowledge that they can always make different choices in the future and those choices will quite likely include classes , teachers , and books !
