dear ms curtiss , thank you for your wonderful writing i believe my husband and sons were inspired when they chanced upon you at your booksigning my son was thrilled with your dragons guard the zoo i have been inspired by brain switch out of depression my cousin is a very talented author i look forward to the day that her fantasy novels can be enjoyed by many however , her adult life has been defined by depression i ca n't count the number of times she has been in the hospital to prevent injury to herself she has been treated with every drug available she recently ended over a dozen sessions of electroconvulsive therapy ect , which seemed to have no measurable benefit , but the side effect of sizable memory loss as i have been reading your book , i am praying that she will accept it from me , and be willing to consider and implement its wisdom thank you again for your inspiration i am most grateful best regards , m dear m , thank you so much for your letter i do not take private patients any more however , that said , i continue to answer anyone 's specific questions via email i do not charge for this i find that having to coelesce one 's thoughts into an actual question may be more helpful than a face to face meeting which are often unprofitable because the person wants to tell the same life story over and over again , rather than figuring how how to write themselves a new story many of these email exchanges i post on my blog after editing for privacy for , often , those suffering depression have questions and sometime answers that are helpful to others suffering the same thing my blog is http mobyjane blogspot com i wish your cousin a speedy recovery i also suggest that in addition to brainswitch , if your cousin is open to the idea , that you also get a copy of depression is a choice since your cousin has a degree in english brainswitch is the neuroscience of how you get out of depression depression is a choice is the philosophy of how you get out of depression and it is the psychological autobiography of my own journey into and out of manic depression i think you can get a used copy of this on amazon com for only a couple of dollars another thing to consider about your cousin if she has been on so many drugs for so long , it is possible that she is suffering from a lack of necessary nutrients in her brain as a result of the drugs i was on oxycodene for only three weeks and it so fried my brain that i was in constant anxiety for months kaiser 's answer was more drugs for the anxiety but i decided to seek the services of a doctor of chinese medicine who put me on a regimen of nutrients it took several months but as a result of the vitamins and hormones i completely recovered and for the last year have never felt better in my life just a suggestion a b curtiss dear a b thank you for your thoughtful , considered responses i will immediately forward this suggestion to my cousin we just spent a lovely day together i confess i prayed for the right moment to share your writing and answers with her i primed the pump by sharing with her some of your wonderful poetry and exquisite illustrations shel silverstein has been replaced i have shared your work with other family members , and we are all praying that she will take your writings and experiences to heart i 've ordered depression is a choice , and look forward to reading it thank you for your guidance warm regards , m
