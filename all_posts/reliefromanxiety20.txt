i have been writing this blog anonymously for over four years and i do often think about revealing a picture of myself , but i ca n't just yet i have absolutely no problem in talking about my mental illness i have told employers , the whole internet and people who want to know of course , i do n't just go up to people and tell them but only if they ask or if it were to come up in conversation the depth of detail that i go into also depends on the circumstances however even after four years of sharing my journey with the world , i still have n't shared a picture of myself or a youtube video this is not because i am ashamed of my illness far from it it is because of my planned future job in which i am disclosing my mental health and have done in work experience in the field the job i am applying for cannot be associated with being known and recognised by many people perhaps if i am given the all clear to do this , i would be more than happy to do so but until that point , in spite of my dream career and giving it all that i 've got i will have to remain anonymous for now i'm hoping the big reveal wo n't be too far away ! amy xx
