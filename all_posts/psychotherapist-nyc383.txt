while most people understand that childhood trauma , including emotional neglect , abuse and unmet childhood emotional needs , can create problems for them as adults , many people who had childhood trauma feel powerless to stop these problems from repeating in their adult lives resolving childhood trauma to have healthier adult relationships current emotional problems as an adult are often rooted in childhood trauma many people who live their lives from one crisis to the next are so immersed in their day to day problems that it 's hard for them to see that the core of many of their current problems are rooted in the past of course , this is understandable because it 's often very hard , when you 're immersed in a crisis , to look beyond the current problem to gain perspective current emotional problems are often rooted in childhood trauma but for many people , who are able to develop a perspective about how their childhood trauma affects them now , getting psychological help with emdr therapy , a mind body oriented form of psychotherapy , has been very helpful let 's take a look at a vignette , which is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality ina when ina , a woman in her mid s , came to therapy , she was feeling hopeless about her life in the past , she had been through cognitive behavioral therapy cbt and she learned important coping skills and learned a lot about how her thoughts affected her emotionally but even though she had gained some insight into her problems , she continued to live her life from one crisis to the next and having insight did n't change this , much to her frustration the current crisis was that , even though she was established in her profession and she earned a good income , she was constantly on edge financially she was behind in her mortgage and owed thousands in credit card expenses on the surface , ina 's problems did n't add up it was n't that she did n't make enough money to pay her bills it was only after we explored her dynamics in her current relationship that the underlying link to her traumatic childhood became obvious ina 's current problems were rooted in childhood trauma ina 's pattern in relationships , which she acknowledged , was to choose men that she had to rescue often , her boyfriends were unemployed and unwilling to work usually , her relationships would begin with her boyfriend coming across like a loving , emotionally supportive man this is what usually drew ina to each of them because she was a lonely child for most of her childhood and continued to feel lonely through much of her adult life when she was n't in a relationship so , having someone that was loving and affectionate was very appealing to ina , as it would be to most people but within a short while , inevitably , things would turn around the man who seemed so caring and affectionate would turn out to be someone who was emotionally and financially dependent upon ina the pattern was usually the same after a couple of months , her boyfriend 's underlying emotional problems would surface and ina would feel obligated to do anything possible to rescue her current boyfriend within a short time , ina was emotionally , physically and financially drained by her current relationship she was also helping her boyfriend to the point where she was hurting herself financially but she was unable to extricate herself , and she felt like she was drowning emotionally ina 's current relationship fit the pattern but , in many ways , it was worse she noticed lately that a couple of her expensive pieces of jewelry were missing as hard as it was for her to think about it , she knew that her boyfriend stole them he was the only one who was in her apartment during the last month or so when she last saw the jewelry this was a terrible dilemma for ina on the one hand , she was angry and hurt that her boyfriend took the jewelry , which was given to her by her grandmother , who died several years ago but , on the other hand , ina felt too guilty to confront him about it she knew that her boyfriend , who refused to work , probably pawned her jewelry she also suspected that he might have a drug problem that he was hiding from her as we discussed this theft , ina made a lot of excuses for her boyfriend he had a difficult childhood , no one ever loved him , and he just could n't get a break in life she felt she could n't be another person who hurt him by confronting him about the theft logically , ina knew that she was making up excuses she realized that if a close friend told her this story , she could see that her friend 's boyfriend was taking advantage of her but , despite seeing this and knowing logically from her prior cbt therapy that her thinking was distorted , on an emotional level , her feelings about her boyfriend made sense to her it was a very painful dilemma of her , and she wondered if she would ever be able to overcome these problems emdr is often an effective therapy to resolve trauma it has been my experience as a therapist , who is trained in psychodynamic and cbt therapy , that often when childhood trauma is at the root of current problems , clients who can see their problems are unable to make the necessary changes to resolve the type of problems described in the scenario above emdr is an effective therapy to resolve trauma it 's not that cbt and psychodynamic therapy do n't ever work for trauma both forms of therapy are often helpful but for many clients , who have insight into the underlying issues and the distortions in their thinking , their insight and understanding alone do n't result in their being able to make changes so they can stop cycle of their problems in my article
