the experience of sunday 's marathon is still with me i suppose i could be accused of hanging onto the glow a bit too long , but i do n't care i am still so pleased with how i ran i'm pleased i stuck to my plan and ran conservatively early , which allowed me to run fast at the end i'm pleased i felt good throughout the run i'm pleased the entire race felt fairly easy and i'm really pleased with the result ! i hope i feel this good after grandmas marathon next month i am feeling more confident about the possibility of running well at grandmas now if i train smart between now and then , i hope to run a personal best i think that 's a realistic goal , so i'm going to go for it that will mean less fun and more pain , but if i can do it , i may glow for a whole week afterward ! i just got in from my first run since the marathon i went miles , which was probably miles too far based on how tired my legs were during the last few miles they were probably a little tired already , as i went to my kettlebell class last night and got a heck of a workout ! it 's actually nice to sit down it 's my day off , and i 've had a very busy day full of appointments and cleaning and errands but my laundry is done , my house is clean , my refrigerator is full , and my errands are run it 's nice to have a day off during the week to do all of these things i like being productive it 's very satisfying well , that 's all i 've got for now my mood remains good things are going well life goes on keep moving forward , my friends
