i 've had many people come and go in my life it 's fair to say that , good or bad , i 've learned something from each and every relationship yesterday was a particularly difficult parting my friend , kmc , who i wrote about recently , succumbed to a brain tumor last week her memorial service was yesterday it was a difficult goodbye kmc and i spent many , many hours together throughout the early and middle years of my sobriety she was my sponsor and friend she took me through the steps of our recovery program she taught me how to live life on life 's terms she gave me the tools to live in this world without fear , anger and resentment instead she imparted faith , gratitude and serenity somehow i missed those lessons growing up , and if it was n't for kmc , i might still be miserable , or worse , dead the church was filled to the rafters yesterday women , especially , were well represented that made perfect sense to me , as kmc had a tremendous impact on countless women in this community in working her program , she was a role model she had her share of struggles , as have we all , but she eventually came through them , standing tall , and in the process gave us all more to contemplate and to emulate the representation of grateful , sober women at kmc 's service yesterday was a testament to a life well lived i will miss my sponsor , my mentor , my teacher , my friend i have no doubt i would n't have the life i have today had kmc not spent those countless hours teaching me i will never forget her she is with me every time i speak up in a meeting , every time i sit down with a newly sober woman , every time i share my experience , strength and hope she is part of my journey in passing on her teachings , kmc will never be far from my heart rest in peace , my friend
