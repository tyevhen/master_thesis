for many adults , especially during times of crisis , there comes a time when they contemplate their faith of origin in a new light this often occurs after decades of having bitterly rejected a belief system from childhood it 's not unusual for people who are reevaluating their faith of origin to be surprised and confused that they 're even considering returning to their childhood religion , not realizing that this is a common experience for many people at certain stages in their lives what 's even more surprising for some people is that their childhood faith still resonates for them emotionally on some level spirituality are you contemplating your faith of origin in a new light ? how does this happen ? well , as you can imagine , this process is different for everyone however , it often occurs during major life transitions or during difficult times for some people , it can occur because they feel adrift in life without a spiritual anchor it may be that there were aspects of their childhood religion that they miss at a younger age , they might not have had the ability to overcome the challenge of holding onto what they liked and rejecting what did n't resonate they took an all or nothing attitude but now , either due to an emotional crisis , a life transition or a longing to feel a deeper spiritual connection , they 're willing torevisit these issues with an open mind you might find that there are aspects of your faith of origin that you miss for many people growing up as children where they had no choice about participating in the family religion , rejecting their faith of origin was part of becoming independent from their families this rejection was part of becoming an adult who could make his or her own choices in life it was part of declaring themselves as autonomous individuals as young adults , they might have felt that they closed the door on their faith of origin , never to be opened again and yet , as an older adult , when they feel secure in their independence , there 's no longer a need to take such an absolute stand , and they 're usually surprised to realize that they 're missing parts or all of their former religion what once seemed to have no meaning to them now seems to hold some significance after all contemplating your faith of origin can be a challenging process with many confusing feelings it can challenge your sense of self and long held beliefs it can also be a time of feeling newly inspired it all depends on how you approach this process with patience , empathy for yourself and a healthy sense of curiosity , it can be a time when time of spiritual and emotional renewal with patience and empathy for yourself , contemplating your faith of origin can be a time of emotional and spiritual renewal it 's often comforting to know that many people , especially during middle age or later , go through this reevaluation process about their childhood religion if you 're willing to spend time contemplating what still remains true for you , what you want to keep from your faith of origin , and what you might want to let go of , you may find a lost part of yourself you might discover that your childhood belief system is still intact in some form you might find yourself reconsidering childhood beliefs in a new light with a more nuanced adult understanding for many people , this gives new meaning to their lives and helps them to feel more emotionally integrated contemplating your faith of origin spiritual renewal spirituality is an important part of many people 's lives whether they 're reclaiming their faith of origin on their own terms now or they 're exploring new beliefs , it can be an emotionally rewarding time if you can be compassionate with yourself , tolerate the uncertainties that are often inherent in the process , and allow this process to unfold in a way that 's right for you if you 're contemplating your faith of origin , allow this process to unfold in a way that' s right for you i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist i provide psychotherapy services to individual adults and couples , including talk therapy , hypnotherapy , emdr , and somatic experiencing i have helped many clients to explore and reconcile their spiritual beliefs in a way that are meaningful to them to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at photo credit eddi van w via photopin cc photo credit duckmarx via photopin cc photo credit scott ableman via photopin cc photo credit wonderlane via photopin cc
