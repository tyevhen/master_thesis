the economic view in this previous post now looks prescient , however unoriginal from march , ' yesterday we went to van damme state park beach to exercise kenyon he continues to limp on his left forelimb , which the vet diagnosed as osteoarthritis no need even for x rays yet it still grieves us to watch him lope unevenly rather than run outright at the beach we tossed a chartreuse tennis ball into the little river and watched him swim and fetch , gradually working up to the ocean , where he braved bigger and bigger waves to fetch his ball because he has one cataract his vision is not as keen as formerly , so we also use a green up bottle half filled with water for fetching kathleen and i also engaged in a little batting practice with a piece of driftwood and kenyon s soggy tennis ball she hit it hard twice but more often whiffed , for which i blame my pitching kenyon meanwhile played catcher and chased down every missed ball before grudgingly , and with much encouragement , returning it to the pitcher the good news is that kenyon s personality has made quite a comeback , overcoming his canine ptsd in increments he will now wander out back of our motel without accompaniment , though most of the time he still stays very close to kathleen when we come home he now greets us with as many items as he can stuff in his mouth , including his favorite sock and rawhide bone sometimes he gets two socks in his mouth but it s hard to add the tennis ball he s been up in our bed to be doted upon but has trouble climbing up without help it s always the left front leg that gives him trouble i suggested a neoprene sleeve support to the vet , but she d never heard of such a thing , so i think i may go to the local dive shop and have them make one as we were preparing to leave the beach yesterday , kenyon happily tired out from his swim and fetch session , we noticed a mottled brown seagull flopping around in the parking lot from a distance it appeared to have a broken right leg on closer inspection i noted that it had been hamstrung by a long leader used for salmon trolling which i believe is out of season and illegal now , including a hook through his right flipper and one deep in his gullet i threw a towel over the bird and lifted it carefully into a box in the back of our beat up van as we drove back to fort bragg he escaped from his box and began fluttering amidst the luggage in the back which made me feel like tippie hedren in a phone booth kathleen steadied kenyon but he wasn t terribly interested , once again confident that he is the center of the universe returning to the motel , i called a number of state agencies for wildlife rehabilitation , only to receive the final recommendation that i should call a local vet your government at work save the teacher s union , not the seagulls as all the vets offices had closed , and being a qualified physician and surgeon myself , i thought it would be easier if i did the job with the help of suzanne , our motel manager , and kathleen , i was able to remove both hooks and untangle the leaders and snap swivels from the bird s right wing its tongue had been partially severed in the middle by the fishing line the hooks were large and of stainless steel , so wire cutters were of no use i had to crimp the barbs and back the hooks out , which worked , although benny i named him afterwards but his pronoun will now change from it to he , though i have no idea how to determine the sex of a seagull was obviously in pain during the operation on his gullet i did learn that the pressure of a seagull s bite is not powerful enough to seriously injure a human finger , although it can be impressive to the uninitiated i wore gloves in any case afterwards kathleen soaked the gloves in detergent only then did i realize that benny might have given us the bird flu ! oh well i wouldn t have done anything different if he were the first north american case except to wear a mask and quarantine him i don t recall any cases in seagulls or vultures anyway , as their scavenging ways require a very aggressive immune system i let benny down in the storeroom after the operation and he could walk normally again , but i wasn t sure he could fly suzanne suggested we keep him in a box overnight to rest this morning i released him and he seemed dazed i gave him some bread and sardines and he ate them , though his aim in locating the morsels seemed a little unsure concerned that he couldn t fly , i gave chase to him on foot , feeling like rocky balboa , only to see him take off from the parking lot , whirl around the trees at low altitude , and then land in the middle of highway what a bird brain is benny ! kathleen and i raced to the median and held up cars in order to shoo him off the road in the gas station across the street i couldn t capture him with a towel , but he finally took off and flew back across the road there he located a pool of fresh water flowing by the curb and drank his fill i watched him a little longer before leaving him to his own wiles and the elements yesterday we learned that we d been declined as tenants for a second hoped for rental , and we know it s our credit scores doing the damage as mad poets , kathleen and i are occasionally seized by guilt at our joint unreliability when confronting the mechanics of modern reality we ve owned three houses between us and have nothing to show for it we ve both been through bankruptcies in mexico we spent way too much money , including the little amount of equity by today s housing market standards we managed to recover when we sold our re financed condo sitting on the bed together , admitting our lifetime lack of interest in things material as well as our failure to cross the t s and dot the i s of modern living we have no health and i have no life insurance , though we do have car insurance , kathleen remarked , it s not so bad , craig that s just who we are we saved a seagull in distress that other people at the state park ignored we helped bring back kenyon s health we had a good day and you know , she s right we are truly god s children , and though that s no excuse for not doing better in the real , material world , we re just the kind of people who more easily give away a dollar than pinch a penny we do , however , believe in karma , that the good we ve done in our lives though it will not insulate us against suffering as this blog has pointedly illustrated will ultimately rebound to us in times of need and it has cast your bread upon the waters seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added to you behold the lilies of the field and so on for us this is not an excuse but a matter of faith we are not in denial about not building bigger barns we re just not very good at it , but god is faithful even to the foolish now i did pay all our bills yesterday , including half of the money my sister loaned me short term when child support services left us penniless again two weeks ago , and i am current with the car payment , the motel bill , the storage payment , and child support , so it s not as if we re totally irresponsible what truly galls me is that three years ago , when we sold the condo , i was entirely debt free but when i went to purchase a car , i couldn t get a decent loan because , god , of all things , i had no credit no payment records a debtless soul thereby i learned again the logic of american consumerism if you can t be trusted to keep on borrowing , we can t trust you to keep on lending so a word to the wise do not become debt free pay your credit card bills on time in fact , it s best to run up large bills and make large payments for at least six months to improve your credit but never , never get entirely out of debt or the system will punish you for your frugality and remember our great example a government of the consumer , by the consumer , and for the consumer , shall not perish from the earth , as congress has just raised the national debt ceiling to nine trillion dollars , , , , more eggs than a million seagulls could lay in a lifetime still the thinking goes that compared to our yearly gnp it s not that bad besides , if american credit goes down the drain , the global economy will tank as well , because those who have invested in our debt , like china and japan , would be shaken to the core thus they would do anything to prop up the credit of the u s , as we are all so economically intertwined like mating snakes the moral of my story ? a penny borrowed is two pennies earned and don t waste your life on wounded seagulls unless you re willing to pay the price thine as ever , c e chaffin
