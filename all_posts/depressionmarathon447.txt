when did i get so busy ? oh my ! i made a decision to go see d in milwaukee this weekend , which means leaving for the hour drive after work on friday typically , i use the thursday before i leave , which is usually my day off , to clean my house , do my laundry , pack jet and i for the trip , and go for my hard run but for some reason , i agreed to work tomorrow morning , at a building which is an hour west of here , and then i have a late afternoon , early evening continuing education class at a building which is an hour east of here ! in between , i need to fit in my hard run i have no idea when i 'll clean , do laundry , or pack ! of course , i could have done some of those things today , but this also happens to be the first week of my evening exercise class , which left me with little time tonight in fact , after a long day at work today , i arrived home late , fell asleep on my sofa and almost missed my class ! oh , and i'm taking care of my friend 's fish tank this week , which is not a big deal , but it 's another jaunt down the road i must squeeze into each day the decision to go away for the weekend has resulted in a ripple effect of busy ness i'm a little overwhelmed and slightly concerned , but so far i guess i'm managing fairly well now , if i could just find some clean clothes and a moment to pack them !
