look at the size of this medal ! and that was just for finishing ! i ca n't imagine what the winner 's awards looked like ! this was easily the nicest , and heaviest , medal i 'd ever received my mom was right this was at miles , and i look a hell of a lot better than i felt ! remember , at this point , i was thinking i 'd walk the rest of the way if i made it to miles ! my friend , kate in white , also had a tough day she said by this point , miles , she was concentrating on just putting one foot in front of the other i think you can see that in her downward gaze grimacing as i approach the finish i think that grimace came out around mile , and it never went away ! and here i am coming into the finish line i'm running hard because i know it 's almost over ! !
