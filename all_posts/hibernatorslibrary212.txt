one of the most difficult tasks for mental health workers is to clinically assess and diagnose mental illnesses especially when comorbidity having more than one mental illness is so common it usually begins with a psychological assessment through tests , observation , and interviews so the clinician can catalog the symptoms then the dsm is consulted to give the diagnosis a clinician may focus the assessment in three ways biological , psychodynamic , and behaviorally biological approach for the sake of appropriate treatment , it is very important to make sure that the symptoms are not due to a physical rather than a mental illness in my experience , many doctors shrug off certain types of symptoms as those of a mentally ill patient for instance , when i fainted at work a while back i was told it was anxiety and because it was diagnosed as a mental problem , my insurance did n't pay but that 's a problem to discuss on another day granted , my fainting spell could have been anxiety induced , but it could have been many things a more extreme example that i heard of from a doctor at a large university hospital was that a foreign patient i ca n't remember his origin kept coming in complaining that there was a worm in his head the doctors kept shunting him off to mental health eventually , the man came back and said there 's a worm in my eye ! they looked , and sure enough there was a worm in his eye possibly something like this ? yeah sometimes the patient knows what he 's talking about of course generally there are n't really worms in people 's heads but symptoms that seem mental could be due to head injuries , strokes , seizures , etc there are a number of brain scans that can be performed to check for such problems one is computerized axial tomography cat scan , which moves x ray beam around the head to create a d image of the brain cat scans have become more rare because of the availability of magnetic resonance imaging mri mri quantifies magnetic fields affecting varying amounts of water content in tissue , thus giving a sharp image of different structures or lesions tumors in the brain another brain imaging technique is the positron emission tomography pet scan pet scans measure the metabolic activity in the brain , thus allowing more clear cut diagnoses to be made pet can reveal problems that are not anatomically obvious however , the images in pet images are low fidelity and the scans are prohibitively expensive functional mri fmri measures blood flow of specific areas of tissues , thus providing information about which areas of the brain are active fmri is the scan that helps researchers discover which parts of the brain are important for certain types of thoughts or activities at the moment , it is more important in the research than in the clinical world , but there is some optimism that fmri might eventually be used to map cognitive processes in mental disorders sometimes , a lesion has n't developed enough to be recognizable by brain scans in this case , neuropsychological tests can be performed to quantify a person 's cognitive , perceptual , and motor performance to determine what parts of the brain might be affected the neuropsychological assessment usually involves a battery of tests such as the halstead reitan assessment for adults this assessment is composed of tests halstead category test measures learning , memory , judgement , and impulsivity patient hears a prompt and selects a number a right choice gets a pleasent bell sound and a wrong choice gets a buzzer patient must determine the underlying pattern in prompt number combinations tactual performance test measures motor speed , response to the unfamiliar , and the ability to use tactile kinesthetic cues a blindfolded patient is asked to place blocks in the correct spaces on a board then she draws the board from memory , without ever seeing the board rhythm test measures attention and concentration the patient listens to pairs of rhythmic beats and must determine whether the pairs are the same or different speech sounds perception test determines whether patient can identify spoken words , and measures concentration , attention , and comprehension nonsense words are spoken , and the patient must choose the word from a list of four printed words finger oscillation task measures the speed at which the patient can press a lever this is a series of posts summarizing what i'm learning in my abnormal psychology course much of the information provided comes from reading my james n butcher 's textbook abnormal psychology to read the other posts , follow these links the definition of abnormal a history of abnormal psychology abnormal psychology in contemporary society contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness biology contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness psychology frontline new asylums brave new films this is crazy clinical mental health diagnosis biological assessment clinical mental health diagnosis psychological assessment does the dsm encourage overmedication ?
