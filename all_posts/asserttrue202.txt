the subject of whether antidepressants increase or decrease suicide risk is a complicated one , and the literature on this subject remains conflicted a study published in , covering the period to , found that u s suicides decreased at a time when antidepressant use rose four fold the authors concluded , rather prematurely the decline in the national suicide rate appears to be associated with greater use of non tricyclic antidepressants those results have to be considered invalid , however , because from to today , suicides and suicide rates in the u s have increased every year , despite increasing use of antidepressants the current rate of suicides per , americans per year is higher than before ssris were introduced are we to conlcude , now , that antidepressants are causing suicide rates to go up ? that , too , would be premature we know suicide rates increase with age , and the u s population is growing older therefore , the ever increasing suicide rate from to today reflects expected demographic trends in antidepressants and the risk of suicidal behaviors , jama jul , boston university school of medicine researchers h jick h , j a kaye , and s s jick looked at suicide and suicidal behaviors in a population of , first time users of four antidepressant drugs they found a fold increase in risk of suicidal behavior in antidepressant users in the first days after starting a prescription that 's not the shocker the shocker is that when they looked at risk of completed suicide in people who had started antidepressant drugs within days , versus people who had been on drugs days or more , there was a fold increased risk for the former versus the latter the drugs in question were elavil , prozac , paxil , and the tricyclic dothiepin , which has been sold in various countries as prothiaden , dothep , thaden , or dopress it is not sold in the united states it 's worth noting anecdotally that robin williams had started seroquel just eight days before his death by suicide he was also taking remeron , an older serotonergic antidepressant you can choose to look at his death as a fluke , if you want , or something that would have happened anyway , with or without drugs we may never know for sure what really happened why the increased risk in the first nine days of treatment ? various theories about this rollback phenomenon were discussed in a previous post accepted medical wisdom going back at least years says that when severely depressed patients are activated by treatment , they go from avolitional to volitional and act out preexisting desires to inflict self harm this ancient theory needs to be reconsidered , however , as it was formulated back in the days when clinical depression was indeed severe and involved psychomotor retardation today 's user of paxil , prozac , etc is not that kind of patient the overwhelming majority of depressive patients today suffer a less severe depression , often diagnosed by a family doctor rather than a psychiatrist activation no doubt accounts for some small percentage of self harm incidents the other theories that need to be considered involve drug induced worsening of depression , and or severe akathisia reactions which occur roughly to of the time , possibly also coupled with insomnia which is known to bring a suicide risk in and of itself we can argue about the reasons , but the fact is , many people find that with antidepressants , they get worse before they get better the drugs are no panacea they work for about a third of users this was the principle finding of the million , year star d study , and it 's also born out by clinical efficacy trials , especially those done in modern times in most antidepressant trials , a third of patients drop out of the trial rather than continue on the drug this too is consistent with the fact that some people find the drugs immediately disagreeable if you 're suffering , you should consider trying antidepressants , but only do so under close medical supevision and be aware that many people get worse before they get better buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
