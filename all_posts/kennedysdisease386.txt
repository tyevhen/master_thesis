things continue to go well for me i averaged minutes of exercises every other day i continue to do a short minute exercise program on the light days the minutes is up minutes from my previous average i did not have a down day this last month i believe that is one of the greatest benefits for me i have not experienced any side effects that i am aware of also , about a year ago we were considering have the bathroom remodeled because i was having difficulty getting into and out of the shower lip that has not been an issue since starting dutasteride someone asked recently if i am stronger i can only give a subjective response to that question since i have not been tested i feel stronger than i did a year ago my exercise program is longer and more intensive without any noticeable side effects i have not fallen in the last year even though i am on my feet a lot more i haven t experienced what i call a slide in a long time and boy is that a great feeling on the flip side , a friend who is also taking dutasteride is considering stopping he wrote yesterday , i am considering stopping it i have had my worst months ever i have pain in my hands which i have never had before and i generally seem to have much less energy i know everyone can react differently but are you aware of anyone else who has stopped this medication for side effects any comments welcome a question if you have had any positive or negative experiences using dutasteride please let me know soon i will have my one year review with my doctor it will be interesting what he says and my blood tests show
