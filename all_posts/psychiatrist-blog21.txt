the issue with mental illness and guns is so hard to explain to people while there have been mass shooters with mental illness , in very few cases does the mental illness serve to explain what happened , and statistically , you should be much more worried about being killed by your spouse , the car next to you on the highway , that extra pain pill you take especially if you take it with a sleeping pill or a drink , than you ever should be about a mentally ill mass shooter in a public place where the numbers of gun deaths rise is when you mix guns with substance abuse , especially in people prone to violence , anger , and impulsive actions suicide where people sometimes take action within minutes of making a now irreversible decision or accidental deaths where people are careless which may be higher in people with cognitive problems or who are abusing substances i had an editorial on a proposed repeal of a gun law this week , and the chicago tribune wrote on the same issue note their emphasis on mass shootings none of which pertained to this ruling as none of the shooters received social security disability payments and it did n't explain why someone would be on disability and might need a payee mine was not about violence but about common sense obviously i like mine better , but compare and see what you think , same issue , different arguments guns and mental illness do n't scrap this rule if someone has a mental illness severe enough that he cannot work or manage his own money , should he be allowed to own a gun ? chicagotribune com by editorial board
