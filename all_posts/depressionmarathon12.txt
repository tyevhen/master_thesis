i hate being sick , and boy have i been sick ! for days i 've had a painful cough , congestion , and body aches i 've been unable to work , exercise , or even get out of my house today i ca n't talk it 's been really rough i keep waiting for whatever this is , likely flu , to improve , but it just keeps hanging on and dragging me down enough already ! as a result of being sick and being stuck in the house , my mood has taken a little dip i have way too much time on my hands i have little to no energy to do anything with my time , yet i can only sleep so much so here i am , bored , and tired , and feeling under the weather for the sixth day in a row i'm not sure what to do with myself i hate what this prolonged illness is doing to my fitness and finances just as i was getting back up to speed in both areas this virus comes along and stops me in my tracks i 've missed days of work and days of exercise money and fitness flying out the window frustrating i'm reminding myself this is temporary i 'll feel better soon but i'm getting a little impatient i hate being sick
