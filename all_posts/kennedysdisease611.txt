on march , i wrote an article about the neck problems i was experiencing i received feedback from several people , all providing helpful thoughts and encouragements one person commented by sharing her experiences with her father , who has kennedy s disease even though i am normally against using devices , such as neck braces , something about her comments made me disregard my self made , and often prideful , rules i ve included susan s comment below the last paragraph and , specifically , the last two sentences are beautiful a message of hope to someone who is always trying to inspire others to believe and to hope thank you , susan , for reaching out to me with your message of hope at a time when i needed some hi bruce , thank you very much for your blog and your inspiring , patient and informative writing both here and on the kennedy 's disease forum my dad has kennedy 's disease we just discovered what it was , though he has experienced progressive weakness for years way back about years ago long before we knew what was going on , he started to experience weakness of his neck and could n't hold his head up so we not knowing what else to do bought a neck brace and he wore that every day to keep his head up and bruce , it went away i do n't remember how long it lasted exactly a couple or several months , not years i do n't know how or why nothing else has ever gone away all the other weakness has gotten slowly worse but after some time of wearing the neck brace around the clock , except while sleeping , he began to be able to hold his head up again and , amazingly , he has never had issues with it since and of course i pray this continues i know this is n't tremendously helpful , and certainly not scientific information it almost seems like a stroke of luck or miracle but i wanted to pass it along anyway maybe it has something to do with total rest for a while and you could try this ? or maybe i'm just passing it along as a reason to hold out some hope , which can also be good at least , after years fighting this alongside my dad , i 've started to like hope for hope 's sake with great respect and gratitude , susan photo credit forlife by taliesin
