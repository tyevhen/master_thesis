a good friend passed on a piece of writing to me the other day he had written a thoughtful note accompanying the literature heather , may you be inspired and charged up by these words , so many of which you already embody these words meant a lot to me to have such conscientious and sensitive friends is a gift that is priceless the piece of writing he gave to me was called of power and time by the american poet mary oliver it is taken from the book blue pastures , , harvest books i used to work in the best independent bookseller in canada before i embarked on the financially nomadic lifestyle of a full time artist my former employer and good friend , whose opinion i value highly , was a big fan of oliver 's i can now understand why this piece of writing has struck a huge chord with me it has changed me it is my new creative manifesto i will post a small section of it near my easel to read when energy or inspiration wane , when my cat tempts me to play with him , when interruptions come calling i have included the essay below for you to enjoy i do hope that it might serve to inspire you a little bit , to bring you to the easel with a bit more fervor , to neglect distraction in favor of one extra brushstroke , one more thoughtful turn of the wheel , one more moment doing what you love to do heather of power and time by mary oliver it is a silver morning like any other i am at my desk then the phone rings , or someone raps at the door i am deep in the machinery of my wits reluctantly i rise , i answer the phone or i open the door and the thought which i had in hand , or almost in hand , is gone creative work needs solitude it needs concentration , without interruptions it needs the whole sky to fly in , and no eye watching until it comes to that certainty which it aspires to , but does not necessarily have at once privacy , then a place apart a pace , to chew pencils , to scribble and erase and scribble again but just as often , if not more often , the interruption comes not from another but from the self itself , or some other self within the self , that whistles and pounds upon the door panels and tosses itself , splashing , into the pond of meditation and what does it have to say ? that you must phone the dentist , that you are out of mustard , that your uncle stanley s birthday is took weeks hence you react , of course then you return to your work , only to find that the imps of idea have fled back into the mist it is this internal fore this intimate interrupter whose tracks i would follow the world sheds , in the energetic way of an open and communal place , its many greetings , as a world should what quarrel can there be with that ? but that the self can interrupt the self and does is a darker and more curious matter i am , myself , three selves at least to begin with , there is the child i was certainly i am not that child anymore ! yet , distantly , or sometimes not so distantly , i can hear that child s voice i can feel its hope , or its distress it has not vanished powerful , egotistical , insinuating its presence rises , in memory , or from the steamy rivers of dreams it is not gone , not by a long shot it is with me in the present hour it will be with me in the grave and there is the attentive , social self this is the smiler and the doorkeeper this is the portion that winds the clock , that steers through the dailiness of life that keeps in mind appointments that must be made , and then met it is fettered to a thousand notion of obligation it moves across the hours of the day as though the movement itself were the whole task whether it gathers as it goes some branch of wisdom or delight , or nothing at all , is a matter with which it is hardly concerned what this self hears night and day , what it loves beyond all other songs , is the endless springing forward of the clock , those measures strict and vivacious , and full of certainty the clock ! that twelve figured moon skull , that white spider belly ! how serenely the hands move with their filigree pointers , and how steadily ! twelve hours , and twelve hours , and begin again ! eat , speak , sleep , cross a street , wash a dish ! the clock is still ticking all its vistas are just so broad are regular notice that word every day , twelve little bins in which to order disorderly life , and even more disorderly thought the town s clock cries out , and the face in every wrist hums or shines the world keeps pace with itself another day is passing , a regular and ordinary day notice that word also say you have bought a ticket on an airplane and you intend to fly from new york to san francisco what do you ask the pilot when you climb aboard and take your seat next to the little window , which you cannot open but through which you see the dizzying heights to which you are lifted from the secure and friendly earth ? most assuredly you want the pilot to be his regular and ordinary self you want him to approach and undertake his work with no more than a calm pleasure you want nothing fancy , nothing new you ask him to do , routinely , what he knows how to do fly and airplane you hope he will not daydream you hope he will not drift into some interesting meander of thought you want this flight to be ordinary , not extraordinary so , too , with the surgeon , and the ambulance driver , and the captain of the ship let all of them work , as ordinarily they do , in confident familiarity with whatever the work requires , and no more their ordinariness is the surety of the world their ordinariness makes the world go around i , too , live in this ordinary world i was born in it indeed , most of my education was intended to make me feel comfortable within it why that enterprise failed is another story such failures happen , and then , like all things , are turned to the world s benefit , for the world has a need of dreamers as well as shoe makers not that it is so simple , in fact for what shoemaker does not occasionally thump his thumb when his thoughts have , as we would say , wandered ? and when the old animal body clamors for attention , what daydreamer does not now and again have to step down from the daydream and hurry to market before it closes , or else go hungry ? and this is also true in creative work creative work of all kinds those who are the world s working artists are not trying to help the world go around , but forward which is something altogether different from the ordinary such work does not refute the ordinary it is , simply , something else its labor requires a different outlook a different set of priorities certainly there is within each of us a self that is neither a child , nor a servant of the hours it is a third self , occasional in some of us , tyrant in others this self is out of love with the ordinary it is out of love with time it has a hunger for eternity intellectual work sometimes , spiritual work certainly , artistic work always these are forces that fall within its grasp , forces that must travel beyond the realm of the hour and the restraint of the habit nor can the actual work be well separated from the entire life like the knights of the middle ages , there is little the creatively inclined person can to but to prepare himself , body and spirit , for the labor to come for his adventures are all unknown in truth , the work itself is an adventure and no artist could go about this work , or would want to , with less than extraordinary energy and concentration the extraordinary is what art is all about neither is it possible to control , or regulate , the machinery of creativity one must work with the creative powers for not to work with is to work against in art as in spiritual life there is no neutral place especially at the beginning , there is a need of discipline as well as solitude and concentration a writing schedule is a good suggestion to make to young writers , for example also , it is enough to tell them would one tell them so soon the whole truth , that one must be ready at all hours , and always , that the ideas in their shimmering forms , in spite of all our conscious discipline , will come when they will , and on the swift upheaval of their wings disorderly reckless as unmanageable , sometimes , as passion no one yet has made a list of places where the extraordinary may happen and where it may not still , there are indications among crowds , in drawing rooms , among easements and comforts and pleasures , it is seldom seen it likes the out of doors it likes the concentrating mind it likes solitude it is more likely to stick to the risk taker than the ticket taker it isn t that it would disparage comforts , or the set routines of the world , but that its concern is directed to another place its concern is the edge , and the making of a form out of the formlessness that is beyond the edge of this can there can be no question creative work requires a loyalty as complete as the loyalty of water to the force of gravity a person trudging through the wilderness of creation who does no know tis who does not swallow this is lost he who does not crave that roofless place eternity should stay at home such a person is perfectly worthy , and useful , and even beautiful , but is not an artist such a person had better live with timely ambitions and finished work formed for the sparkle of the moment only such a person had better go off and fly an airplane there is a notion that creative people are absent minded , reckless , heedless of social customs and obligations it is , hopefully , true for they are in another world altogether it is a world where the third self is governor neither is the purity of art the innocence of childhood , if there is such a thing one s life as a child , with all its emotional rages and ranges , is but grass for the winged horse it must be chewed well in those savage teeth there are irreconcilable differences between acknowledging and examining the fabulations of one s past and dressing them up as though they were adult figures , fit for art , which they never will be the working , concentrating artist is an adult who refuses interruption from himself , who remains absorbed and energized in and by the work who is thus responsible to the work on any morning or afternoon , serious interruptions to work , therefore , are never the inopportune , cheerful , even loving interruptions which come to us from another serious interruptions come from the watchful eye we cast upon ourselves there is the blow that knocks the arrow from its mark ! there is the drag we throw over our own intentions there is the interruption to be feared ! it is six a m , and i am working i am absent minded , reckless , heedless of social obligations , etc it is as it must be the tire goes flat , the tooth falls out , there will be a hundred meals without mustard the poem gets written i have wrestled with the angel and i am stained with light and i have no shame neither do i have guilt my responsibility is not to the ordinary , or the timely it does not include mustard , or teeth it does not extend to the lost button , or the beans in the pot my loyalty is to the inner vision , wherever and howsoever it may arrive if i have a meeting with you at three o clock , rejoice if i am late rejoice even more if i do not arrive at all there is no other way work of artistic worth can be done and the occasional success , to the striver , is worth everything the most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work , who felt their own creative power restive and uprising , and gave it neither power nor time
