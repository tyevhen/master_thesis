a new study published in the annals of internal medicine demonstrated that risperidone risperdal was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in people who had not responded to a prior course of antidepressant treatment but how effective ? what is the marketing angle ? how does this tie in with invega ? let 's find out what is effective ? people who were not responding to their current antidepressant were assigned to receive risperidone or placebo as an add on to their current antidepressant treatment on average , people taking risperdal improved by points on the hamilton depression rating scale ham d relative to people taking placebo look over the scale and tell me if you think points is a very meaningful difference decide for yourself yes , the difference was statistically significant , and when a sample size contains people spilt between two groups , it is common for a small difference to be statistically significant similarly small in some cases moderate , but statistically significant , differences were found on other measures assessing overall mental health , disability , and life satisfaction results in terms of response to treatment i e , getting better or more and remission no significant symptoms of depression were a little more encouraging , but not overwhelmingly so in sum , risperidone worked better than placebo as an add on to antidepressant treatment by a small to moderate margin so far , so good lies , damned lies , and statistics here 's two quotes from the discussion section in our study , risperidone augmentation offered statistically significant benefit on multiple measures within week , and the magnitude of benefit appeared to increase steadily throughout the study our findings suggest that risperidone augmentation is well tolerated and has beneficial effects early in the course of treatment among patients who do not respond to initial therapy investigators have reported that early symptom improvement during the first week of therapy may predict eventualremission , a key ultimate treatment objective not to be a stickler for details , but at the end of week , the average patient on risperdal was points better off on the ham d see above compared to the average patient on placebo yes , it 's statistically significant , but it 's pretty close to meaningless oh , and at week , the difference had shrunk to points and was no longer statistically significant so how did the magnitude of benefit appear to increase steadily throughout the study when the benefit decreased from week to week ? the benefit of risperidone over placebo did improve from a measly points on the ham d at week to a questionably meaningful points at week not sure that is a steadily increasing benefit worthy of much mention enter invega here 's another piece from the discussion although not evaluated in this trial , a new medication closely related to risperidone , extended release paliperidone , has hypothetical advantages related to its metabolism and delivery system , including reduced serum fluctuation , reduced peak exposure , and fewer cytochrome p related drug drug interactionswith widely used antidepressants awesome ! i was hoping they 'd mention invega paliperidone , the son of risperdal and i was not disappointed as you likely know , invega is the patent extender for janssen , as generic risperidone will soon make branded risperdal into a has been this is clearly an attempt to link the present study 's modestly positive results to invega you can bet your life savings that janssen reps will be pounding down doors attempting to convince docs that invega is just like risperdal but better because of some trumped up advantages , which will include some of the hypothetical advantages mentioned above so the study , published in a highly respected journal , goes to show that a product just like invega works as an antidepressant , but invega gives you the efficacy of risperdal in a new , improved formulation note to peer reviewers you 're not actually obligated to run marketing tripe for janssen there was not a single reference cited to support the hypothetical advantages of invega not one in the future , i think such statements that lack supporting data should be excluded from your journal this is supposed to be about science , not marketing , right ? where did the key opinion leaders go ? a previous trial examined risperidone as an antidepressant , generally finding the drug ineffective , though one had to look closely to notice the use of tricky statistics , in the trial the prior trial was also noteworthy for its authorship line , which apparently included people whose contributions to the study seemed minimal in addition , the order of the authors switched around in suspicious ways as the data moved around from being presented at conferences to being published , in the present study , key opinion leaders are nowhere to be found in the authorship line i know that people at janssen read my prior posts regarding the prior study perhaps they have learned that someone is watching them and that adding authors for the sake of marketing lending a veneer of independence and credibility to an industry funded study may well become public knowledge , making them look like used car salespeople in any case , i appreciate that there were no academic authors thrown on the authorship line as a means of boosting the credibility of the present study now i'm off to snort a couple of seroquel to deal with all of this marketing trickery rumor has it that seroquel can be a pretty good high
