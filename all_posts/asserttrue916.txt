i owe this one to my colleague stephen holmes in dublin , who today pointed me at the freely downloadable version of ross anderson 's superb security engineering this is without a doubt one of the finest free online books of any kind that i 've ever seen , beyond being a celebrated classic in security circles for several years now the author is a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge 's computer laboratory even so , he writes entertainingly the chapters are individually downloadable , or you can shag the whole book for a quick look , i recommend chapter which had me utterly spellbound
