i get alot of emails from readers asking questions about certain aspects of their anxiety i feel like i write novel length replies sometimes its like texting , sometimes its just easier to call the person instead of typing everything out this morning the idea struck me to start a local support group something where we can just get together to talk about how we are dealing with our anxiety , a place to find friends that share the same problems and offer support to each other here are a few benefits of support group memberships members become part of a collective voice the group is non judgemental this creates a safe environment for members to disclose their problems members become more informed builds confidence for coping being able to discuss their circumstances enables members to look at how they cope , think about the advantages and disadvantages associated and adapt their coping strategies development of skills improved communication i 've done a little research and have only found one local support group in provo , utah which for me is a good minutes away so i am thinking about starting one in the salt lake area although from what i have read they say its good to get a few people interested in starting one to form a little team as opposed to doing it on your own so two questions if you live in the salt lake city utah area , is this something you would be interested in attending , and if so , is this something you would want to help out with starting ? just testing the waters if you would like to contact me as opposed to leaving a comment , you can email me here if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like join my online anxiety support group ! support group october sign up why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? ever thought about therapy by phone ? linkwithin
