whew a bit of a hiatus there i had n't quite realized how much i had overextended myself until decamping to texas for some serious sitting around there i had all sorts of unrealized ambitious plans to read and get caught up , visit some local crossfits , answer some emails , etc i did very little at all besides the holiday stuff , a handful of morning runs , and reading some fiction since the whole family was recovering from a steady onslaught of viral preschool nastiness that began before thanksgiving , i sorely needed the rest a very mild but persistent case of walking pneumonia had settled in , so it was nice to take it easy and finally get well in the midst of the sitting around , i was able to visit two austin real food restaurants , hudson 's on the bend where i had rattlesnake cakes not gluten free but very tasty , and hudson 's has several gluten free options and foreign and domestic steak and pigs brains i have to say the brains at animal were better , but the steak at f d was fabulous , the yogurt with dill sauce sublime , and the atmosphere quintessential austin i'm told the noble pig is also excellent though it is a sandwich restaurant one of lance armstrong 's yellow jerseys at hudson 's on the bend pig brains and huckleberries yogurt with dill sauce perhaps the most ambitious thing i did all week was to go to the rail yard for the austin steam train association we were able to get a behind the scenes tour , and the kids were thrilled kids love trains , as do the adults at the austin steam train association at this point i have numerous articles and a large stack of books waiting to be read i'm hoping that without my class , my schedule will be a bit more forgiving you never know what will turn up , however , and the backlog of emails and to dos formidable !
