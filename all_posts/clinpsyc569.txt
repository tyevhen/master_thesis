wow , does pharma marketing blog have a great post today ! phrma and related industry groups have been complaining that the uk does n't approve drugs fast enough , which is of course causing untold suffering and death you have to see pharma marketing 's post here to appreciate the negative correlation between a nation 's frequency of using new drugs and its average lifespan i am fully aware that correlation does not imply causation , but the post really does indicate that big pharma 's claim that delays in approving drugs is likely not a serious problem at all
