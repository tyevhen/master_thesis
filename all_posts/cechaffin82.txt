i wanted to alert you to some new publications and readings here 's an essay in barefoot muse on intellectual substance in poetry there is a companion essay in umbrella i think i already told you about my memoir on becoming a poet in pif new poems in the avatar review and my upcoming readings first , poetry and pizza at montgomery at bush in sf on june at pm , hope some of you can come i 'll be at beyond baroque on july at pm , venice blvd , venice , ca for any in the la area more to come and thanks to all who have purchased my book like the reviews , i 've heard nothing but good reports ! as for my previous blog , hashing it out on paper has helped me make peace with ambition again it 's about the poem publishing and recognition are secondary , but i for one need the encouragement to go on so i do june gloom has hit mendocino and kathleen hates it the overcast days do n't affect my mood one way or the other then i'm nordic by descent there were some great comments on my last post if you have n't read them thanks mittens and beau blue ! since i find myself with little else to say , here 's a new poem i may have posted in rough draft form before but i doubt it ah memory , where hast thou gone ? of book trees first , do not pick a green book , the print is faint and there 's often no ending they also fail to develop the proper musk , that smell of paper and glue paperbacks mature more quickly but are usually known cultivars and lack the vigor of hybrids that hardbacks display still , where the soil is poor or shade diminishes the literary vigor of the tree , occasionally a masterpiece may appear these are usually grafted onto hardback stock as soon as possible pulp paperback trees have no peer and can produce more fruit than any other though as in a chinese meal you may be hungry afterwards the rules for nonfiction trees are simple lots of room and lots of light space them too close together and they share the same opinion give them too much shade and the research is n't up to par reference trees are orderly as beech forests , their tall smooth boles spaced widely , an air of gravity in the light that floods the oblong leaves silence and history walk there beware a brown book , usually overwritten or overripe , with stultifying reams of overexplanation and overelaboration as in how many paradoxes can fit on the head of a heading but you might find henry james there or the critical prose of eliot , so a discriminating taste in aged books should be cultivated not all their fruit is dry a red book should be picked immediately bright red has the genius of youth though shakespeare and dante come in gold and are common now , having been cultivated for centuries the bible is black but remember , licorice tea is sweet like the scroll jeremiah ate poetry trees are rare and do best in the high desert overwatering them leads to self indulgence while soil too rich yields verse in love with its own diction planted in unforgiving soil they have a chance , though most die young at kilobunny , ce
