i have just spent the evening with my friend , she gave me some photos of her baby i was really pleased she let me have them and i was making plans of where i was going to put them i put the photo on the seat next to me and drove home on the way home i stopped at the fisn 'n' chip shop to get some food i got in the car and placed these too on the seat next to me i worried for an instant about the greece going through but decided they would be ok because the chips were well wrapped and a little greece would wipe off in worse case scenario when i got out of the car i found that the heat from the chips had melted some of the print on the photos ok it was sad but only effected one of the pictures , i still had all the others i was sitting on the floor eating my chips from the paper and i knocked my drink all over the photos it has ruined the whole lot o the ink has washed off o ! ! it has ruined the whole lot to just rub salt in the wound the print from the photo is all over the rug i scrubbed on my hands and knees last week my automatic thoughts are just 'you never look after anything , you are so careless , x wo n't give you anymore , she should have given them to someone else' i feel so miserable about it ! ! o i'm trying to fight the automatic negative thoughts but i'm so tired i just want to cry still no word from the someone else , and the other guy seems to have lost interest too i am destined to be alone forever maybe it will seem better in the morning !
