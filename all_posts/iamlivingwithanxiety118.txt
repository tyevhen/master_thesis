i 've had a lot of counselors graduate students , phds , lsws i think maybe more than ten in ten years i 've learned something from each one well , except the guy who wanted to cure me in six sessions to appease my insurance one counselor who had anxiety problems herself was really helpful , but she decided to focus her practice on spirituality and relationships , so we had to part ways one thing they 've all told me about is the importance of flashcards basically , on index cards you write inspiring and hopeful messages to counter negative and anxious thoughts for example i am perfectly imperfect and that 's ok ! i trust myself so what if i'm feeling anxious this feeling will pass good for you for taking this head on and having the courage to do this when anxious , you review your flashcards , and you do this over and over the goal is to reprogram your brain to accept these messages to replace the anxious ones or at least that 's how i understand it for a long time , i did not like flashcards they just seemed to gimmicky to me i wanted to take a pill and be free from anxiety it took me a long time to realize that overcoming anxiety is not that easy medication can help some folks manage the symptoms , but overcoming anxiety also requires hard work brain work finally , two months ago i decided to give flashcards a shot at first , my response was very negative this is n't going to work but every time i was anxious , i would refer to them a quick reality check from that flood of anxious thoughts it took time , but now i'm starting to believe those hopeful messages i carry my flashcards with me and refer to them quite frequently i add new cards when i think of uplifting messages i wish i would have taken my counselors' advice about flashcards earlier but that 's the odd thing about living with anxiety at least for me you learn to live with it , and are skeptical of being free from it , even when people try to help but instead of letting anxiety influence so much of my life , i now want to focus on living instead of anxiety
