at least once a year i write an article about this important subject and , yesterday , while reading a book , i saw the following quote the only thing potentially worse than not being able to see the forest for the trees is not being able to see the trees because of the forest anonymous i loved this quote because it is so true we often become blinded with the little knowledge we have and miss important factors concerning our health this often happens because we just believe or want to associate most health issues with kennedy s disease twice in the last week i have received emails from men that related symptoms that are not normally associated with kennedy s disease i am happy men are asking rather than ignoring the symptoms so , let me say it again do not assume that every health issue is related to kennedy s disease consult with your family doctor and neurologist whenever a new symptom shows up that is not normally associated with this health condition in i wrote about this not everything is related to kd again in i addressed the issue in this article frequently asked questions and early this year i again reminded my readers not every health issue is related to kd each article takes a little different spin on the same subject the message can be reduced to seven words when in doubt have it checked out !
