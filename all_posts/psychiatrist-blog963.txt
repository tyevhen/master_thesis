roger lewin is a psychiatrist writer with a blog he writes fiction and poetry and about psychiatry i like people like this roger 's blog is so much simpler , quieter , and more elegant than shrink rap his home page has a single word welcome nowhere on his website is there a picture of his feet i 'll link to a really gentle , non fiction piece called the vicar of towson , where dr lewin talks about the vicarious life he lives listening to his patients proust wrote that the only real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new landscapes , but in having new eyes , in seeing the universe with the eyes of another , of hundreds of others , in seeing the hundreds of universes that each of them sees psychotherapy is an art of such listening that the other can world forth a world , this world being his world and have it shared , not statically , but so that it can live and breath , declare itself and grow psychotherapy is a partnership in presence a good psychotherapist is a gifted story listener he goes on each patient is a dream every way of living is a way of dreaming part of what language makes possible is that this waking dreaming should be able to be made sociable i listen to my patient talk about how hard his conscience makes life for him , finding fault with him wherever he goes i see a lonely little boy , one who does not know what he can count on i see myself as a lonely little boy
