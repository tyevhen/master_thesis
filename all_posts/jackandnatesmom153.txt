when i told my husband that i thought we should walk in the local th of july parade with the cisco center float he looked at me like i had gone mad we usually do n't take our kids to parades , let alone ask them to participate but i thought they could benefit from having this experience and figured that if ever we were going to try it , the safest way to do it would be while surrounded by about special needs childcare providers and about as many special needs families to those of you with neurotypical kids i should explain that a parade is nothing short of a sensory nightmare large crowds , unfamiliar faces , lots of waiting , people throwing or handing things to you , loud sirens , bands , flashing lights , and no clear escape route if things get to be too much jack has had several meltdowns at parades my thinking was that participating in a parade might actually be better than watching one at least this way , the faces surrounding the boys were familiar , they would have the same noises instead of constant changes and we got lucky yesterday since a christian band was on the float in front of us and they would be moving instead of sitting still so i packed like we were going off to war , slathered on the sunblock , put the wagon in the trunk and we gave it a go i would say the hardest part for the boys all of us really was waiting for the parade to start we were standing at the float for a good two hours before we actually moved that would be hard for any kid , let alone ours jack was trying to eat everything in sight , and nate , well he was just running everywhere he did pause to dance to the band next to us at one point though , which was ridiculously cute candy diving , but notice he has an apple too ! by the time we were ready to actually get moving , john and i decided it would be best to divide and conquer jack was really wound up , so he and john went to sit in the back of the truck this helped jack feel a bit more protected , and worked out pretty well , although he did apparently still have some trouble with all of the noises nate and i pulled wagon duty i was concerned about him staying in the wagon for the whole mile route , but he did pretty well i even had a little help nate had quite a few of the bystanders cracking up he was playing the role of contortionist in the wagon lying on his back , his tummy , sitting up , and his favorite , as shown below was dangling his legs over one side or the other also , most of the time he had one shoe off , which is his norm always the right one , but i ca n't even tell you how many people helpfully pointed it out people were so nice he did pretty well , but was ready to be done by the time it was over hey , me too ! so we made it all the way through ! we hitched a ride back to our car in the back of the truck roads were still closed and had a quiet afternoon especially him thanks cisco center for yet another great experience !
