my post on my fashion fears , which included photos of a look i'm currently loving , proved very popular , if you missed it please take a read here so , i thought why not write another ! here i tell you about how i enjoy styling my leopard print coat and flares i have always enjoyed clothes and fashion but two things held me back from embracing that love and displaying it in my wardrobe firstly , my fear of standing out , i used clothes as a method to blend in secondly my practical nature i'm so bad at justifying purchases ! 'it 's too expensive ' 'i wo n't wear it enough ' 'it wo n't stay in style for long enough ' 'i already own something remotely similar ' 'it 's too young ' 'it makes too much of a statement ' these are but a few of my excuses that 's if my anxiety did n't prevent me entering the shop in the first place even once i was in the shop and selected something safe and usually in the sale , i would often freak out in the changing room and end up fleeing in tears i have always been very self conscious of my appearance well this is the year i face those fears and enable myself to enjoy life including fashion and display the best version of kelly i will face those shops and changing rooms and i will select trend led pieces i may rarely wear purely because i love them and it 's fun i will style the clothes i buy and then pose for photos wearing them because if so many others can then why not me i'm feeling more comfortable in front of the camera already which is a revelation ! could n't resist a catalogue pose dare i hope my choices may inspire others , that would be wonderful either way i'm going to have fun and enjoy this new path so here is my second look that i 've styled for the blog , this look is based around my leopard print coat and flared jeans i have always loved leopard print i 've just never dared wear it i thought based on my new attitude i would n't merely dip my toe into the trend with an accessory i would jump straight in with a coat ! much as i still love my skinny jeans , i am glad the flared style is having a revival i think it suits my pear shape this pair are long so i team them with heeled ankle boots , on this day they were one of my black pairs they are quite a chunky pair which i think balances out the flare well a basic polo neck completes the look what do you think of my choices ? would you wear a leopard print coat and flares ? jacket new look polo neck marks and spencer jeans top shop boots red herring thanks for reading , kelly x suggested posts my exercise history or lack of my healthy eating journey
