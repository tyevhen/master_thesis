this morning i went for a run with my friend renee sounds simple no big deal but this was a gigantic big deal ! renee did n't realize this , but right up until the time i left my house i was filled with trepidation it is so scary for me to make plans with anyone when i'm in the midst of the darkness i ca n't keep my own schedule let alone involve another ! but when i scheduled a am run with renee , i did involve another , and that was the key i would n't have run if renee had n't been waiting in fact , i probably would n't have gotten out of bed that 's the easiest way out , after all , to roll over and go back to sleep but renee was waiting i could n't sleep i had to go this morning marked only the fourth run i 've accomplished since grandma 's marathon one month ago without renee , that number would still be three renee 's initiative broke up my isolation renee did n't allow me to stay away she sent two e mails offering a bike ride , swim or run she did n't offer advice she did n't suggest she could fix things she offered to share her time with me doing something i typically enjoy so despite my trepidation , i scheduled the date i am so grateful for renee 's initiative without her offer , i 'd still be in bed one of the most common questions people ask me is , what can i do to help my depressed friend or family member ? this week i was blessed with two friends who demonstrated the answer to that question be kind do what you would do for any other ill friend or family member pick a bouquet of flowers like my friend cindy did her flowers acknowledged my current struggle , which was validating and encouraging they were a bright fragrant addition to my home everyday they reminded me someone cared renee cared enough to share her time with me she got me out of the house and out of myself once we were running we just had fun and is n't that what friends are for to get outside ourselves ? to have fun ? it 's so simple , i say do for your friend with depression exactly what you would do if your friend had cancer be kind offer encouragement cook a meal mow the lawn do something enjoyable with your friend do n't advise acknowledge their reality resist the urge to fix it take a moment to be with them while also allowing them to just be i'm grateful for my friends today
