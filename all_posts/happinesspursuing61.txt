let s talk acne why ? why not i had this terrible bowl style hair cut as a kid my mom used to cut my hair to save money instead of putting a bowl over my head she d take a piece of scotch tape and stick it horizontally over my bangs then she d cut just above the tap leaving a straight line that left me looking for all the world like moe howard what s this have to do with acne , you ask well , when puberty hit the skin that for all of those years had been trapped under my bangs became a veritable mountain range of nasty puss filled bumps i had to make a decision change my hair style and risk the humiliation of displaying those nasty zits for a week or so while they recovered or grin an bear it with a hair style that i had suddenly realized was pretty silly looking my final solution was a flat top ! believe it or not but i actually thought that i looked pretty good with my head sculpted into a box it temporarily solved the zit problem about year later my face exploded again and i went through a couple of years with full blown acne i scrubbed my face and used whatever creams , etc i was advised to but it never really helped much interestingly , given my typically delicate teetering between a relatively normal mental state and attacks of social anxiety or depression i never really developed an acne complex these feelings i get have never been that tied to my outward appearance they are more about my feelings of worth and relevance to society in general this entry sponsored by murad acne
