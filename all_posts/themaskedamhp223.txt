gerry was a year old young man whose father was a banker he had attended a private school and had done very well academically he was in the middle of his gap year prior to commencing a degree in art history at university when his behaviour became more and more erratic and grandiose he used his new credit card to pay for the publication of a book of truly awful poetry from a vanity publisher , made plans to hire a recording studio and session musicians to record a rap album , and had announced to his parents that he no longer needed to sleep because his brain was receiving energy directly from the cosmos i first became involved with him when i was asked to write a report for an appeal tribunal after he was detained under sec mha for assessment when i interviewed him he was still plainly hypomanic , with grandiose delusions , although the medication was beginning to take effect by the time of the hearing two weeks after detention he stood a fighting chance of being discharged from hospital as long as he kept his delusions to himself indeed , he did manage to keep himself under control for most of the hearing , right up until the point where the chairman of the tribunal asked him if he had anything he wished to say to them as a matter of fact , he said , i would like you to know that aphrodite is smiling on you all , you are all blessed by the light of the goddess of love , beauty and sexual rapture tonight you will feel the power of her love and beneficence since the tribunal decided not to discharge him , he remained as a detained patient , and i was asked to assess him for detention under sec for treatment this seemed like a reasonable request however gerry may have been acutely mentally unwell , but he had not lost his intellectual capacity he realised that he was likely to be detained for a longer period if assessed , so he arranged not to be assessed he absconded from the ward the very morning i was due to assess him however , unlike most absconded patients , who tend to turn up at home , there was no sign of him , until a day or so later , when his parents received a call from him in paris he stayed in a star hotel in paris until the sec had expired , then returned to this country he clearly knew something about the mental health act going to a foreign country is a good way of avoiding it he managed to remain free for several months , before he completely lost control of his illness and was inevitably detained for treatment
