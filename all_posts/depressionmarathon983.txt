this is when you must have faith , she said even though it does n't feel better in the moment , the cumulative effect of getting out and exercising will be positive i had just explained how painful it was to go to my favorite state park and feel nothing , which is exactly what happened on saturday i made the effort i went to a place i love i expected it would help it did n't nonetheless , my therapist encouraged me to continue getting out despite this unmet expectation of relief it 's so hard to get out when getting out is not reinforcing if i feel no benefit from something which used to bring multiple benefits , how can i continue to do it ? why would i continue doing it ? is n't that a bit like banging one 's head against a wall ? except instead of bang ouch , bang ouch , i get bang nothing , bang nothing the whole point of forcing myself out is to feel something anything , please ! right now , i'm feeling nothing nothing is not reinforcing as usual , my therapist is correct , i think on some level i think i know that yet , i do n't trust it to be true how do i know for sure that getting out exercising will eventually bring relief ? how do i know it will ever feel good again ? why ca n't it feel good now ? why do i have to wait ? how can i be expected to continue pushing when pushing yields no results ? i want to believe her i want to have faith , but faith is a leap positive steps should yield positive results i know i have to keep pushing myself i know i have to trust in the cumulative effect , just like she said i have to take that leap of faith one day , one moment , one action at a time unfortunately , the hole of nothingness has swallowed me whole , and positive reinforcement feels a long , long way away picture black hole by hikari riku
