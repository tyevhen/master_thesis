i was invited to caroline 's on easter day for wine , appetizers , and an egg hunt it was a lovely event , a bit chilly , but they had an outdoor fireplace going so i'm talking to caroline whom i have n't seen in months people here kind of hibernate in their caves during the winter and she starts telling another person about shrink rap ! she was even quoting different posts wow ! i did n't remember that i 'd ever told caroline about the blog , i found myself vaguely embarrassed , but ultimately quite flattered caroline reads the blog ! ! ! please note the photo above shows clinkshrink and roy , not caroline
