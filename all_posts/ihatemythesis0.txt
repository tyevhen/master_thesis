yesterday afternoon at approximately p m i completed the last step of my master 's degree dropping off five copies of my thesis at the university bookstore for binding and filling out roughly two pages of paperwork it was all quite anti climatic , really the clerk at the bookstore said congratulations , and i walked back into the sunlight a completely different person , but nobody seemed to notice maybe i did n't even notice all i did was get on my bike and bike home but when i arrived at my house some five minutes later , i found myself lacking one identity as a student as well as one certain purpose in life it was a little disorienting for the last four years whenever i meet somebody and they say , what do you do ? i have always been able to answer , i'm a grad student it 's a satisfying answer for someone of my age it seems to fit my station in life but now when strangers ask , what do i tell them ? unfortunately , being a graduate , only seems to get one so far people expect you do something more instead of the follow up question of , oh , what 's your major , now i get , so what do you do for money ? the distress was enough to motivate me to post my resume on monster com geez i guess i 'll be exploring this in subsequent posts also , i have to fill you in on the last month of excitement and then there 's the little issue of my top secret , new website more to come !
