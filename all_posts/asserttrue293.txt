the term pseudogene was coined in , when jacq et al discovered a version of the gene coding for s rrna in the african clawed frog xenopus laevis that was truncated yet retained homology with the active gene subsequent work has shown that in higher life forms , pseudogenes genes that have been inactivated through one event or another are almost as numerous as coding genes , with for example the human genome containing , or more pseudogenes a more recent estimate puts the number at , many of these pseudogenes are highly conserved looking at pseudogenes in the mouse and human , svensson et al found that of a group of such genes that occur in both species , appear to have been conserved since before the evolutionary divergence of mice and humans in higher organisms , pseudogenes are sometimes transcribed into rna , with the rna filling a regulatory function for example , korneev et al found that simultaneous transcription of neural nitric oxide synthase nnos and the antisense strand of a homologous pseudogene in the same neurons of lymnaea stagnalis a snail leads to the formation of a duplex between the two strands and a reduction in nnos translation further examples can be found in pink et al , pseudogenes pseudo functional or key regulators in health and disease ? in bacteria , pseudogenes are somewhat rarer than in eukaryotes , but exist in significant numbers in many pathogens including many species of mycobacterium , shigella , brucella , bordetella , and others a study by kuo and ochman found that pseudogenes are swiftly eliminated from salmonella they describe evidence of a strong deletional bias in salmonella , such that genes that are not maintained by selection are rapidly inactivated and eliminated by mutational events in fact , kuo and ochman found that pseudogenes are eliminated more rapidly than could be explained by the so called neutral theory of evolution , indicating that the continued presence of pseudogenes exacts a high cost to the cell and yet , many bacteria with slow evolving genomes such as mycobacterium species retain their pseudogenes with high fidelity across evolutionary timespans the most celebrated pseudogene hoarder of all time , m leprae the leprosy bacterium appears to have acquired its pseudogenes to million years ago meanwhile , the half life of pseudogenes in buchnera aphidicola was measured at million years a staggering number so on the one hand , we have work by kuo and ochman showing that pseudogenes in bacteria are rapidly eliminated , and on the other hand we have some bacterial lineages in which it seems pseudogenes are not only conserved but actively repaired over periods of tens of millions of years ! in chapter of brucella molecular microbiology and genomics , caister academic press , garcia lobo et al describe their work with rna sequence data from the bacterium brucella abortus twenty four of the genes selected from the rnaseq data were annotated as pseudogenes in the b abortus genome , which was considered a rather unexpected finding by comparison with other brucella genomes we can reduce the list of highly expressed pseudogenes to often , truncated parts of a gene are annotated as different pseudogenes especially in b abortus this seems contradictory since high transcription of these genes , which should be not able to translate into functional proteins , will be contrary to biological economy the high levels of transcription observed for these genes strongly suggest that they could be active genes and their products may perform functions unreported in metabolic reconstructions high pseudogene expression may also indicate that these are very recently produced pseudogenes that did not turned down transcription yet by accumulation of mutations in their promoter or control regions it is also possible that these pseudogenes may contain sequencing errors and they are indeed active genes it 's almost comically obvious from this passage that the authors are troubled by their own finding that some pseudogenes in brucella are highly transcribed they try explaining it away by saying it could all be sequencing errors a more parsimonious view is that pseudogenes that have n't been eliminated from a genome are , in fact permanent , legitimate fixtures of the landscape , in microbes just as in higher life forms and as in higher life forms , pseudogenes in microbes are probably serving perfectly understandable regulatory functions when they 're not actually translated into protein products kuo and ochman have convincingly shown that useless pseudogenes are quickly eliminated it follows that any pseudogenes that are n't swiftly eliminated are , in fact , serving a biological purpose , or else they would n't be there this line of reasoning is already well accepted by researchers who study eukaryotic life forms those who study bacteria need to take a hint from their up the food chain colleagues what could the hundreds of pseudogenes in bordetella pertussis or the pseudogenes in m leprae be doing ? first we need to get used to the idea that in bacteria , virtually all genes are transcribed , in both directions it 's been four years since dornernberg et al reported finding antisense transcripts in e coli , but no one seems to have gotten the memo a section of rothia mucilaginosa genome top and a corresponding portion of mycobacterium leprae bottom click to enlarge the yellow gene , in each case , is dnae error prone polymerase pink bands indicate areas of or more homology between the two organisms the small diameter silver genes in the lower panel are m leprae pseudogenes normal genes are shown in green notice that r mucilaginosa has open reading frames on both strands of dna , with many bidirectionally overlapping genes a look at the genome of the bacterium rothia mucilaginosa dy shows that a very large proportion of normal genes have open reading frames on the opposite strand see illustration bidirectional overlapping genes run throughout the rothia genome a massive annotation error ? maybe or maybe both strands are transcribed if massive wholesale transcription of antisense strands occurs in e coli , as we know it does , certainly it 's no stretch to imagine it occurring in rothia mucilaginosa and if it is occurring in rothia , which is incidentally an opportunistic pathogen , how much harder can it be to imagine it occurring in another well known pathogenic member of the actinomycetales family , mycobacterium leprae ? we know already that upwards of of m leprae pseudogenes are transcribed antisense transcripts could well be playing a role in silencing certain gene essential genes when attempts are made to grow the organism in defined media forward transcripts could be producing nonsense or partial nonsense truncated proteins that are excreted as toxins or find their way to the cell wall as surface antigens any number of scenarios might be possible some very low hanging fruit is available to micobiologists who are willing to accept the obvious instead of wishing away pseudogenes or imagining them to be useless baggage , we should be looking at them as potential determinants of pathogenicity we should consider their possible roles in modulating protein expression patterns we should attempt to learn why they 're conserved what roles they 're playing in cell physiology the last thing in the world we should be doing is calling them junk dna
