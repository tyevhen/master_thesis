i'm hesitant to write this post i do n't want to be a complainer i do n't want people to see me as ungrateful or selfish but there is a reality out there that 's moved to the forefront of my mind recently , and i feel the need to talk about it , to educate i will speak only from my own experience , but unfortunately , i believe my experience is not unusual within the last six months , a colleague of mine was diagnosed with cancer she is a full time , fully benefited employee who is now back at work after missing a few months for successful treatment while she was out one of our coworkers began an online crowdfunding campaign in order to decrease the burden of her medical bills and living expenses it was a wonderful , compassionate gesture , which was embraced by all forty four thousand , nine hundred two dollars and fifty five cents that 's , i'm fortunate i pay a lot of money every month , over to be exact , for insurance to cover most of my medical bills and prescription costs so this bill sitting in front of me for , , which is just for my hospital stays , it does not address any md charges or the cost of ect treatments , will largely be covered by my insurance i'm grateful and relieved unfortunately , my relief is short lived , as i currently have no idea how i will continue to pay for the very insurance premiums which will cover that hospital bill i have depression because i have depression , i am unable to tolerate working full time because i work part time , i am not eligible for benefits like health insurance , paid time off , or health savings accounts i missed days of work without pay while i was ill i 've worked fewer than of my hours for days since since february th , i 've received just under in pay i have a few dollars in savings , but the stress of spending my savings on a daily basis to cover my mortgage , health insurance premiums , vehicle payment , utility bills and groceries has been overwhelming and frightening despite being open about my illness with friends and coworkers , i do n't think the financial burden of this illness has crossed anybody 's mind i'm not asking for money i'm just pointing out yet another naive and unfortunate difference in how mental illness is perceived those around us seem to immediately understand how financially stressful a major illness can be , and they move to help perhaps those same people do n't realize depression is a major illness , too ? i used to say the difference between mental illness and other illnesses was pancake breakfasts and spaghetti dinners in my neck of the woods , that 's how families , friends and coworkers used to raise funds to assist the sick people in their lives i guess the difference now is in online crowdfunding campaigns
