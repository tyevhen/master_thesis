when you get right down to it one of the most integral aspects of unschooling , and this is something you hear lots of unschooling advocates saying , is trust trust is a really nice word according to dictionary com , trust is trust truhst noun reliance on the integrity , strength , ability , surety , etc , of a person or thing confidence confident expectation of something hope i love that first definition reliance on the integrity , strength , ability , surety , etc , of a person unschooling , or really , doing many things differently than those ways of doing and being sanctioned by the dominant culture , takes a lot of trust it takes trust on multiple levels trusting that nature evolution the divine god goddess has created human beings capable of learning , capable of following their innate drive to learn , capable of making the important decisions in their lives it 's trusting that nature got things right trusting , as a parent , that you have the capability and strength , ability , surety to make the decision to take your kids out of school , or to never send them to school to begin with and trusting that your children are capable people , able to learn and grow guided by their innate desire to explore the world around them trusting yourself , as someone who is themselves of an age to be in compulsory schooling , to have the insight , foresight , strength and ability to take the leap of leaving school , or if your parents made that decision at an earlier point for you , trusting that you really have always been and continue to be capable of controlling your own learning , education , and life trust is hard , and learning to trust yourself is a continuous journey , full of learning and re learning your own strength and capability , while learning to accept weaknesses and mistakes a great strength of unschooling is , i believe , the gift of being confident in the innate ability of children to learn giving them trust and in so doing , breaking a cycle of teaching dependance on authority , breaking the cycle of teaching children that they 're incompetent and incapable of having a major say in their own lives i believe unschooling can really help in allowing people to develop confidence in their own power at the same time , though , unschoolers are of course just people , and unschooling does n't erase the influences of the rest of this culture , or fundamentally change the fact that everyone , no matter their upbringing or education , has insecurities and worries and problems with trusting their own judgement i never went to school i do n't count kindergarten , yet that does n't stop my insecurities ! and it does n't stop me from wondering on a regular basis if i am trustworthy , if i really am capable of making the best choices for myself it helps though , having had so much trust for so many years it helps being able to look at all the things i 've learned and accomplished , by my own initiative and in my own time so , unschooling is really about trusting trusting nature , trusting your kids , trusting yourself it wo n't be perfect , but as long as that core of trust remains , i 'd say unschooling works out pretty damn well you might also like favorite unschooling posts on this blog of blame unschooling ! unschooling is not relaxed homeschooling unschooling are we teaching ourselves ? linkwithin
