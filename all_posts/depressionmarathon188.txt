i'm not sure if i 've ever mentioned this , but i have very well controlled , fairly mild asthma over the past ten days , my asthma has gotten worse , and worse , and worse over the weekend , my heavy duty special asthma meds , the ones designed for just this situation , were only working for a few hours at a time basically , i could n't breathe ! i was constantly short of breath , and go figure , quite anxious i was fortunate to get an early morning appointment with my doctor today my doctor checked me out , and i apparently may have a slight case of pneumonia on top of aggravated asthma he prescribed me a steroid , prednisone , as well as an antibiotic i'm not a fan of taking either , but i am a fan of breathing without struggle , so i'm taking them and they are already making a difference my breathing has improved , but the prednisone makes me very jittery it 's been awhile since i took it , and i'm feeling better however , for several hours after taking it i felt like i was crawling out of my skin , and there was nothing i could do about it it was n't pleasant the dose of prednisone decreases everyday , so i'm hoping for fewer side effects and better breathing each day this new medical battle makes me wonder if i'm falling apart at the seams i'm barely emerging from the desperate lows of my depression relapse , my achilles tendon is torn , i also just strained my hamstring , and now my lungs are n't functioning well oh , and i have to have repeat oral surgery next week my friend , wendy , jokingly calls me a hot mess ! i ca n't disagree i'm working on my radical acceptance of the whole mess the mess of me ! as best i can , i 've got to keep moving forward i could easily mope and feel sorry for myself , but i 'd rather not acceptance , as difficult as it is , will serve me better i have to believe things will improve i mean how much more can go awry ? there 's not much left i'm banged up from my head to my heel i'm going to try to stick to my schedule as much as possible despite the medical mess i ca n't afford to let my mood be affected i'm praying for acceptance and health but really , god , enough already ?
