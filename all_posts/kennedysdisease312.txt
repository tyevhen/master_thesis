it is hard to believe i have been taking dutasteride for four months already this last month brought an interesting revelation oh oh what s happening ? when i woke up on may th i noticed that something was different my left knee ached my quads did not feel as strong during my short leg exercise program my stamina just was not there also under normal conditions , i would not have thought anything about it just another twist in living with kennedy s disease but , these were not normal circumstances i had felt strong for months stronger than i have felt in years my confidence had grown with each passing day and now i felt vulnerable again wake up call it took me a few days to figure out what was happening i had not listened to my body and had pushed it too far for months i had continued to add exercises and reps my short program had increased by and my long program by my body finally told me , ' enough already it was time for a correction i started listening to my body again i backed off on my off day exercise program i started doing the same exercises and reps i use to do before taking dutasteride i also decided to leave my new long program alone just to see what would happen results within days i saw and felt some positive changes my left knee stopped aching i felt a little stronger again and , i had more energy and better stamina two weeks after backing off on the short program , but keeping the long program at just under two hours , i felt good again my strength was as good as it was prior to the wake up call my knee is fine again my confidence is back i am relieved three weeks later i can say that i m back lesson learned practice what you preach !
