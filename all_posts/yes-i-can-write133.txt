one of the first things people think when they hear you do n't , or did n't , go to school , is oh , you must be religious and by religious , what they really mean is that we must be either fundamentalist or evangelical christians i think that the image that instantly comes to most peoples minds when they think of homeschoolers since most people think that all school free learners are christian is a very specific one it involves girls in long skirts or dresses , boys in dress shirts , and mothers in denim jumpers families with often many more than children , who do their schoolwork at the kitchen table and have daily bible study the stereotype goes that they may also hate gay people and have a problem with the theory of evolution the duggar family from tlc 's kids and counting source and , well , that stereotype is actually based in something growing up , many of the homeschoolers i knew fit it almost exactly ! it 's probably not surprising to discover my family felt pretty out of place at certain homeschooling gatherings because my family ? well , school free learning definitely was n't a choice made for religious reasons of any kind , christian or otherwise my father seems pretty atheistic , but i do n't think cares enough about religion either way to even bother labeling himself my mother is a rather spiritual person , with her own personal beliefs and a definite attitude of live and let live my sister once referred to herself as a superstitious agnostic , which i loved , but she does n't feel the label of agnostic fits any more , and has n't replaced it with any other labels and me ? well , i usually simply refer to myself as an animist , and i also throw a little goddess earth worship into the mix i got a necklace much like this for christmas source the difference in outlook can be seen clearly in this story i remember a homeschoolers group activity my sister and i were part of one summer they gave us each a small new testament bible , and we memorized a small passage each meeting actually , i think it might have specifically been a bible club thing , that my sister and i decided to go to simply because we had friends there but either way , i remember that emi loved that little bible it had a faux leather cover and gold writing emi thought it looked like a spell book , and used it as such in her regular play it might start to sound at this point like i'm not all that fond of christianity , and that would be accurate to be honest , i'm not all that fond of any organized religion but as with everything i'm less than fond of , i try to keep things pointed squarely at the big guys i have a problem with schools , not those who attend them similarly , i do n't like the institution of religion , but that does n't mean i dislike the followers of a religion what i do dislike is the politics and opinions that frequently go along with fundamentalist christianity , though the hatred of glbtq folk , the idea of purity and repression of sexuality , the belief that physically punishing children is okay , the overall sexism when i was young , i did n't notice all that stuff , despite the fact it was very evident at times i think kids often do n't ! but once i was older , those types of attitudes definitely started making me uncomfortable so do i think choosing not to send kids to school for religious reasons is bad ? no , i do n't i think it 's important that children are loved , treated kindly and respectfully , and given the freedom they deserve the families who strive for this are the ones i personally agree with most , and i do n't really think whether those choices are made with religion in mind or not matters at all i consider myself a very spiritual person , and i do n't really separate the various part of me into different categories everything i think and feel has an effect on everything else i think and feel , thus my own decision to never send my unwilling to go future children to school is as much a spiritual choice as anything else and really , it would be very nice if people started realizing that the school free community is a vast one , and one that encompasses a wide variety of people who do n't send their kids to school for a wide variety of reasons school free learners are christians , pagans , jews , atheists , muslims , hindus , and any other religion you can think of they 're conservatives , liberals , republicans , anarchists , supporters of the green party , and libertarians there are a lot of school free people out there , and thus you find a lot of variety some of them i personally agree with , some not so much yes , i think i 've probably come across more christian homeschoolers than anything else , but there are enough home learners who are other than christian that automatically assuming they are is not really a good idea ! it would also be nice if people would move away from the idea that christian x type of home learning , and atheist other x type of homeschooling that 's slotting followers of a specific religion or holders of a specific label into a box , and not taking into account the complexities of each individual , why they decided not to send their children to school or not to go to school themselves , their relationships with each other , etc there are radically unschooling christians , and there are rigidly classically homeschooling pagans i 'd personally like the focus to stay firmly on the important things are they happy ? are families living together with love and respect ? or , are they striving to live that way since it can be pretty hard to actually achieve at times , as i well know ? because is n't that what 's important ? why i'm such a strong supporter of unschooling is because i believe everyone has the right to free choice , and because i believe that free choice leads to happy , connected , caring people ultimately , if people are happy , i do n't think it matters what type of education they 're following so i 've tackled religion , something i 've never really written about before on this blog hopefully i 've done so respectfully ! and i 'd be interested to hear your perspective do you feel religion had any impact on your educational choices either to have more or less religion in your environment ? what 's been your experience with the school free community and religion ?
