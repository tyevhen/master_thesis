okay that 's how things have been going since the weekend okay my mood has dipped a bit since sunday 's post actually it 's dipped a lot a few times , but i 've survived i'm working hard on dealing with the dips by remembering they are only temporary along those lines , i heard something great at a meeting last night one woman laughed and said that she somewhere got the idea that she would always feel good we all laughed and nodded right along with her she expanded on the thought she told us if she did n't feel good , she assumed it meant something was terribly wrong again , i nodded what a thought , huh ? it made me think perhaps some of my angst would be relieved if i remember life is n't always supposed to feel good so simple and , when i do n't feel good , perhaps i need to relax before concluding something is terribly wrong maybe all these years of depression have made me too sensitive to the little dips i know i can survive i 've survived in the past i need to remember that so things have been okay i'm working as scheduled i cleaned my house i paid my bills i walked ran with puck yesterday , and i plan to swim tomorrow my knee is coming along it gets sore after work and after my walk runs , but overall , it 's slowly healing , i think mentally , i 'd like to feel better i'm not back to full strength , but i'm nowhere near as low as i was just one week ago i'm grateful to be feeling okay
