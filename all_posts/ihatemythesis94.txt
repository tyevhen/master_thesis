i fielded off three invitations to celebrate the green beer holiday via text message from my study post at no internet starbucks i forced my self to study until the barista forced me to leave and then went home to study more except that i could n't get a parking space in front of my own house i finally parked in front of the neighbor two houses down and then heard music blaring before i reached my door after all my diligence , a st paddy 's day bbq stood in my way now it 's nearly am , i have two days to write pages , and i'm hopped up on coffee and vodka disaster even worse , my roommates' girlfriend and my neighbor discovered my blog and now they are making fun of me so you 're writing a blog about writing your thesis instead of actually writing your thesis ? they ask yes , i say ironic thesis progress of pages written that 's only for chapter , the full thesis is much longer
