with respect to classical music , i'm a much bigger fan of the classical and romantic composers mozart , beethoven and all those russian guys like rimsky korsakoff than the earlier baroque composers such as bach and handel baroque is beautiful and often awe inspiring , but too structured for my taste like a doily or a stained glass window in a church back then gardens were arranged into strict geometric designs we caged nature then pastoralism came into vogue , and we get landscape architecture that was meant to be natural and pleasing rather than quite so civilized , and the music of the time reflects this aesthetic as well the structure and expectations of the preceding baroque era seemed to squeeze the lyricism out of baroque music , though not the beauty but a baroque giant , handel , wrote the largo from xerxes , a selection of music that seems to wrest poetry from rigidity it 's an amazing piece , before its time a game changer who knew handel could be passionate ? according to wikipedia , mozart said of handel , he understands affect better than any of us when he chooses , he strikes like a thunderbolt right click to open in new tab we have our biology , our natures and yet we dare impose the structure of agriculture and pharmacology upon it with an incomplete understanding , at best , particularly in the brain such incomplete understanding will lead seemingly learned folks to suggest that we are all diabetic we are not and that glucose is not a toxin but foods that raise blood sugar levels are toxic er , what ? i probably should not stick my foot into this one , as i am not a metabolism blogger , but for heaven 's sake without glucose in the bloodstream we are dead with too much glucose we are poisoned physiology is all about goldilocks , the right amounts , and the case that all starches are toxic for the vast majority of people is a very , very poor one and if fasting glucose and overall levels of circulating glucose are important , the strict low carber who cheats every once in a while might be in more trouble than the healthy starchy carb eater who will be more exquisitely insulin sensitive as kurt harris and melissa mcewen have noted , there is no evolutionary precedent for lifelong very low carb diets , and plenty of examples of healthy cultures who eat starchy carbs so with our incomplete understanding of physiology , i feel it is a safer bet to use reasonable precedent rather than a zero carb theory of an optimal longevity diet as a prescription for most people certainly there are likely exceptions seizures , dementia , the first stage of weight loss , in many folks with diabetes personally i think calling starch a poison for the majority of people makes about as much sense as demonizing saturated fat so back to allergies and suicide this part of the post is for me , really i need a spot to look back and see the nitty gritty stuff organized in a way that makes sense to me actually , this is the point of the entire blog my self taught fellowship in evolutionary psychiatry in the beginning , there were th and th helper cells these are soldiers of our immune system , called lymphocytes , with different capabilities and called into action in different circumstances the call to war comes in the form of the release of inflammatory cytokines there are a whole soup of these chemosignals , released also primarily by t lymphocytes , mostly named interleukins , which are shortened to il , il , il , etc etc in general the release of inflammatory cytokines can lead to reduced activities and social interaction , and it can activate the hpa axis which can lead to supernormal responses to stress , which can further ramp up the inflammatory response elevated pro inflammatory cytokines can activate the ido enzyme , reducing serotonin production this may explain the link between allergy and suicide certain types of th related cytokines also increase insomnia allergy , then , does not increase the risk of suicide by making people feel sick , but directly through inflammatory means , leading to people withdrawing from social activities and over react to stressful situations what are some more specific features ? well , proinflammatory cytokines released at the time of the allergic reaction activate the hpa axis the glucocorticoids and catecholamines cause a suppression of th and a shift to th activity by inhibiting il and promoting il the pro inflammatory cytokines also cause dysfunction of corticosteroid receptors the th lymphocyte produces il , which can effect serotonin metabolism as well and il is known to have more effect in people with some genes than others en anglais , we are talking here a direct mechanism by which a certain kind of stress , allergy , can affect the neurochemicals in the brain and therefore behavior , and it seems that some people are genetically more vulnerable to this stress than others that said , other researchers have postulated that the th cytokines impair the serotonin machinery even more than the th ones we 're back to not too hot , not too cold , not too soft , not too hard it all has to be just right and what is just right ? depends on your genes and your epigenetics superimposing an emulation of the evolutionary milieu is only a first approximation and a good guess
