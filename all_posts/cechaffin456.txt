i wrote a long blog entry this morning then lost it as my connection disconnected i should know better , as this has happened before best to write your blog entry in a word document and afterwards paste it in like this minor stupidity , we too easily forget the dangers of the past unless forcefully reminded again it 's human nature to need a two by four on the forehead to get our attention , why jesus called us sheep why didn t he call us pigs ? pigs are smarter and better symbolize our fallen nature and why not cows ? because sheep are renowned for being dumb , dumb , dumb how they survived for domestication is a question for previous predators incapable of herding i also rattled on about depression , talking about the kilorat variety where one is reduced to a microscopic dot of pain , self despite and self loathing , with an unquenchable thirst for self annihilation in that state you are truly better off dead without others around to remind you of the possibility of a different outcome in which you cannot believe , they must believe for you after today s sonnet i ll post a poem that comes from a much deeper depression than that with which i am now afflicted one does not beat depression , one survives it if you have any thought in your head about your triumph over depression in the past , it is a dangerous illusion the wolf is always at the door don t mock the devil , he s listening keep passing the open windows i speak only to serious depressives when i say this i always thought it ironic that when i went to aa for a time , it was all about not drinking or taking drugs when i attended dmda depressive and manic depressive association it was all about taking drugs but here s another thing about of bipolars also have a substance abuse problem so it s about taking the right drugs , but this statistic shows that the right drugs are often not enough and if bipolars use common drugs like alcohol or marijuana to partially ameliorate the pain of depression or the excitation of mania , who can blame them ? alcohol worked for my father until he was when it quit working he killed himself he would not or could not face the diagnosis he d received while hospitalized in the air force as a young man and so it goes but even more so here s today s sonnet , followed by another poem written in deep , deep depression resisting melancholy you are a mailed fist around my heart metal against flesh now who will win ? i am forsaken by the healer s art my medications multiply like sin it s only by acceptance i resist to struggle is to fall into your trap , mistaking us for equals in the mist of madness i would lose you like the clap but it is not that simple no infection , however terrible , could freeze my soul and sand my skin until there s no protection and make a million fractions from the whole through infinite divisions i endure you re not the power that you thought you were at kilorats , the usual suspect
