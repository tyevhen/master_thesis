a b , i 'm feeling very confused after a series of outbursts , for the last couple of weeks my husband has not lost his temper he 's been very friendly , helpful and pleasant i regularly thank him , praise him and let him know how i appreciate his good qualities and efforts but , even when he is not being so endearing pleasant i try to do that ! over the last weeks i 've sincerely had ample reasons to do so it 's been nice to have a pleasant environment , to not be walking on eggs to feel like my best friend is back i work hard to run the household want to help his life run smoothly i'm happy to do so i feel blessed grateful to be able to stay at home tell my husband that i try to be supportive pleasant i make a real effort not to burden him or complain about much , save for my aches pains on certain days ! frankly , i do n't feel i have much to complain about last night , my husband 's disposition changed again he was being critical , erupting in outbursts , all over the tiniest things i pushed the wrong button on the air conditioner you 'd have thought i had hit it with a hammer ! i could n't do or say anything right in his eyes , he said the usual comments about i was fine until you i would n't have to yell if you i ignored him as always , gave him space when he came in to sleep , i just could n't remain silent i usually just go to sleep , turn the other cheek never bring his words back up to him i just move on he never offers me an apology it would have meant the world if he could have said , yes , i was annoyed , but yelling does n't solve anything i'm sorry i over reacted but last night i felt i had to say something big mistake ! i said calmly nicely , i do n't care if the air conditioner is broken , i just would like to be treated with kindness i wish you could tell me there 's a problem without screaming at me that just set him off again he got very defensive , said it was all my fault , made things up , starting yelling again at that point , i picked up the phone said , should i dial ? he said , i 'll just leave i said , that sounds like a good idea thing is , i had already hit on the phone i 've never done this , ever , in yrs of hostile , rages ! i do n't know what came over me anyway , i hung up before someone could answer the dispatcher called me back though i apologized profusely , thanked her , said no help was needed minutes later a policeman was at the door i told him all was fine , my husband was walking out the door he spoke to the officer told him he was being kicked out of his home the officer said , that 's fine , everything else is okay ? we both said it was the officer left my husband left questions like , should we cut those flowers shorter ? or pushing the wrong button , or asking if he likes his dinner too many times , might annoy any husband i understand that i am a very average , flawed person i am bound to put my foot in my mouth , make mistakes i just feel like i really , really , try to be a pleasant , supportive appreciative wife to be on the receiving end of so much wrath , so frequently , for so little , does n't make sense this has been going on for most of our marriage , with a respite of three years after i filed for then dropped divorce two yrs ago it started up again i think he thinks i 'll never leave because we live in a nice house , i love our yard , i do n't have job skills cost of living is higher here i just do n't think he thinks i 'd ever go anywhere , so he feels free to treat me like a doormat when he 's so inclined the last several incidents have left me feeling not as scared or panicked as in the past , but with a sense of sadness that our home has to so often be a hostile , anger filled environment it seems he does n't have any motivation to change i try to be understanding , but i ca n't seem to love him out of this the reality is , even though he seems impossible to please , i'm so happy to see him when he comes home i'm like a puppy ! i enjoy our simple life do n't feel i need anything more i read that dr laura schlessinger advised that all one can do around a man like this is ignore him i guess you ca n't make someone feel compassion or remorse are n't some people incapable of feeling compassion or remorse ? he seems to feel utterly entitled to go crazy with anger if the smallest thing is n't to his liking ! i know i 've written about this about a thousand times i do n't want to drive you crazy , a b i just do n't know what to do i want to get off of this roller coaster now that this call was placed , he probably feels even more disdain for me i'm sure he went to his office did n't get any sleep i am sorry for that g dear g i suggested this to you before it might help to get out a camera and record his rages if you can i do n't think he really sees himself the only thing he sees is that you still respond to his anger , and he can still control you with his anger , and that makes him feel safe calling was probably not a great idea since it was done as an act to manipulate your husband into behaving better rather than to get help because you felt in danger the cliche in the counseling industry is to meet a behavior with a behavior this does not necessarily mean yelling at someone that is yelling at you but it does mean that in any situation an adult should be taking care of themselves independently and directly , rather than getting the other person to alter their behavior so that they are taken care of indirectly you still do not see this subtle point you are still indirectly taking care of yourself by getting your husband to change his behavior , instead of directly taking care of yourself , and behaving in a way in which you are completely taken care of by yourself , and the consequences of your being able to take care of yourself removes the ability of the other person to control you by their anger calling the policeman illustrates the point you called them to manipulate your husband , to get him to alter his behavior so you would be taken care of this is not the same as calling the police so that they can take care of you , which is their job , and which would mean that in the situation with your husband you are taking care of yourself directly by calling the police and are not calling the police to get your husband to take care of you it is still a matter of being able to be self sufficient in an adverse situation when my situation was similar to yours i would actually say to myself during my husband 's rages , what can i do in this adverse situation to take care of myself ? sometimes i would simply get up and leave the house and go somewhere to collect my wits and handle my own emotions but at this point i was able to start to make some judgments about the fact that my hurt feelings were simply caused by my emotional dependence on my husband , and hurt feelings indicated my needing to do some more work on repressed fear that hurt is just fear and i had some glimmer that i was extremely weak and my husband did not come to this planet to do what i wanted he came here to take care of himself in the best way he could it is one of my core principles that everybody always displays the best behavior that they are capable of at the time they are displaying it another problem with us women is that we use the cover story that we are right and our husband is wrong in some situations to cloud that fact that we cannot abrogate our responsibility to take care of ourselves just because we are right and put that responsibility on our husbands just because he is wrong by common sense standards again , there are no specific right and wrong actions that can be listed down and memorized that you can do to take care of yourself you know you are on the right track when your husband 's anger becomes is his problem and not your problem if your behavior comes from love of some core principle instead of fear , it will be appropriate in some way to your life being appropriate to your life , however , does not automatically make you a winner as opposed to a loser in the short term scheme of things in the long term , however , being true to your core principles will mean that you win yourself hope this helps a b curtiss
