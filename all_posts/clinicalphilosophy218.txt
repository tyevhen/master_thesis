last night i went to a talk in oxford by john cottingham which was on amongst other things nachtr glichkeit , and in particular on the temporality of human happiness one of his basic claims surely plausible was , if i understood him right , that our happiness unlike , say , a sensation of pleasure is not to be understood merely episodically rather , it is bound up with the meanings of our lives , and these meanings extend from any moment far into the past and the future we are continually reinterpreting , or discovering more about , or becoming , ourselves thus , for example , how we die may itself have a profound impact on the quantity or quality of happiness which can be said to accrue to our life as a whole 'call no man happy until he is dead' is one greek aphorism attributed by heroditus to solon cited by cottingham , which seems to give if albeit in an extreme form us a clue about the essence of what we could call 'happiness holism' the freudian topic of nachtr glichkeit was particularly and personally apt because the discussion caused me to rework and unfold some of my own reflections , earlier that day , on the kinds of spurious usually idealist metaphysics that get implicated in the interpretation of simple buddhist or cbt mindfulness techniques here 's what i have in mind we are invited to cultivate an ability to move from a 'doing' to a 'being' mode to just notice the sensations , for example , that come up in our body , as they arise to notice when our mind wanders off into the past , or the future , or some present concern , and gently bring it back to the meditative object e g the body , or the breath , or a candle , or what have you we may notice as we do this that a sense of happiness wells up from within contentment , bliss not about anything in particular , but just through settling into ourselves and gently relinquishing the urge to fantasise , fret or ruminate but what sometimes frustrates me is the way in which the 'being' mode gets presented as a kind of engagement in a temporal pointilism as if just 'being here now' meant a relinquishment of temporality as if i could really be said to be existing as a human being , living a meaningful , rewarding , happy , life , if i were to pursue an existence self contained at every moment as if my being my dasein were not itself constitutively temporal why is it that a straightforward psychological or spiritual technique so readily gets caught up with a particular metaphysics in this case a metaphysics which seems to want to deny the kind of temporal happiness holism described by cottingham as constitutive of the human condition ? well , i think the answer is clear when we think about it it is because we have not adequately distinguished between the neurotic temporalisation of the mind which flees from being into the imagined future or past , and the constitutive temporality of human existence dasein which knits us essentially into our personal historical contexts a perfectly decent psycho spiritual claim gets dressed up in metaphysical garb , perhaps to make it appear more philosohpically respectable but the result is just implausibility to conclude , let me just make the distinction as clear as i can sure when i'm depressed i may just be thinking about the past , or when i'm obsessional i may just be ruminating over what i said or did earlier , or when i'm neurotically anxious i may just be desperately trying to figure out what might happen next perhaps in part i am trying to flee from a present which i fear will be overwhelming in all such cases i am showing an unwillingness to simply experience what is 'in my mind' to accept my experience for what it is it is this neurotic temporalisation which therapies or practices relying on mindfulness attempts to dispel and to return the subject to stimulus governed rather than rule governed contingencies , as the behaviourist might put it but it is not only not even primarily through such neurotic temporalisation that my life gains temporal structure rather , the meanings which are necessarily distributed throughout the historical texture of my being arise not just in anxious reflective thought , but in my reposed moral reflection , in my gradually unfolding self understanding , and primarily in the mainly non reflective practices which occupy me each day lived temporality looks after itself , we might say , putting the claim in a rather extreme way , with no need of such a helping hand from thought my life has its temporal contours , and the meanings of it stretch right out through the unfolding activities and practices of my existence neurotic temporalisation would in fact be most likely to stifle , rather than promote , any such temporal unfolding , keeping being locked into static situation contingency non governed and predictable patterns of action and reaction being , then , is not aptly opposed to doing , when making a contrast between a mind which is anxiously projecting itself into possibilities , and a mind which is reposed in the present yet constructed by its temporal ties to past and future being is doing , doing is being some forms of being , because of their infatuation with projection ahead of itself modes of fantasy , are profoundly limited the question is not can i reside in the present moment ? now that often really would be banal ! the question is can i reside in my being , as it unfolds , through time , with all of its rich temporalities and episodic uncapturability ? can i be on the way to with no hurried pace faster than my existence can carry me ?
