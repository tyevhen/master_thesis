youth who abuse cough syrup in a study conducted among college students in the southeastern u s , researchers identified several groups who abuse syrup these groups include males , members of the lgbtq community , and students from suburban and urban areas in their study , the researchers found there was a strong correlation between the abuse of cough syrup and the music preference i e rap of

people together and they often model behaviors from the lyrics of the artists those who listen to certain types of music are sensation seekers and use substances to increase those feelings youth often choose peer groups who reinforce their substance abuse and this can be accomplished by listening to certain genres of music in the future , researchers believe there may be a shift in youth who abuse syrup as other genres of music , like country , begin to promote its use source purple drank research prevalence of syrup use among high school seniors cough medicine is the fourth leading abused drug
