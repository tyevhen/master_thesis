something very strange happened the other day i was fooling around looking for flagellum genes in various organisms , hoping to find homology between bacterial flagellum proteins and eukaryotic cilia proteins all of a sudden , a search came back positive for a bacterial gene in rice , of all things on a lark , i decided to check further if one gene transferred , maybe there are more , i reasoned it was late at night before going to bed , i downloaded the dna sequence data for all , genes of enterobacter cloacae subsp cloacae strain nctc and set up a brute force blast search of the , bacterial genes against all , genes of oryza sativa l ssp indica i set the e value threshold to the most stringent value allowed by the cogeblast interface , namely e , meaning reject anything that has more than a one in chance of having matched by chance i went to bed expecting the search to turn up nothing more than the one flagellum protein match i 'd found earlier when i woke up the next morning , i was stupefied to find that my brute force blast n dna sequence search had brought back more than high quality hits in the rice genome i later found more bacterial genes , from acidovorax , a common rice pathogen enterobacter is not a known pathogen of rice , although it has been isolated from rice but before you get the impression that this is some kind of major scientific find , let me cut the suspense right now by telling you the bottom line , which is that after many days of checking and rechecking my data , i no longer think there are really hundreds of horizontally transferred bacterial genes lurking in the rice genome oh sure , the genes are there , in the data you can check for yourself , but this is actually just a sad case of garbage in , rubbish out the oryza sativa indica genome , i'm now convinced , suffers from sample contamination that is to say bacterial cells were present in the rice sample prior to sequencing some of the bacterial genes were amplified and got into the contigs , and the assembly software dutifully spliced the bacterial data in with the rice data my first tipoff to the possibility of contamination aside from finding several hundred bacterial genes where there should n't be any bacterial genes came when i re ran my blast searches using the most up to date copy of the indica genome suddenly , many of the hits i 'd been seeing vanished the most recent genome consists of chromosome sized contigs the earlier genome i had been using had had the chromosomes plus scores of tiny orphan contgis when the orphan contigs went away , so did most of my hits when i looked at ncbi 's master record for the oryza sativa indica group , i noticed a footnote near the bottom of the page contig aaaa was suppressed in feb because it may be a contaminant in actuality , a great many other contigs have been removed as well when i ran my tests against the other sequenced rice genome , the oryza sativa japonica group genome , i found no bacterial genes contamination continues to plague the indica group genome the official chromosomes of oryza sativa indica have acidovorax genes all over the place , to this day i suppose technically , it is possible those genes represent instances of horizontal gene transfer but if that 's what it is , then it 's easily the biggest such transfer across species lines ever recorded and it happened only in the indica variety of rice , not japonica the two varieties diverged , to , years ago the following table shows some of the acidovorax genes that can be found in the oryza satisva indica group genome this is by no means a complete list note that the identities number in the far right column pertains to dna sequence similarity , not amino acid sequence similarity acidovorax genes ocurring in the published oryza sativa indica genome query gene function rice gene query coverage e identities aave phospho dehydro deoxyheptonate aldolase osi aave orotate phosphoribosyltransferase osi aave lipoate

, tetrahydropyridine carboxylate n succinyltransferase osi aave ferrochelatase osi so let this be a lesson to diy genome hackers everywhere if you find what you think are dozens of putative horizontally transferred genes in a large genome , stop and consider which is more likely to occur , a massive horizontal gene transfer event involving several dozen genes crossing over into another life form , or contamination of a lab sample with bacteria ? i think we all know the answer many thanks to professor jonathan eisen at u c davis for providing valuable consultation
