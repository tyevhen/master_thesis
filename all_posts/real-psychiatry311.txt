in a word adherence or what we used to call compliance that is whether the drug is taken at all or whether it is being taken according the the prescription adherence is an important aspect of the working alliance with any physician the only accurate way to determine a response to a medication depends on whether it is being taken correctly and the person taking the medication is describing a true treatment response and true side effects many patients do not take the medication as prescribed for various reasons the question of adherence takes on an equally important role in clinical trials if non adherence is present it affects the statistical power of the study sample sizes are often calculated to bring the study into a range where the sample is considered to have an adequate number of subjects non adherence rates can adversely affect that estimation there is also the question of whether non adherence reflects another issue related to the medication like side effects the related research question is whether non adherence is evenly distributed across the groups taking the study drug and the placebo group in previous discussions of the placebo response in drug trials of psychiatric drugs i have not seen adherence discussed as a critical factor a brief news report in science this week by kelly servick provides a good discussion of the adherence issue from a number of perspectives the central graphic is from a paper by blashke , et al showing summary data of electronic monitoring of medication adherence from clinical trials that shows decreased adherence rates in terms of taking the medication and taking the medication as prescribed both fall off significantly over time by days of subjects have stopped taking the medication and about are no longer taking it as prescribed those are substantial numbers especially if the active drug can be identified by a specific effect or side effect and discontinued on that basis in a field where there is a significant placebo response among subjects with mild to moderate illness non adherence can lead to significant problems in the final outcome and overall worth of the study according to servick the typical approach used in the past has been to recruit enough subjects to counter the low adherence rates this is problematic for a number of reasons subjects these days are often from nonclinical samples on college campuses this can be a problem with some subjects volunteering for multiple studies with psychiatric drug trials , the recruitment criteria are subjective , obvious , and selection is often coordinated by non physician research coordinators whose job it is to get the required number of volunteers in a specified period of time in the drug trials that i am personally aware of only alzheimer 's disease trials asked for corroboration from sources other than the patients on how they were able to function on a daily basis it would be very interesting to obtain that kind of data on subjects recruited from university campuses who were still attending classes especially if some incentive was involved in a related matter , one of the investigators in this area created a database to identify potential subjects who came in for screening at various sites where he was an investigator up to of the subjects across sites were identified as duplicates because of the potential negative effect of duplicate subjects the authors suggest that a nation wide database of subject should be considered the article looks at a number of measures to determine the level of adherence in a study the first take home message is that pill counts are relatively meaningless i have certainly talked with research subjects who told me that their blister packs were empty because they just threw the pills away in a study that compared pills counts with blood levels of the drug the sample sample had an adherence rate of by pill count but only by blood levels the author cites medication side effects as a reason for non adherence , but in a complex sample of patients with varying levels of motivation and insight the reasons can be very complex several electronic approaches to adherence have been devised that vary from a chip in the pill bottle cap that records when the bottle is opened and closed mems system to a chip in a pill that records when it is ingested adherence measures are another dimension to look for when reading the results of clinical trials i do n't recall seeing any commentary on this important issue in cochrane reviews and probably with good reason non adherence rates this high are probably at least as important as what cochrane typically discusses as technical problems like small sample size and measurement problems blaschke is quoted in the servick article that many of the researchers in this area feel that the problem is bigger than one that can be detected by surveillance and databases to me this comes down to the limitations of clinical trials and a problem that cannot be potentially solved certainly the days of research units where subjects could be supervised in inpatient settings for months is gone in most cases , persons with severe psychiatric disorders can only get that kind of treatment if they can personally pay for it or the state they live in has a state psychiatric facility even then they often have to undergo civil commitment a practical solution would be to eliminate the obviously non adherent subjects and not include them in any intent to treat analysis and use a standard adherence measure such as blood levels where appropriate ambivalence about taking a drug in a research protocol is not the same thing as stopping an fda approved drug in a clinical setting , but that conscious state has not been adequately
