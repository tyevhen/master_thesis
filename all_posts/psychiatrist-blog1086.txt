we 've been talking about psychiatrists and facebook here on shrink rap and it got me thinking about psychiatry and technology i always think of the internet as kind of public turf can it be wrong to google someone ? it 's not illegal , it 's not hard , and the stuff is all in the public domain people will sometimes mention they 've googled me to find my phone number i do n't often google patients , but once in a while someone once told me about their brother 's murder in an international scandal and it sounded a bit weird , so i googled the brother had been murdered and there was some mention of the international issue but is wrong ? i'm perplexed in a psychiatric news story from july , jun yan writes in psychiatrist must beware the perils of cyberspace recently , apa 's ethics committee gave a brief recommendation on whether it is ethical for psychiatrists and residents to google their patients 'googling' a patient is not necessarily unethical however , it should be done only in the interests of promoting the patient 's care and well being and never to satisfy the curiosity or other needs of the psychiatrist psychiatric news , may on the other side of the coin , patients may google their psychiatrists and not only uncover their professional credentials but also dig into their personal information , opinions , and attitudes many psychiatrists have blogs , facebook pages , and a chat room presence that patients could uncover , sometimes anonymously jacob sperber , m d , discusses the ethical and therapeutic pitfalls that appear when psychiatrists and patients google each other credit david hathcox patients and psychiatrists secretly googling each other raises all kinds of legal , ethical , ideological , and personal concerns , jacob sperber , m d , director of the psychiatry residency training program at ncumc , told the audience he believes that searching and gathering information about a patient behind the patient 's back potentially violates the patient 's autonomy and dignity and breaks the trust the patient has in the psychiatrist it may be a violation of the patient 's privacy , even if the psychiatrist 's intention was to provide zealous care hmm , i'm not so sure about this why is it okay for a patient to google me , but not okay for me to google them out of curiosity ? should n't there be some control over what 's up on the internet about us meaning all of us humans ? what do you think ?
