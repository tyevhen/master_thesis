dr michael price writes hello i'm writing in response to your clinical psychiatry news article re cpt coding , to let you and the other shrink rap people know about a free web based interactive teaching resource i developed for helping people learn cpt coding for psychiatry , trying to get the word out i do n't know if you 'd actually want to link to it in a cpn note or something , because it 's not official from any organization , but i think your members and others might want to know about it in some way or other , and it 's new enough i finished it mid february and i'm small enough just a person , not some organization with a big site and high traffic that it does n't really show up much in web searches about that sort of thing it has n't gotten a lot of hits as yet , but i have had very positive feedback from people who 've used it anyway , if you look at it and think it would be useful to people , please do whatever seems best to make people aware of it as a resource i think it 's one of the best ways to master coding quickly , and i do n't know why none of our organizations did something like this themselves to let people get hands on and see the nuts and bolts in action your article noted , dr schmidt suggested i buy a manual on how to use e m codes and noted , there probably is not a way to make learning this easy the truth be told , i want a way for this to be easy i think you might actually agree that maybe now there is , or about as easy as it can be or if not , i 'd like to know , since that was my goal , lol looking for something like this and not finding it except a very crude implementation on soapnotes org was what motivated me to create it the link to the page is here http home midmaine com mtpmd psychcodecoach html and it 's most easily directly found in searches by psychiatric code coach
