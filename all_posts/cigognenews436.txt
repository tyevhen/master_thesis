there is an article in the may june scientifc american mind on creativity here is what they propose creativity flows best when barriers are down good creative people do not fit in very well socially both creativity and eccentricity are the result of genetic variations not good that unfiltered information reaches conscious awareness in the brains of people who are highly intelligent and can process this information without being overwhelmed , leading to creativity and exceptional insights creative individuals are more likely to believe in past lives and other mystical and mysterious unsubstantiated notions that they all have what is known as cognitive disinhibition that their mental filters do not work properly they may suffer delusions and hallucinations , which i think is another form of creativity where we create scenarios that come out of our deep seated feelings if we can indeed create a mysterious scenario we may avoid cancer , in my opinion , because it means that there are leaky gates which allow feelings to push upward forcing new ideas we need to study to see if creative people die of cancer versus the more likely possibility of strokes and heart attacks , because lack of creativity in my opinion often indicates massive repression and therefore great pressure on the cells and of course when you have leaky gates it means massive first line trauma and damage that can lead to strange and mystical ideas unidentified flying objects , for example the more unidentified the better vagueness allows all kinds of kooky interpretations leaky gates , you may remember from my writing means broken defenses and unfiltered input what we have in the author s schema is a group of correlations they then try to put them together to draw scientific conclusions but correlations do not delve deep down where generating sources live and that is what we need in order to understand the phenomenon of creativity i use myself as an example i always was interested in music but i was never really good when i play in a mental hospital band and played alongside a great but crazy trumpeter i realized that i was never going to be as good as him i was too anxious to learn properly my gates were more than leaky they were flooded i was totally right brain where the origins of creativity and nutty ideas and beliefs reside later on , much later on , as i developed an intellect i could see and feel feelings and how they drove behavior i had creative insights mostly because my gates were still leaky and i also needed and finally had a working intellect i could think and feel , and think what i felt and that is one reason it led to primal i had basically illiterate parents so i never had to be smart for them and i wasn t they lived in their own world so there was no way i could be to get love from them the good part is there was no neurosis i could adopt that would work i was an anxiety case completely creative people focus on their inner life non creatives focus on the externals they effectively lack an inner life , an internal access to their feelings they are blocked off from their feelings and from creativity
