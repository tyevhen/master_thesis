my little one , i wish you nothing but the best this school year i'm already so proud of you today was your first day for this year and you already have a note from school saying you shared and took turns ha ! i'm sad because you 're gone all day now the school changed your status to have you there from morning to afternoon so the bus picks you up at am and drops you off at pm i missed you during the day but i kept plenty busy with your brother and with all the things i needed to do for my work and around the house you 're growing too darn fast i love you little birdie you are flying now ! love you always and forever , mama save you might also like mother 's day preschool concert year , happy birthday to p linkwithin
