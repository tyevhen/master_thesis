i'm currently reading , among others , a book called expect resistance , written and published by the crimethinc collective i have n't gotten all that far , but so far , it 's quite interesting and thought provoking i figured i 'd share a couple of short excerpts , to show you what i mean exchange economics presupposes a one dimensional scale of value , according to which everything can be appraised if an avocado costs a dollar , and a new sports car costs , , then a sports car must be worth exactly twenty thousand avocados but such equations are absurd can you calculate the financial value of a friendship , or the exchange rate of a clever joke for a meal tenderly prepared , the comparative worth of the sound of birds singing in the trees against the current market value of lumber ? those who would measure such things miss everything that is beautiful and unrepeatable about them once one recognizes this , it becomes clear how pathological such calculations are in any context to asses the commercial value of experiences and sensations , let alone trade in the very lives of the human beings around you with an eye to your own advantage , is to flatten the world for yourself and everyone you touch some call this a democracy did you get a say in what the billboards you pass every morning say , what they go on repeating inside your head all day , the trees they cut down by your house to make room for the new gas station ? how about the preservatives they put in the food you eat , or the conditions in the factories that produce them ? what about your wages at work , or how much money the irs takes from you ? these are n't just inevitable facts of life they are the manifestations of conflict as the system of human relations , every man for himself and force against us all the leagues of intimidating red tape and the battering of woman , the biased news coverage and the inhumanity of factory farms , the jockeying for ascendance between colleagues and countries , all these are simultaneously expressions of the strife at the heart of our civilization and weapons which , used by factions fighting for survival on its terms , perpetuate it peace , idzie you might also like an interesting excert fall days and new writing green anarchy awesome revolutionary quotes linkwithin
