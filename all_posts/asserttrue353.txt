i have n't blogged a heck of a lot over the past month or so , because i'm in the middle of a quixotic quest to finish a screenplay it 's been heck of a journey and the journey is in many ways just beginning i ca n't say a lot about the project just yet although i 'll definitely be saying more in future posts , so watch this space here 's what i can say first , writing a screenlay is hard it 's harder than a novel by quite a bit , i'm afraid secondly , it 's difficult writing something with the knowledge that maybe only a handful of people will ever read it i keep telling myself it 's good exercise even if it goes nowhere , it leaves me with all the scaffolding for a novel well defined characters with character arcs , a story , backstories , plot points , subplots , reversals , key dialog , key visuals thirdly , having said all this , i would n't waste my own nor anybody else 's time on a project i did n't think was truly epic , relevant , commercial , original , and flat out un putdownable the project is based on an original idea i had about two years ago it 's been germinating and blossoming ever since it 's a high concept story involving world hunger , with a philip k dick slant the concept proceeds from the idea what if you or someone you knew stumbled onto a tool , technique , technology , or idea that really , truly could make a dent in world hunger ? what then ? what then is pages of screenplay my first stab at this was a manuscript for a young adult novel that i got pages into a year ago before making the unforgivable mistake of sending off a few queries to agents , on a lark to my shock and horror , i got an immediate request for a full read and of course , there i sat with , words written and , unwritten i never got back to the agent instead , i put the project away for a while and thought about it some more and i realized that the story would play out a lot better if the hero was significantly older rather than have the hero be a year old indian american whiz kid , i decided it would be better to make him a year old white upper middle class american grad student with a female hindustani lab partner a post doc who , as his intellectual equal and cultural superior , in many ways , can keep our hero honest , point up his faults , challenge him , goad him , infuriate him , and eventually of course fall in love with him when he finally slays the figurative dragon but wait , you 're saying , is awfully old for a grad student , is n't it ? actually , i 've met the type before they get a master 's degree right off the bat , but when it comes time to finish the ph d , the lab work just never seems to add up to a thesis nature takes its time handing out dissertation worthy scientific discoveries you ca n't force a discovery laboratory science is an art luck is involved in my grad student days at u c davis , i knew several older students who had labored valiantly for six years seven being the max allowed by many universities to achieve a coherent set of results for a thesis , without ever actually getting there if you 're one of these people , it can be frustrating to watch a younger grad student move into the lab , work on something for a year , stumble onto a great scientific result , and have a ph d in months the two year science ph d is a very real phenomenon so is the seven year ph d , unfortunately my what if story follows the pair of young scientists on a journey that takes them from new haven , conneticut to madhya pradesh , india it 's epic in scale , global in relevance and multi ethnic in cast , has all the elements of a good suspense drama , and forces the viewer or reader to confront hard questions what if x ? what if y ? what if z ? what if all three ? i 'll be able to reveal more specifics soon i need to nail act iii first and that could take a while but i'm working on a self imposed deadline in two weeks , the screenplay will be done or i 'll stop eating until it is done hopefully it wo n't come to that on the theory that it is never too early to attach talent , i invite any actors or film people who might be interested in seeing the wga registered script when it 's available which is soon days , not months to drop me an e mail my hushmail dot com address is kasthomas inquiries will be kept in confidence
