life has not improved around here my mood , unfortunately , has not changed i'm feeling about as bleak as i can recall feeling in the recent and not so recent past the medication changes have not made an impact the ect treatments i 've already received did not change the course i am apparently on at this time , and i'm not willing to continue subjecting my brain to the amnesia inducing seizures although the pressure from my psychiatrist , whom i trust implicitly and respect immensely , to continue ect is significant i'm meeting with her tomorrow , so who knows ? i may be convinced to change my mind i am miserable enough , at this point , that i will listen to other treatment ideas i'm trying to resume my normal routine , but low energy , difficulty concentrating , and general lethargy make returning to any kind of routine difficult i did get a mile run in yesterday , but that knocked me flat for the rest of the day still , it was nice to run i ran hard , made it hurt , and that helped temporarily physical pain is so much easier for me to deal with than mental pain i'm going to try to run a little again today i actually have the new york city marathon coming up in three weeks i do n't think i 'll be at my best for that event , but i'm already entered , and i have my room and flight reserved , so i'm going to go and experience it anyway i hope my mood is better by then i do n't think i can take three more weeks of this i appreciate your comments and support your continued prayers for relief are certainly appreciated
