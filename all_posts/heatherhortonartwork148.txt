what do i ask of a painting ? i ask it to astonish , disturb , seduce , convince lucian freud the lookout , oil on canvas , x , is another painting of my friend carly one day i saw her at work and she had on the most beautiful white , flowing dress i had to paint it i asked her if she might wear it on a photoshoot she obliged and it is in the painting you see now we were out at lasalle park here in burlington and we had finished up our shots i really wanted to do another painting with a lot of sky and minimal ground in it the first place that came to mind was sioux lookout , a little spot next to lake ontario here in town we zipped across town and i got the shots i was after i wondered about landscape or portrait orientation for the canvas but portrait won out in the end i love painting atmospheric perspective and i knew i would have more fun with the different variations of blue with a portrait format years ago i painted another painting of sioux lookout i suppose it reoccurs in my work simply because i grew up very close to it and know how it might work into a painting i wanted carly to simply be looking it can be taken literally or metaphorically , like almost all of my work i try not to wax melodramatic in my paintings but the idea of painting a white flowing dress with lots of sky was just too appealing to pass up soon i am off to the alaskan interior to see what sort of paintings might come from its northern climes i have absolutely no idea how it will figure into my work , whether it will be an easy transition or a struggle people are integral for my paintings and i will rely upon capturing self portraits and new friends who are amenable to being painted fortunately no one has declined my offer yet so i hope that trend continues ! the trick is to fight against wanting to paint landscape heavy works in a place so very topographically unique i have to find that bridge between the two and hopefully find a successful melding of subject matter on the canvas every artist dips his brush in his own soul , and paints his own nature into his pictures henry ward beecher quotes
