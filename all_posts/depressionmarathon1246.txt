it 's been a rough few days around here puck is pretty uncomfortable puck 's mom is pretty uncomfortable unlike puck , i ca n't deal with it by lying flat on the floor and whimpering well , actually , i could i did it did n't help puck 's probably thinking the same thing right now after hours of lying there whimpering , puck still ca n't walk when he arises when i arise , i still feel sad and overwhelmed , and amazingly none of the overwhelming offenders were tamed while i lied there whimpering i dislike being overwhelmed i dislike my house being in total disarray i dislike my lawn being the tallest and ugliest on the block i dislike facing a project knowing i do not have the energy to even begin it i dislike seeing my boy in pain i dislike worrying i dislike missing scheduled running days because there is too much exhausting chaos whipping about my life i dislike whining and i am whining i know i also know i am lucky to have a home i am lucky to have enough stuff in my life to even allow for chaos i am lucky to have a nurturing relationship with a pet i am lucky to have a strong heart , working muscles , and a willingness and desire to run i am lucky to have the opportunity to continue competing in a sport which i love i am lucky to have supportive friends , family and professionals surrounding me for all of these things , i am incredibly grateful i am sad and overwhelmed , and i very much dislike my current state of affairs but i need to keep reminding myself that things could be a lot worse this is nothing ! and i am grateful for that my therapist encouraged me to focus on my accomplishments this week , rather than beat myself up for all i am not getting done it 's a great idea following through with the idea that 's the piece i forget i 'll try harder to remember it
