i'm going to do a little problem solving here in the washington post yesterday in virginia does n't need another mental health task force , pete earley writes virginians should be embarrassed and angry that a newly appointed state mental health task force convened tuesday in richmond it is the th task force asked to investigate the state s mental health system if you click through to hit the link , you 'll note that this th task force on mental health has members politicians love task forces , it 's a way to look like something is being done without actually doing anything so now people , presumably on someone 's payroll , have to coordinate their time to be at these meeting , write reports , and in this case , reinvent the wheel i 'll point out two other quotes from mr earley 's commentary , and then i'm offering my suggestions on how to fix the problem to the state of virginia at no cost , here on my free blog , and all of those people can go home and spend quality time with their families first virginia s inspector general warned in a may report that people were turned away from hospitals during one month period because of a lack of beds , even though the patients were considered a danger to themselves or others second virginians must look at the big picture after the virginia tech shootings , our task force lowered the criteria for involuntarily committing someone into a hospital while a positive step , this has proved ineffective because there are not enough hospital beds meanwhile , people in state hospitals are ready to go home but can t leave because there is no affordable housing in their communities it costs per day to keep those patients in a hospital it would cost per day for them to live in a community setting you can t fix one tire and expect a car to run if the other three are flat so in my state maryland , the average length of stay in a psychiatric unit is roughly days for certified patients , it gets a little longer , more like days in virginia , we 're told , patients year are released from er and i 'll assume they have similar lengths of hospital stay distributed evenly over the year , we 're talking roughly hospital beds if each of those patients stays for a full days let 's be generous here let 's say that you need a few more beds in case the patients do n't distribute their admissions evenly through the year , so let 's give the state of virginia extra beds for their population of million it seems they need one new psychiatry unit in a general hospital , or one extra bed in units around the state all this fuss for a dozen , or less , hospital beds ? but mr earley also points out that the state could save money by moving state hospital patients who are ready for discharge to a community setting , so presumably they do n't even need to build a new facility , they just need to move a dozen patients to a community setting i imagine the cost to run a state hospital is a fixed cost , so the total cost of doing this is the day patient cost of moving those patients or roughly , year chump change to get treatment for dangerous people one last suggestion to virginia change the law requiring a hospital bed be found within hours of a judge issuing an order for hospitalization i'm imagine the law came about because people were left in ers for days at a time , as they are here in maryland , so a humane requirement to move the process along is fine , but a law ? and six hours ? in that time , i 'll assume the police have to get the patient , transport him her to the er , get through triage , clarify health insurance , do vital signs , lab work , medical clearance , psychiatric evaluation including discussions with family and the patient 's doctor , and locate a bed a process that entails 'calling around' might i also suggest they set up a google form that hospitals could update a few times a day with their bed availability ? in six hours maybe the patient gets brought in and does n't need hospitalization ? there was a misunderstanding , or he 's acting strangely because his blood sugar is low , or she ran out of medicine and just need to be restarted on it but those things take more time sometimes , after a patient calms down having the police grab someone makes everyone angry and gets a thoughtful look and perhaps medications , then a few hours for the medicine to take effect , and the patient may agree to sign in voluntarily as i noted above , this makes for a shorter average length of stay other times , the patient can be sent home , but a psychiatrist in an emergency room ca n't know that until he 's had a chance to observe the patient for a while , and to clarify what the outpatient follow up might be and what setting he is sending the patient home to i do n't know that the laws we have in maryland are any better than those in virginia we also have problems with access to care , both inpatient or outpatient , and we also have our own mega task force the continuity of care committee sometimes i wonder if common sense could take care of some of these issues , but as pete earley notes , it requires taking a stand and then moving forward , and change is hard i am starting to think that in virginia it sounds to be very easy to get a gun and very hard to get mental health care
