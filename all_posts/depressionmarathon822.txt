a new week begins i'm ready to go , drinking my coffee , watching sportscenter , waiting for when i can see my first patient just two blocks from my home i love that i finished a long week yesterday by working hours at mayo my weekend on call position and then attempting an minute run in degree heat and humidity i say attempted because my legs were dead and the heat oppressive ! wow ! i think it was just last week when we had several days in the 's ! i did n't quite make minutes i was done after sixty four but wait , i have an even better reason than the heat for coming up short ! on saturday , i had a three workout day i started with the usual cable class strength workout an hour later , on a very windy day , i was on my bike after miles , i jumped off the bike and ran miles despite feeling shredded , i was pretty pleased with my effort it was a tough workout , and i did it i feel like i'm getting ready for the triathlon , which is now just one month away i'm hoping things settle down a little bit this week i do n't think i can handle many more days of high stress i worry about my mood taking a hit if things stay so busy fortunately , i have fewer workouts scheduled this week , as i start counting down to the race unfortunately , work is going to be very busy since i still feel very , very new , work already feels stressful i 've got to cut myself some slack , i think , and be okay with questions and mistakes to keep my mood in check , i 've got to keep putting one foot in front of the other and pray for a little serenity this week if i start feeling out of whack , you 'll hear it here first , as this will be the first place i look for solace thank you all for that
