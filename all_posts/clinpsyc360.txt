i think that complaining about the blogger switch cued me to other complaints like this one i was at bruegger 's bagels the other day i was asked if i 'd like my bagel sliced i responded in the affirmative looking at my receipt , i noted that it cost cents to have it sliced it took about five seconds to slice that is per minute and per hour to slice a damn bagel mind you , i was not told it would cost me a red cent she put it to me as if it were a favor with adorable little doe eyes , she asked , would you like your bagel sliced ? what was i going to do , say no ?
