running through the streets late this afternoon , i was reminded of similar runs last christmas and thanksgiving days the weather , perhaps , was similar i was running with puck each time , and each occasion was a family holiday my memory was tripped , however , because during each run the streets were eerily quiet despite the sunshine time of day today , i was even transported back to when i ran a beautiful easter day miler around the charles river in boston quiet , quiet , quiet there is something serene about running through a sunny , quiet city in the middle of the day the usual raucous activity occurs , on holidays , behind closed doors rather than in the streets so , despite being alone on each of these gathering days , i have found beauty and serenity on the vacated streets i could feel sad and pathetic spending holidays alone , but instead i discovered today that being single creates a unique gift i receive the gift of empty streets and public solitude because all around me pull their families inside and close the doors i get to enjoy the city as few ever do like today , when it was bright and alive , yet expansive and serene just me and puck cruising down the middle of the street and i have a feeling my last three holidays alone may have been a bit more enjoyable than some of the family laden holidays unfolding behind the doors i passed happy easter
