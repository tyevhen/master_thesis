it 's been nearly years of shrink rap posts this is post number , i 've rambled and ranted so much , i do n't know what i 've said and what i have n't said , much less what the other shrink rappers have talked about so meg asked clinkshrink to comment on this article about bernie madoff 's psychotherapy in prison mary jo says we could have a field day with charlie sheen it was a joke , as evidenced by the in the comment at least i think it was a joke instead , i thought i 'd write about the goldwater rule and how shrinks ca n't talk to the media about people they have n't examined this feels familiar maybe clinkshrink already posted about it ? a quick search , and i 'remembered' that i wrote a post called we do n't say just about two years ago regarding bernie madoff and charlie sheen , i think we 'll stick to no comment
