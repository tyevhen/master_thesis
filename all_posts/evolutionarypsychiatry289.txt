the good news about selenium and the brain is that one can become familiar with the literature with full institutional access to pubmed and an hour or so of reading time the bad news is that the mechanisms of selenium and the brain are rather mysterious , so all we have are a few papers , some micronutrient supplementation , and some speculation all right let 's talk pregnancy and depression for a minute little known fact that slightly more women are depressed during pregnancy than after it and if you combine ante and post natal depression statistics , this is what you get for the moms and kiddos poor maternal self care , increase in alcohol and drug use during pregnancy , decrease in seeking medical care during pregnancy , more pre eclampsia , birth difficulties , preterm delivery , reduced breastfeeding , lower apgar scores , poor sleep , failure to thrive , developmental delays , greater risk of illness in the baby , more behavioral problems , and at years , offspring of depressed mothers are almost five times more likely to suffer depression themselves there are any number of social and medical factors that are linked to perinatal depression , but let 's focus a bit on the nutritional ones links have been found with folate status , vitamin b , calcium , iron , selenium , zinc , and omega s kaplan and colleagues , in a must see literature review , found potential beneficial effects from b vitamins , vitamin c , d , and e , calcium , chromium , iron , magnesium , zinc , selenium , and choline on mood symptoms real food best fetal dinner a very recent study to which i , sadly , do not have full access showed a significantly decreased edinburgh postnatal depression scale score that 's good in pregnant women randomized to receive mcg selenium daily from the first trimester until delivery back to selenium as you recall , it is a vital component of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase and is required for the synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones and way back in , benton and cook did a randomized controlled crossover trial of mcg of selenium vs placebo in people for weeks , followed by a month washout , then the crossover arm of the trial selenium supplementation was associated with increases in self reported mood this same paper tells us that when push comes to shove and selenium is deficient , the brain is the last place that selenium levels drop , suggesting that in the brain , selenium is important more recently , gosney et al reviewed the effects of micronutrient supplementation on mood in nursing home residents , finding that no residents started out with insufficient serum levels of selenium , yet weeks of mcg selenium supplementation included in a multivitamin multimineral with mcg iodine was directly correlated with decreases in depression scores and increases in serum levels the supplementation of these elderly people with selenium resulted in reduced serum t and increased serum t , suggesting that the additional selenium helped the rather boring t become the metabolically active t and kick some serious sluggish metabolic and depression expletive deleted here any of you with hypothyroidism on synthroid t get a recommendation from your doctor to supplement iodine or selenium ? hmmm in other studies , selenium serum level was associated with cognition in the elderly in a year follow up of alzheimer 's patients , cognitive decline associated with dropping selenium levels there 's hardly enough data even to speculate , but i 'll give it a whirl selenium is more like magnesium than zinc i think most non alcoholic non anorexic meat eaters not on thiazide diuretics probably have enough zinc on board , though stress and yellow number five might make you waste it a bit faster than normal but magnesium is low in pretty much everyone , as is selenium if you are n't a coal miner or a fish in selenium rich fertilizer run off lakes selenium deficiency will mask itself as a somewhat subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism , with depression , fatigue , and grumpiness along for the ride replete the selenium and jazz up the t happiness to follow not sure what that has to do with the brain holding onto selenium , but maybe that 's where the glutathione comes in but i have a lot more reading to do before i jump into the thyroid in the mean time that multimineral ai n't such a bad idea or seaweed and brazil nuts though barkeater was right ! according to the internet , brazil nuts have times more radium than other foods not that much is supposedly retained in the body ? ? or organ meats good fuel for everyone months and older
