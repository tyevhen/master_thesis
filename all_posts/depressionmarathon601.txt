another monday , and here i am i am dressed and ready for work again the weekend was long i wish i could say it was pretty , but it was n't i grappled with the decision of whether or not to go to the hospital more than once i was so low , suicide crept in and took up residence in my brain i could n't see a way out , and i could n't stand feeling so miserable any longer yet here i am it 's monday i survived i pulled out all the stops and did what i needed to do i talked to a lot of people over the weekend , friends and professionals alike i wrote a lot i ranted against the devil of depression , as i was furious with this illness i took my meds as prescribed , including the as needed meds i do n't always like to take i exercised when i could it was n't much , but it was better than nothing i slept a lot my energy was sapped , and sleep , at least , was a good diversion i did the best i could , and this morning things appear slightly brighter i survived i do n't like writing about feeling so miserable maybe i want to be some sort of depression hero , one who always puts up a noble , beautiful fight but this weekend the truth was uglier than that at times i was a tearful , crumbled mess rather than a poised , striking statue despite the ugliness , i made it through it 's monday here i am i'm still fighting the not always beautiful fight , and i'm hoping the battle will be over soon
