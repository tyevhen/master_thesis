i forgot to post two raven poems a reader looked forward to i have a third but it 's not soup yet my spirit guides withered in the sizzling afternoon , black smokestacks of glisten , dark wings dumbstruck silver wet ravens exfoliating steam i grok their raucous caws , listen not the kookaburra in the eucalyptus nor the turkey vulture in the date palm , more the great heron stabbing fish at the center of all birds , a calm so large no feather raised against the wind denies it , no pinion , quill or tail recedes without shifting the air 's resistance toward it ravens on rooftops and rails shine bright silver to other birds i bless the gin rummy of their tails , black angels with their secret wurd , but i won t trust them signs follow wonders , wonders , faith these birds are not divine psychosis and poetry are twins while prophecy 's another thing unpublished survivor raven pecks a pine , click click click like a woodpecker to fool me , then cries craah craah craah and flaps black fingered wings away an iridescent sheen creasing the neck betrays his monotone like a film of oil on water black eyes see no color , though black beak eats anything , going where vultures ca n't in the middle of roads , quick to rise before wheels arrive the tlingit indians have two clans either you are a raven or an eagle i want to be a raven published in my first book , elementary i 'll return to sine wave tomorrow my mood is holding dare i venture to say i'm at kilobunny ? to assert such a notion scares the dickens out of me , because i know how thin the paper is on the closet door where the monster hides , waiting to devour me i have an immense respect for depression , the kind of respect sigfried must have for tigers or was it roy ? whichever one was dragged across the stage by the neck i'm never safe and i only have today it is through my actions that i live , while remembering that speech is an action and that inaction is also an action thine in truth and art , dr craig chaffin
