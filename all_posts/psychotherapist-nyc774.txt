when i stop to notice , i'm often surprised and delighted at the small wonders that are all around us recently , i was crossing the street , on my way to the subway , when i noticed a mother and her small son stop to pick up something in the street small wonders al around us if we take the time to notice the mother reached down and picked up what looked to me , at first , like a very pretty , orange , transparent piece of paper but when i looked closer , i saw that it was n't a piece of paper at all it was a beautiful butterfly that had been lying in the middle of the street for some unknown reason as the mother gently picked it up by its wings and placed it carefully in the palm of her hand , the butterfly remained motionless small wonders all around us if we take the time to notice i feared that it had been run over by a car , and might have been dead the little boy peered at the motionless body of the butterfly as the mother said , let 's let it rest here as she put it gently on a plant leaf in a nearby garden suddenly , the motionless butterfly came back to life , as if it had been temporarily stunned , spread her beautiful wings and flew away it was such a simple thing , and yet i felt my spirit lifted as i watched the butterfly revive and fly away i felt so grateful to the woman who noticed it , picked it up , and rested it gently on the leaf until it could revive itself it really made my day the mother and her son were also delighted a few months ago , i was on my way to yoga class early on a saturday morning when , from the corner of my eye , i noticed something floating in the air i was passing a local greek eastern orthodox church and against the background of the church 's dark stone structure , i saw a beautiful , small , white , diaphanous silky strip of cloth come spiraling down in the air i could n't imagine where this silky strip of cloth could have come from then , suddenly , i saw a sparrow fly over and , without skipping a beat , like poetry in motion , she clasped the beautiful strip in her mouth and flew up to her nearby nest that she was building it all happened in a matter of seconds i stood there for a moment , delighted and grateful to watch this magical sight had i walked by a moment or two before or after , i would have missed it so often , there are small wonders all around us if we 're open to seeing them i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , somatic experiencing therapist , and emdr therapist in nyc i work with individuals and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com
