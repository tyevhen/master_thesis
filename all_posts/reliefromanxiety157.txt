i do n't know how i can begin to comprehend the journey that has been this year if you 've been following my blog , you 'll know that last year was hell in more ways than one you can read more about , here although the year had a rocky start , with my worst depressive episode , it was immensely better than anxiety was still a big problem in terms of school , but by beginning a course of medication , life became so much easier i began to tackle the things that scared me the most i was definitely pinned to the post between life and death , but i can happily say that this year has been one of the best in a long time , and for that i am forever grateful i do n't think you can truly experience the beauty that life holds , unless you have been to the darkest depths this year , i have felt the fresh air like never before and held on to moments with every last grip in a way , i can experience life at a new level this year , instead of having limited positive experiences to talk about , i have too many to list from getting into university i have to say , i am having the time of my life , meeting my idol for the second time , being discharged from therapy , conquering some of my anxiety triggers , concerts , travelling the list could go on never did i think that i would experience happiness again , and even though i still have my bad days , and although i know have n't gotten over my anxiety completely , my life is a world away from the last year it 's almost incomprehensible once i was on the tightrope between life and death and now i am living independently and discovering happiness once more i cannot thank my family , friends and teachers enough , as without them i do n't know where i 'd be and of course you , the readers of my blog have been super supportive and for that i thank you i wrote in last years' , year in review that i hoped that the next year would be more of a dream than a nightmare , and my hopes have become a reality at the beginning of , i could n't leave the house and now , at the end of , i am living independently i never thought it possible , but life is full of twists and turns you can do it when people ask me what my greatest achievement is out of this continuing process , i have to think but , my answer always remains the same surviving i say because i never thought i 'd see the day best wishes , amy xx
