lots has happened since i last posted the biggest thing is i am getting married in just weeks and hours time i am really looking forward to married life and initially i will not be working i have handed my notice in at work as the stress has been relentless although i am reasonably well compared to depressions i have had in the past , work is unbearable i have awkward clients that do not understand english , who keep changing their minds and want the world and all by tomorrow the company policy seems to be we never say no to a client no matter whether their request is ethical or even possible mr r is being fantastic , he did really want me to quit i have some savings which means i do not have to worry about being unemployed for a few months at the moment i am not sure whether i will continue my career or go into less demanding employment in another industry now i am getting married and i am sharing living expenses , i can afford to take a pay cut which leaves me options to work part time or even perhaps retrain i am still struggling with mental health services on the nhs as work has been hard and my confidence has been low i have had a few bad days as i have also reduced my medication i went to my gp and asked to talk to someone , perhaps some counselling or cbt before things get worse i said ! they referred me to a counselling service which i had to wait one month for someone to ring me to assess my needs after this call they rejected me as my problems are too complex and i have been referred to psychological services for assessment and they may refer me back to the counselling service this is a nightmare in the mean time i have been doing some cbt online at the moodgym , it seems to be a really good program i have to work my notice period for a further two months before i leave my job , i leave a few days before the wedding right now i do n't think i will make it another months but i really want to get out of the job without a black mark against my name so i get a reference i also do n't want to have to cut back on the wedding budget i have to balance this against sitting in front of the computer staring at it blankly all day , the days really drag doing this and it is not getting any work done nor doing my health any good i best stare at something work related for a little while
