tonight at least 'tonight' in eastern standard time in the the us , mckayla maroney slipped on her second vault , and surrendered the gold medal to the romanian competitor she was expected to win the gold , and her distress and disappointment were obvious as the cameras zoomed in on her as someone who is neither athletic nor coordinated , i am in awe of all the olympians , and i find it sad that a young woman would be so disappointed after winning a silver medal in a very competitive and difficult sport she was , i might add , no where near as gracious as oscar pistorius , the south african runner with the double leg prostheses who finished last in the meter semi finals maroney reminded me that years ago , i published a short piece in the american journal of psychiatry , an introspection piece titled going for the gold if you ca n't get in to the site , try here it 's short , i promise i suppose we all are left with the question of how good is good enough ?
