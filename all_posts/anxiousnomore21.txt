it 's been at least a year and a half since i have had a panic attack but sure enough , thursday night i had panic attacks and then generalized anxiety ever since i believe it was brought on due to the fact that i weaned my baby from nursing last week and my daughter 's rd birthday party was on saturday the combination of my whacked out hormones and a huge stressor was more than i could take i 've noticed a pattern to how i deal with these sudden anxiety outbreaks i think i get a little better each time at dealing with them so i thought i would share my process both the good and bad with you hopefully you can adjust as needed for your situation the first thing i do is freak out this area needs improvement lol after the panic attacks happened , my mind was racing worried about the impact this would have on the next few days and i was a little out of control i cried alot and my stomach cramped all night and i could n't sleep the next thing i do is mourn i mourn for the loss of my anxiety free days i have my internal pity parties , why me moments , and laying around feeling sick and sorry for myself this is what i did all morning on friday in the past this mourning period has lasted much longer it could drag on for a week so just one morning is improvement for me maybe someday i will be able to skip this step altogether then i finally realize i need to change my attitude and get to a better place on friday afternoon i went to the reality of anxiety site and read the following blog posts to get me pumped even more about morning anxiety it 's all about your attitude need a little faith and motivation ? on saturday morning i implemented the coping strategies in those posts and others i have learned over time i did a lot of abdominal breathing , i repeated positive affirmations ex this may be hard but i can handle it over and over again , i asked my spouse for a lot of love and support and got lots of hugs and kisses and i listened to my body and ate when i could sunday i made sure to have a destress day where i lounged around in comfy clothes and then today i did some yoga and tried to get back to my normal routine after the birthday party i felt alot better simply because the stress was over , but sunday and this morning i still had lingering morning anxiety i 've continued to tell myself it is n't a big deal and it has been going away much quicker i am hopeful it will be gone completely in the next few days and if its not , i will reassess if i need additional help like medication if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like they 're here anxiety is full of ups and downs how stress affects the body stop the world i wanna get off linkwithin
