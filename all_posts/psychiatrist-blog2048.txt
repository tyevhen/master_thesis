posted by dinah this post was inspired by dr a 's account of his patient jen in his post bride of hyperthyroidism and by carrie 's neonursechic , whom i always find inspiring response to it hey , doc , she said , do n't forget to come to my wedding next month it 's going to be a good time she then proceeded to tell me the entire plan for the day , which made her face light up and bring a smile to her face i'm sure it will be , i said , i would n't miss it for anything and carrie commented doctors are a part of my life and hear all the negative things that happen all the time it 's nice to be able to give back and show i'm a normal human , too , and share the positives , too ! hope jen gets her hyperthyroidism controlled and has a beautiful wedding ! this is the thing about being a psychiatrist it 's this funny little world inside the office where intimacy reigns and boundaries become oh so important psychotherapy mandates a number of important boundaries , sometimes they feel rigid , but mostly they serve as a protective barrier i could ramble about the obvious defined meeting times and pre determined session lengths , very restricted physical contact i'm good with a handshake at the initial evaluation , and sometimes patients will hug me at the termination of therapy , a gesture that is beyond me to refuse , payment in exchange for the services this , in addition to being a boundary issue helps me pay my bills , and perhaps most important , limiting meetings to the therapeutic sessions which take place in my office in all honesty , i 'd rather not see my patients anywhere else given a choice , i do n't even want to ride the elevator with them mostly , i think my patients would rather not be with me outside the office , too of course , it 's a bit inevitable i ran into a patient one day when i was out for a walk i introduced her to max , my dog , and she said , i did n't know you had a dog i do when i bump into patients and i'm with my kids , invariably they ask , who 's that ? and i'm left to mutter something i hope wo n't lead to more questions people tell me about the events in their lives usually they do n't invite me , they seem to instinctively know the rule sometimes they 'll say , i wish you could be there recently , a patient asked me to come to his art opening he mentioned it several times , he gave me an invitation , he asked me to invite all my friends it was important to him that people come , and he made it clear he wanted me to come what would i tell people if they asked who i was ? this is always an issue for outside the office stuff i'm the artist 's psychiatrist that just does n't fly it 's a problem dr a does n't have he can go to a patient 's wedding and just be dr a everyone knows i see you , he said so i guess i could have said i was the artist 's psychiatrist , i just would n't i went alone the room was packed , my patient was holding court and doing a wonderful job , though i knew he was extremely anxious i walked around , loved his artwork , tried to guess who was who from the puzzle of his life that i 'd heard so much about inside the office he was , for that moment , a normal human actually , a rather talented human with a normal life a woman approached me and introduced herself as the artist 's mother i introduced myself by my first name only , shook her hand and simply said her son had invited me mostly i stayed lost in the crowd and enjoyed the artwork the opening was great , the artist announced a few days later i wish you could have come i did , i said he looked surprised , then delighted i told him which were my favorite pieces , told him how well i thought he did somehow i was pleased to have both been there and yet been just a little invisible
