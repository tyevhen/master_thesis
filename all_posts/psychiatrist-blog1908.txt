posted by dinah i tell people things about my life and they look at me kind of funny it 's that look that says , really loudly despite the fact that no noise pops out , you do what ? or maybe more like , you do what ? clink did it recently when i mentioned that i have coffee every morning with my friend the judge and her dog , tex she said , every day ? how do you do that ? just to be clear on this , i have coffee every morning with a friend sometimes two , for twenty five minutes , right before work , it 's how i start my day , every day , for years now oh , and i write fiction one more way to get funny looks now i take a grad school course in fiction techniques doctors are n't suppose to do this did i mention i have a psychiatry blog ? at that point , the noise gets louder , i'm told i have much too much free time and should i bother with the fact that i exchange emails three times a day yes , i mean three times a day , well sometimes more with a high school friend i reconnected with after decades ? and that we 've done this every day for the last months or so ? i used to feel a bit awkward about it i 've wondered why other people do n't have more time they 're quick to point out to me that it 's because i work part time , what can i say ? for a while , my answer to how do you have time ? was to get a bit defensive and say i'm more efficient than you amazing anyone even wants to be my friend , but hey ask an obnoxious question and i 've given up , i concede , and now i just say , i have the life everyone else wants it 's not so bad
