citizen safety related video about arizona borders and citizen safety house session house session the first is to control the border when we can trulyly look with app honest answer in the eye of our fellow citizens and say americas arizona borders and citizen safety commonly question about arizona borders and citizen safety question would my fellow democrats please stop and listen to why we need

progressive axis of evil , bama , pelsi reid question why don t arizona ignore court ruling and go ahead and guard the border what can the govt do ? the fed court just ruled it was illegal for arizona to guard its own border so why not tell obummer and the courts go to hell and guard them anyway for the safety of the american citizens only thing i see they could do is impose sanctions and they would probably be tougher sanctions on arizona than there are on iran knowing these bunch of heathens occupying the white house answer arizona doesn t have the authority to guard the us border with mexico that s a us responsibility if arizona s senators and congressmen think arizona isn t being sufficiently protected , let them sponsor a bill to increase the border patrol and change us immigration laws to allow more forceful action against illegals anyone seen any of them do that lately ? then of course , mccain was one of the primary supports of bush s immigration reform act

place to live please support arizona citizens safety by controling illegal borader crossings answer on a normal day and under normal circumstances old school mc and i disagree i m a conservative , he a way left liberal but , today we agree the arizona immigration law is not racist , not anti immigration , and is almost identical to the federal laws on the book , only this law tells the police to enforce the law it has support across the board legal latinos , american indians , whites , asians , dems , repubs , liberals , conservatives , men , women , young , old in fact the only group that is not well over in support is blacks and they are split what it does do is make the administration either act or not obama said during his campaign that he would act on closing the borders in his first year , either another failure or a lie napolitano , as gov of az , wrote to those in washington begging for action , now she has been written to also and ignored the issue , until now and she plays politics , telling everyone the borders are not a problem and she and the dems in power have the situation in hand problem is it is in the hands of the illegals crossing the border maybe this law will work , maybe the feds under either party will actually do the part of their job where they swear to protect and defend we shall see
