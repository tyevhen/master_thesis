i evaluate cms and dam systems for a living , and one thing i keep coming back to is the fact that so very few of these expensive systems do workflow well i think part of this may be because there are no industry accepted standards around the kind of workflow i'm talking about thus , every vendor reinvents the wheel the closest thing to a standard is bpelpeople , which is an extension of bpel and thus too heavy , imho there needs to be a minimalist standard around this domain space , something dedicated to human facing interactions , supporting process facing tasks optionally , not the other way around i think the other reason so many web cms and dam vendors fail to do a nice job with workflow is that it 's just plain hard light duty taskflow or workflow or pageflow , as we called it where i once worked is deceptively difficult to implement , especially if there 's a requirement for good uis around administration , design , and reconfiguration of workflows and especially if there 's a requirement for hot failover being able to deal with stonith and other messinesses and especially if you need to support acyclic reentrant flows and especially if you want to offer good extensibility apis and , and , and most systems that support approval workflows of the type seen in web publishing scenarios get the basics right , but after that , not typically , though , the customer has n't really thought out his or her use cases very well before buying a system and so begins a long process of design , test , rollout , fail , back to the drawing board setting up workflows typically means developers need to touch xml , code , properties files , templates , and or miscellaneous artifacts , often editing them by hand since it 's unusual to get good tools for this you may be able to draw a basic flow on a canvas although even that is n't done well , by many vendors , but applying timeout and retry policies , and handlers for exceptional conditions , may involve a good bit of dirty fingernails work when you 're all done , the customer thinks okay , done this should last us for all eternity glad we never have to do that again ! but very soon , it becomes clear that a number of corner cases that were not anticipated at the design stage need to be handled better so it 's surgery time again back to messing with a bunch of artifacts and their cobweb of dependencies , then finding a way to test it all , etc administratration is often not well supported how do you run a report for all workflows of type x in the past month that either finished abnormally , did n't finish at all , or took too long ? do n't tell me look in the logs what ui tools do you have for simply finding an orphaned workflow , or killing an in progress workflow instance ? how do you know if bouncing one machine in a cluster left one or more workflows of potentially hundreds in progress in an inconsistent state ? and then there 's rights administration when sally goes on vacation , how does she give her subordinate , bob , her rights in the system for a workflow of type a but not for workflows of type b ? the issues get sticky in a hurry but i do occasionally see workflow systems that combine decent functionality with a usable graphic designer , or with good administrative tools but it 's hard to get a robust engine , a good feature set , good visual design tools , and good administrative tools all in one package there are always warts and holes so i think the right way to look at all this , if you 're a vendor , is that this presents a ripe opportunity if you 're a cms or dam vendor looking to differentiate , provide a superior workflow solution but there 's also an opportunity in the market , right now imho , for someone to come up with a fully productized lightweight workflow product with decent design , development , and admin tools , and easy extensibility of course , that can be bolted onto a web cms or dam system with little effort , so that customers who are using bespoke wf systems of the kind that are so common in this industry can move over to real workflow and get real work done i wonder why products like this are n't more common ? again probably because it 's hard but again this is an opportunity for someone
