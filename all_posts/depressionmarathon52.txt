the saga of my back will continue for another weeks i am scheduled for back surgery on wednesday , june st recovery and restrictions after surgery will last at least weeks the surgery will be a minimally invasive procedure to remove the extruded piece of disc currently displacing my l nerve root there are lots of risks , of course , but they each occur or less of the time , and the chance of never regaining my ankle flexion is high if i do n't have the surgery i ca n't run with foot drop there is a chance i will not regain my ankle flexion even with the surgery , but surgery is the best option to make me a runner again i ca n't imagine my life without running , so the decision was actually pretty simple i'm anxious , of course , about the surgery i'm trying to keep the negative thoughts at bay the thoughts of waking up in even more pain or paralyzed are the worst , but i push them aside , as i must , or i would n't be able to move even with no surgical complications , it will likely be a long time before i find out if i 'll be able to run again it 's going to be a long road of re strengthening what is now a very weak left leg i 've already lost so much thinking about what i 've lost , and what could have been saved if my mri had been read correctly , and if i had been listened to by my inpatient treatment providers it 's of no use to me now i sent a letter to the radiologist explaining the negative trickle down effect his erroneous reading has had on me and my care i honestly answered all of the questions on the hospital satisfaction survey i received i do n't expect an apology i do n't need one i did what i could now i have to work on letting go of my resentments now i have to face and deal with what i can control in today alone so that 's what i'm trying to do let go move forward and pray for the best outcome possible update surgery moved up to monday , june th i 'll let you know how it goes
