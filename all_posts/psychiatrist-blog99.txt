regular followers of this blog know that every year about this time i put up a series of posts entitled what i learned the purpose of the posts is to give people a peek inside the annual conference of the american academy of psychiatry and the law as well as some exposure to the kind of topics forensic psychiatrists are interested in general psychiatry residents may find it helpful , particularly if they are considering a career in forensic psychiatry and if they ca n't afford to travel to the conference our organization , aapl , is an international group with members from canada , the uk , australia , and south america our international members deserve to see what 's going on , as well this year , we will boost our international presence by livestreaming a select number of presentations through the meerkat mobile app here is a schedule of the presentations we will stream directions on how to use meerkat are below in addition , select aapl members have volunteered to moderate questions on each presention through twitter hashtags will be announced through meerkat , twitter , and slides at the actual presentation we 've never tried this before , and we are all volunteers rather than professional videographers , so there may be a few snags or hitches but overall we 're hopeful people will find it educational and fun the conference begins on thursday , oct nd and continues through sunday here 's the schedule thursday graham glancy witness protection program a matter of training thursday ken appelbaum the new apa guidelines on correctional psychiatry thursday ryan wagoner the psychiatrist in peril current topics in malpractice friday tobias wasser novel approach to teaching residents about violence safety friday drew kingston phd the relationship between mental illness and violence friday caitlin costello adolescents and social medica privacy , brain development and law friday robert forrest treatment of transgender inmates friday rosa negron munoz educational factors contributing to juvenile delinquency saturday madelon baranoski role of forensic psychiatry in veteran evaluations saturday anna glezer myths and realities of women in prison saturday jennifer piel what gets judges in trouble ? saturday keith stowell forensic issues in emergency psychiatry sunday hal wortzel tbi update international collaboration on mtbi and dsm sunday stephen simring forensic psychiatry and the death penalty sunday lynn maskel rock and a hard place debating sexual sadism diagnosis here s how you use meerkat first , go to the app store , search for meerkat app , and download it meerkat will ask you to type in your phone number for verification then , they ll send you a four digit confirmation code next , connect the app with your twitter account if you prefer , you can skip this step and check the app out in stealth mode if you don t want to add friends , don t connect your accounts simply scroll down and you ll see anyone who s live streaming right away keep scrolling for more search for and follow aapl we will have a schedule of streams posted each day for simultaneous sessions , aapl members may use their own twitter accounts which we will announce you can search for them on meerkat as well this is all a tremendous experiment so i want to thank my colleagues , aapl , and our viewers in advance for participating i'm looking forward to your questions , comments , and discussion clinkshrink aka clinkshrink aka annette hanson , md program co chair
