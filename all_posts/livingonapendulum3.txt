i wonder if anyone out there gets tired of hearing but you are just something , or anything along those lines i get that quite a bit and it has started really getting to me lately you are just bipolar , it 's nothing serious , nothing to worry about plus you have a mild version of it funny , my psychiatrist and family doctor would quite disagree with that statement i may make it look easy , i may make it look mild , but i work very hard at it my bipolar is mainly depression with the odd mild mania here and there however , my depressive episodes can be quite severe and debilitating when i get like that i hide it , i struggle but do n't let it show as much as i can i get suicidal , everything becomes very dark and hopeless the cycles come quite often now many who have this issue will take antidepressants to help take the edge off due to my type of bipolar , i cannot take antidepressants , when i do , i become extremely manic , uncontrollably manic i may abhor my depressions but i fear the manias no matter what i will not touch antidepressants of any kind with a foot pole doctors have tried giving me strong mood stabilizers to try and reduce the manias but nothing seems to work the only way to get rid of the manias is to stop taking the antidepressants doctors have tried to give me just mood stabilizers to help control the depressions , i have taken anti psychotics along with mood stabilizers , and none of it helps with the depression i have tried various therapies to try and change the way my mind thinks while in these episodes , again , they were not very helpful therapists have told me that one of the reasons they do n't help is that my depression has a strong situational component i need to change my circumstances as you know circumstances ca n't always be changed so i cope as best as i can , go on with my daily life and keep thinking it 's just a phase , it will eventually taper off some days it 's the only thing that gets me out of bed and somewhat functional you just have fibromyalgia , do n't see why you ca n't do everything everybody else does while my fibromyalgia may be milder than some other peoples , it is combined with chronic fatigue syndrome , making my exhaustion just that much more debilitating this whole post exertional malaise thing is putting a serious crimp in my lifestyle my condition is severe enough to qualify for disability , and many choose to go that way i have worked hard to pull myself out of poverty and am in no hurry to head back into it people on disability are very poor , i have chosen to keep working as long as i possibly can , no matter how hard it is on me or how exhausted i am all the time i go to work every day feeling worst than what would often justify my co workers calling in sick i push through the brain fog when i get home after a full day of work i am completely drained as the week progresses , i borrow more and more energy from the next day so that by the time the weekend comes along i am completely at i need the whole weekend to recover somewhat to get ready for a new week while i have a lot of catch up needed on the housework front to do , it 's very often not possible to get around to it you just work in a call centre , it 's not like it 's a hard job talking on the phone all day true , i do n't have to stand on my feet all day , balance fragile objects , lift heavy things i am not responsible for controlling potentially dangerous things i also do n't face danger and perilous situations on a daily basis when comparing to jobs like that , one could definitely say my job is easy however , my job does not only entail talking on the phone all day and even if it were just that , it 's not always very pleasant conversations some of those conversations can be quite abusive , others challenging due to a variety of factors you 'd be surprised how many people actually ca n't cut it in the client service industry furthermore i also have non phone work to do that involves complex analysis at times , attention to detail , ability to write complex concepts in clear and easy language in both official canadian languages try doing complex analysis while constantly being interrupted by the phone and being hit by particularly heavy brain fog you just have osteoarthritis , i have it too , just take tylenol and carry on usually said by an older person i developed osteoarthritis at a very young age , i have had it for well over years it 's not in a few odd joints any longer , it 's generalized i do n't think i have any joint that is not affected by it any longer some joints are still are mild , but others have progressed quite a bit in the last some years tylenol just does n't cut it anymore also you do have to be careful with long term use of over the counter pain relievers long term heavy use of these products can cause some organ damage even prescription pain relievers can also cause some organ damage , so it 's best to try and not abuse them also i have pretty bad gerd gastroesophageal reflux disease and many of the better meds are very harsh on the digestive system so all in all , it 's best to cool it on the meds that help , but do n't completely take away the pain save it for the really bad days you only have two kids , and they are mostly grown up , people with more kids and or younger kids have it much harder what can i say , it 's true that i only have two kids and they are no longer toddlers requiring babysitting all the time however you kinda have to look at my particular context first i am a single mom by that i mean there is no dad in the picture whatsoever like at all never has been no financial support , no weekends , nothing i do n't have any sisters and for most of their life my family lived as close as hours away by car mom hours away , brother hours away , dad hours away so not much family support with regards to stuff like babysitting i did move close to my mom from to so i did get a break then , but it was a fair exchange , i helped her out quite a bit with the business she had then i only started working week day shifts in late up until then , my jobs consisted of low income shift work including nights , weekends and holidays that may no longer be the case , but we still carry the baggage of those years with us then you have to consider the particular challenges i have with my children first my daughter was a victim of severe trauma as a child while she is a survivor , she did wind up with mental health issues that she has to this day it 's something i always have to be on the lookout for and take into consideration with any major life decisions i also have to weight how most things will affect her but it ca n't show it 's important not to treat them as victims and to empower them every chance you get i slip at times then my son , my miracle baby , the one i was not supposed to ever be able to have is special needs he is currently a teen , with teenage angst , but combined with a pervasive developmental delay , severe anxiety , and intense behavioral and emotional issues at times violent so he is inches taller than me , at least pounds heavier , muscled with little to no self regulation he also has no empathy it 's best to not leave him alone for more than hours at a time with my daughter present i can leave him for up to hours but is really pushing it i ca n't send him to family or friends for a bit of time off because it requires quite a bit knowledge into his psychopathy and some training in order to be best able know what to do when his emotions become overwhelming respite care is very expensive , not covered by insurance and only for a few days , barely time to recover not that i can afford it anyway needless to say this family dynamic is very difficult on my daughter and not helping her in any way for more information , you can read this post , this post from when he was n't quite a teenager yet , and if you are interested in even more information , go ahead and read this post now something i do n't get a whole lot of comments about because very few people know about it is my cardiomyopathy , if they knew , they would probably say it 's just a mild heart condition since this particular condition of mine does not elicit comments as of yet , why am i including it in this post ? the reason i am is that when considering my life , one should not just take one element into consideration and decide what level of quality of life i may or not have solely based on one alone while it 's true that my cardiomyopathy is not really very serious at this time , i have to be careful to keep it that way so i have to keep my blood pressure normal , my doctor has prescribed some meds to try and keep it stable , but i also have to make some changes to my diet and lifestyle one of the things i need to avoid is stress as stress elevates blood pressure and damages the heart muscle i also have to make sure my heart rate stays as stable as possible avoiding stress is a lot easier said than done , taking all the above into consideration , so i am doing the next best thing and trying to learn ways of better coping with stress as it is pretty much unavoidable i think that all in all i am not just , and it would be pretty inaccurate to describe my life easy yah this one person told me i was lucky to have had an easy life compared to her , healthy her whole life , developed osteoarthritis at , had a husband who made good money , where she did not have to work and she and her kids were well provided for , he was n't abusive but did have expectations of a clean home , ready meal and polite kids , her kids were of above average intelligence , healthy , active and pretty well behaved believe it or not , while a lot of stuff was mentioned here , i really do not mean to complain there are so many ways it could be worst , and i am thankful for the positives i do have in my life after all i am employed in a job that pays well and has benefits i do live in a country without persecution and free health care i do not have an abusive partner and can still get around i can see the beauty not blind and can fully enjoy the best sounds available not deaf both my kids are mobile , can speak , hear and see neither drink or do drugs my allergies have subsided so i can have pets and there nothing quite like the unconditional love of a pet i also have been truly blessed with some amazing people in my life i 'd start naming names but with the friggin brain fog i might leave some out , i think you know who you are anyway thank you for taking the time to read as always , much appreciated
