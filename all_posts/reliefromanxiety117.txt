well i did n't exactly travel the whole world as the title suggests , but i did manage to find my way from germany back to london completely alone with anxiety right by my side actually , travelling anxiety has never been a major issue for me however , battling my health anxiety and travel has i once could n't get on any form of transport in the fear i would n't be able to leave fortunately , with the help of cbt and medication , that fear is almost completely gone travelling is also something i love to do and i have traveled alone on various occasions however , i have never gotten two trains in a different country on my own and gotten on a plane on my own , and this is something which i had to do to get out of the situation i was in whilst i was in germany i thought i would give you all some insight as to what it was like travelling on the two trains themselves was n't too much of an issue , it was more the worry of being on the right train and not knowing every aspect of the germany language however , pushing my anxiety out of my way , i managed to ask multiple times whether it was the right train and where my stop was even some was spoken in german ! when i left my final train , i then had the ultimate struggle to find my way through munich airport , which is split into two massive and separate sections in which i got utterly lost luckily i was a fair few hours early , and i managed to find someone who could point me in the right direction even after been given instructions , i still got a little bit lost until i finally found the security checks i would be lying if i said i was n't at all anxious being alone in a massive queue , but i was pretty calm for travelling and being alone knowing that i had to rely solely on myself to get home , was fairly scary however , going on a fair few planes in the past helped me to be acquainted with the situation too after going through security i was out into duty free woooooo ! and i just had to find my gate to my plane , which i luckily did i got onto the plane wondering how the hell i managed it if this experience has taught me anything , it 's that you are way more capable than you can ever imagine and if you need to do something , you will i never thought i could do it , but luckily i arrived safe and sound and i am proud ! you can do it ! amy xx
