he was also behind in his bills and he was receiving delinquency notices ed acknowledged that he made a good salary and he had the money to pay his bills , so he was n't sure why he allowed his debts to pile up ed felt that his life was out of control and completely unmanageable , but he did n't know what to do to change things during the first therapy session , ed was flooded with anxiety and needed constant redirection because his anxiety caused him to jump from one topic to the next as he discussed his family history , he revealed a highly dysfunctional family and he had many of the traits that are usually associated with people from dysfunctional families see my article dynamics of adult children of dysfunctional families , including approval seeking and loss of identity see my article people pleasing confusing love and pity see my article confusing love and pity confusing compassion and responsibility see my article confusing compassion and responsibility fear of angry people and personal criticism fear of authority figures difficulty completing things see my article having difficulty completing things each of his parents also came from highly dysfunctional families and they seemed to unknowingly repeat patterns from their families just as ed was also unconsciously repeating patterns from his family not only was ed deeply ashamed of himself and his family background , but he was ashamed to be coming to therapy he felt like he must be weak to need therapy see my article overcoming shame is shame keeping you from starting psychotherapy ? he was very surprised when i told him that people who seek help in therapy are often the healthiest people in their families see my article why it 's often the healthiest person in a dysfunctional family who comes to therapy ed felt so overwhelmed by his problems that he did n't know where to begin , so we began by breaking down his problems into manageable pieces so that he could begin to tackle the most pressing issues , including paying his bills deep down , ed knew that his relationship with his ex was very unhealthy for him he also admitted that he knew nothing would change and they would just end up breaking up again because they were basically unsuited for each other so , he agreed not to contact his girlfriend and , if he felt like contacting her or he felt lonely , he would call a friend instead for emotional support and he would discuss his feelings in his therapy sessions we also worked on helping ed to develop coping skills so that he would be able to calm himself when he felt overwhelmed see my article developing internal resources and coping skills once ed was able to begin tackling some of his concrete problems , like paying his bills on time , and he developed techniques for managing his stress , we began to work on the unconscious issues related to his family of origin that he was recreating in his life see my article psychotherapy making the unconscious conscious as we discussed how he was leading his life from one crisis to the next and the chaotic patterns in his family of origin , ed was able to see the similarities but , at first , he could n't see how he was creating these patterns this was a new concept for him until then , he experienced the chaos in his life as things that happened to him not that he was creating these situations as we went over each situation that had occurred in the recent past , ed began to develop clarity about his role but rather than feeling self compassion , he was self critical , judgmental and hard on himself see my article self blame and the internal critic being critical was another pattern from his family , and it caused ed a great deal of shame not only was this self blame not helpful in the present , it was also getting in the way of his understanding the origin of his problems from the past we had to work on helping him to distinguish taking responsibility and being compassionate towards himself and being critical and self blaming as we continued to explore his current relationship to his family , who continued to be dysfunctional , ed realized that one of the underlying issues to his repeating the pattern of creating chaos in his life was that it enabled him to commiserate with them and to continue feeling connected to them see my article overcoming trauma when the past affects the present this was an aspect of his problems that ed had never recognized before , and he worried that if he got his life together that he would be , in effect , moving away from his family on an emotional level he had a deep sense of family loyalty , and he felt conflicted about this see my article how a distorted sense of family loyalty can affect your therapy at the same time , ed recognized that he could n't keep living his life in the same way as he had been he had to change if he wanted to be happier in his life the next step in our work was to do trauma work in order for ed to work through the emotional trauma that he experienced in his dysfunctional family and for him to accept that he might not feel as connected to them in the same way if he was n't creating chaos in his life i often use different types of mind body oriented therapy to help clients with emotional trauma and choose the type of therapy that is best suited for each client in ed 's case , i used emdr to help him work through his childhood trauma see my articles what is emdr ?
