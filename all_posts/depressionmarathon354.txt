i have discovered that when one is away from home for days , there were a lot of things awaiting completion once i returned home i 've been a bit overwhelmed with the amount of items on my to do list just opening my mail required half of an afternoon ! and some of it is still sitting on my counter waiting to be filed or addressed it seems every task results in two or three additional tasks the more items i cross off my list , the more items i add ! yikes ! i'm not sure i 'll ever catch up it may sound like it , but i'm not complaining i may be overwhelmed , but i'm overwhelmed at home ! and that is an improvement so far i'm doing fairly well i 've been spending my days at home , running errands , completing paperwork , paying bills , and running ! my late evenings and overnights are still being spent minutes away at my friend wendy 's home it 's a lot of traveling back and forth for jet and i , but it is still the safest option , and i think being around others , especially at night , helps maintain my mood it is what it is , and so far it 's working i mentioned running i ran the last days in a row , and i have a long run , miles , on my schedule for tomorrow i'm officially in my first week of training for the boston marathon my runs of , , and miles have all been tough with extra pounds on my frame , so i'm not sure what to expect tomorrow i think i 'll run two mile loops just in case i'm not yet up to the task of ten it may not be easy or pretty , but i'm happy to be out on the road i 'll try to be patient that 's all for now , friends i 've got this to do list staring at me thank you all for the support i received from you over these last three months it 's hard to believe i felt that bad for that long , but i'm hopeful the worst is past that 's all i can do , right ? keep the faith tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow will hopefully be better days
