may i respectfully suggest that most of the current problems in psychotherapy today lie in the inability to differentiate between awareness and consciousness thus , the cognitivists and insight therapist believe that if the patient is aware she will make progress and i suggest that awareness has little to do with progress unless you are happy to get well from the neck up and leave the body behind so , let s define things awareness involves the last evolved neurologic system , the neocortex where ideas , beliefs and perceptions lie consciousness involves the three levels of consciousness , the three key brain systems working in harmony and fluidity consciousness involves all of us and particularly our history awareness is ahistoric and since we are historic beings we cannot hope to get well if we leave our past behind if we ignore our history and what happened to us from our life in the womb onward when we rely on awareness we are dealing with a thin sliver of brain function , disconnected from physiologic processes which areprimal the motor for how and what we think thinking and beliefs which is what we are asked to do in cognitive therapy , believe the therapy and therapist are ultimately malleable and change with the wind not so with lower brain processes which involved survival , and should not be so malleable when we rely on awareness we are avoiding our life blood , our feelings that is what makes us feeling human beings why is feeling so important ? when we speak of quality of life , we are dealing with feeling so we have one brain , the left , that is fragmented and the other that sees the whole to become whole we must manage to recruit the fragments of our lives into a complete picture for that we need both brains hemispheres working in harmony that is one definition of consciousness and its differentiation from awareness in therapy we see how this works when after a feeling , the patient will begin a litany of , that s why i did this and why i did that the fragmented behavior begins to make total sense it has a gestalt context consciousness out of unconsciousness the problem with left brain centered psychotherapy unfortunately , we tend to glorify left brain awareness to the neglect of the right feeling brain we expect the left brain to fight our battles , particularly , the internal enemies we do this without taking into account that left brain development came into being much later in evolutionary history than the right brain , and in each of our individual lives , in part as a means of disengaging us from the other side one kind of brain tissue cannot do the work of another the left brain developed different abilities to avoid a redundancy between left and right the left brain s activity helps soothe and calm us it allowed and continues to allow us to defend against feelings that were too much to bear we use the left hemisphere to rationalize a hurt or insult so it won t create so much pain or at the mercy of needs of which we may be only dimly aware , the left brain can superimpose all kinds of needs onto a romantic object and imagine her to be wonderful , only to be disappointed two years down the line because it didn t see reality it didn t listen to the right because communication was either reduced or non existent when perception is detached from need and feeling , we misperceive for instance , if we need a strong protector , we will overlook the other person s weaknesses and ignore his flaws we see protection where it may not exist , or we get protection accompanied by total domination it is difficult to know what is real about humans if we take words alone as a sign of reality the left frontal area is also where we conjure up or embrace beliefs insights given by a therapist are ultimately beliefs to soothe and ease pain so of course the therapy patient feels better after a session she has knocked down painful feelings that is one of the key roles of the top level neocortex suppress feelings indeed , the words of a therapist , no matter whether right or wrong , can be soothing to our agonies it is not only the content of what the therapist says , but just his words offered in soothing tones oddly enough , that tone affects the right brain , not the left the content of the insight remains in the left we can be fooled into thinking that the content of an insight is what makes us feel better , but in reality it is the reassuring tone , all along it dampens right side pain , the pain of a father who never cared , was never soft , and whose tone was unrelentingly harsh the therapist s presence says , i m here now it s going to be all right just being in his office can make us feel better in other words , the left side allows us to be partially oblivious to ourselves this is particularly egregious when it comes to psychotherapy , which traditionally has been left brain focused for over years it is now apparent , due to an abundance of new research , that psychotherapy must address the right brain and consider how to affect right left brain connections as this is the way feelings become integrated psychotherapy must work to help not only ourmental state but our entire neuro physiologic system this is the difference between dealing with words left brain and the use of images , scenes , and feelings right brain the former is what occurs when we reflect on our past , while genuine emotional retrieval , which is what is needed for integration and genuine healing , requires access to the right brain feeling structures once again we see that it is not possible to use ideas and thinking processes , which literally came along millions of years later in brain development to affect what is lower in the brain , and developed millions earlier the right frontal area is as involved as the left , although the contributions to the ideas are different the right will tend to like grander ideas
