taking the wrong track into abreaction to understand more about how abreaction works , let s see what happens when a session goes off track as we now know , there is a critical window during a session when the patient brings in a certain feeling , say , helplessness if the therapist does not act to help the person delve into the feeling it very well may be too late , later on in the session when the therapist does not strike at the critical moment , the specific feeling frequency the patient came in with is now gone what the patient will be left with is abreaction , the discharge of a secondary feeling , not the key one she brought in that means no resolution and integration of feeling because the feeling has not been felt when we measure vital functions after the session , the signs move in sporadic fashion they do not move in coordinated ways but as though each function moves at a different pace they seem to have lost their cohesion , which tells us that no primal has occurred what i think may happen , and this is only hypothesis , is that when the feeling and its frequency are left unaddressed the patient slips into a secondary feeling with a different brain pattern and frequency even though she may look like she connected and resolved the feeling there is a good chance that it is abreaction it is simply the discharge of the energy of the feeling without connection let me make this clear because so many so called primal therapists make this fundamental error there is a time in the session when that feeling is very near conscious awareness without professional help the feeling slides away and the patient , now floundering , manages to get into a different feeling , one that may belong to the therapist s agenda , not the patient s that is because the therapist did not pick up on the entering feeling and then projects his own needs and feelings onto the patient the patient then goes where the therapist decides , which has nothing to do with attacking the basic need and resolving it too often , the patient goes where the therapist tacitly is interested the patient senses that and becomes a good girl the unconscious of the therapist implicitly directs the patient the pain of lack of fulfillment is always an adjunct to a specific need to address the wrong need is to forego proper connection and resolution it is feeling the wrong pain at the wrong time a depressed patient comes in feeling hopeless and helpless the therapist may perceive latent anger and urges the patient to hit the wall the release does offer some relief and they both may think there was resolution but it was only temporary the real feeling will return again and again only to be waylaid or the therapist may say , tell your mother ! but it may have nothing to do with mother , at least not the patient s what is coming up is the pain of the doctor he needs to scream at his mother indeed , the patient s core feeling may date back to a time before words so expressing the feeling verbally is a false route it is tricky business a sound knowledge of the evolution of consciousness will help here doctors are used to being active during therapy sessions so it is difficult for them to see how little there is to do i speak on average about words a session my patient feels and then the insights follow i do not need the majesty of bestowing insights on patients it is wonderful that they make their own discoveries and what discoveries they are , up surging feelings accompanied with their notes from the underground telling the doctor what the feelings mean on the other hand , therapists have a lot to do when we sense abreaction entering in at that point , the therapist must be vigilant and hyperactive to keep the patient on track he must make sure not to reinforce the tributary feeling while steering the patient back to the main feeling and how , you ask , does the therapist know the difference ? by instinct and experience the therapist has to sense that his patient has taken a detour and he has to know what the real feeling is that skill you can only acquire by primal intuition there is no law
