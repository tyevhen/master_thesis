that 's a great title for a post , is n't it ? unfortunately , this is n't going to be about anything all that juicy i'm giving a talk on access to care next week to or so psychiatry residents in training i thought i would ask our readers what should young psychiatrists know about finding a psychiatrist ? are there things that make it harder or easier to find someone ? what should they know about health insurance participation ? write something i had n't thought of and i 'll read it at my presentation ! thank you for your help
