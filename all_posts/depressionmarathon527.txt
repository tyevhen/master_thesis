it 's the end of another week in my life i feel like i 've missed most of it this pnemonia has kept me down i 've spent most of my free time , and i 've had a lot of that , lying low or sleeping i have n't run in over a week i have n't done anything except walk puck i tried a bit longer walk yesterday , about miles , and it totally wiped me out ! that was disappointing i had hoped to get my running shoes on tomorrow , but now i'm not so sure that being said , i am feeling a little better i still have a very nasty cough , but no fever or joint aches except after my long walk today was my last day on antibiotics , and they did make a difference i guess i might need to be a bit more patient about getting back on the road i'm not too good at patient this week has been a little more challenging for my mood as i said before , i'm not used to being physically down for so long i discussed feeling a little low with my doctor yesterday we decided i 'll likely feel mentally better once my physical self heals again , patience without exercise , i 've had extra time in my life to focus on work things are improving there i'm getting into the swing of things i know what forms are in which drawers now i figured out how to put a patient on my schedule and today i mastered faxing orders to a doctor whoo , hoo ! i'm still struggling to control my fear every time i get a referral for a new outpatient , but i figure that 's got to improve eventually patience is king i'm laughing here i am writing about patience while internally i'm screaming , hurry up ! oh well , i never claimed i was perfect i 'll keep working at it
