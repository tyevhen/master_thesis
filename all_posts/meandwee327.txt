dear little p , a few days ago you turned months old another month flown by for stats you 're still really tall about inches tall and getting heavier every day my back can attest to it you 've moved into wearing a lot of size t stuff depending on the maker and that just blows my mind it seems like i get you new clothes in month sizes and all of a sudden you 've outgrown most of them i ca n't seem to keep up and , being tall means that you can pretty much reach everything we do n't want you to reach so , you 're quickly learning what not to touch thanks to my stern voice and annoying eh ! eh ! eh ! noises along with no touch ! you make the best face when i say that you look at me all surprised and wide eyed and then look at the item then back at me and you back away from it i 'll enjoy it for now i know soon you may not be as compliant ! i try to praise you a lot when you listen i figure it ca n't hurt ! in the meantime we 've baby proofed what we can that helps limit all the no 's i'm down to saying it maybe once or twice per day at most so , you 've been working hard on your walking skills as you cruise around the living room holding onto different things as you move you typically do n't like to walk while holding our hands you seem to want to try it for yourself you 'll privately crawl to the other side of the room and stand up in the middle of the rug then , you 'll try to take a little step and then land on your bum it 's like you want privacy and do n't want prying eyes judging you or something i can tell you , your dad and i are so proud of you ! we see you trying hard on your own giving it your best in your own time you 're even starting to allow us to help you every once in a while which is fun i love to see the proud look on your face when you 've taken steps holding our hands you can do anything you know you 've been transitioning from naps to a painful process for us all and we 've been working with you on a decent bedtime and naptime routine we 'll get it right soon or fall asleep trying i 'll have to do a whole other post on this topic but it 's moving along in the right direction as far as food goes , we 've still been introducing you to new and exciting things you still prefer mushy pureed stuff , but you 're slowly venturing out into new tastes i figure , as long as you are eating some sort of thing we 're winners we 've been working on weaning you from formula to milk and it 's taking longer than i 'd thought you are n't the biggest fan yet but , i 've learned this stuff is n't really up to me so i'm just riding it out so , that 's what 's been going on with you this past month ! we 've been slowing the pace around here keeping things quiet and simple i can see this works well for you and helps you focus much better than before it 's fascinating and rewarding to watch you learn and discover so slowing down and simplifying has been good for both of us ! i 've really been enjoying being with you and i hope you enjoy being with me too we have a lot ahead of us and i want you to know that you make me feel so delighted and so happy you are incredibly precious to me and i 'll never know of anything better than hanging with you ! i love you always and forever my little shining star , mama p s there 's nothing cuter than a baby in jammies my heart melts every morning save
