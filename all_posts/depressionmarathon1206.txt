living with depression requires an enormous amount of patience , resilience , and coping one of the my favorite coping skills is humor when i lose my sense of humor or my sarcasm i know i am in a very deep hole it 's not pretty one of my favorite sources for humor , especially on weekends , is national public radio living in minnesota , i am quite fortunate to have a thriving public radio network , and i spend most of my weekend alone time listening to my local mpr station today i heard one of the funniest segments i have ever heard on one of my favorite npr programs , car talk if you are in need of a really good laugh , spend the next minutes listening to this ! you wo n't regret it for a second ! enjoy !
