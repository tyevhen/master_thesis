yes , the black cloud of clinical depression has finally descended on me after a year and a half of bad luck i know from experience that once my brain chemistry is adequately adjusted , my wife 's dear face will look familiar to me again , but one symptom of depression is derealization the sense that everything is foreign , even the chairs at the restaurant this morning where i did n't eat , as if every object in the world were new , entirely inexplicable and vaguely sinister the last time i was hospitalized for depression , january , i remember how daunting it was to tie my shoes it took much study , but after a while i managed it however , the whole process of tying my shoes seemed as if i 'd never done it before this is one reason i tell folks that ect is a whole lot better than depression my memory has been more damaged by depression that my one course of ect , which restored it back in anyway , in writing about this i escape the feeling for a while in the formation of words we are forced to ignore inner weather for a moment , perhaps because of the very demands of logic placed on the left hemisphere where depression is mainly centered recent studies also show the use of antidepressants may keep the brain more agile over time , contrary to earlier fears i 'll share with those likewise afflicted my rules for depression first , and above all , be evaluated biologically and enter treatment with the proper medications wait for the worm to turn , it always does eventually and if medications do n't help a serious depression within two to three months , especially for manic depressives , i think ect a very good choice now , behaviorally , here are dr chaffin 's rules it is better to do something than nothing it is better to do something active than something passive it is better to be with or around people than alone try to set a modest goal each day mine is i'm going to try not to hate myself too much today i try to follow my own advice here i am writing , right ? as for the lawyer thingie planned yesterday , the public prosecutor is absent and wo n't be back until thursday so we could n't go kathleen ate some excellent eggs benedict this morning i had one bite and made a lame joke about the current pope as close as i came to humor i can still read that 's a good sign when worse i ca n't concentrate enough to remember what i'm reading here 's a poem about depression eternal recurrence psychologists call mania a defense against depression but i find that silly there is no defense against depression and no adequate metaphor for its recurrence , but i 'll try you love someone with all your heart they are brutally murdered after an interminable grief they magically reappear and you fall down on your knees and thank god with tears the second time is worse after the third funeral you dread their resurrection as much as their death and love becomes a poisonous thing you would drive a stake through their heart if only you could here 's a link to where it was published along with others , in tryst magazine http www tryst com issue chaffin html all for now thanks for listening thine , ce
