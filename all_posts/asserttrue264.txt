if you 've ever been bitten by tiny red bugs in the garden , you 're familiar with members of the trombiculidae , a family of mites known variously as berry bugs , harvest mites , red bugs , scrub itch mites , aoutas , or in the southern u s chiggers in the united states , the garden variety chigger is basically harmless , but in much of the world this tiny arthropod comes with a very nasty endosymbiont known as orientia tsutsugamushi , which is a bacterium related to the rickettsia organisms that cause various tick borne diseases throughout much of the orient , o tsutsugamushi infections from chigger bites cause scrub typhus , which begins with a rash and fever but can progress to a cough , intestinal distress , swelling of the spleen , abnormal liver chemistry , and ultimately pneumonitis , encephalitis , and or myocarditis and even death treatment with doxycycline , azithromycin , or chloramphenicol is usually successful the harvest mite chigger can carry scrub typhus , although u s varieties are typically harmless the sequenced genome for o tsutsugamushi is available , and if you go to this link and click on click for features at the bottom of the dataset information box you should be able to open up a table that shows the organism as having , protein coding genes quite a small number , plus an additional , pseudogenes quite a huge number , by comparison the dna seqs links in the table will let you download the dna sequences of all the organism 's genes and pseudogenes this is an extremely unusual situation , in that we 're dealing with a bacterium that has more pseudogenes switched off , defunct , damaged genes than regular genes , something that can be said of no other bacterium of which i'm aware the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae is famed for having approximately pseudogenes and normal genes astonishingly , orientia tsutsugamushi reverses that ratio , and then some we do n't know for sure how old orientia tsutsugamushi 's pseudogenes are a standard rule of thumb in biology is that microbial genomes experience one spontaneous mutation per chromosome per generations but this does n't really help us decide how old orientia 's pseudogenes are , since the pseudogenes probably did n't arise one by one , indepedently , through accumulation of random mutations more than likely , a massive pseudogenization event caused the simultaneous deactivation of a large , unknown number of the organism 's genes of which survive today as pseudogenes , much the same as has been hypothesized for m leprae we have good reason to believe m leprae 's pseudogenes are at least million years old it seems likely that the pseudogenes in orientia are also quite old , or at least not terribly new to get more perspective on this , i analyzed orientia 's pseudogenes from a couple of perspectives what i found , first of all , is that the pseudogenes are shorter than their non pseudo counterparts , averaging bases in length versus for normal genes this is similar to the case with m leprae where pseudogenes are bases long and normal genes average , the average shorter gene length for orientia vis a vis m leprae is consistent with the fact that this is a greatly gene reduced low gc endosymbiont , whereas the mycobacterium family is in theory free living , with higher gc content for m leprae or more for tuberculosis species i 've written before about the fact that in most genes , in most organisms , codons tend to begin with a purine base therefore i decided to look at purine usage in base one of normal gene codons versus pseudogene codons pseudocodons ? , finding the following distribution in normal genes purine usage in base one of codons in orientia tsutsugamushi n , codons no pseudogenes were included in this graph see the next graph below for pseudogenes this graph leaves little doubt that most codons begin with a purine a or g the median ag value is very few proteins lie to the left of x , and frankly some of those are probably misannotated as to reading frame the situation with pseudogenes is quite a bit different purines in codon base one ag of pseudogenes n , codons in orientia here we see that purine usage in codon base one is not as strong median , although clearly , plenty of codons still show ag above , implying that many pseudogenes are still in frame not frameshifted interestingly , ag is not only higher in normal gene codons than in pseudogene codons , it 's also higher in codons associated with proteins of known function than for hypothetical protein genes only of pseudogene codons have ag greater than , whereas of hypothetical protein genes have ag and of genes with functional assignments have codon ag greater than this implies that some genes annotated as hypothetical proteins may , in reality , be pseudogenes that are incorrectly annotated i 'll return to that topic some other time
