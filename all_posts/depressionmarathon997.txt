hello from colorado ! so sorry for the abrupt departure from this space i 've been fretting about not being able to write , but here i am finally i am in a colorado cabin with my good friends bill and cindy they were generous enough to invite me to their northern colorado cliff side cabin for one week again this year we spent a week here last year as well the cabin is on a cliff overlooking a wide meadow with mountains in the distance it has no electricity nor running water it 's perfect i 'll post pictures soon we arrived after a hectic run through the airport on saturday our plane was cancelled , but after some fancy footwork we dashed onto an even earlier plane in fact , i got a seat in first class ! that was cool it was sunny when we arrived , and it 's been nothing but sunny and dry ever since from our cabin , we can sip coffee and watch the sunrise bring the mountains to life it 's peaceful and restful the peace and rest have not , however , kept us from adventure we 've played , slept , and played some more today we hiked miles in the mountains up to , feet tomorrow we may hike a , foot mountain needless to say , i have n't felt the need to run yet my quads are tired , but my brain is clear my right shoulder is also a bit sore i shot a gauge shot gun for the first time yesterday , hence the sore shoulder five of us finished off shells shooting clay pigeons otherwise known as trap or skeet shooting it was a blast no pun intended i started off slow it was tough for me to track a spinning orange disc hurtling through the air once i got the hang of it , however , i did pretty well i finished with a for round it was very satisfying obliterating that clay disc , reducing it to powder in mid air , especially when i pretended it was my depression ! very satisfying the depression has , in fact , continued to stay at bay i'm very grateful i am alive and well here i'm hoping to write with typical frequency again , but if i miss a few days well , i'm probably having too much adventure or too much rest time for dinner
