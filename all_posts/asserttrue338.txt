i'm firmly convinced that a solid understanding of the craft of screenwriting can only improve your fiction writing skills many of the skills of good screenwriting , if transferred to novel or short story writing , make for a much higher impact story i'm talking not only about story structure and dialog related tricks , but verticality and visuality making a story more vivid by making it more visual visuality is something good screnwriters spend a lot of time trying to achieve mediocre scripts , and even some good scripts of the i like it but do n't love it variety , are often mediocre simply because they lack visual impact , relying too much on explicative dialog to move the story along when you read one of these scripts , you get the feeling you 're reading a stage play but even stage plays good ones , that is rely heavily on visuals , rather than just dialog kenny hodges in many years ago when i was working for the mother earth news , i came to be good friends with somebody at work named kenny hodges kenny was a great raconteur i ca n't begin to replicate his skill here , and one of the many amazing stories he told was the story of the time he auditioned for , and landed , a part in a broadway play the way he tells it , kenny and some friends decided , on a lark , to get in line for an open reading for a play kenny had never done any acting he had been a musician the bassist in the s group spanky and our gang many people were reading for the part the role was that of a small town hoodlum of some kind the reading involved dialog between the hoodlum and the county sheriff the dialog was fairly humdrum , the hoodlum saying to the sheriff something like oh yeah ? well , you may think you 're the big shot here , but you ai n't got nothing , hear me ? i'm the one in charge of this town not you people read for the part , one by one , and got told thank you by the director meaning you 're dismissed , have a nice day now i could n't wait for kenny to reveal the secret of how he got the part , so i interrupted him while he was telling the story and just asked him he explained that when he got on stage to read the lines , he improvised at the critical moment , he held out a fist , thumb pointing straight up , and said completely off book see that ? the actor playing the sheriff stepped a little closer , looked at kenny 's thumb , and said something like what ? what 's that ? whereupon kenny flexed his thumb and pointed to the crotch of the thumb , under the first joint , and said that 's where you are right there right there , my friend in essence saying i 've got you under my thumb , asshole it got him the part the director had the thumb gesture written into the script unfortunately , due to a musical engagement , kenny who never seriously thought he would get the part in the play had to decline the role , and never got to act on broadway this is an example of the power of visuality and the kind of thing you should be having characters do , if you 're writing a script or a novel i'm going to continue on this theme in tomorrow 's post , because there 's a lot more to say about visuality and how to use it to enrich fiction
