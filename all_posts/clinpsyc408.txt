a prior post regarding the paxil seroxat for adolescent depression debacle focused on an academic who seemed to have acted as a huckster for glaxosmithkline he could have been na ve or he could have been on the take or some combination thereof in any case , his behavior does not reflect well on the academic research community however , i want to take this opportunity to publicly give praise where it is due dr david healy was also interviewed on panorama and i will provide two quotes according to my transcription of the episode , the nature of which few in academia have the guts to say publicly if you heard the experts talk , they all said the drug was extremely safe and very effctive we were all hoodwinked , misled , duped they use these clinical trials which appear to be evidence and they aren t they re adverts later in the broadcast people who are ill generally have been deeply betrayed by the whole process , deeply betrayed by the pharmaceutical companies and by all the experts that have been willing to actually lend their names to the process i give healy oodles of credit for making the above statements making much softer statements than those above ended up costing him a lucrative academic job in the past it is a sad state of affairs when people such as myself feel the need to write anonymously when questioning the interface between marketing , academia , and science this makes the public statements by healy all the more commendable
