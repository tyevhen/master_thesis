i think my spiritual condition is a bit deconditioned in my program of recovery , we strive for a spiritual awakening , which according to the big book of alcoholics anonymous means a personality change sufficient to bring about recovery from alcoholism it is also described as a profound alteration in our reaction to life , and as an awareness of a power greater than ourselves i guess two out of three is n't bad , but on a daily basis it is the profound alteration in reaction to life which keeps me sober and sane and that 's exactly what seems to be lacking lately maintaining a fit spiritual condition is crucial to my recovery and my contentment it is the only comfortable way for me to be in this world today when i am spiritually fit , i am centered , humble , grateful , generous , and even serene spiritual fitness means i am savoring one thought at one time my mind does not race i am not blaming or irresponsible i see my part in all my interactions and strive to treat others as i wish to be treated kindly , gently , and respectfully in the past few days , i 've had a couple of experiences which , while they may not seem big or important , indicate i am less than spiritually fit first i raised my middle finger in anger at a motorist who nearly ran me off the road on which i was running that was yesterday today i did something i knew was not likely allowed , but i did it anyway , and then got angry when i was told what i was doing was , in fact , not allowed in each case i stewed about the incident long after it had passed luckily i did n't , but i could have easily stewed myself into a roiling boil voluntarily introducing discord into my life is my definition of spiritual un fitness now i could write several paragraphs explaining the details of each incident , but that would only highlight my spiritual deconditioning explanations would require me to rationalize my actions , blame others for theirs , and reinforce anything but kind and gentle behavior instead i need to look at my role in each situation , analyze my actions and reactions , and figure out how to get back on the right path that will likely require a call to my sponsor and the reciting of a few prayers so that 's what i'm about to do call my sponsor the fact that i recognized my behavior after only two agitating incidents is a hopeful sign perhaps i have n't fallen too hard hopefully i can soon get back on the beam of spiritual fitness life will certainly be simpler when i regain my balance
