earlier in this week , i wondered how charles nemeroff , key opinion leader in psychiatry at emory university could make the following statement with a straight face the concerns about antidepressant use in children and adolescents has paradoxically resulted in a reduction in their use , and this has contributed to increased suicide rates note that the data do not actually show a decrease in ssri prescription for teens during the timeframe when suicides increased , and that even if it did , such a relationship could have just been a coincidence but now , i believe that nemeroff 's statement does not even make for the least supported i e , most fictional statement of the week in psychiatry the award instead goes to extended drum roll , please jean frazier of harvard university the new york times quoted her as follows dr jean frazier , director of child psychopharmacology at cambridge health alliance and an associate professor at harvard , said that up to three quarters of children who exhibit bipolar symptoms become suicidal , and that it is important to treat the problem as early as possible we re talking about a serious illness with high morbidity , and mortality , dr frazier said , and for some of these children the medications can be life giving nice ! to my knowledge , there is little to no data to show that bipolar disorder is a valid diagnosis in young children , nor that early treatment is helpful , nor that treatment reduces risk of suicide for bipolar children , nor that percent of bipolar children become suicidal this is absolute nonsense , the type of statement that leads to unnecessary medication and leads people to falsely believe that bipolar disorder is a terrible epidemic among youth it gets even more detached from reality when we consider the case of rebecca riley , a four year old who was prescribed a very high dose of clonidine , as well as being prescribed seroquel and depakote , and who died , reportedly due to the effects of her meds clonidine seems to be the leading suspect hat tip furious seasons , who has been absolutely on fire as of late
