i'm finally sitting down after a quick walk with puck and a long day at work i do n't have much to say or anything very interesting to report , i'm afraid i 've been busy working my new schedule and getting used to my new buildings and patients i find i'm a little more tired during the week now , but napping , which i do almost daily , seems to take care of that so far my running has n't suffered from the increased hours , which i was worried about happening of course , i am tapering right now i'm getting prepared for the dallas marathon , which is now less than two weeks away i'm excited about that ! and i'm still feeling good i'm sure looking forward to the marathon is helping keep me on track it 's good for me to have goals and that 's all i have to say for now i'm tired , and i'm hoping to go to bed early , so it 's time for me to go good night !
