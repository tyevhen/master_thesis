so , i do n't usually like writing two posts in one day , and i try not too but while this is still fresh in my mind , i figured i 'd post about it now , knowing my opinions and all , it probably does n't surprise you to know that i'm not a huge fan of the police force and cops have never seemed very big fans of youth a friend of mine was told not to wear his earphones while walking along the side of the road by a cop suspicious looks from every man in uniform are directed at anyone who wears a hoodie and is under and there just generally seems to be a feeling of tension whenever cops and kids are in the same vicinity but back to the incident that led me to write this post my sister , three friends , and i were walking to one of our friends houses , when a pretty average car pulled over and said something or other along the lines of 'hey' now , i should make it clear that it 's not all that uncommon for a car scooter full of drunk and or high people to pull over and ask either idiotic questions , or directions to the nearest party , so we usually just ignore them it 's also not uncommon for cars full of extremely high people to whiz past at ridiculous speeds , swerve towards people to scare them yes , that has seriously happened , and more than once , or honk their horn when right behind people to also scare them so , we do n't like random cars , and ignore them if we can but for this particular case , we were a bit past the car when the driver yelled police ! and switched on the lights so we 'd know it was a cop car so we stopped where are you going ? inquired the driver i was thinking none of your business , but luckily did n't say that instead , my friend cheerfully informed the cop that we were going to his house are you going to a party ? he further inquired umm , no was the rather bemused response i can never get over the stupidity of police if we were going to a party , would we really tell them ? after assuring themselves that we were not going to a party , they drove away but i remained pissed i was n't even sure they were really police at first , as i was furthest from the car and ignoring them at first , thinking they were drunk idiots and all but the guys assured me they were actually wearing uniforms , so really were what they said they were wow people go on about how free we are , yet men with guns can pull over and ask us where we 're going , and we answer for fear of being arrested on some made up charge , as others who are completely innocent have been that really bothers me and proves quite clearly to me that we are far from free sighs and i suppose you could say that they 're trying to stop those speeding idiots i mentioned above , but i doubt stopping pedestrians is going to help that there have never been police around for any of the actually bad stuff that goes on , yet they 're right there to intimidate the innocents when we are n't doing anything even remotely wrong grumbles but i 'll end this , once again , political post before i can rant any more peace , idzie you might also like political dump aka interesting stuff to my green anarchist self trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference my response to some unschooling questions and concerns linkwithin
