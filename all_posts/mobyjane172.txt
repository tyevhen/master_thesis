hi ab , i just wanted you to know that i finished reading your book children of the gods and loved it i was enchanted by the rich poetic rhythms , its wisdom and knowledge i went to amazon com to write a review and for the first time in my life i was unable to do so i lost the review times ! it just vanished from the screen and i had no way to bring it back it was discouraging as it had been quite lyrical and heartfelt , but there was no way for me to remember all i had written i felt bad for awhile , but i thought that after having it vanish times ! i should just accept it was n't meant to be i then checked in with my intentions i saw they were honest and honorable i gave it stars but then as i sent my mind out in your direction i got a feeling there was a blockage there , some vibe from you that was unconsciously preventing me from writing a good review for you as we are all in charge of our own destinies , i realized that there was no way i could have lost my supportive words without your cooperation no blame here i myself was feeling some anger toward a world that ignores needed truths and the people who write about them and , of course , aside from you and me , there is always the possibility of a higher force that came into play in the sudden , unexplained disappearance of my complimentary review ! i may try later on to recreate the review , but you can imagine , being a writer yourself , as i am , how disheartening it is to lose what you have written , especially when it was really good ! i am no stranger to self sabotage , and perhaps i am only recognizing my own experience in you , but in any event i wanted you to know what had happened and to tell you that your poetry is quite wonderful and your book should be read aloud across the land best to you , z dear z , thanks so much for your letter maybe it was n't a higher force , maybe it was a lower force as the old saying goes , if you tell the truth , you 'll be kicked out of six villages the wise man is not necessarily being kicked out because of a higher force at work there is always a tussle between light and darkness , between love and fear , in the human world i know what you mean , though , about finally deciding it was n't to be sometimes i , too , doubt whether or not i should continue to go forward if my efforts are met with failure so many times in a row what is the correct answer , i ask myself ? am i supposed to quit or persevere ? the problem with this line of thinking is that there is never a clear or right answer in the way of coming to a conclusion because one cannot know truth as an object one can only be the truth or as joel goldsmith so aptly put it , you cannot arrive at truth through the reasoning process the only clarity , for me , lies in each moment am i now proceeding out of love of something , or out of fear of something ? this is not easy either , because it is not easy to figure that out however , making the effort to figure it out , it seems to me , is being on the right path a b curtiss
