this is the third and final installment of unexceptionally exceptional , which is the text from the talk i presented at the northeast unschooling conference at the end of august you might want to read part one and part two first the meaning of success , and time for struggle , time for joy downtime of all sorts can be valuable , and one of the way that manifests is in boredom i decided that me and my sister should sing a duet for the talent show because i was bored i ve been bored a lot in the past year , mainly because when things aren t going great , i m less likely to have a good routine going with regular activities , and more likely to feel restlessness so , in some ways the boredom i ve felt has been a sign of things not going as well as they could be but in other ways , boredom has always been a force of creativity in my life as i wrote in a post on the home school life magazine blog back in february boredom acts as a gateway , as the beginning of something new or different , or the introduction or reintroduction to a new hobby or passion , something that will go on to be an important part of our days or not as important as the productivity that boredom can lead to , equally important is simply the space of boredom itself the time for us to get past the initial restlessness or discomfort of not being busy , not doing , and settle into reflection , observation , stillness we need the time to process and digest our learning , our experiences , and sometimes boredom can be a part of that to struggle , to be bored , is part of the process of learning , and of healing i ve never sung a duet in public before i sung in a church choir and a homeschool choir when i was young , but my voice , when others are listening to me perform , has always been part of a crowd a hopefully harmonious small part of the whole i ve sung in small groups , casually , where everyone is messing up and messing around , playing instruments they re less familiar with and maybe trying out a new harmony it hasn t felt like much pressure but what i was suggesting to my sister when i turned to her and said we should do a duet at neuc was scary everyone would be listening to my voice they d hear if i messed up but , i was bored that evening , and i wanted to sing with my sister , and once the thought crossed my mind and the words left my mouth , i became determined to follow through with it we sung safe and sound by taylor swift and the civil wars sometimes , too , boredom is the impetus to actually work through emotional shit keeping busy , always talking and working and doing , can be a way to hide from difficult emotions , to avoid facing difficult experiences boredom , an absence of busy ness , has forced me to process what s been happening in my life , to reflect , accept , and work towards moving forward and as i move forward , i find myself asking again and again , what is success ? it s layered and multi faceted , and my definition is constantly changing i m working on being at peace with my life , with where i am right now i m learning to move forward i may still be grieving the loss of two cats who meant the world to me , yet i have two different cats who have now come to mean an incredible amount to me as well i m still not living the dream life , there are still so many things i might want to change yet the garden still grows , and my family still loves me my darling bea , of the no tail and too many toes success isn t something you can attain in one grand swoop i m reminded of an allie brosh comic , where the author in scratchy comic form is shown gesturing sweepingly towards a purple ribbon wrapped trophy on the mantlepiece that right there is my ability to be responsible she says i won it when i was people my age , whether unschooled or not , have so many flawed and conflicting beliefs about what it means to be a successful adult , and how that can achieved i guess we re all floundering , at least some of the time , and just trying to figure out what we re doing unschooling , too , is a practice of learning and un learning and re learning , trying to find a path to respectful relationships , a peaceful home , and joyful learning ah , the joy because the thing is , no matter how hard some times in our lives might be , no matter that our lives might not always look how we think they re supposed to , there s so much joy pursuing an unschooling life is pursuing joy it s cultivating the excitement of discovery the satisfaction of doing hard things on your own initiative the companionship of strong relationships and time spent with people you not only love , but like me and my mommy i spend as much time as i do talking and writing about unschooling because , despite none of this being new to me , it still fills me with so much excitement my mind spirals into thoughts of what i ve learned , with great pleasure , to do bake pies and ferment kombucha and grow zucchinis i think of all there is that i m going to get to learn in the future i think about how learning feels the playful , relaxed , yet deeply focused intent of doing something i truly love , something that hits the perfect sweet spot of challenging yet attainable it feels like freedom and it s one of the best feelings there is how can i not consider that joy , in and of itself , a form of success ? i delight in learning , and in sharing , and in making the tenets of unschooling a continuing part of my adult life this past year may have tested me in a hundred different ways , but i m proud that i managed , through everything , to find those joyful moments it takes a shift in focus to start seeing the success in your own life it s hard do i ever know how hard it is ! i struggle every day to truly value my unique education , to recognize how much i ve done and am doing in my life to really feel my success but whenever i force myself to stop and really look , i can see it i see the learning , and the growth , and the joy , and i know that i ll be okay i ve got this i m busy building the life i want one messy , difficult , enthusiastic piece at a time
