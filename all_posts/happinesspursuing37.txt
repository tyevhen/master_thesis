just checking in to report that there 's nothing to report my year is n't quite as bright and shiny as it was but i still have n't had any really dark days still off the sjw , too it 's odd , that i just realized one day that i had forgotten to take it for a few days and i did n't miss it one whit i still have a massive pill bottle of it in my desk drawer a few things have cropped up but they hardly rate as depressive episodes , just emotional bumps the first was yesterday i had to get nasty with a magazine that owes me money for some work that i did last summer i hated doing it and even though i was in the right i still felt small and mean for the rest of the day that 's an odd thing i know i'm not alone in it the more i am in the right and the greater the insult to me , the worse i feel when i overtly react to it another is a dear friend lost her mother as you might imagine i have few friends this has less to do with my sometimes apparently abrasive personality and more to do with the fact that i simply let few people in well , she is one she 's quite a bit older than me and it was n't unnatural for her mother to go but i do n't really know what to do i called her when i heard and we talked for around minutes she discovered her mother collapsed in her mother 's house so she had to live every minute of that horrible day now she 's descended into her family as they deal with everything that has to be dealt with i want to do something for her but i feel like i 'll only be intruding i may give her another call on friday finally , an old friend who 's been gently trying to reconnect with me for months finally forced the issue i cut him off years ago i was having a very bad year with my family and well , it 's all stupid and the details are pretty boring if you did n't live them suffice to say that i was petty with him and was just being stupidly stubborn so , he lives a continent away now and pinned me down via facebook he sent a long , nice email just catching up no mention of my pettiness he ended the message by saying that i was someone for whom he felt great affection those were his words , great affection i do n't think anyone has ever said that to me it was startlingly disarming especially when said between two heterosexual men it made me regret the years but , like i said , nothing of the deep , black depression that has engulfed me in the past just life so that 's my update for now cheers all ! photo by elisafox
