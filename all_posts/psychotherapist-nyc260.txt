in my prior article , i introduced the topic of the dynamics of adult children of alcoholic or dysfunctional families and discussed that , even when there 's no substance abuse involved , adult children from dysfunctional families often have similar problems to adult children of alcoholics families adult children of dysfunctional families confusing pity and love one the common characteristics for people from dysfunctional families is that they often confuse pity for love and get into codependent relationships where they feel the need to rescue the other person since people who grow up in dysfunctional families often have a fear of being abandoned , they unconsciously choose people who are in turmoil because they feel that these people will depend on them and not leave them the fact that this is unconscious is important to recognize it 's only after these people become aware of their unconscious codependent dynamics that they can begin to understand how and why they 're perpetuating these dynamics in each relationship once they 've developed an awareness , there is a possibility to change as with any change , it 's not always easy , especially if codependent dynamics have been longstanding change usually involves processing the childhood emotional trauma so that these dynamics do n't keep getting repeated in each relationship the following vignette , which is a composite of many different cases to protect confidentiality , illustrates how an adult child of a dysfunctional family repeatedly recreates codependent dynamics , including confusing pity for love , and how this problem can be overcome in therapy ella ella began therapy because she felt confused and upset that none of her romantic relationships worked out at the time , her ex boyfriend , dan , who had lived with her for a year , had just moved out of her apartment following a turbulent breakup ella , who was in her early s , felt like a failure when it came to relationships prior to the last breakup , she had been in three long term relationships , and every one of them ended badly when she first met him , she was sure that dan was her soul mate , but she was bewildered as to why it did n't work out when she first met dan in a cafe , he was unemployed and couch surfing among his friends as they struck up a conversation and dan talked about his problems , ella felt a instant intense attraction to him by the end of their conversation , ella invited him over to her apartment they had passionate sex , and within a couple of weeks , she invited him to move in adult children of dysfunctional families confusing pity and love ella ignored her friends' advice to wait because she really did n't know him and she would be supporting him while he looked for a job her best friend , nina , tried to tell her that there were red flags with dan after she heard from ella that he had a history of rocky romantic relationships and an unstable work history nina also pointed out that dan 's problems seemed similar to ella 's last two boyfriends and she reminded ella of how badly those relationships ended see my article falling in love with mr wrong over and over again but ella felt that dan was n't the same at all as her last two boyfriends she told nina that , while dan had similar circumstances to her last two boyfriends , dan was completely different she felt sure that , with her help , dan would be back on his feet in no time and they would be in love forever initially , their relationship was very passionate and intense ella saw this as confirmation that they were each other 's soul mates adult children of dysfunctional families confusing pity and love during that time , ella spent a lot of time networking for dan she contacted everyone that she knew in dan 's field to try to help him find a job as a favor to ella , these people met dan to see if they could help him but after each meeting ella was surprised to hear negative feedback from her colleagues about dan most of them said , after hearing him complain about his prior bosses , that he created problems for himself at work , and they were hesitant to recommend him to contacts in their professional network after six months , dan and ella began to argue because ella felt that dan was n't following her suggestions to find a new job , and dan felt that ella was being too pushy whereas their relationship was passionate in the beginning , they were n't even having sex any more dan told her that he did n't feel sexually attracted to her any more because he felt that she was nagging him like his mother , and he did n't feel like having sex with someone who reminded him of his mother adult children of alcoholic and dysfunctional families ella felt that dan was n't appreciating how hard she had worked to try to help him when ella called nina in tears because she was worried that her relationship with dan was in trouble , nina was n't surprised nina knew that ella had gone through similar dynamics in her prior relationships and , once again , ella was unable to see that this was a recurring pattern once again , nina recommended that ella go to therapy but ella did n't feel she needed to see a therapist until several months later when dan moved out while ella was at work he left her a terse note that it was over between them , he was tired of her trying to fix him , and he would rather stay with friends feeling abandoned and confused , ella contacted me to begin therapy see my article overcoming fear of abandonment that keeps you stuck in an unhealthy

which lists many of the character traits of people who come from alcoholic and or dysfunctional families this was an eye opening experience for ella to her surprise , she identified with almost all of the characteristics over time as we continued to work in therapy , ella was able to see that what she really felt for dan and her prior boyfriends was pity not love and she was attempting to rescue and fix each of them as ella developed a better perspective about her relationship dynamics and how they related to her childhood history , she began to understand why these relationships were doomed from the start she also began to understand the emotional , physical and financial toll that these relationships had taken on her initially , ella feared that she could never be attracted to anyone
