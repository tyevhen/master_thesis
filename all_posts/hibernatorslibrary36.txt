packing for mars is a hilarious and informative book about the difficulties astronauts face in outer space it covers most bodily functions , eating , and what happens to food and bodily fluids in zero gravity however , it has very little to do with visiting mars i admit that i found this book a bit slow at the beginning , but it perked up around the time she started talking about the sleep studies nasa is performing i want to lie around in bed all day for months ! i even called up the number provided on the nasa website to volunteer , but the number did n't work sigh oh well , i really did n't want to ruin my bones having studied bones for my dissertation , i recognize the long term effects of a study like that i was also thrilled when roach quoted my dissertation adviser on the effects of hibernation on bear bones how funny ! i definitely recommend this quirky book to anyone who enjoys knowledge for the sake of knowledge and is n't easily grossed out
