depression was the most confusing and bewildering experience of my life i did not know what was wrong with me or what was causing it , and spent countless hours searching for that cause i truly believed that if i could pin down the cause , i would find an answer or solution that would bring instant recovery from the multitude of symptoms that assailed me th january i am a mess and i still don t know why i see several possibilities as to what is happening to me a i have suffered a major burnout if this is correct , for the next six to twelve months i will run around looking for the answer i had suffered an undiagnosed minor depressive episode in and spent the whole time doing exactly that b i need deliverance from something inside me or from a major external attack c i need deep inner healing or renewing d that maybe god is telling me that my christian walk is unbalanced e that the enemy has developed a strategy of throwing doubts at me , which i analyse to the point that it destroys that area of my faith g or maybe a combination of the above i have many such entries in my diary , written before i was diagnosed with depression by a doctor and a christian counsellor these entries reveal that i often feared that the intense suffering i was going through was caused by spiritual causes and required only a spiritual solution it is common for christians suffering from depression to suspect this , since their spiritual life is so clearly off balance because of this , they may find themselves asking questions like these perhaps god is not the centre of my life like he should be ? perhaps this suffering is caused by hidden sin in my life ? perhaps i am unwittingly living in disobedience to god ? and if any of these are indeed the case , has god has inflicted this suffering upon me to punish or discipline me ? some christian circles also view depression as just a spiritual problem that requires only a spiritual solution some tell depression sufferers that they just need more faith , or to read the bible and pray more , or to rebuke the enemy that it is nothing more than a concerted spiritual attack and yes , satan does attack those who are suffering from depression , but as my counsellor confirmed , this was not the cause of my depression but merely one aspect of it because i suspected my suffering had a spiritual cause , i kept searching for a spiritual answer in the belief that such an answer would instantly set me free i believed that if i were to just take one particular step of obedience , or make one significant change in my spiritual life , or find and repent of a hidden sin , the depression will go away my exhausted mind kept searching for what was causing the suffering , and because my spiritual life mattered more to me than anything else , my mind latched onto a spiritual topic that troubled me as i examined and debated that topic , i become convinced that it was the cause of my suffering , and in the end , that topic became an obsession that took over my thought life in my first session with my christian counsellor , i shared with her my fear that it was god who was inflicting depression upon me and she said , we make the mistake in thinking that because our spiritual life is affected by depression , the cause must be spiritual but this is incorrect depression touches every part of us , so why do we think that it will not touch us spiritually ? she then reassured me of the truth that god does not afflict depression upon anyone using god s word , she showed me that my fears were unjustified and helped me to find the correct , biblical perspective on each of them we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god , and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ corinthians for example , the symptom of depression that disturbed me the most was the complete lack of peace , which i erroneously believed to be god s attempt to guide me my counsellor confirmed that god does not take our peace away , but gives us a peace that transcends our understanding and the peace of god , which transcends all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus phillipians and also , peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid john as depression dragged on , my diary entries also show me realising that there was much more to what i was going through than simply a spiritual problem , due to the host of physical , emotional and mental symptoms of depression that were afflicting me too yet even there , i kept looking for the answer that would instantly set me free th sept this was written after i knew what was wrong with me and how to recover i can remember that amongst the bewilderment , some of the things i wondered were as follows since it was so physical as well as emotional , i wondered if it was caused by food allergies , so i considered seeing a specialist i wondered if there was something wrong with my neck or back , so i was going to see a chiropractor i wondered if it was caused by my car seat being set back , so i considered putting it forward i wondered if it was caused by something being wrong with my eyes and so on it went of course , none of these things had anything to do with what was causing the depression , but how was i to know ? these were all symptoms caused by the depression i learned that there is no single answer to be instantly set free from depression , and that it is not easy for us to determine what is causing it by ourselves , since we cannot think objectively while in the midst of it that is why others , such as a doctor , minister , christian counsellor therapist , a wise christian friend , and even a resource such as the book self help for your nerves , can help us to wade through the bewildering mess to find out the causes of depression , and point us in the right direction to recover in the end i learned that my depression had been caused primarily by genetic inheritance both of my parents had suffered from it , however , many other factors contributed to its severity and duration including undiagnosed complex partial epilepsy , chronic insomnia , working myself into the ground , poor diet and lack of exercise , a massive shock , faulty theology , etc depression is a complex illness and normally needs to be treated , which may include medication and biblical counselling therapy and like any illness , even with the correct treatment , recovery and healing is a process that occurs over time and when the causes of depression and its associated fears traumas have been dealt with and the fear adrenalin cycle has been broken , the physical , mental , emotional and spiritual symptoms will slowly reduce in severity and duration and eventually fade away and our spiritual life will not only be restored , but can in fact be better than it was previously , as a result of the strengthening of our faith during the trial , as well as being set free from traumas bondages from our past blessed is the man who perseveres under trial , because when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him james consider it pure joy , my brothers , whenever you face trials of many kinds , because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete , not lacking anything james download an ebook on depression , ie , this blog 's articles all verses from niv
