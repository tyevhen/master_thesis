posted by roy nice to see that the supreme court reviewed eric clark 's case he 's the texas kid who developed schizophrenia and killed a police officer , thinking the officer was an alien unfortunately , the washington post reports that the court will probably interpret the case very narrowly , thus not affecting many of the states that have reduced or eliminated the ability to use insanity as a mitigating factor in criminal trials so , maybe they 'll render an opinion that all citizens have the right to sanity , and require true access to mental health treatment for all us citizens ? i must be delusional hmm , i note that cchr citizen 's commission on hubbard no , human rights testified at the hearing cchr is a scientology driven organization now that 's supreme irony an organization founded on the belief that aliens are among us testifying that mr clark 's defense that he thought the police officer was an alien does not justify an insanity plea in fact , that there is no such thing as insanity at least they are internally consistent but do n't they have a conflict of interest ?
