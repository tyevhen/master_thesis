look at us i look at this picture and i can see every emotion that was running through my head that day i was so happy , full of joy , and incredibly hopeful for our future it was an amazing day and one i will never forget it s been years today , which just feels amazing don t be calling me a newlywed we are in the trenches baby where are we ? i haven t given an update on our family unit in a while there just really hasn t been a need for one we are , in a word , solid we are at peace we are insane and we are busy most importantly , we are together the insecurity of the past few years is long gone , we have graduated from counseling and only return every few months to check in aka , when there are so many moving parts in a family , it s easy to start going through the motions we go , we sit , we make sure we are on the same page , and we move on i think we bore our counselor at this point how awesome is that ? last year , our anniversary felt like such a triumph , because we were really still in the throes of overcoming all that had happened in our family this year i just feel a sense of calm i am not worried about us anymore i am not worried about outside factors impacting our relationship we won t let that happen , our family is too important so today , when i am feeling so very thankful for my family , i want to make sure and include all of you who support our marriage and family on a daily basis if it takes a village to raise a child , it takes a jam packed stadium of devoted fans to cheer a couple through all of the obstacles we have overcome you all know who you are , and you know how much we love you i am a cheese ball today so forgive me the below song is on my ipod and when i took a walk today it happened to play this is how i feel now like we have come through a storm , and have gained the respect of those around us like we have found the support we need in each other and in those who have had faith in us oh and john , love you to pieces , and thank you
