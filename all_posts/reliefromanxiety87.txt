today , i'm going to share with you an experience that happens to me rarely , but nevertheless can affect me greatly years ago , i used to have periods when my anxiety got so severe that i would have panic attacks that would get out of control in fact , i would just lose control as my counsellor has put it , an extreme version of the fight or flight system i used to get severe panic attacks and then get to a point when i would kind of become dissociated with myself and be in such a state that i would be in some sort of autopilot i would still be aware of my surroundings and aware of what i was doing , but it would be hazy as the feeling you do get with a panic attack i would usually just end of walking to somewhere and would never affect anyone else , just myself although this was few and far between , it was an occurrence that was scary to say the least and i know that it was definitely down my severity of mental illness a few months back , after a good few years without experiencing this , i had another experience similar to what i had just explained , but this time it was without a panic attack i had low mood since i had woken up and it had been building up over time and when i was talking to my house mate , i starkly left my room and went out into the street with the intention of walking to somewhere with my house mate following me because i suddenly just exited the house without saying anything , it was natural for my house mate to wonder what was going on and to be honest , i was n't completely sure either again , it was a loss of control and almost like a dissociation of my person , where i was aware of what i was doing but it was all such a confusion and haze once i managed to calm back down , i had a clearer mind from this past experience , i am glad to say it has n't happened since i am still trying to figure out why this happens to me and trying to find strategies to cope if it does happen again have you got a similar story to share ? please let me know amy xx
