this is n't usually the type of post that i would write , but i'm hoping it will still be beneficial there are so many people out there that do n't understand anxiety and it 's true to say , it will never be completely understood unless you have experienced it yourself i hope that for the sufferers of the condition you will be able to relate to this somehow and for others , i'm hoping you understand how hard it can be for some people this is in no way intended to be a negative post , but more of a realisation the diary of anxiety different aspects of your life will be affected depending on what type of anxiety you have and how severe it is for those who suffer with severe anxiety , life can be a living hell it is with you sometimes it will be present in your sleep your body will be preparing for the day ahead with the flight or fight response this means one of two things either interrupted sleep , or feeling tired when waking up from the moment you wake , anxiety takes action with adrenaline rushing through your veins you wake up everyday feeling ill because your body has heightened anxiety due to the daily tasks you have to complete , such as going to school or catching public transport you 've put up with this anxiety for a long time now and it 's tiring you feel ill when you wake , so you do n't feel like doing much you do n't feel like putting makeup on or putting more effort into the way you dress you can only eat little , because your anxiety is just too bad and you 're always tired you just want to stay in a safe place , where you can be calm for a while for many people this is home your anxiety is so crippling and disabling that it stops you from doing anything that you love you get heightened anxiety any time you try to attempt to do something , which often ends in a panic attack or avoidance as a result , you end up staying at home again everything in your life is constant battle with your brain you struggle and often avoid school , public transport , driving lessons , getting a job , joining a club and speaking in front of class you try with every inch of your body and all of your might , to complete a simple task as to catch a bus , but it often results in hours of emotional and physical pain and angst about the thought you 're always told not to compare yourself to others , but sometimes you ca n't help but notice the people around you when you see other people your age with jobs , going to school without a second thought and driving , you ca n't help but feel a little bit hopeless it 's all well and good saying that you are in control of your destiny , but when it seems you have a great brick wall in front of your every step , your legs are heavy and you feel like you 're wading through thick mud , it 's extremely hard to believe but then you wake up one morning feeling okay , this is a very rare occasion but you 're feeling good you manage to overcome some of your fears and at the end of the day you feel ecstatic you know that this is a taste of what life should be and could be like you feel as if you 've crawled out of this deep dark hole and seen the light you know recovery is n't going to be easy , but it 's the good days you 've got to hold on to you know that even if the crippling anxiety comes back the next day , you 've experienced some sort of relief i really , really hope this has given people a better understanding of the struggle sufferers of the condition have to go through again , this is not intended to be a negative or pitiful post , but one that i hope you can relate to i wish you all best and do n't forget you can contact me through any of the social networks amy xx
