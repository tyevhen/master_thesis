i hate first weeks of school i guess the good news is that last week was my last first week of school , at least for a while it has n't really sunk in yet , though , that this is the beginning of the end and i really want to go through this semester with some sort of consciousness of that i want to appreciate these moments before they 're gone i want to revel in the feeling of transition but back to first weeks they 're awful when you 're an anxious person my therapist says i should n't call myself an anxious person because that means i let my anxiety define me , but eff that all i 've ever known is life with anxiety and it does define me it influences my every moment it shapes my personality and my actions people get to define themselves as white or black or latinex or gay why ca n't i define myself as mentally ill ? i do n't mean it in a bad way it 's just part of my identity , perspective , and experience rants aside , i wanted to take a few moments to reflect on life right now because i 've wanted to write about first week anxiety last semester but never got around to it because , well , schoolwork caught up with me first off , i wanted to give a shout out to all the anxious people starting school again i learned to dread going to school when i was young , and i think i mentioned before on this blog that i would always cry and cry the week before school started i did n't have a particularly horrific school experience or anything , but i just hate the stress , the regulation , the loneliness , the detachment , the oppression even though i'm a good student and always get things in on time and do a thorough job , i always feel like i'm drowning once school begins all the deadlines feel so impersonal and even though i know everyone else is stressed , you 're the only one who can do your own work , so there 's an element of loneliness i guess it does n't help that i 've never had a ton of friends it also does n't help when you have friends who invalidate your fears and anxiety about school when you confide in them first weeks are awful because you get syllabus after syllabus of deadlines , due dates , projects , readings , expectations , grading policies , office hours , participation grades it 's like a giant vortex of anxiety if the mantra to combat anxiety is , take everything one day at a time do n't worry about tomorrow , syllabuses undermine all of that and we 've all had those teachers who love to talk up their class to be as intimidating as possible to weed out people i recall getting so anxious about being in honors math class when i was in sixth grade after listening to the teacher tell us all that we would be covering that semester i 've never been particularly confident in math , that i dropped down to the grade level math class it was not an appropriate fit for me and my teacher kept telling me to move up to honors , but i was terrified but that was the only year i got an award for my performance in a math class , and trust me , that 's never going to happen again you think that after , what , eighteen years of first weeks i guess more if you count semesters i would be able to not get freaked out and tell myself , hey , you 've done this seventeen times and everything turned out alright , even when you were , like , almost dying , so i'm pretty sure you can do this but no , i still got pretty overwhelmed not as overwhelmed as before , but freaked out and it did n't help that my professors gave the syllabuses in a casual , oh , btw , nbd but there 's a ten page paper and two three pagers but they 'll be a breeze and when i expressed my overwhelm to fellow students they seemed non surplussed by the workload this week , i'm feeling less overwhelmed i guess i'm just taking the one step at a time approach but my heart goes out to all the people who feel completely out of their element and overwhelmed it 's not a fun feeling to have that 's an understatement you feel like you 're in a pressure cooker like someone just placed your head in a crock pot maybe you get headaches or neckaches or realize you 're constantly tense maybe you start having panic attacks again or waking up in the middle of the night maybe you feel emotionally like you 're drowning and ca n't possibly get this all done you need a break just when you ca n't take one you feel overwhelmed with inadequacy and uncertainty your calendar is your enemy but it is also your master you ca n't ignore it but it terrifies you and it 's marked up with commitments and deadlines in red ink it 's okay to feel overwhelmed it 's completely understandable and valid do n't let other people who are excited and blase let you feel like you 're crazy personally , i feel like they 're the crazy ones give yourself room to breathe though take a moment every now and then to pause and say , i am alive this moment is mine i am here it is a miracle i am breathing i am working i am achieving i am enough there is a future , but my job is to do my best today look around you when you walk look up at the trees and admire how their branches stretch as if trying to touch the sky notice the little things a house 's shutters you like , a plant you 've never seen before , a bird flying by , no matter how small dwell on the small miracles that all this life is happening it 's not all about this stress bubble that has encapsulated you i'm not blaming your for the stress bubble , by the way i hate how life puts us into these bubbles i know the pressure is unrelenting when the semester starts , but i also know that people who are anxious and or struggle with other mental illness are strong they are survivors they are overcomers every day is a battle for them , and they beat it just getting through a day is achieving sometimes when the world is putting pressure on you , be the one to give yourself a break you are a miracle we will be okay one day , one hour , one minute , one second , one breath at a time one sentence , one word , one formula , one math problem it 's going to be okay i do wish there were a couple extra hours in a day though
