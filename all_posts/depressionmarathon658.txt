it was n't easy , but i ran a new personal best time today i beat my old personal best time , set in december , , in dallas , by almost minutes i had a goal of , and i was pretty sure that would be doable on a perfect day but i really did n't expect i could achieve that time today after suffering through some sluggish training lately today was not a perfect day , but it was n't too far off either at first , it did n't appear the weather was going to cooperate it poured rain all night long it poured rain from the time i got up , to the time i boarded the bus to the starting line , and through the entire bus ride however , when we stepped off the bus minutes later , it magically cleared to a mere drizzle at around degrees , it was hardly comfortable , but again , it magically stayed dry for the duration of the marathon so it turned into almost perfect running conditions temps were in the 's , clouds covered the sky , and there was a fairly steady , albeit brisk , tailwind personal record conditions physically , things were slightly less than perfect i started great , felt great and was running around pace through approximately seven miles unfortunately , mile was the start of some vicious , take your breath away stomach cramps the cramps brought me to a stand still times between miles and i wasted at least one minute on the sidelines trying to work out cramps i 've never really experienced before it was baffling and frustrating , and i never thought they were going to let up they did , but they never totally went away i did , however , regain my pace later in the race other than that , i have no complaints it was tough , but marathons are supposed to be hard i found out , however , that when you run faster you hurt sooner so i began walking through some water stops around mile , and i walked up the heartbreak hill during mile my slowest mile i had to really push from one mile to the next during the last miles , and especially through the last two but i did it here are my mile splits , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , pace overall , i'm ecstatic like i said , it was hard , and i did have the thought more than once that i 'd just like to do this for fun from now on , but i doubt that will hold true i'm planning my next marathon for august what else can i say ? i'm really pleased i'm really pleased
