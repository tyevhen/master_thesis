for my people the slightly crazy , slightly broken , slightly outside of normal this has been a bad , bad week i want to talk a little bit about how it 's okay to practice some self care in times of horrible tragedy we who have depression or other forms of mental illness do n't always have the same filters that other people do we ca n't watch a news report about a horrible tragedy like the mass shooting in orlando and think that 's so awful and yet then be able to go on with our day instead , we have a tendency to sink far , far below the surface , drowning in waves of pain and empathy last night , when the news about the toddler at disney came through , after christina grimmie , after the pulse nightclub tragedy , it was that one final thing that sent me reeling into the cumulative pain of all of it i started to cry and i could n't breathe i literally could not catch my breath , to the point where i started to hyperventilate and then i had to go and hide in bed with the covers wrapped around me like a fragile cotton shield from the week 's horrors if the news is making it hard for you to breathe to live to stay out of the black pit , then please , please take a step back declare a no watch no listen zone in your house and car it 's okay to need a buffer from soaking up so much pain if you are standing on shaky ground , you need a lifeline , not to jump into the quicksand when you 're stronger , you can step up and take a stand do your part to help stop these tragedies from happening again speak out but please take care of yourself first be gentle with yourself and remember the friend rule you would n't say to me , alyssa , shake it off , you big baby be tough ! so please , please , do n't say it to yourself tonight i will go to a rally memorial service near me for the victims of pulse tomorrow i will go donate blood but today ? today i will keep my tv and radio off , and stay away from internet news today i need to learn to breathe again take care of yourselves , please hugs , alyssa
