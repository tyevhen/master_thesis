for years , i 've absolutely loved having shrink rap i 've loved having a place to write , to vent , to share something cool i 've learned , and i 've learned so very much from readers who have really changed my life what a great experience from a thought at the kitchen table that started , i want a blog what 's a blog ? shrink rap has inspired me to keep current with psychiatry and to learn about things to write about that i might otherwise just skip i love having a place to ask questions , especially when they 're about things that make my brain start doing somersaults well , not really , i think it 's anchored in there okay someplace to talk about things that are really bothering me or to share a funny cartoon or to just be a bit ducky sometimes , over the years , i 've gotten really annoyed as much as i like hearing about others peoples' experiences , i do n't like when people generalize their interior world to everyone else and when it 's an incessant , it gets wearing lately , i'm totally consumed with writing our next book i'm meeting the most interesting of people , and it 's fine with me that some of them are very much in favor of involuntary psychiatric care , for what seem to be caring and reasonable agendas , and some of them are very much against involuntary psychiatric care , for what seem to be caring and reasonable agendas but my brain is consumed with this and as much as i 've loved shrink rap , the drum beat of negative comments and the inter reader bickering , well , it 's tiring for a short while , i moderated comments that 's work , one more thing to do when i should probably be making pesto instead roy got tired long ago , and clink chimes in when something really inspires her , so i 've been most of the noise for a long time now i'm tired just tired we 'll see i think i'm taking a little rest for now
