during my ten mile run this morning i was feeling grateful i was feeling grateful for my recent run of feeling well , feeling great even , which made another decrease in my meds possible i always love it when i can decrease my medication and still feel well i was feeling grateful for my psychiatrist and thinking i really needed to let her know again how much i appreciate her i was feeling grateful for the friends i had just run of my miles with , friends i only knew through running and only socialized with around running , but friends i otherwise would not have met i was feeling grateful for the ability to run and for the opportunity to run marathons in many cities across many states i may not have the nicest house or the fanciest car , but i 've been able to travel and run , and i'm grateful for that i was feeling grateful for feeling alive , remembering just a few months ago when my whole being , especially my soul , felt nothing i was walking dead i marveled at that fact for a bit this illness continues to amaze me i may not be the luckiest person , in that i suffer with it , but this morning i felt very lucky despite this debilitating illness , right now , today , i feel productive , active and alive i'm grateful
