i apologize for going missing for almost a week i do n't have a lot to say i continue to be very busy working it feels like i have little time to squeeze in my other obligations , like exercise , meetings and jet i was doing fairly well this week until about thursday that 's when the fatigue really hit wednesday was my day off i managed to sneak in a nap between errands , appointments , and chores , but apparently that was n't enough rest by thursday morning i could barely get out of bed it felt like all the energy had drained out of my body my brain and my body felt like lead i pulled myself through the rest of the work week , made it to a cycling class and a meeting this morning , but since then i 've been on the sofa i'm a little concerned despite several hours of sleeping off and on , i 've got the beginnings of a migraine my mood is a little low and my thinking is a bit off my off thinking concerns me i 've been having some scary thoughts over the past several days i do n't usually have these thoughts they typically only occur when i'm not doing so hot they are intrusive thoughts about horrible , usually violent things happening to my dog , jet , or to people i care about i hope the presence of these thoughts is not a signal of depression around the corner just in case , i'm being hyper vigilant i wanted to do a couple of other things today , but i'm going to be okay with staying home and doing nothing i may even rest my eyes some more if i feel i need to i'm going to pay attention to my nutrition , stay away from sugar hopefully , and tone down the intensity of my exercise for now i 'll keep moving , but not to the point of further sapping my energy my hope is i can stop the fatigue in its tracks less fatigue and improved energy will hopefully lead to fewer scary thoughts and an improved mood one foot in front of the other , my friends i guess i had more to say than i thought
