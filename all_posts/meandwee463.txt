hi friends ! i hope all is well with all of you ! things are coming along well here ! we have been so busy here experiencing all of paige 's firsts time is going by too quickly ! her first night home , her first feedings at home , her first visits with friends and family days after her birth her little umbilical cord stump fell off , and i promptly cried in a fit of hormones she 's growing so fast ! of course , it 's funny since we had our second pediatrician visit today and she now weighs lbs oz up from her birth weight of lbs oz such a huge difference , eh ? anyway , i'm ultra sensitive and emotional right now if i were to allow myself i 'd likely cry all day ! not in a depressed way , just in a sentimental and overwhelmed by love way i never knew i 'd be like this anyhoo , her stump fell off , so we gave her the first tub bath it was pretty scary , but we figured it out and now she 's a bathing champ she loves the warm water and the sounds of the splashing phew ! another first and the moments fly right by and disappear i 've never been more aware of the fleetingness of time in all my life i wish i could press a pause button so i could savor things all the more save you might also like the first story one week ! here comes the sun linkwithin
