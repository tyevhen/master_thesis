question what is depression , really ? there 's no real definition it seems everybody knows depression when they get it why do we get it ? answer i did n't know what to call it but i certainly remember my first hit of depression when i was years old like being hit by a truck i could n't let anybody know how i felt i was totally lost and had no one to confide in i could n't talk to my parents about it i do n't know why i just hid my depression from everyone for years until i finally went to a psychiatrist in my thirties now i realize that , practically speaking , depression is more of a routine than a disease by that i mean depression can be a downshift in your mood that you shrug off and turn your mind to something more productive a quick choice of an alternative thought like a nonsense rhyme , a thought about something you re grateful for or when you get a downshift in your mood , you immediately let it slide into depression as a matter of course you just naturally start withdrawing you don t feel like jogging or going to work of course you hate the bad feeling and the fact that you just got hit again is disheartening oh no , not again and you give up and give in to depression and follow your regular depressive thinking and behavior you don t have to follow a depressive routine you don t have to carry this heavy load you can shrug it off that 's what i do when i get a hit you can interrupt the downer thinking with a mind exercise or physical exercise or immediately turning to some small task at hand any small thing accomplished instead of just being depressed is a help think about that i haven t done much this morning yet wait a minute yes i have i made my bed , walked the dogs wrote my blog i can think about that maybe i even encouraged somebody else to shrug off their heavy load of depression i have a whole day ahead maybe just a routine day but it won t be a depressive routine
