as the christmas cards start pouring in , i feel the need to let everyone know that we are not sending one out this year i don t want anyone to feel like we are slighting them , because that is so not the case it s a funny story about weeks ago , john and i got the boys dressed in cute clothes and set out to take our own picture we usually have a photographer take our picture around the holidays but we are trying to save some money and this seemed a good place to cut ha john and i put the boys in a chair in our living room and snapped no less than pictures of the kids nate was bribed with food , and mr jack is in a phase where his smile looks like he is in pain we are working on that j in any case , after about an hour of this , we had had enough and figured we would have gotten at least a few pictures i uploaded them to the computer and started looking through honestly ? nada seriously , out of , nothing still i was not deterred we had one good picture of nate and one good picture of jack and i knew that heads can be swapped in this day and age i found some software online and after about hours of fiddling , i got the job done i thought it looked great ! i uploaded it to tiny prints , it didn t give me any warnings about poor picture quality , so i ordered the cards fast forward days i got a call from a very nice customer service representative stating that the picture was blurry and would not look good if printed she wanted me to just send another over ok , i still feel kinda bad about this i started laughing and just could not stop like gulping snorting laughter i said , i m sorry , but that s really just not an option i explained to her what we went through in order to get this shot and she offered to refund our money immediately because of this , i do not feel even slightly bad about posting our proof here consider this our christmas card we love you all and have a wonderful holiday ! the back is always our reality shot jack airplane check , nate staring into space check
