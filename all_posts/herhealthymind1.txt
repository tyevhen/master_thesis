from elementary school through middle school , i ca n't remember how many times the white kids asked if they could touch my hair i'm not kidding when i say it happened pretty much once a week at least at first , it did n't bother me but eventually i felt like an exhibit in a petting zoo and i did n't have the vocabulary to explain to them that it was really weird that they kept asking to touch my hair all the time see , i was a pretty shy kid i was the only black one , i was overweight , and i 'd moved three times before i turned so , rather than tell the white kids that no , they could n't rummage through my hair , i just said yes and sat there quietly while they marveled at how my hair felt , says brian crooks on his chicago tribune 's essay what it 's like to be black in naperville , america and he continues , i 've never had a black boss i played football from middle school through senior year of high school and only had one black coach in that whole time not just head coaches , i'm talking about assistants and position coaches i 've had two black teachers in my entire life one was for my harlem renaissance class , and one was for my sign language class i 've never been to a black doctor , or a black dentist i 've never been pulled over by a black police officer what i'm trying to explain is that , in years , i 've seen three black people in a position of authority while the theme of racial discrimination is somewhat outside the scope of this blog , july is national minority mental health month and i think , more than ever , that it 's crucial to talk about it racial attacks and protests have become routine on media vehicles being a white , green eyed woman has always put me in a rather privileged condition and i can honestly say i never experienced racism first hand in america despite my latino background having the letters md after my name certainly helped but , in my profession , i get to feel the pain of people who did n't have the same luck to receive fair , equal treatment who did n't get to have the benefit of the doubt who have to teach their children to protect themselves from the very ones who were supposed to protect them who were denied opportunities simply because of the color of their skin day after day , i see the tears , struggles and challenges of those black women with mental illness a triple minority of an unjust society but what does one 's complexion have to do with mental health ? , you may ask racial discrimination is closely related to trauma , and can even cause post traumatic stress disorder ptsd it is , indeed , one of the greatest misconceptions about ptsd , that it s limited to wars and combat zones or to a life threatening event the reality is that one can have ptsd simply from witnessing a traumatic event of any nature or even if a loved one has suffered a traumatic event a study from the university of miami showed that almost of women had ptsd symptoms after hurricane katrina , for example the dsm even broadened the definition to include a person who learns about a traumatic event that happened to a close family member or a close friend , and also stress due to a prolonged exposure to an aversive situation well , racism itself may be a traumatic experience ! watching repeated acts of violence is a source of stress and trauma in black people , particularly black women research has shown that stress and trauma from racially motivated events create reactions that can be identical to ptsd if i am african american and i see this pattern on television i may identify myself with the entire situation but trauma extends well beyond what we see on cable news and social media it is an everyday challenge that people face with institutionalized racism leading to what some mental health professionals call race based trauma racism continues to be a daily part of american culture and to have an overwhelming impact on the oppressed in the case of racial discrimination , we re not talking about an issue that s been around for years or decades , but centuries it s people who were kidnapped and thrown in the bowels of slave ships and submitted to forced labor and torture later on , that was translated into exclusion from educational , social and health resources causing disparities that are linked to mental health it 's important to have that in mind in order to understand one 's perceptions and society 's misperceptions victims can become distressed by things that are not typically worrisome to white people , for example microaggressions , or routine slights , can trigger stress reactions it s the black man followed by a security guard at the department store or the white woman clutching her purse when a black man enters the elevator , says dr carl bell , from the university of illinois at chicago what is ptsd ? it s a severe and chronic condition that may occur in the aftermath of a traumatic event symptoms usually develop within the first months after the trauma and the diagnosis is made if symptoms persist for over a month women are more affected than men symptoms include depression , anxiety , flashbacks , fear , intrusive thoughts about the traumatic event , recurrent nightmares leading to sleep difficulties , anger , apathy , inability to get pleasure , impaired concentration it may also cause hypervigilance , hyperarousal and an exaggerated startle response certain sounds or smells make the person relive the trauma as well as avoidance behaviors leading to social isolation the person becomes more seclusive and uninterested , fears getting out of the house , or may change the route they normally take to avoid walking by a police officer or the street corner etc ptsd may have short term or long term impact how long ? the answer may be shocking studies suggest that trauma is intergenerational and inherited , with memories passed along through the dna ! that is shown , for example , in several interesting studies with families of holocaust survivors , or more recent studies with victims of the attacks , that showed that pregnant women who experienced the bombings passed on biological signs to their babies there is another study from columbia university that revealed that one third of nyc s school children suffered mental health disorders following the wtc attacks we must ensure black women have the ability and the right to raise their children in a healthy environment it is a matter of reproductive justice african americans are more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites they are also more likely to have feelings of sadness , hopelessness , worthlessness and more likely to attempt suicide vs the national survey of american life found that aa have a prevalence of ptsd around vs for non hispanic whites in certain populations , this number can get much higher inner city studies in high crime zones of detroit and baltimore show something like , which is comparable to war zones in vietnam , iraq and afghanistan aa usually have more serious traumatic events and are more likely to experience child abuse , sexual trauma , and to witness domestic violence an emory study showed that almost aa living in impoverished urban areas reported some form of trauma a umichigan study from with women half aa showed that the prevalence of ptsd was times higher among aa , but they were also less likely to get treatment they also noted the correlation of ptsd and pregnancy complications , including preterm birth due to increased cortisol levels causing placental abnormalities aa are under represented in outpatient settings but over represented in inpatient treatment they are also over represented in jails aa and hispanics comprise of the us population but account for almost of the prison population they re also of drug users but of drug arrests police are also at an increased risk for violent behaviors as a consequence of stress the uncertainty about whether they ll come home alive to their families at the end of their shifts and the pressure from being at the front lines may cause depression , and anxiety , and burnout stigma is particularly significant in this population and a lot of them won t disclose their feelings and struggles with fears of being perceived as weak , or even of losing their jobs as a consequence , lot of them will use alcohol or drugs to self medicate their symptoms , making the symptoms much worse and more difficult to treat and contributing to poor judgement and inappropriate defenses this attitude is thankfully starting to change but the process is really slow there s still something between documented suicides per year among police officers and a very high prevalence of ptsd in what can be done ? we need to understand this phenomenon as a public health crisis there are still a lot of underserved areas and significant lack of resources to treat mental illness aa physicians are times more likely to treat aa patients but the vast majority of mental health professionals are white some people have difficulty expressing their feelings and experiences thinking they won t be fully understood it s important to make mental health professionals aware and teach them how to address this problem and how to actively screen specifically for racial based trauma when assessing the trauma or abuse history despite the growing evidence that ptsd is related to racial discrimination , little is being done to address this problem hospital trauma centers are well equipped to treat the physical injuries from the trauma , but not its emotional and psychological components we have a number of evidence based interventions and treatment models for trauma but not specifically for racial trauma so more studies should be done and more attention should be paid to this matter also it s important to develop interventions to decrease violent crime and increase access to mental health treatment and to work on decreasing the stigma that surrounds mental illness below is a panel that aired last week on the morning news about the theme of race , trauma and urban violence
