one of the most common questions that i see being asked around the internet after the lousy segment on good morning america , that only focused on what unschoolers do n't do , is quite simple what do unschoolers do ? here 's my answer i wander , explore , read , write , discuss , laugh , play , run , hike , create , grow , garden , identify , search , talk , listen , swim , hang out , organize , breathe , gather , touch , work , participate , watch , help , ask , meditate , daydream , wonder , connect , think , learn i'm fascinated by people , earth , sustainability , writing , food , learning , unschooling , anarchy , freedom , art , community no , really , what do you do ? i live my life for most people , the concept of education being a separate part of life is so ingrained that they ca n't see things working any other way but for me , and for other unschoolers , learning really is nothing more or less than living my life as fully as i can life and learning do n't have to be separate things as i wrote a while ago , learning is living , and living is learning , so why differentiate between the two ? if i'm living , i'm learning , and obviously if i'm learning , i'm living ! i am learning all the time the tombstone will be my diploma eartha kitt and i'm quite happy with that , thank you very much peace , idzie you might also like unschooling are we teaching ourselves ? blame unschooling ! learning advice from a learning life unschooling gets publicity in a big way ! linkwithin
