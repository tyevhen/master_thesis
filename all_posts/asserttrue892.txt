i downloaded chrome today and immediately started using the javascript console it 's pretty nice , but if you 're already accustomed to firebug in firefox , it 's no substitute also , what good is chrome if you ca n't use greasemonkey scripts with it ? the js engine is presumably based on spidermonkey since the chrome guys apparently used a lot of mozilla code to slap this thing together but they forgot to include ex and so help me , i have n't figured out how to enter a newline in the console without triggering an eval in other words , i can only enter one line of code at a time , and then i have to execute it as soon as i hit enter , cr , control enter , etc , the code on the current line executes oh well as a browser , this thing is not terribly impressive , from what i can tell in any case , chrome itself strikes me as too fugly to deal with i'm not sure which i 'd rather do spend a work day using chrome as my main browser , or jam prickly pears into both my eyes at once i think i 'll stay with firefox until chrome gets out of beta which if it 's like gmail it never will
