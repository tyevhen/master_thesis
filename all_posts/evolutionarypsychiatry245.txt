certain composers seem to be able to understand the music that floats in the air between molecules , the music that describes the light , wind , war , and love tchaikovsky can be a bit too romantic , as the russian composers were apt to be a writer would call it purple prose , but in my mind there are few better songs than the overture right click in new tab to listen without leaving this page this is the first part a lot of folks dig the finale with the cannons and the fireworks , but my favorite part is the beginning choral and its recapitulation in brass just before the cannons start going off when i listen to the choral , i feel that tchaikovsky translated a spirit , a meme , a truth , and that when it is over , i understand something more about being human in some respects , that is the lofty goal of this blog what does it mean to be homo sapiens ? how do we nurture a human , how do we heal ? since i have no patience for philosophy , i work in biology and biochemistry with a hint of practical psychology thrown in my style is to think out loud in blog form such a wretched word , blog , sounds like some sort of mucousy allergy problem some of the ideas are early , not fermented as it were , and i will likely change my mind about some things over the months there are so many unknowns it can get frustrating when you realize how much money , effort , and time have been spent looking at nutrition , metabolism , and mental health in such a way as to discover nothing at all but there is exhilaration too , especially in the sharing of ideas , and to have if someone wants to listen an enhanced ability to heal myself , my family , my patients here is the finale i do n't believe in magic cures i agree wholeheartedly with this post on panu , about looking for that next secret , the next hack , the next way to measure your increments of success other than feeling better , lifting better , running faster or farther , and the pantsometer just eat well , get some sleep , play outdoors if possible and worry about the tablespoons of coconut oil when everything else is locked into place sometimes we are broken , and modern medicine can actually help with the fix sometimes we are broken , and there is no perfect fix it always settles me a bit when i find myself in agreement with kurt harris mostly because i can tell he thinks about things he reads and sits back and asks some questions and reads some more and he thinks about it again , and then he posts he is not as even tempered as stephan guyenet , but if he jumps at being questioned , i'm pretty sure it is because he 's done the time , the reading , and the thinking sometimes i post first and think about it later a different process , and in some ways a more prolific but scattershot result and i believe the most important aspect of a paleolithic style diet is the avoidance of inflammatory load not too much fructose , as little gluten as possible , and keep the pufas minimal with enough omega to more or less balance the , and avoid all the fake food out there my obsession is not with what exactly goes in the mouth but how the possible toxins meet the gut , the immune system , and the brain the audience for this blog grows and grows it has tripled in the last three months or so , and given the growing interest and intrinsic common sense of the traditionalist paleo diet movement , i imagine it will only get bigger the concept is simple , the proof of concept a lot of work , especially when only a few of the researchers are asking the sorts of questions that will yield or not the answers we are looking for the picture below is of my great grandmother , by all accounts an extraordinary woman who graduated from vassar with a degree in botany she married a publisher and died at the age of her early passing i believe cast a shadow on my family that continues in some respects to my generation i'm tired of illness caused by bad advice , corrupt motivations , and incompetence i love the study of medicine and the human mind i read and i listen to find that truth , that meme , that whisper of the mathematical dance of molecules through the gut , the bloodstream , the brain the spark of thought and what might strangle it or snuff it out and that is the story of my blog thus far
