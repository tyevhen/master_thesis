as i mentioned in my earlier post , we are finally getting some much needed rain in our neck of the woods that means a lot of playing inside where paige is enjoying making a big mess of toys , shoes , and running all around she 's also doing a lot of reading and cooking with her play food she sure does love the comic exploits from the far side this when she 's not desperately clinging to me and fussing for no real reason but i suspect she wants to go outside today 's visit to gymboree class only did so much for her energy sun is in the forecast for tomorrow so we will be taking full advantage of the outdoors that much is certain ! save
