energy what a precious thing i just responded to a comment by noting i had given up on showering daily and brushing my teeth twice a day a long time ago that 's not a rule , of course i always shower after working out , and sometimes my teeth do get the two a day treatment my point is , this disease steals so much that i need to constantly decide when , where , and how much of my limited energy supply i am willing to spend brushing my teeth and showering dive down the priority list if doing those simple tasks means depleting my precious energy supply how much do i have in reserve ? i would like to run , feed the dog , pay a few bills , and maybe go to a meeting if i brush my teeth , will i have enough left to accomplish any of those things ? if the answer is no , i swish the mouthwash and move on i had my best running year in in , at the age of , i ran like the wind ! i set personal bests in every distance from one mile to the marathon i comfortably qualified for boston i won gold medals and one bronze at a major international track meet all of these accomplishments were significant because while i was hitting those all time athletic highs , my depression was hitting an all time desperate low ! incredible but it was all about the energy , i realized years later i was determined to keep running , and i was willing to part with all of my energy to do it i was a runner i had already lost so much of my identity , i was compelled to hang on to that one piece runner so despite pounding fatigue , smothering darkness , loss of appetite and weight , self medicating with alcohol , at least one suicide attempt , and multiple hospitalizations , i ran there were hundreds of days when i did nothing else i could n't if i wanted to keep running , i needed all of my energy to do it i needed to do it to save one sliver of me , the runner so , that 's what i did i got out of bed to run , went running , and then returned to bed running hurt , too , which was another bonus ! pain was supremely preferable to the vacant emptiness i otherwise experienced ironically , my fatigue , weight loss , singular focus , and pain tolerance combined to produce speed i had never achieved before or since and it was all because i did n't brush my teeth
