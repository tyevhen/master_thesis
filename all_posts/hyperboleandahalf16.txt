this comic was inspired by an experience i had a few night ago i was pulling into the parking lot of safeway when i saw one of those gratuitously bright shooting stars i tried to think of a really good wish , but the shooting star had surprised me and i did n't really have any good wishes on deck , so i wished for the first semi intelligible thing that came to mind for the rest of my life to be totally awesome as soon as that ham fisted jumble of words left my mouth , i immediately started thinking of all the ways my wish could backfire and how the phrase i wish that the rest of my life is totally awesome could be misinterpreted and taken out of context and turned around to cause me great misery i silently berated myself for not choosing my words more carefully i could have used this opportunity to secure a bright and wonderful future for myself , but no , i was stupid and just blurted out the first dumb thing to barge into my head and i 'd wasted my wish and possibly also earned myself an untimely death or a crippling brain injury then i realized that i was sitting in a safeway parking lot , consumed by anxiety over whether some fictional being that grants wishes was going to screw me out of my wish through a technical loophole involving death , brain damage or prolonged unconsciousness it made me feel slightly uncomfortable that i'm the person making all the decisions about my life anyway , i'm sometimes reluctant to post short comics , but i should probably get over that because i love to draw them and it gives you guys something to read while i'm working on the longer comics oh , and you may have noticed that i changed my banner , sidebar and buttons at first i just wanted to mess with the post column width so that three panel comics like this one would fit , but i got carried away
