cloaked in gray , feeling unreal those are my words from a recent post unfortunately , those words still apply the darkness is still here , surrounding me , but i feel the clouds lifting a bit the cloak of gray is less weighty upon me that cloak is being replaced i am now sampling a cloak of gratitude amidst the darkness and you know what ? the cloak of gratitude is yielding to the cloak of gray the cloak of gratitude is slight upon my shoulders as compared to the cloak of depression i have had plenty of time to reflect while here in the hospital at first my thoughts and questions were jaded with disappointment and a sense of failure how did i get here ? why me ? how did this happen so fast ? was n't i doing what i was supposed to be doing ? sounds like a lot of self pity to me , and it was n't moving me forward today , i'm working on a new attitude , and the change is all because of you , my readers in the aftermath of my most recent blog post you responded with unbelievable eloquence and passionate support i am overwhelmed i cannot believe how fortunate i am i felt your caring and concern from afar i was changed by it thank you so much for sharing your hope with me you give me strength your hope and strength got me thinking yes , i have a debilitating , life interrupting illness , but i have so much more than that i have many fortunes for which to be grateful the job , the house , the food on the table , jet , and all the material comforts i have make my life simpler but more importantly , my life is full and rich today not because of things but because of the people surrounding me these people , wendy , heidi , vicky , therese , shelli , mike , molly , nancy , pam , joan , bruce , janill , dr l , deb and shawn have all played a role in my life in just the past few days they supported , transported , called , visited , educated , mowed , packed , dog sat , fed , and basically took care of me when i could n't care for myself that 's a lot of people ! despite this terrible illness , i 've decided i am one of the luckiest women around more grateful , i could not be thank you all
