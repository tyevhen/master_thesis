i found a home for the deprivathon , my over line poem about quitting smoking i wrote the rough draft in , i believe , so it 's taken about six years to muscle that white elephant in to publishable shape and i did a bad thing , something you should never do as a poet , just like you should never play in public with new strings as a guitarist i sent klaus gerken , the generous editor , some last minute revisions and weakened the poem i wo n't tell you where or it might spoil the experience of reading it in ygdrasil ygdrasil is unbelievable , a zine that has been around since and it 's format has never changed like jack kerouac 's famous on the road , the magazine always appears as a continuous typewritten page i had n't sent them anything since that behavior comes from my trophy hunting days to what do i refer ? when i first came out of my year long depression of , i began publishing on the net with good success i sought to publish in as many e zines as possible trouble was , once i published in one i forgot about it and put it in the trophy case after publishing hundreds of pieces i finally slowed down and began submitting much less that also had to do with a relative lack of stability in my personal life i should have spent the time submitting to eminent print journals i did n't for the simple reason of e mail i'm as lazy as the next guy why do bears raid trash cans ? because it 's easier than hunting and gathering nature never passes up a chance to be lazy , why should i ? as i said in an earlier post , i am not in remission from depression i am much improved but i feel fragile the freedom depression gives one , the new start , has not been a pony ride so far i feel light and dark at the same time , the tootsie pop image recurs , or an oreo , or a clean engine with dirty oil inside , you get the picture i feel the medications holding me back like a needed harness how i wish i could jump over the pit to real freedom ! remaining symptoms ? i love kathleen intellectually and by faith but i feel disconnected from the warm , fuzzy feelings i usually have for her i see that she 's beautiful i see that she loves me like no one else has i see she is the best mate i could hope for yet she and i both sense a lingering barrier between us , and we know it 's on my side in that she suffers depression as well , she understands even if she does n't like it other symptoms include a plethora of self castigating thoughts and a melancholy remainder that asks , what 's it all about ? apologies to peggy lee and alfie going through a depression strips you of everything , all attachments , all likes and loves on the other side , once released , you have the freedom to dump anything from your life with essentially no regret it irks me that i have a love hate relationship with poetry i enjoy composing it more than reading it , though i read much more than i write a good poem can make me praise god , but a mediocre one , especially in a prestigous journal , sets my teeth on edge it takes a lot to read good poetry , it takes a concentrated mind and an open heart i'm rarely in that state of mind i'm used to disappoinment in poetry , mainly from reading my recognized contemporaries last night i was reading william carlos williams , eliot 's contemporary and opposite i gave him an even break and tried to enjoy his work did you know he published his first book of poetry in , before eliot did ? maybe the reason i love poetry is that it is the only thing that forces me to be economical with speech behaviorally , i must put my self image into reinforcement mode if someone now asks me , what do you do ? i 'll reply , i'm a poet , and roll with the punches i can always chicken out and shade my reply i dabble in literature i 've had a few things published poetry is sort of a hobby and due to the fact that my depression is not in full remission , i will waver between the two approaches , which will add uncertainty to my self view oh shut up , craig ! enough already you know it 's all chemical but something has to be my fault thanks to norm for speaking well of my music anyone who wants a free disk need only write me with their snail mail address enough for a sunday already i have the distinct feeling that if i should ever re read my blog , i will be sorely embarrassed about the degree of narcissism on display think of me as a work in progress and my blog the necessary exhaust vapors from my self manufacturing at kilorats , ce
