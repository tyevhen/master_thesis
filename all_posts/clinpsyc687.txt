i have been wondering aloud for years when someone was going to make an ssri into a treatment for premature ejaculation well , it seems i need to wonder no longer to some , a pesky side effect of impaired ability to ejaculate is just what the doctor ordered if you can get men to last a whopping three minutes in the sack , then you 've obviously created a winner ! my bold prediction as another new generation of miracle antidepressants read ad 's that are about as effective as ssri 's but with new , slick marketing , and equally importantly , many years of patent protection hits the market in the next few years , look for the ssri 's to be coming bad pun possibly intended to a sex therapy clinic or a general practitioner near you as usual , phamagossip is on top of the story pharmagossip
