i have been off warfarin for three days now i began to notice a difference yesterday this morning when i began my standing exercises the difference was amazing i did calf steps , side steps and step ups without any problems the weakness in my trunk muscles stomach and back was also gone just two days ago this was impossible i went on to perform all of my other long day exercises i noticed that some exercises were still not perfect , but they were a lot easier and better another difference i noticed yesterday was the heaviness i felt in my lungs was gone observation it wasn t the flu that caused this extreme weakness i must be one of those that cannot take warfarin because it causes muscle weakness and fluid on the lungs in two more days i begin a new blood thinner two of the benefits of this new thinner are that i do not need inr blood tests and i can eat any food item salads , broccoli , cranberries , etc i am really enjoying eating salads again in the expansive potential side effects list is one that says , could cause muscle weakness so , i need to be observant and make certain this doesn t happen again
