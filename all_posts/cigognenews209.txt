i will recount another one of my primals which occurred last night you mean you are still primaling ? at ninety ? a bit unseemly ? ah no primals , i e , feelings are a way of life , not just a therapy do you stop feeling ? no so you don t stop primals they occur far less as the years go on but we should welcome them because they are liberating and insightful they help us lead the examined life not just examined , but experienced with all of our being oh pardon , but that is exactly what is wrong with behavior therapy it is a life examined but never experienced it is wonderful for a purely cerebral life but not for a feeling one so intellectuals are drawn to an intellectual therapy where they can purify their neuroses so many people lead the unexamined life , going on and on without changing or knowing they are acting out or even why they never ask themselves what is it all for ? am i leading the life i want ? if not , what is the life i want to lead ? what does it all mean , anyway ? at least having a bit of reflection of questioning why ? so we don t turn into robots so we don t treat people inhumanely so we can lead a consciously aware life my primal last night was about being sent away when my mother went psychotic she was sent to an asylum and my dad went to live with her they split up my sister and i , and without a word sent us to strange houses to be cared for , for several years my first love was from a dog my first bonding was with him and today most of my money goes to animal shelters whenever an animal is sent even into the wild i have feelings i wrote about this recently when a family raised a rhino in their home he was part of the family but when got too big he had to be sent to a shelter where he soon died of a broken heart he was sent away from his family and it was too much i know exactly how he felt and i hurt for him , knowing his suffering why does it matter to understand that animals feel deeply ? it matters because we will begin to treat them differently and not as unfeeling robots oh yes , it is to avoid parents treating children as unfeeling beings , as well so why can t i get over it ? because there is no biologic way to leave our past behind until we feel it otherwise the traces of trauma are deeply embedded in our systems they just don t walk away when they have had enough they linger and compound , deepening the imprint the earlier it all happens the more embedded and obdurate it is that is why i cannot get over it it has got me in its physiologic grasp how early ? my mother had me and then facing the prospect of taking care of a child , she just collapsed into psychosis i was given to a grandmother who had no idea how to take care of children whereupon when i was five or six she gassed herself because she had a lesbian affair with a niece the point being that there was no parent after that since my mother was then interned in a hospital it began so early that the imprint was compounded i have taken off layers and layers of it but the residue remains and it drives me even today , not in a bad way but it is a motivating factor so when someone tells you , just get over it , explain that it is a matter of the brain cells changing first and they and we cannot change without going back directly to the trauma and reliving how and where it happened the chain of pain will do it for us it is not a deliberate thought out affair resonance will lead us back there unerringly it is one reason that the trace is there it is a reminder of unfinished business no therapist has to tell us all that our biology is the best reminder it says , go here but not too deep feel a little bit now and more later go slow all we have to do is listen to ourselves we are the world s best therapist no one is smarter than that we are the repository of all the knowledge we will need to make it through life
