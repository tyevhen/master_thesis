oh , you know i love surveys the ny safe act 's requirement that mental health professionals report dangerous patients goes into effect on march th new york has released a video and slideshow for mental health professionals explaining who must report , to whom they must report , and there 's a website to enter the information a director of community services reviews the information and decides if it goes to the fbi 's nics database to prevent such individuals from purchasing guns or to revoke a firearms license if the patient already owns a gun the director can also decide to have the patient brought in for emergency evaluation , though presumably the treating clinician might do that if there is an imminent threat the information is used only for gun permits , and is not accessible for other reasons in maryland , lawmakers are considering a similar measure , currently as house bill , but it may get rolled into the governor 's firearms act which has already passed the senate legislators are aware this may have a chilling effect and deter people from getting care i'm wondering if that 's true so i'm asking you to take a quick survey for me two questions if you 've never felt dangerous , or you 've never been in therapy , try to imagine obviously , i'm wondering if gun owners would feel differently than those who do n't own a gun and who may never wish to own one comments are welcome as well thank you so much loading
