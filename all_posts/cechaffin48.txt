there is much to tell , yet little again i have ascended out of my month depression after a washout of all psychiatric medications and the re introduction of lamictal which previously kept me stable for nine years i did not blog about this except through my dark sonnets , essentially , because i had little more to say about the black dog , and after having been underwater more than above the last four years , i am hopeful for another long stretch of relative sanity no need to repeat the experience in detail as i did from when , not unexpectedly , my readership was highest what people most need to understand about my disease external circumstances , though sometimes involved in a trigger , in general bear little relationship to one 's prevailing mood the two proceed in separate arcs , and any intersection is largely coincidental the mood disorder goes on it is endogenous , or self generated one question i used to ask patients to distinguish depression from the blues was their reaction to winning the lottery if no reaction they more likely depressed no external happenstance can cheer one when in a state of severe clinical depression the horror and self despite of clinical depression cannot be adequately communicated to one who has not suffered it think of the worst day of your life and the associated feelings multiply that exponentially and extend it for months , even years suicide begins to appear as heaven , and resisting it takes much fortitude if truly afflicted by manic depression , only one thing helps in treatment medications ect ought to be included except that it failed me in my last attempt and i will not try it again combined with the heavy psychiatric drugs they gave me at the hospital invega , i actually became worse there now for a new poem foxgloves mozart does it so neatly , answering every question posed i swear his concerto billowing out the porch attracts birdsong their song is not so neatly balanced as the master s their melodies can end in queries or falter in mid arc without resolution while no matter how far mozart s questing strays it always folds back on itself to the origin not just by counterpoint but reaffirmation as if the world made sense beyond the porch the shaggy foxgloves droop their furiously maculate lilac bells , broad leaves uneven , some prematurely yellowed and these are nothing like mozart , more like life , shedding and beautiful , its messy menstrual necessities even in crescendo trumpeting decay in fact when earlier i tried to straighten the foxgloves winding stalks they would have none of it see how they curl like snakes ? thine in truth and art , c e chaffin
