i have pointed out on many occasions that psychiatric research showing minimal to modest effects gets overhyped heavily by both drug companies and academic researchers for example , see my post on injectable abilify from a couple days ago it made me think about a somewhat snarky letter to the editor by bernard carroll published in the american journal of psychiatry a couple years ago it 's worth reading both his letter page and the authors' response page go here to check it out remember folks , if a trial has a huge number of participants , a trivial difference between the drug and placebo will be labeled as statistically significant , but do n't be fooled we must also know the magnitude of the effect , and , as i 've noted on many occasions such as here , here and here , the size of the treatment effect is often fairly unimpressive i must include one quote from carroll 's letter the study has all the hallmarks of an experimercial , a cost is no object exercise driven by a corporate sponsor to create positive publicity for its product in a market niche this is reminiscent of the arise rd risperdal as an add on treatment for depression study that i have written much about recently here , here , and here , in which relatively minimal treatment effects were seen , yet the accompanying press release and , indeed , much of the discussion in the article itself , is overly optimistic regarding the treatment
