i'm back in my house , with jet , and feeling well , okay i left the hospital monday morning , and the rest of monday went well jet and i walked through the solar eclipse , which was pretty cool the moon covered of the sun here i did n't have any special glasses , but the light coming through the trees along our route made the sidewalks and streets fill with hundreds of various sized crescent moons it was an unexpected surprise i spent the rest of the day unpacking , laundering the hospital off myself and my clothing , and buying groceries what was i eating prior to hospitalization ? ? my cupboards were bare it felt really good to feel human again unfortunately , those good feelings did n't last the darkness and heaviness began settling back in early yesterday it was weird it seemed i could feel it creeping through my body one part at a time slowly i got heavier and slower and lower i was baffled and discouraged but i fought i fought the creeping depression by writing thank you notes to several people i needed to acknowledge i walked with jet i tried to focus on my posture , the sun , and the air rather than on my frustration with the continued weakness in my left hip , knee and ankle , which made completing the mile walk tiresome afterward , i went back to mayo clinic to restart transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments my first tms treatment went well the process wiped me out , so i took a long nap afterward , but i at least felt hopeful that i was actively doing something to combat this debilitating illness the rest of the day was more encouraging i actually cooked something for dinner , watched my favorite baseball team go twins ! beat chicago , and spent some snuggle time with jet he 's been sticking close to my side since we were reunited yesterday , which is just fine with me normalcy i kind of like it i have a few chores on my to do list today prior to my second tms treatment this afternoon i'm hoping to find the energy to get on my elliptigo this morning i miss running so much i so desire the chance to expand my lungs , challenge myself , and feel that good , totally explainable , physical pain on a regular basis again i can only get those things on my elliptigo right now , so i need to get out there and ride one step at a time , one foot in front of the other , i'm hopeful getting back to my normal activities and tms will bring me back to a purposeful life that 's the plan , anyway carry on , my friends
