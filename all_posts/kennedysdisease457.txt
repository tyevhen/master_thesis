fortunately for all of us living with a rare medical condition , the internet has become a tremendous resource for seeking answers to our questions unfortunately , not all of the information available on the internet is accurate and it is important to validate what you read with quality information at your disposal , you can make more intelligent and less emotional decisions approximately three times a week either the kda or this blog receives an inquiry concerning kennedy s disease the subjects most often asked about are is there a test for kennedy s disease ? if so , where can i be tested ? i am concerned that i am a carrier , is there a test for women that might have the disease ? i am experiencing the following symptoms my doctor doesn t believe it is kennedy s disease , but everything i read points to the disease do you think i should see another doctor or demand that i be tested for the disease ? do you know a doctor in my area that is familiar with kennedy s disease ? my husband is really struggling with the disease and refuses to talk about it is there anything i can do to help ? do you know of others in my area that have kennedy s disease ? if so , how can i get in touch with them ? can a carrier experience symptoms like a man ? there are times i do not have the answers and have to ask a member of our scientific review board srb for assistance ed meyertholen , our biology professor , and the doctor members of our board are very supportive and have helped many people by answering their more technical and medical questions about the disease and , every time i contact a member of our srb , i learn something so , keep your questions and comments coming they are all appreciated
