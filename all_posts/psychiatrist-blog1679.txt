in the comment section to roy 's mental iphone post , rach asked if we 've seen michael moore 's sicko it was n't on this weekend 's agenda , but hey okay , so i could n't resist someone actually wants my opinion ! ! , and for rach , i spent sunday evening watching sicko my husband left the red sox with a tie score for this okay , so sicko michael moore starts with the statement that he thought health insurance companies want to help people , and he 's had this unnerving revelation that they want to make money he has no trouble finding examples of people who 've been denied coverage for the lamest of reasons too fat , too thin , too too , or those who 've been denied at the mercy of mis managed care he finds ex industry employees riddled with guilt who pour tears he villainizes everyone from john f kennedy , jr to hillary clinton yup to george pataki he finds people who 've been dumped in the street by hospitals , delirious and still in hospital gowns , as well as ground zero heroes with no access to health care it 's one heart wrenching sob story after another where 's it any better ? what 's the answer ? socialized medicine it 's better in canada , england , cuba , and even guantanamo bay , where the ratio of prisoners to health care workers is and state of the art care is readily available france does n't just have great free health care where doctors make house calls in cute little vehicles , but workers get disability pay , weeks and weeks of vacation , months and months of maternity leave , and the government sends out free nannies to do your laundry and cook dinner why would anyone live here if they could live there ? and do n't worry about physician reimbursements with national health insurance the french doctor drives an audi and lives in a million dollar home so what did i think ? gosh , it was nice of rach to ask ! i guess i thought the story was one sided it sounded like no one in the us , even the well insured , is happy and everyone is screwed by the health insurance companies who are digging into every last health record to deny the last surgical claim because the insured did n't reveal that once upon a time they 'd had a yeast infection it 's not hard to find unbelievable health care stories , and mr moore did n't seem to have any trouble trumping them up i 've heard them too none involving dead children , but i 've also heard people say their illnesses were completely covered without any battles , and that part of the story was not mentioned sicko was engrossing , entertaining even , thought provoking , rage provoking , and there were several laugh out loud moments michael moore is nothing if not clever is socialized medicine the answer ? to read dr crippen 's nhs blog or shiny happy person 's rendition of life working in the nhs , there 's another story to be told my opinion would be a random one i 've no experience in this arena , and i 'd love to hear from our readers in canada , great britain , france , cuba , and guantanamo bay we all know the system 's broken i hope michael moore 's sensationalized presentation will help to change things for the record , psychiatry was totally ignored in sicko one ground zero hero had ptsd , but this was presented as a dental problem he ground his teeth maybe in mr moore 's next movie ?
