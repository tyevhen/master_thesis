i wrote this the other day but forgot to post it , so forgive any redundancy at the mention of depression or the anachronistic reference to a lack of comments ce the rainy season has begun , and here in coastal northern california , once it begins it seems never to end it is the price we pay for redwoods and berries and mushrooms and all the lush vegetation that surrounds us in this emerald paradise but you do n't want to move here it 's much to damp and drizzly and the economy sucks and we locals treat tourists like lepers actually our economy depends on them to come clean , i have been in a bit of a depressive relapse since thanksgiving , when i took a medication for pain for the trip to sf , a medication i know presents risks as soon as i go off of it my brain screams do n't take it ! my back urges , how can you drive four hours without it ? truly my brain must win this argument , since the pain in my back ca n't compare with emotional pain strangely , though , when i now become tearful at my usual times , am and pm , i think of rachel the sadness comes first i am convinced the affect precedes the thought but now , at least , i have a focus that feels healthier she was my heart she broke my heart in life she shattered my heart in death i apologize to any who feel i sometimes ask too much of the reader , for some feeling of connection , usually when i reveal something extremely personal i must remind myself that the medium of writing renders things impersonal the writing is the show and the audience is the reader , and if it 's a good show you do n't think about the writer , you just enjoy the show that 's good writing in a nutshell eliot was partially right about this , how the personality must get out of the way for poetry in confessional prose , the act of writing does change the personality into a persona it is unavoidable how i come across in the meat world is far different if my mood is euthymic i tend to be a gregarious clown , something you might not guess from my writings i suppose what i most prize in writing , besides clarity and substance , is the virtual disappearance of the writer often we run into heavy handed exposure of the writer , even in fiction , if the writer is not careful mailer and thompson come to mind one example of great writing is that no one really knows squat about shakespeare from his plays his sonnets are the only real record he gave us , and even they are somewhat stylized to please a patron the meaning of patron of the arts has changed over the years it used to mean the one guy you worked for to amuse , the same guy who paid you you had to amuse him , and if he liked your stuff and paid for its printing , it added to the patron 's reputation now patron of the arts seems a generic term for people who attend opera and donate now and then in place of the old patronage system we have the grant system , where committees weight the investment of a foundation 's money it 's not easy to get patronage in either case , but it sure would be nice to know for whom you 're writing shakespeare was lucky in this regard his audience was made up of all society 's classes all art is for someone initially for the artist , then for an audience , then for the critics in my best writing , of course , an audience is never a consideration it is all about the writing if publication follows i feel slightly vindicated in my own judgment , but that is more frosting on the cake than the labor of the cake in view of the above , when i complain about a lack of comments , i deserve the criticism i get writing that does not objectify the writer into a voice may rightly be attacked by those who are repelled by the writer 's personality and actions in the real world thine at kilorats , ce
