in the comment section of my post how do you switch docs ? readers moviedoc and kate have been having their own discussion perhaps to be called the blog within the blog ? about the virtues , or lack thereof , of psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy i 've been staying out of it i'm not a psychoanalyst and i 've never been in psychoanalysis my sense is that since psychoanalysis is so specialized and done by so few , and takes so much time and money , that in today 's world , the contribution is more one of technique and assumptions that flavor most psychotherapies things like that the idea that there exists an unconscious mind , or that feelings that were part of past important relationships might surface in current relationships , including the one the patient has with the doctor what role all this has in the treatment of mental illness seems to depend on the patient and the doctor some people find it very helpful to look at their lives and their illness and their problems as part of a continuum , and even those that do n't , often find great solace in the therapeutic relationship there is something so lonely about being mentally sick , and something so comforting about having someone to talk to about the pain without the judgments or fears that go into ordinary conversations that said , psychiatrist richard friedman was kind enough to talk about the role of insight in treatment today in the new york times i feel like he really meant to chime in with moviedoc and kate in our comment section , but i guess he lost his way and ended up in new york instead in does insight in therapy equal happiness ? dr friedman writes psychoanalysts and other therapists have argued for years about this question , which gets to the heart of how therapy works when it does to relieve psychological distress theoretical debates have not settled the question , but one interesting clue about the possible relevance of insight comes from comparative studies of different types of psychotherapy only some of which emphasize insight in fact , when two different types of psychotherapies have been directly compared and there are more than such studies it has often been hard to find any differences between them researchers aptly call this phenomenon the dodo effect , referring to the dodo bird in lewis carroll s alice in wonderland who , having presided over a most whimsical race , pronounces everyone a winner the meaning for patients is clear if you re depressed , for example , you are likely to feel better whether your therapist uses a cognitive behavioral approach , which aims to correct distorted thoughts and feelings , or an insight oriented psychodynamic therapy since the common ingredient in all therapies is not insight , but a nonspecific human bond with your therapist , it seems fair to say that insight is neither necessary nor sufficient to feeling better
