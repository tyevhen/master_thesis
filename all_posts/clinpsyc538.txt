apparently , the british press has decided that a study showing equivalent efficacy between first and second generation antipsychotic meds is worthy of discussion a few weeks about seven weeks , actually after the publication of the study the american media nowhere to be found , of course , with the possible exception of the new york times over at furious seasons , you ll find a good synopsis of some of the larger issues surrounding atypicals i believe many readers will find his points of interest teaser below this is now the third study in about a year to knockdown the prevailing orthodoxy that atypicals reduce symptoms better than first generation antipsychotics and that the atypicals are so kinder and gentler with the side effects i have discussed the catie study here and here all of these studies combined raise serious questions here are a few why do pharma companies continue to charge anywhere from to times as much for atypicals as they do for older antipsychotics ? because they can and no one will question them on it why do doctors continue to insist , in the face of compelling data , that atypicals are great ? because they can and no one will question them on it why did nami national put out a press release and organize a teleconference for reporters soon after this archives of general psychiatry study called the status of atypicals into account ? because they can and no one will question them on it and , nami national gets a lot of money each year from pharma companies any connection ? why have these same atypicals suddenly become frontline treatments in treating bipolar disorder , despite a profound lack of independent evidence showing that these meds are good for schizophrenics and that those poor folks can barely tolerate taking them ? why would they suddenly become so good for bipolars ? hell , they do n't even reduce re hospitalization rates compared to only taking a mood stabilizer bipolars do n't particularly fancy these meds , either , as i pointed out last year why are we now giving them to children ? why are their parents going along for the ride ? for much more , interested readers should take a hike over to the post at furious seasons for my take on the cutlass study , feel free to read here
