yesterday i had a taste of recovery i did activities that make me anxious but pushed forward through them if someone interrupted me , i continued on if i felt like starting over , i did n't when my mind was cloudy and my vision blurry , i told myself that was ok and here and there , i started to have some clarity some glimpses of what it would be like without all this anxiety i got a lot done yesterday , and i feel good about that if my anxiety impaired my performance , then oh well ! i did the best that i could even though i was anxious yesterday , i know i made progress , and that was a great way to start the weekend !
