the race is on to find a school counseling job this is the time of year that i get dozens of inquiries from teachers who want to move over into the counseling field , from students who are graduating in the spring , and from counselors in other schools who want to know if i am aware of any job openings with all the requests for information and job tips , i decided to write a post for those in the market for the best job in the world ! ! ! my journey into school counseling before becoming a school counselor , i was a high school history teacher in fact when i interviewed for my first teaching job , i think i had the quickest interview in the world the reason for such a quick interview was because i knew the high school principal really well hint he was my principal when i was a student in reality , i truly never had an official interview nor did i have to write a resume or conduct the traditional job search however , after nine years in the classroom , i decided to leave my position for the world of school counseling what i thought would be an easy transition was not so simple ! ! my search for a school counseling position was a four year process after failing to find a job in my school or neighboring schools , i decided to widen my search i combed school websites , i talked to my professors , i talked to any school counselor i could find , and i even visited schools leaving my resume' i could find nothing ! ! it was time to back up and rethink my plan to find a school counseling job feeling discouraged , my dear grandmother decided to give me a piece of advice she told me that if i wanted to get a counseling job that first i had to get my foot in the door now , being a twenty something year old gen xer , i did not want to hear that i would have to work my way into the position however , at this point , what other alternative did i have ! ? so , my journey continued i got my foot in the door ! my next step was to fill out as many applications as possible no matter what level , what school , or what area i really wanted a high school counseling position , but i knew that i was probably not going to get that coveted position finally , i received two calls yes ! ! one call was from a high school in the suburbs and the other from a rural elementary school ahead of my interviews , i sent my resume to the principals , bought a brand new business suit , and researched the school districts the interviews came and went with me waiting for a call i found myself hoping that the high school principal would call and tell me that he had a job waiting for me however , a letter arrived in the mail from that principal thanking me for my interview you know what that means was this going to be another dead end ? then , several weeks later , the principal from the elementary school called and offered me a job , but there was one catch the position would be a part time elementary school counselor and part time middle school in school suspension coordinator say what ? ? ? ? so , i decided , based on my grandmother 's advice to take the position at the elementary school to get some much needed experience the following year i was able to interview again with the high school and i got the job ! thinking about my own job hunting experience , i decided to ask to former interns and co workers about their job search to see if there are similarities in our situations former intern job search years and counting one of my former interns told me that finding a counseling position has not been easy although she does not have a counseling position at this time , she is now working in the school that she wants to be a school counselor when i asked her what helped her get into the school that she wants to work , she told me that forming relationships with school staff by volunteering and accepting a non counseling position helped her get closer to her goal of becoming a school counselor former intern job search years her advice to me is to get your foot in the door by accepting any available position before becoming an elementary counselor , she worked as a clerical assistant co worker job search years one of my co workers informed me that she had been searching for a job in school counseling without any luck not able to get a school counseling position , she decided to become certified to teach spanish until she could ascertain a position i am glad to report that she just got offered a school counseling position in a middle school ! ! co worker job search years my co worker is currently a special education teacher who has been great about helping in the counseling office as much as possible her theory , and a good one , is that we will be familiar with her work which she believes will help her become a frontrunner if we have an open position in our department co worker and current counselor in our school job search years he gave me a good tip when he told me that having the ability to coach a sport is a big plus when applying for any job in education present intern currently in graduate school my present intern and i spoke about her impending job search i asked her what advice she has been given by her professors when looking for a job here is what she told me visit job fairs and share your resume' create a portfolio of lesson plans and be prepared to teach one at the interview i looked at her strangely about teaching a lesson be prepared for the interview in addition to speaking to co workers and interns , i also included some great tips from some of the hottest school counseling blogs on the web here are some of their suggestions when looking for a school counseling position danielle schultz , author of the school counseling blog , has a great post from about finding a school counseling job for graduate students make connections ! ! ! always have a business card on hand danielle uses vistaprint which i love as well ! they have a great price when ordering large numbers of business cards i order all my department 's business cards from here each year do your homework and learn about the district and school you want to work in danielle suggests going to national center for education statistics for that information ask questions in your interview here are some sample questions what is the major role responsibilities of the school counselor ?
