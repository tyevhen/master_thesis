i am a woman of few words today just checking in darkness has descended my thoughts are bleak and feelings dark i have slipped into the black hole that is depression the world swirls around me i cannot connect i cannot step in i cannot stop the free fall kicking and screaming have long since left me i have not the energy for that instead , i fall without fight it 's dark very , very dark
