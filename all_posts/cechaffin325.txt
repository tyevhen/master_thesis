short answer not very but i should add the biblical story about when david decided to number the troops of israel on god 's part it was considered an act of pride , of trusting in someone beside the lord by measuring one 's own strength afterwards god gave david three choices for punishment , of which he wisely chose plague , the most easily blamed on god for political reasons so if this post results in reduced visits , so be it i can accept god 's judgment in modern cyberspace just at easily , though i do n't think it would apply , since this is no righteous enterprise endorsed by god , unlike the surety of suicide bombers i started a stats tracker eight months ago we just reached , hits i say we for obvious reasons in terms of universal knowledge exchange , it 's very much mom and pop , you and me baby here this projects to , visitors a year , and i do n't know how to decipher unique visits maybe someone can explain to me how different domains and ip addresses sorts out in this regard if i should ever rise to the level of a celebrity , i promise to remember everyone i stepped on to get there , and the imprint of my size shoe on their dented spines my real feeling about unique visitors is that most of you are retreads , because once the reader has tasted of my unique vision , he is forced to return either to confirm my insanity or marvel at it i can be addictive then there is a whole group of those misdirected by google , as in my mention of therapy above when therapy is combined with david 's dilemma in the bible , it guarantees i will now be visited by puzzled fundamentalists asking god 's permission to see a psychologist how the web works ! strange how much that sounds like wet works , a term all you sopranos fans have long since mastered i wo n't bore you with page views the current average is visitors day , inflated , i think , by the current debate and my recent resignation from contemporary poetry day is more realistic i am truly grateful to you , the readers , for making my solitary existence less pointless , though naturally protected behind the gates of cyberspace , as few of you know me as a meat person but i am open to meet anyone who reads me in meat space that is preferable in my mind except for kathleen , none of my immediate family reads this thing but i know if i dwelt more upon the foibles of my siblings and children , chance would have it that one would alert the others until i am roundly crucified there are some places i dare not go but if you are a close relative and reading this , please let me know , and i promise my christmas card wo n't be late this year still , day is more than a standard high school classroom , and not a compulsory audience so even if a few are entertained , i'm happy the irony is that when i edited and published the melic review , with all its awards and pulitzer winners and la di da if i can speak of a magazine in the magisterial we , we got less hits overall excepting the poetry board , which was , of course , instant publication for the literarily impaired that was the big fish that pulled melic , not the other way around but back to life 's basics we kathleen and i , not the magisterial we hit the road on saturday , june , and i played a brief gig at the benbow lake festival in humboldt county , where i was essentially ignored due to the engineer 's bad miking of my guitar and the next band 's bassist playing too loudly in warming up behind meanwhile kathleen had an allergic reaction to something in the grass , we think , and i do n't mean the inhaled kind though that is always a possibility at such affairs so she became miserable with systemic itching afterwards we were ripped off by a motel posing as a hotel through orbitz , a service i now roundly condemn for the wallet impaired and whether my chronic back pain , the chief reason for my disability in practicing medicine , was increased by the drive or packing or loading i do n't know suffice it to say we were both miserable when arrived to house sit at my sister 's in burlingame if i have to be in this kind of pain for the rest of my life , i am happy kevorkian was just released from jail happily , pain tends to improve over time , though the waiting is often fatal no comments on the love poem i last posted oh well as an ex poet i will try again with another poem ce wrote when he thought he was a poet we need something to break the reader 's granite heart is the theory of contemporary poetry so much more interesting than the same , same , same bleating of the human heart , already known in all conditions so that it takes a miracle of style to render anything fresh ? if the human heart has not changed , and it has not , how have homer and dante and shakespeare maintained their hold on us ? because they are poets there 's the rub aye , if the poems i post as an ex poet do not elicit comment , it confirms my suspicion that ce was never a poet he 's not asking for comments their lack confirms his suspicions , thus he rejoices in his failure here 's today 's verse , as i cannot anymore call what ce wrote poetry , though love remains , however poorly communicated handfast if i said i would disembowel myself in public for one last benison from your sea green eyes or clean the augean stables with a toothbrush to touch your white vase , what does it mean ? what does it mean to say , without you i am not , when i was here before you and content ? you make me a blushing boy , an adolescent feigning diffidence while desperate for a kiss , an old man begging forgiveness of his only daughter i would be closer than the lace that ivys your hips , seal all your skin with my marauding tongue it is a delicious irony , this blurring of borders in two so strong would you rather we sat in citadels and sent ambassadors ? it is obvious ce thought he could write something fresh about love the silence that follows that is , lack of comment reminds me of the silence in heaven in the book of revelation , when nothing is really happening remember that god was the first to take a sabbatical ex poet craig erick accepts that judgment if nothing is happening , not even the angels can gossip about it thine , craig erick
