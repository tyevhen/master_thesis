i'm feeling so low yet i cannot cry where do the tears go ? they 've apparently disappeared with the rest of my soul into the deep darkness , which has yet to abate in fact , i'm darker and the darkness is deeper i'm feeling sad , so sad i 've reached a point where i feel tearful , without energy , and alone all the time i'm numb , yet i hurt it 's a deep , dark ache in the middle of my soul my heart feels heavy , like a leaden weight in the middle of my chest it does n't beat it just hangs there heavy and low i'm numb , yet i hurt i'm so numb i ca n't even cry though my body wants to stream it all away , no tears will come where do the tears go ? tears seem insufficient anyway i crave oblivion drinking , drugs , food , sleep name your poison , anything to drive out the pain i crave whatever will take me there , and it 's a scary place to be oblivion seems the only way it 's been quite awhile since i 've felt this way scared craving oblivion it 's harder and harder to hang onto the temporary nature of pain they say it will pass they are not here , within , experiencing the despair the light at the end of the tunnel has grown frightfully dim
