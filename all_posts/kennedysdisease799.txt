the greek philosopher , heraclitus , said , change is the only constant in life he felt things are always changing , and we need to plan for and be ready for it when it happens my wife goes crazy this time of year decorating the house and , i love it she is so creative the house comes alive with the spirit that is christmas interestingly , she is never quite satisfied with what she does often , in a day or two , things are moved or rearranged in such a way that it is new again this year , she has gone over the top there will be nineteen of us here for christmas i know the last few days will be stressful for her as she prepares the meal , but right now , she is still rearranging things it draws an analogy to what happens to those of us living with kennedy s disease we find ourselves constantly changing how we do things to accommodate our current capabilities and , since kd is a slowly progressing disorder , we never seem to run out of opportunities for change what worked last year , no longer accomplishes the task what currently works , might not work in a year or two , so we had better be looking for ways to adapt there are some blessings to be derived from this we cannot afford to become lazy or complacent we must constantly explore opportunities and find other ways to accomplish things in some ways , it is the gift that keeps on giving from one early adapter to another , i wish you a safe , healthy happy holidays photo ancient history encyclopedia
