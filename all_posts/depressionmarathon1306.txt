it has been on my mind earlier this week there was the jk rowling article and hate filled responses that set me off disturbing and cold tonight , i am going to a documentary movie entitled , for the bible tells me so , about parents in faith based families and their responses after learning one of their children is gay gay and lesbian teens are at extremely high risk of suicide they are to times more likely to complete suicide , and for every completed suicide there are gay and lesbian teens who make an attempt ! finally , i just came from reading untreatable 's blog his two most recent posts are about suicide i am going to attempt to include the same video clip he had in one of his posts because it was so powerful it is the trailer from a documentary called , the bridge , which documents jumpers from the golden gate bridge in san francisco and includes interviews with families and friends in an attempt to understand their suicides i have not seen it , but i will http www youtube com watch ? v zwl pa qtm why ? that 's what you 're asking , right ? why would you want to watch that ? because i 've been there except instead of a bridge , i was on a cliff my toes hanging over the edge stirred loose pebbles and sent them tumbling straight down i was , i think i do n't know how long i stood there it felt like forever the wind whipped against my face the waves crashed against the rocks below , but i do n't remember any sound i was frightened i was relieved sitting here today , i can feel my body standing there , two or three times leaning forward ready , going closing my eyes , opening them again there was no sound it was time , although this was n't what i had planned and that , perhaps , is one of the only reasons i did n't go this was n't the plan the plan 's final was still a couple weeks away , and i had n't finished everything yet but the opportunity was here , now i loved this place , and it felt so right , so okay leaned forward once again cold , carrying wind warm , penetrating sun silence peace closed my eyes pebbles tumbled anew voices ! damn ! kids kids below boys on the rocks where the hell did they come from ? ca n't jump now , i might hit one of them damn did they see me ? sit down hug my knees cry the wind is cold the waves are loud cry , cry , cry at least two more weeks of pain it was years later , maybe years later , when i learned one of those kids was my youngest brother he and his friends thought i was going to jump , he said it was n't until adult depression wrapped me in its suicidal grasp that he told me this my brother was one of those kids thank god i did n't jump related post a birthday of sorts
