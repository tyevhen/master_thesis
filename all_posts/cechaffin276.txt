i did n't believe in black friday i thought only lemmings did what the papers say we 'll do so i drove to circuit city in the early afternoon to buy a computer i picked out weeks ahead , though the significant outlay may render our christmas commercially skimpy call it a victoria 's secret christmas when i arrived at circuit city what did i find but a parking lot full of mad lemmings ! i went down a parking aisle two cars stopped in front of me , three locked in behind me , and we began to wait for some blue hair in a cadillac to back out of her space i freaked i ca n't do this ! as soon as could , i extricated myself from that consumer madhouse to breathe freely again on the blessed freeway i did not go near a store entrance afterwards i said to my sister i ca n't believe that people actually behave the way retailers want them to , like sheep to fodder ! she stared at me as if i were a kindergartner hey , i was never very good with practical reality like most fools i assumed others were like me no others were in line at best buy by am later , driving home from the bay area , i stopped at the circuit city in santa rosa in the late afternoon no rush , no hassle , instant service , they had it in stock , i got my rebate it went like clockwork until i got my new acer aspire home only to discover it had vista but no word program ! all my former documents were now useless ! the ecstasy of my new purchase had been plunged into the agony of its uselessness mr gates wants for microsoft office and i ca n't spend any more right now so keep those cards and bootlegs coming what 's funny is that i did not discover the fact until i was deep into the information transfer protocol talk about stupid ! why wo n't my documents open ? word pad , which was included , did open them but lost all their formatting i plead stupid to buy a computer loaded with vista but not word never occurred to this little trout brain of mine i should have bought a new brain kathleen had also purchased new sheets at a costco nearby , but while drying them somehow a pen burst and spotted everything , including my stepson 's clothes now i call him dalmation boy perhaps spotted dog , that famous greasy english pudding of the o'brien novels , might suit him better kathleen also purchased another layer of memory foam to add to our present layer unfortunately the increased foam makes us sink towards the middle of the bed even faster the very thing she sought to prevent it 's simple physics i weigh , she weighs at least lbs less i make a deeper hole in the memory foam , she rolls into it he who digs a pit will fall into it , wrote solomon he should have added and his bedmate , too what a pisser ! new sheets stained , new mattress addition worthless , new computer impossible to use no matter there 's a super low tide for abalone picking today and kathleen also wants me to gather wild mushrooms for her pot roast , which i am more than happy to do to obtain mushrooms for a pot roast is much more tangibly satisfying than fooling with software and mushrooms are fungible whereas computer files are not another perfect day ! kilobunnies , ce
