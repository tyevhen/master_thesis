ju jit su also ju jut su or jiu jit su or jiu jut su j jtsn an art of weaponless self defense developed in japan that uses throws , holds , and blows and derives added power from the attacker 's own weight and strength i hesitated to use this phrase because i never want to think of parenting as a fight or combat so please take that picture out of your head instead i want to focus on rolling with it that is what ju jitsu does our youngest is taking mixed martial arts it uses kick boxing , jujitsu and wrestling i think anyway , ju jitsu rolls with the other person force or momentum to gain advantage there are times when our children 's fears are so strong that they will not let go of certain behaviors here is an example every night teddy walks into the kitchen while i am fixing dinner he seems to pick that moment when things are done at once , the phone is ringing and the dog wants out at that moment he says what 's for dinner ? i know i know this sounds so petty you have to realize this child rarely speaks to me but he picks this moment every evening to ask me this same question he is years old , so can pretty clearly see what is being prepared for a long time i just answered this seems to be not only reinforcing the question , timing and persistence , but then he stands there and stares at me i can get exasperated it is easy to read way to much into his actions why is he picking that moment when it gets most hectic to come in and ask ? probably because that is when i'm making the most noise , dinner is almost done so smells good hopefully and he 's hungry he does n't take hunger well and it brings up fear for him he still says i'm hungry in a the voice of a very young child with a look on his face that says why are you doing this to me ? so i need to start rolling with it teddy , would you like to come in and stir the ? i need to start getting him involved we need to focus on building relationships with our children and not focus on being irritated or annoyed so look for what irritations repeat themselves with your child and ask how can i roll with it ? use it to bring you closer and to build i know this sounds like rad parenting , but some of us are slow learners be patient with me have a healing weekend
