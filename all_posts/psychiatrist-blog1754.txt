ok , in all fairness i need to post about this after all , we had a small catfight in shrink rap land over the issue of sheppard pratt 's retreat program now it 's my turn to eat my words let others rage as they may , i promise to shut up and take it this just in from the new york times booking a cell in a star jail apparently orange county has a number of facilities where selected inmates can pay anywhere from to dollars a day , in advance , to be housed in a nice clean safe single cell facility where they are allowed to have cell phones and or computers and where people can bring them hot meals dinah , have i got a jail for you inmates are allowed to leave during the day to work but are required to have small jobs within the jail to keep the place clean proceeds from the pay in advance upgrade program go to underwrite the costs of other county facilities so what do i think ? i think it 's a win win for both sides it spares the custody staff from having to protect high profile defendants from the general population of gang members and it provides indirect benefit to the general population is it discriminatory ? sure but if they were in gen pop they 'd also be discriminated against by the inmates themselves or for the truy adventurous , you can stay in the ottawa jail hostel for those who believe a jail should be a hostel environment
