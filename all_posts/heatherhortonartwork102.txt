art is contemplation it is the pleasure of the mind which searches into nature and which there divines the spirit of which nature herself is animated auguste rodin laura , natural , , oil on panel , x is a quiet little study of light and how it plays upon skin it is a study of contemplation , and an exercise in simplicity laura has great eyes , and i wanted to try to capture their full reflection here there is a limited palette , which is intentional i am working on another little painting the same size to sort of work as a pair with this piece , a compliment to it i suppose this painting is filled with natural light i simplified the background by omitting laura 's shower , which was distracting to the composition her bathroom is a very neutral , muted grey green colour , which worked well against her skin tones in my painting i try to emphasize brushwork this is probably why wood panel appeals to me it is wonderfully unforgiving , and leaves the brush and paint to do their job , unobstructed by the give that can happen when you paint on canvas there is a weave to canvas that i always see beneath the paint i do n't paint very thickly usually , nor do i gesso until the weave is gone , so the underlying canvas usually it can be detected upon close inspection panel solves this problem and while sometimes the texture of the gesso can be seen , the paint has fewer places to hide some artists render their work in a very fine manner , with blending on canvas , scumbling , hatching or otherwise reducing the visibility of the brush strokes this is fine and beautiful and i enjoy looking at paintings rendered this way , but half the fun for me is capturing something from a planar perspective it is hard because you do n't want to make something look too blocky , too stilted and cold it is a paradox is n't it ? to paint something simply and with a rather chunky application yet to try to convey the softness of flesh at the same time what is she thinking about ? as usual i do not provide answers because really , we all have an answer within ourselves it is all relative i was talking with a friend awhile ago too about how as we look upon paintings at different times , the connotation changes according to our circumstances , what is happening within our own lives at that time i am on my tenth painting for the newfoundland show , which i have provided details about below in a way it as though i am experiencing the journey for a second time , revisiting these special people i met , and the gorgeous places i went i can see why newfoundland casts a spell over people incidentally , newfoundland and labrador 's official tourism website has linked to my blog i have provided the link here i was quite touched that they deemed my writing worthy of inclusion on their site here is some information on the exhibition in november of i hope to see you there ! newfoundland portraits november nd , abbozzo gallery , oakville , ontario opening reception november th , pm the ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival aristotle
