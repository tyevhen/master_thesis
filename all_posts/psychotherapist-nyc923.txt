do you often find yourself in situations where you said yes where you wish you had said no ? do you feel you would be rude or unkind if you turned down other people 's requests ? are you able to say no in certain situations , but then feel you have to apologize or say something like , i hope that 's okay because you 're afraid that people wo n't like you if you say no ? problems with assertiveness do you avoid taking calls from certain friends or family members when you know they 're calling to ask a favor of you that you know you either ca n't or do n't want to do ? do you agree to do certain things for people and then seethe silently with anger and resentment ? if you answered yes to any of the above questions , more than likely , you 're having problems asserting yourself enough to be able to say no many people have problems saying no they feel uncomfortable and think it would be either too hurtful to the other person or they worry that if they say no , they 'll be seen as mean or uncaring they often lack the self confidence to feel they are entitled to say no they will often go to great lengths to accommodate others to the detriment of their own health and well being under certain circumstances , if they know that someone is about to ask them to do something that they really do n't want to do , they might avoid that person , which causes other problems when that person feels ignored although both men and women have this problem , it tends to come up more with women women are often raised to feel that they must accommodate others , no matter what the consequences are for themselves in our society , women are also seen as the nurturers , caregivers , and encouraged to be people pleasers , so there 's often pressure to take care of other people 's requests and problems here are some typical examples of situations where people have problems asserting themselves enough to say no see if you can identify with any of them scenario mary is the second oldest adult child in a family of five children she 's also the oldest daughter she and her brothers and sisters live about the same distance away from their aging parents whenever her parents need help , they call mary whether it 's a matter of taking them to doctor 's appointments , grocery shopping , helping them to set up their computer , whatever they need help with , they expect mary to help them their way of thinking is that she 's the oldest daughter and this is her role mary loves her parents very much , but she 's often exhausted after a week of working full time and , as a single mom , taking care of her teenage children she never turns down any of her parents' requests , but lately she 's been feeling irritable and resentful whenever they call she feels too guilty to say no or to ask her brothers and sisters to pitch in , so she seethes in anger instead lately , she 's been having tension headaches , and during her last doctor 's visit , her doctor warned her that her blood pressure was a little high and she needs to reduce her stress she knows she needs to find a way to change the dynamic with her parents , but she does n't know how scenario bob and dan are colleagues in the same company over the years , they have become friends bob enjoys dan 's company and they and their wives often socialize on the weekends over the last few years , dan has borrowed a few hundred dollars from bob , but he has n't paid him back initially , dan was apologetic and said he would pay bob back , but lately dan has not mentioned the money at all bob is annoyed about this , but he tells himself that dan has had several unexpected financial setbacks , so he does n't want to ask him for the money but bob 's wife recently lost her job and now they 're trying to get by on just one salary until she can find a new job finances have been tight they 've had to cut back on certain expenses , like sending their daughter to the dance classes that she loved lately , bob 's wife has been pressuring him to ask dan for the money he owes them but bob feels that if he asks dan for the money , he would n't be a good friend then , one afternoon , dan leaves bob a familiar voicemail message at work , i'm in a jam i need to talk to you can we have lunch ? bob recognizes the familiar words and tone as a sign that dan wants to borrow more money rather than calling him back , bob avoids dan for the next few days because he does n't know how he can say no to dan 's request , but he also knows that he ca n't afford to lend him any more money so , he does n't know what to do scenario nancy is a writer and she works from home she loves her work and she has been getting more frequent and interesting assignments lately from her editor nancy knows this is a sign that her editor really likes her work and she is progressing in her career she wants to continue to do well so she can get more of these types of projects these interesting assignment also come with more stringent deadlines she 's disciplined about how she does her work at home and she has never missed a deadline yet her latest assignment has been the most exciting one so far she knows it will be a challenge to get the piece to her editor on time , but she thinks she can do it if she stays focused however , the problem lately is that she has an elderly next door neighbor who lives alone and who is lonely she likes to drop by nancy 's apartment to chat nancy likes her neighbor very much and also feels sorry for her because her children never come to visit her sometimes , when she 's coming up against a deadline , nancy feels irritated when her neighbor rings her bell most of the time , nancy lets her in and hopes that she wo n't stay too long but lately , the elderly neighbor 's visits have really been interfering with nancy 's work and she 's afraid that she 's going to miss her deadline for this new project she does n't want to hurt the neighbor 's feelings , but she ca n't miss her deadline she does n't know what to do scenario alice has a stressful full time job she and her husband are also raising three young children who are in elementary school alice is also involved in the pta and other local community groups lately , several colleagues have been laid off at work , so alice has been asked to take on additional work assignments by the end of the day , after helping her children with their homework and putting them to bed , she 's exhausted now that alice is working longer hours , her husband has taken on additional household duties , including cooking , picking up the children from school , doing the laundry and grocery shopping they have a good marriage , and he has always shared in household responsibilities he 's also working extra hours at work due to company cutbacks so , they 're both stretched to the max one day , alice receives a call from the pta president , who tells alice that she found out the school will be cutting out several after school activities these are activities that parents and children have come to rely on the pta president is worried and upset about this she has received numerous calls from parents who do n't know what they 'll do if these programs are cut she tells alice that , in addition to what alice normally does for the pta , she needs extra help over the next four weekends from alice for a fund raising event so they can raise the money to save these programs inwardly , alice cringes because she does n't know where she 'll find the time , but she 's caught off guard and she says yes after alice hangs up the phone , she feels annoyed with herself for taking on this extra work she also does n't know how she 'll tell her husband , who would have to take on even more responsibilities over the next few weekends because of this new commitment that she has made to the pta president she does n't know what to do do any of these scenarios sound familiar to you or can you see yourself in similar predicaments ? can you think of other ways that each of these people can handle their situations where they do n't have to compromise themselves or those close to them and where they can tactfully say no ? fortunately , saying no in a tactful way is a skill that can be learned if you have problems asserting yourself in similar situations , there are certain things that you can do to learn to be more assertive talk to a trusted friend and ask him or her to do role plays with you where you can practice standing up for yourself as a start , you can use the scenarios presented above and also come up with some of your own that are relevant to your life so , for instance in scenario , you can practice how you can speak to your brothers and sisters to ask them to share in the responsibilities of helping your parents you can also practice with your friend how you would talk to your parents to tell them that , while you want to help out , you ca n't always be available and explain the reasons why in scenario , you can practice telling your friend and colleague , dan , that while you empathize with his financial problems , you 're also having financial problems so , you ca n't lend him any more money and you and he need to work out a payment plan for the money that he currently owes you in scenario , you can practice talking to your friend as if she were the elderly neighbor and tell her that , while you enjoy her company , there are times when you ca n't socialize with her because you have work deadlines that must be met suggest other times when you can get together to chat in scenario , you can practice taking the time to think about what you 'd say to the pta president before automatically saying yes and then regretting it since the person in this scenario was caught off guard , you can practice a certain technique that will give you time to think when you 're caught off guard this technique is restating the president 's request in a tactful way so , let me make sure i understand what you 're asking you 're asking me if i can spend about five hours each weekend working on the fund raiser ? is that right ? this gives you time to think of a tactful answer after your friend , in the role as pta president , restates her request , you can practice telling her that you ca n't help out this time because you 're already over extended at home and at work you can also practice stating what you can and ca n't do you can also practice from the standpoint of having said yes initially and then calling back the same day and telling her that you 've thought about it and regret that you ca n't do it this not an ideal way to handle this type of situation most of us like to honor our commitments most of the time we feel that once we 've committed ourselves that we want to be true to our word while i'm not advocating that you go back on your word on a regular basis , there might be certain times when you realize that it 's going to be impossible for you to fulfill your commitment of course , it would have been better not to have made the commitment at all but sometimes we make mistakes and we have to learn , when the circumstances are not dire , how to handle these types of situations without feeling completely stuck practice asserting yourself by saying no in real life situations that are not so emotionally charged for you for instance , if you normally accept every leaflet that people are handing out in your neighborhood , whether you 're interested or not , because you feel sorry for the person giving out the leaflets , practice saying no thanks in a tactful way or if you have a hard time getting telemarketers off the phone , practice saying thank you , but i'm really not interested i would appreciate if you would take me off your list practice writing down in advance what you want to say before you say it so , if you have to call a friend to turn down her request , write down what you want to say to her of course , you 're not going to read it to her , but it 's helpful to have the words in front of you if you begin to stumble on the phone if you still have a hard time asserting yourself so you can say no or you have difficulty setting healthy boundaries with the people in your life , there might be other underlying emotional issues that practicing might not resolve in that case , you could benefit from dealing with these issues in psychotherapy if you have a hard time asserting yourself , you 're not alone this is a common problem that many people have it 's important for you to know that you do n't need to suffer in silence and , remember that there 's a big difference between being assertive and being aggressive being assertive being assertive and standing up for yourself does n't mean you 're being aggressive and , you can learn to develop the self confidence to become more assertive being assertive i'm a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i have helped many clients to learn to assert themselves in healthy ways to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , please call me at top photo credit spaceodissey via photopin cc bottom photo credit ss ss via photopin cc
