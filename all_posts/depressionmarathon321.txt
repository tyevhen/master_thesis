i'm struggling with what to write here today i do n't have anything new or interesting to report life is slowly moving forward i say slowly because i 've been bored thus far this week i have not worked since last wednesday , and that was only for a couple of hours and i'm not scheduled to work the rest of the week either things are slow at the rehab facility and at the hospital , so there has been no need for extra help while working did make me anxious , it was better than sitting home when i'm feeling well enough to be working i 'd much rather be dealing with my anxiety today that being said , i have been running as scheduled , going to meetings , and catching up on a bit more housework my energy has been better , which is another reason i 've been frustrated by not working i 've had plenty of time to nap , but i have n't needed to nap ! go figure i'm not complaining it is what it is , and like everything else , it 's temporary i'm grateful my mood and energy have been better than they were would n't it be nice if that were permanent ? i can hope
