i wanted let my readers know that i'm slightly better since my kilorat nadir on tuesday as i wept at my psychiatrist 's office on wednesday , i told him i wanted off the cymbalta , as i did n't trust it anymore , and that the seroquel , according to kathleen , was making me much worse and it was i asked for an antidepressant combination that helped me ten years ago prozac wellbutrin though at first he did n't agree , he later did , saying that he had to listen to his patients i was empowered by desperation these are the medications i think i should be on having him concede made me feel more in control of my fate i have n't cried since that session i do n't claim to be well , just not as sick i want to be well if jesus were nearby i would outshout the lepers despite my depression , over the last four months i 've had four magazines pay me for poems byline , astropoetica , grasslimb and contrary i had an essay published in umbrella and have another essay coming out later this month in blue fifth review meanwhile sam rasnake whose blog i recommend , link below , editor of blue fifth , has honored me with a broadside an independent feature , so i understand it where a poet reads his poem on audio mine is almost eden , a love poem although an ex poet , i can still send old ones away and however small the check , i can call myself a professional even if i ca n't make a living from it , not by a longshot i'm too tired to write more , but in my next post i hope to tell the tale of the wild cucumber until then , at kilorats , ce
