losing someone is never easy i knew that losing my grandma would be the first time i ever lost someone close to me it hit me hard she passed away earlier this year in january and thinking about her still puts a tear in my eye i miss her months later to today i can finally pull together some of my thoughts of her when the moments are dark , i try to remind myself to be like my grandma she is probably the strongest person i know i learned so much about her when my family put together a slideshow about her life the hardships she went through made me heartbroken , but her strength made me want to be the strongest person i can be sometimes i still ca n't believe she 's gone she was such a big part of my childhood but at the end of the day i know she felt loved by us and lived a long good life it makes me sad that i do n't think about her enough because it is hard to rememeber her still , but moving forward i want to turn her memories into positivity and good that 's what she would want me to do miss you poh poh
