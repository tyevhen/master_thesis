okay , that title is a bit misleading i'm still in therapy , but i 've cut back to every other week rather than every week no big deal , right ? i mean , that 's the point of working with a therapist , to get better and that 's what 's happened i 've improved enough to cut back on therapy so why do i feel so lost ? my sense of loss seems over blown if i had cancer , i 'd be thrilled not to see my doc every week it would mean my illness had improved i guess this is just another difference between mental illness and most other illnesses if any of my other docs were treating me for a chronic condition , i 'd be ecstatic if they told me i did n't need to follow up as often ! while i like all of the healthcare providers i see , the difference between my therapist and the rest of them is the relationship i have relationships with my therapist and my psychiatrist that far exceed the intimacy of the relationships i have with my orthopedic surgeon or allergist , for example my depression has improved primarily because of my relationship with my therapist that 's the irony of getting better , i guess in order to improve , i need a close , trusting , stable relationship but once i do improve , that valued , reliable relationship changes continue to get better , and i lose the relationship all together like i said , cruel irony i 've been seeing my therapist at least weekly for or years she 's been a stable , supportive presence in my life every week , rain or shine , i knew i had that hour to figure things out , let off steam , or get the encouragement i needed my relationships with my psychiatrist and psychologist are a couple of the very few i have where the boundaries and roles are crystal clear i will miss that clean , clear hour every other week seems so small , but that hour of simple , uncomplicated communication holds me all week i'm not sure if it can hold me for two i realize , intellectually , that the decreased need for therapy signals a momentous leap forward in my odyssey with depression i realize that , but it still feels like a loss i also realize going from every week to every other week is hardly something to freak out about , and i'm not freaking out but i feel a loss an ironic , confounding loss i needed to write about this , because i wonder if others have also felt this loss ? i wonder if , like me , others have felt silly and shameful about feeling loss over such a small , and ultimately positive change ? if so , you 're not alone i feel it , too
