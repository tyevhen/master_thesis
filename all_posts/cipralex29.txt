friends , hope you re all still in the game and getting better with each day it s been a while since i last wrote something , been little busy lately it s now day , soon i ll be a year on cipralex it s time to stop for a second and appreciate what happened this year , how things changed , how my way of thinking and looking at things change and it did sure did wow , i m amazed at how easy it is to get use to things , to get use to feeling normal to get use to not get use to think too much about things , and just flow a year ago maybe a little bit less , i was so depressed , lonely and living on the edge , in this daily fear on everything i guess i use to get panic attacks every single day sometimes even couple times a day i wouldn t go out , i would do everything in my power to avoid any social events and meeting new people was a nightmare sometimes even walking down the street was a damn project it s amazing just amazing i can hardly remember how it felt like which is good , very good i now walk the streets , meet and interact with new people , i feel safe i feel i can trust myself i have a beautiful girlfriend , good friends i love my family and most important of all i guess i made peace with myself the improvement and changes i ve going through all this time on cipralex are overwhelming sometimes i use to complicate things too much , think too much and i used to feel like i m not in control i always knew , even back then that i was stuck inside a bubble or maybe a cell , a prison cell which i build for years guess how that makes you feel knowing you put yourself there , knowing your inside a bubble but just can t get out of it i guess it s important for me to stop for a second stop and appreciate myself for doing this for myself i guess this is one of the most important things i ve done for me ever i do not regret my decision to take cipralex it was a hard call to make but i made it and for that i m grateful too things are working out , soon i m meeting my psychiatrist again , see what he have to say he will probably suggest to continue three more months but it doesn t matter , taking cipralex is a very small price to pay for the benefits of rebuilding your life rebuilding yourself btw i can now say that all the side effects are totally gone , so the only hassle is to take the pill once a day i still haven t told anyone about me taking this pill and i m not going to at least not in the near future i know some of you disagree and say its as if i m judging my friends or gf , but i m not i just think that i m not ready for that yet maybe society isn t ready too it s funny yesterday i met my friend new girlfriend sounds silly right ? today it is no big deal i haven t really thought about it much just didn t care a year ago i would think about it so much i get panic attack all day just because i m meeting someone i don t know things change remember that folks , sometimes they change so fast , you don t even notice take care now email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
