i had my last long run prior to next saturday 's grandmas marathon this morning it was only miles , but you could have fooled me ! i had totally dead legs every step was work , and i just wanted to quit i did n't , of course , but i did n't have any fun despite almost ideal running weather i'm really concerned now grandmas is only one week away , and i ca n't seem to shake this fatigue i do n't want to have another difficult race i like grandmas , and i want to enjoy it i almost always have some level of fatigue , but this feels different i feel heavy my muscles are sore and my legs just do n't seem to be responding to training despite tapering for the marathon , running many fewer miles than usual , and running them with less intensity , i'm tired running is difficult and that 's not fun as i mentioned here previously , i 've decided to take a couple of weeks off and get away from training after grandmas i 'll run less and only for fun maybe i wo n't even wear my watch ! that would be an amazing development for me i'm hoping to run some shorter races later this summer i 'd like to mix it up a bit my next marathon is n't until the chicago marathon in october , so i have some time to play before i have to get back to serious training at this point i need the mental break as much as the physical one i'm taking a break this weekend , too besides an easy i hope miler tomorrow , i do n't have anything planned for the rest of the weekend i took advantage of the rainy afternoon and napped today tonight and tomorrow i will just be puttering around the house , relaxing , and getting a few chores done with the exception of running , i do n't even need to leave the house and i may not before long , i 'll be in duluth , minnesota , preparing to run grandmas until then , i'm going to try to take one day at a time and not spend too much time worrying about the race whatever happens will be okay i need to keep reminding myself of that it 's the journey , not the destination right ?
