hi there ! i'm back with another stay at home mom style post i hope you liked the last one you know , i 've been living under a rock to not have noticed the what i wore wednesday posts all around the web playing along with the pleated poppy blogger lindsey she has been inspiring other stay at home moms for a while now encouraging that we document our efforts to try and get dressed and feel good about ourselves while we 're at it i'm going to play along with her on wednesday and link up i hope you 'll join in too ! lots of people link up on her blog so you can tour what lots of other people are wearing it 's fun ! check out the example here on the pleated poppy so , for today 's what i wore wednesday trouser jeans by kut from nordstrom the same as my last style post houndstooth blouse from downeast basics steamboat jacket from downeast basics wedge sandals from aerosoles chunky shell bracelet from a local craft fair all are comfortable the blouse is a soft jersey knit and all are machine washable ! here is what i might have worn before boring and who cares the vest and tshirt are comfortable and machine washable as well , but just do n't look as chic or pulled together i look like i might go gardening or hiking the new outfit has the same sort of elements for fall with a chill in the air without sacrificing a sense of style of course , i end up taking off the jacket when i'm hanging around the house to keep things easy and i'm barefoot once inside too just fyi i need a pedicure by the way please know that i'm not a style maven i do n't even tend to notice what people are wearing out and about i'm too busy picking paige 's boogers off my shoulder to look around i simply got sick of feeling tired and frumpy and sloppy and figure i can put in some effort once in a while for my own sanity , you know ? it does well to remind myself that i am more than a mother and a proud grateful mother i am save
