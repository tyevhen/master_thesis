ginger 's comment below should have been posted as a comment to the last post but something went wrong and it did n't get posted it was such a great comment that i do n't want to lose it so i'm posting it today after reading the comment i was able to make much more sense out of the analogy of the brain as a sponge the internet is a wonderful thing for helping each other thanks ginger for your great contribution i can see r 's analogy of the brain as sponge in that most of us do treat our brains passively , allowing all sorts of negativity to soak in ! without directed thinking we will just absorb whatever comes along the sponge is a helpful image to me , as it illustrates beautifully how passive living can get us in trouble as we merely soak up rather than create , experiences and thoughts a b 's assertion that we need to direct our thinking and life 's path with purpose can also be seen using the visual of a sponge one could imagine i wo n't let my sponge sit in a dirty bucket of water i will only put my sponge in clean water i will use my sponge productively and get much accomplished with it how wonderful to have such a useful tool at my beck and call ! posted by ginger to mobyjane at december , am
