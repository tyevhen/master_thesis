sitting here stuffed with stuffing and turkey , ham , mashed potatoes , gravy and pie , i thought i d wish you all a happy thanksgiving i hope your day was as uneventful and peaceful as mine i worked at the hospital for hours prior to attending a sober get together with many friends the food and the company were exquisite i had some very interesting and fun patients today , too , so it s been a good day although i could have used a longer nap ! today s events remind me i am so grateful for my sobriety and for my sober family i know many people with mental illness and or addiction issues are separated from their families by choice or necessity , and holidays can be very difficult i am separated by choice today i suppose i could have called the brother who rudely insulted and belittled me more than a year ago and asked him what he was doing i suppose i could have called my other brothers and done the same but i didn t instead of obligatory invitations or half heartedly visiting , i chose to keep my life simple today i chose to give the gift of time by volunteering to work i chose to spend the day with people i care about and who graciously care about me i chose the rewarding path of recovery today sure , it would have been nice to see my out of state mom and step dad , but other than those two people , i couldn t have spent this holiday with nicer , more sincere people than the friends with whom i chose to celebrate i didn t have that option prior to recovery mental illness , even recovery from mental illness , does not come with an instant community while those of us suffering from brain disorders can share our experiences individually , we do not have the advantage of multiple weekly gatherings in rooms filled with healthy , happy , and grateful people so today , with all the sincerity i can muster , i can honestly say i am genuinely , truly grateful to be a recovered alcoholic happy thanksgiving !
