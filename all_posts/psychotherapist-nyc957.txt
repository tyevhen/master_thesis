in my prior post , talk to your fiance about money before you get married , i recommended that people talk about money before they get married whether you started out doing that or not , when you 're in a committed relationship and sharing a home , you really need to be able to talk to your partner about money talk to your spouse about money as a couples counselor , i see many people who come to marriage counseling due to serious conflicts about money it 's one of the major reasons why people come for treatment there are numerous reasons why couples have conflicts about money here are some of the major reasons and some tips on how to overcome these problems no financial plan many couples enter into their marriages without a common understanding between them about how they want to handle their finances talk to your spouse about money many people assume that their partners feel the same way that they do about money however , this is often not the case couples need to come to an agreement about short term and long term financial plans there should be no secrets about money if a couple needs to make a major purchase , they need to talk it over together first otherwise , if one person just goes ahead and makes a major purchase without consulting with his partner , this can often lead to fights about money or , if one of them has a secret bank account , sooner or later this information will come to light and this will also cause significant problems also , either of these issues would be indicative of larger underlying problems in the relationship that go deeper than money problems no understanding about each partner 's role regarding money there needs to be an understanding about who is overseeing the couple 's finances this does n't mean that it must be a rigid role and that these responsibilities cannot be shared or rotated every so often however , at any given time , the couple needs to agree as to which one of them is handling the various aspects of their finances , such as handling the checking account and paying the bills sometimes , one partner is better at it than the other and prefers to do it this is fine as long as each partner is completely knowledgeable about all aspects of their finances and would know how to handle them or where to find information in an emergency avoid getting into power struggles about money often , when couples get into fights about money , it becomes a power struggle between them couples need to learn to communicate about money in a way that is respectful talk to your spouse about money avoid getting into power struggle about money as i mentioned in a prior post , it 's better to speak from your own experience i feel upset when you pay the mortgage late than to be critical or verbally abusive i ca n't believe that you were so stupid that you forgot to pay the mortgage this month no cursing no put downs no hurling dirty laundry at your partner stick with the discussion at hand if it becomes too heated , take a break and get back to it when you 're both calm again having long term financial plans that you are both working on together can bring you and your partner closer together as you see progress over time towards your goals getting help in therapy if you and your partner are fighting about money and you 're unable to resolve it between you , you could benefit from marriage counseling i am a nyc psychotherapist and couples counselor in nyc to find out more about me , visit my web site at josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist feel free to call me at or email me to set up a consultation
