well , well , well , it 's been a while ! my final semester at uni completely took over my life , allowing little time for fun activities such as looking after my blog , but it 's all over now and i have a lotttt of free time ! ! in a little under two weeks , the girls and i are off to croatia and i could n't be more excited ! although i 've got most of my outfits sorted , pinterest always seems to supply me with last minute inspiration , which is great for me , but not so great for my bank balance ! this week 's iwwsw is bohemian inspired ! i'm completely obsessed with the idea white lace , flowing kimono 's and layers upon layers of jewellery i 've never been one to make an effort while on holiday , especially if it 's a beach vacay , however this year i feel that going away with other fashion graduates will definitely change that ! have a great weekend everyone , s b x related posts fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue things i 've learned in years suz
