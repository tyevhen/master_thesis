hi friends ! thought i 'd show a few more nursery details i found some cool adhesive ribbon at michael 's crafts from the martha stewart craft line and decided to line the bottom of the pull shades with it it 's a small detail , but i like little surprises like that we got the lamps installed and together as well left to do our chair slipcover is coming on tuesday and tonight we 're hanging the valances i have some artwork i'm putting together for one wall , and a few other small little things left to do the big thing that will pull the room together , the area rug , is on backorder and the arrival date keeps getting pushed out sigh it 's no big deal , but when you 're excited to finish something and it 's the key piece well you just have a hard time waiting at least i do perhaps it will be here by the end of the month i guess you never know ! save
