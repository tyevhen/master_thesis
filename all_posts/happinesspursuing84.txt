so , i haven t posted in a while there are a couple of reasons that , in addition to being true , have the added benefit of being relevant the first is that the first wash of entries in which i stood up and said that i am depressed really felt good it lifted my mood considerably just to write about it in a public way i have no idea way i m a very private person and generally find sharing to be a particularly icky experience but for whatever reason i wound up being less depressed and , consequently , didn t have much depression to blog about the second reason that i haven t made any entries in a while is that i almost didn t get everything done last month that i was supposed to i work from home and earn my living from a variety of different sources in some cases i have my own customers and in other cases i have clients for whom i perform services those are measured monthly and my depression became so dark and debilitating in early june that i didn t get much work done and the work that i did do was so disgraceful that i simply had to redo it later luckily the clouds lifted as a result of this blog and the pure adrenaline brought on by the approaching deadlines so , i didn t have time to post those last few days of last month but here we are at the fifth of july i managed to wrap up last month without missing any of those deadlines it took me a few days to clean up the resulting mess but now i m caught up and things are on track in fact yesterday i got ahead ! i was feeling pretty good about myself for a couple of hours last night until the phone rang no , it wasn t bad news it was my step daughter in law is that right ? she married my step son she was calling to speak to my wife they re great friends but being a very polite and outgoing person she chatted with me for a bit as she always does before asking to be passed on i find her to be very intimidating because in addition to being outgoing she is also very smart a combination that translates into cleverness i am a very slow talker partially because i put a lot of thought into choosing my words and partially because i have a very mild speech impediment most people probably don t notice the impediment it s kind of like a stutter except that i don t stutter , i just stop and the words can t come out it s as though some mechanically has gone wrong and i briefly can t form words anyway , it s no big deal and i m comfortable with that part of me except when i m speaking to someone like my step daughter in law then i feel like a slow witted oaf i try to respond in kind to what she has to say but i m never really able to my social anxiety kicks in and i just want to crawl under a rock by the time i handed the phone to my wife last night i felt completely humiliated even though it was relatively early i went to bed while they chattered on the phone for an hour and a half but before that i was happy , content and carefree for a couple of hours and it was wonderful
