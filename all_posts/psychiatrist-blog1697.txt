ok , here 's something weird i am writing a post with the hope that i will drive traffic away from our blog the post i'm about to direct you to is a worthy cause and i enjoy calling attention to people who do common sense things for a good purpose and considering how often we bloggers parasitize the standard media it 's only fitting that i should drive traffic back in that direction once in a while in june one of the columnists for our local newspaper , dan rodricks , wrote an open letter to the drug dealers of our city the point of the letter was to ask them to stop killing people seriously really that 's exactly what he said read it here if you do n't believe me now the cool part he offered to help them get real jobs and that 's what he 's been doing for the past two years any ex offender looking for a job can call for information about companies that hire ex offenders he 's had more than inquiries and mailed out loads of packets of information about job opportunities and substance abuse programs he 's even sent these packets to inmates in our prison system and i really like folks who help my patients and it 's not even his job to do this i 'd like to keep up the momentum , so if any you are willing and interested you can support this project by sending a check to goodwill industries strive strive is a national organization that provides job training and job seeking skills for impoverished people , including ex offenders you can find a local chapter here i know it seems odd to ask a global readership to support a local effort well , if somebody can ask drug dealers to stop killing who am i to be less bold ?
