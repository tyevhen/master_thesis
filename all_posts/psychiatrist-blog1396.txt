i am not a happy clinkshrink right now i'm a bit hot under the collar in fact , i'm a bit hot everywhere right now i have no air conditioner i know , i know , i should be used to this by now i do n't have a phone , i do n't have a desk , i have to hunt for chairs to sit on every day i should be used to this i am , i'm just not used to this at home this is n't something i typically blog about i generally keep my personal life off the internet and stick to mainly professional type topics , but i promise i will make this relevant to psychiatry i called up the local heating and air conditioning guy , who took one look and pointed out what was wrong he saw it immediately , and i ca n't believe i did n't someone stole my copper freon pipe it was four or five feet long , leading from the external pump up into the side of my house it had been clipped off neatly at either end , so neatly i did n't even notice it was gone i'm told it 's going to take four hours of labor at an hourly rate nearly higher than what i make as a physician and four gallons of freon at per gallon to fix and there is no guarantee it will work depending on how long the pipe was gone , both my external compressor and internal unit may be toast replacing both units is ridiculously expensive , not to mention time lost from work and loads of inmates who are n't going to get psychiatric care while i'm out i'm going to think about this incident the next time i hear someone say drugs should be decriminalized because drug addicts are only hurting themselves i will think about this the next time a non violent substance abuser says , i'm an addict but i never hurt anybody horse hockey like most people who live in big cities , i 've been a victim of crime before i 've also had my car window smashed in by someone looking to steal a bag of used spark plugs long story again , metal recycling is used to support drug addiction maybe we need a registry of people selling metal like we do for pawn shops ? ? once upon a time , someone even stole the brass doors off of our circuit court house pounds apiece , metal value estimated at a quarter of a million drug addicts do n't only hurt themselves and the most hardcore addicts need to be picked up involuntarily and taken off the streets to make them stop using so anybody who really wants to debate this is welcome to come over to my place this weekend the forecast is for a hundred degree heat index bring ice for more on the scrap metal theft epidemic , see also how hot are metals ? note from dinah my guest room has a window unit you 're always welcome
