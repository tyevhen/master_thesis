this illness never ceases to amaze me things have been going well i 've been feeling well my mood has been stable it 's been good until today today i awoke deep in the pit just like that there 's no reason for the plunge it 's just part of the illness , i guess i know that but it still never ceases to amaze me how fast things can switch i awoke feeling low not sad , not angry , not frustrated just low and hopeless that 's how i knew it was my depression acting up the hopelessness was the clue my energy level matched my mood i felt like a wet dish rag with nothing to offer anyone i tried to go about my day i had set my alarm early in order to make it to the gym before work , but i could n't get out of bed after getting up i dragged myself around my house , worked a few hours , and then hit the gym at lunch once again , i just could n't go my minute bike ride ended after only minutes , and my effort was poor at best i made it to a dental appointment before dragging home and climbing into bed my day , as far as i was concerned , was done unfortunately or perhaps fortunately , puck does n't understand depression he woke me up for dinner by wagging his tail against my bed depression or not , my boy still needed to eat ! so here i sit my head hurts my body aches my energy remains low i plan to finish my bike ride even though the thought of it is overwhelming if nothing else , i 'll take puck for a slow walk i do n't want to , but he needs care despite how i feel i feel like i need to attack this with whatever energy i can muster i'm scared of it lasting beyond a day i know it may last longer , but i also know it will pass it will pass i ca n't tell you how many times i repeated those three words today it will pass damn , i wish it had never arrived
