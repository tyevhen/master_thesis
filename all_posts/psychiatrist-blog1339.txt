so here at shrink rap , we 've been at it for a while since april of , to be exact , and we have posts now i think that 's a lot of posts on my post was it today or yesterday , or what day is it , anyway ? titled what 's in a name , tigermom commented , from the title of the post , i thought you would address what doctors and their patients call one another i 've written about that , right ? i'm sure i have , early on , i do n't know what i said , but i'm sure it 's been done if i have n't written it , well one of us has so i searched i finally went into our posts , all , and went to the oldest page there 's was a post called what 's in a name so i have two thoughts oy , i reused a post title without even remembering this if the blog is n't getting old , then maybe i am perhaps i'm mellowing , but in the years since , i'm not sure i quite care so much what anyone calls me anymore to tigermom , with regards
