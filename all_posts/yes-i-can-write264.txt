i 've been feeling lately that what i share of my personal world on this blog is not all that fleshed out , because although i 'll briefly mention my family members , i 've hardly talked about them as individuals i 'll just say that i went downtown with emi , or had a conversation with my dad , but neither of those things says much about who i'm actually sharing my life with ! so i decided to do a bio of sorts on each family member my apologies if this is n't the most fascinating subject ever i mean , i think they 're fascinating , so maybe you will too ! , but i want to give more of a background on my life , so i plan on having the links to each family members 'page' on the sidebar once i 've written them all they 'll probably be spread out over the next couple of months a neat list of those people animal people included most important to me but enough with introductions or maybe not just a different type of introduction meet emi she 's a self proclaimed otaku , one obsessed with manga , anime , and japanese culture in general she loves to cosplay dress up as characters from a manga , anime , or even video game , and adores going to the annual montreal anime convention in full cosplay , of course she 's also learning to speak japanese she 'll greet and say goodbye to people in japanese a good portion of the time , and regularly decides to confuse her poor family and friends by throwing in random japanese words and phrases into normal conversation , and plans on visiting japan in the next couple of years she says that in her learning of the japanese language , she 's come to understand the intricate workings of the english language better , and to really gain a whole new respect for the power of and beauty of language oh , and have i mentioned that she loves japan ? yeah emi is a writer , and a good one at that she 's been doing writing role playing , where two authors collaborate online to create a story , scene by scene , since she was something like years old , and thus has written hundreds of thousands of words of fiction that 's her main form of writing , but she also occasionally writes non fiction in the form of really good responses in online debates and discussions , has recently developed a love of poetry , especially haiku , and has turned out a couple of haiku that i really like , though she 's more critical of them unsurprisingly she also tackled nanowrimo this year , and finished victorious on november th one day before the deadline ! with , words emi has been playing the snare drum for four years now , and the highland snare specifically for two years she goes to drum lessons once a week at a pipes and drums school , and drum practice once a week with the pipes and drums band she belongs to , that does paid gigs i might add she earned her first money ever for playing drums just a couple of weeks ago ! i should also mention that emi has a crazy non biological twin named trevor they decided they were twins last year he 's the cute twin and she 's the smart twin , and like to do similar things , wear similar clothes , claim each others mother for their own , and say all personality traits that they have in common are thanks to their shared dna they even fight like siblings ! she also has three adopted big brothers , one of whom she 's actually informed of this fact in case you were wondering , emi is , and unlike me , with my half a year of kindergarten , has never been to school a day in her life she 's probably the best in my family at arguing in favour of unschooling , because unlike me , she 's pretty good at not putting people on the defensive obviously , sometimes that reaction ca n't be avoided but when it can be , she 'll usually manage to ! she 's just generally good at debating , as well usually issues of unschooling or green anarchy , since those are the two most contentious things she 's likely to talk about she argues both logically and calmly she just does n't usually get ruffled or angry , and if she does , she hides it well ! most importantly to me , emi is my best friend we talk late into the night about things both vastly important and deep , and things merely gossip worthy we argue over which guys are cute or not , people watch together , talk about our shared love of writing , about human behavior , about politics and religion and a million other things i 'd seriously be lost without her ! oh , and i have to mention that she also loves art , loves spending time on the online artists community deviantart , and loves making plushies check out her da account here ! and that is my introduction of emi in case you did n't gather it from what i 've written above , she 's a majorly cool person friendly , talkative , loyal , intelligent , fun and funny i think i'm pretty lucky to have her as a sister , personally ! peace , idzie
