i actually woke up depressed today , despite two nights on the antipsychotic zyprexa usually there 's some attainment of consciousness that precedes the leaden feeling , but within fifteen minutes of waking i began to cry about nothing just sadness spilling over , sadness not attached to any particular loss depressed people are boring their loved ones , ultimately , ca n't help being irritated by them here 's what happened yesterday we took kenyon to a nearby beach to swim when we thought he 'd had enough he began to shiver and kathleen took him to the car to escape the wind , as she was getting cold , too she told me i 'd like to leave in a little while i was n't ready to leave lying in the sun by a chorus of waves i found soothing , and i prefer open vistas to closed spaces no matter how sick i am yet eager to be compliant , or rather desperate not to displease , i packed up and got in the car i drove home , and after bringing the van into the garage , i told kathleen that i was going back to the beach this made her angry why did n't you tell me at the beach ? i could have sat in the car and read the paper we 're married , you know we 're supposed to communicate and it 's a waste of gas ! and here i thought is it depressive thinking ? that by getting her and kenyon home quickly i could avoid any conflict and return to the beach as well i 've told patients' friends and families that it 's ok to get angry with depressed people it 's what they expect anyway i advise kathleen to treat me as she normally would when i'm sick the last thing a depressed person wants is to be singled out for special handling , which is more painful than blending in and passing for human people who have survived severe depressions are tough we 're not made of glassware the mentally ill are some of the toughest people you 'll ever meet do you have any idea what it is to come out of a psychosis ? have you ever had to step back into this world from an alternate world that seemed more real than this one and have to adapt all over again ? obviously i'm worse today , say kilorats i do n't want to go lower but i have no control over the disease i write to distract myself if it distracts you as well , it has served some purpose it 's terrible in the midst of depression to have the certainty it will come again , that soul mutilator of which jane kenyon speaks below when you step on a piece of concrete with a hollow space beneath and hear the clunk and shiver , i am the echo below here 's something really worth reading , a poem by jane kenyon , having it out with melancholy ce
