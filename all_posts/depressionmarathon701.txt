life moves on whether i feel good or not yesterday , despite still feeling low , i got up early to run unfortunately , my body did not agree with that decision neither , it turns out , did the weather but i pushed out the door , which is when i realized my legs were totally dead i felt like i was running on water logged , dead tree stumps instead of human legs the weather , too , was rudely awakening of course it was cold , but the real killer was the wind it was gusting up to mph ! my heart sank at both of these developments i was planning to run miles with puck alone before joining the track club for another miles unfortunately that did n't seem likely given the circumstances i spent the first three miles of my run contemplating my planned miler after three miles , i decided my legs felt too dead and the wind was too cold and fierce to attempt miles i ran miles instead i do n't know how i was shooting for five , but once i decided not to join the track club , i wanted to get as far as i could before giving up after quitting , i filled my stomach , rehydrated , and relaxed with my feet up i went to my usual aa meeting , which i would have missed had i done the whole miles upon returning home , i ate some more and took a nap i was praying the wind would die , but it did n't , so i stopped waiting at one o'clock i felt well enough to try again i headed out to finish my run the afternoon weather was equally as brutal as the morning crap my legs felt better , but overall i was still tired while running , i decided i 'd shoot for a total of miles then i downgraded that decision to miles around miles , some rough footing forced me to walk for awhile that rest break must have served me well , because i ran past miles and made it to before finally calling it quits i was whipped i think the trauma of losing my job , combined with the recent slide into depression , physically wore me down over the course of last week like most of you , i woke up tired today and missing one hour of sleep i had to work at my second job , and maybe that was good my brain and my mood behaved while i was working focusing on others always helps i swam after work , but once in the pool i felt as dead as i did yesterday morning i stayed about minutes at least i did something before coming home to collapse i 've rested now i'm trying to relax i'm anticipating feeling discontent , perhaps a little angry , when i return to work tomorrow morning my boss will be gone , so that will make it easier i will be professional , as usual , but i'm anticipating a lot of mixed emotions , nonetheless i'm hoping my energy wo n't be sapped it 's only weeks to boston i need all the energy i can get !
