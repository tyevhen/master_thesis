many , many unschoolers have expressed their dislike of the word unschooling they say it 's too negative , or that it 's still using school to define their learning journey many unschoolers also say that they prefer to describe unschooling in a positive way to people , explaining what they do instead of what they do n't do however , i 've found that if you explain unschooling only in the positive , the average person will simply assume that you do all those things in addition to regular schooling , not instead of i find it much more useful to first take away the preconceptions about learning , to say , for example , that i direct my own education , which means i do n't go to school , i do n't use a curriculum , i do n't take tests or get given grades , and my mom or dad does n't teach me then to go on and explain what you actually do ! i learn from life , from books and the internet , from fascinating conversations with fascinating people , from following my passions , from thinking deeply about the world around me , researching , reading , discussing which brings me back to why i happily use the word unschooling labels are really only to inform other people about how you live , what you think , how you feel unschooling says that you 're not schooling to me , that 's a very good first step in explaining exactly what you are doing ! peace , idzie you might also like what do unschoolers do ? learning advice from a learning life blame unschooling ! unschooling is n't new really , it is n't linkwithin
