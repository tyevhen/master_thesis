hi friends ! i 've finally finished mailing out the birth announcements i made for family and a few friends they were quite the undertaking ! but , i did n't want to skimp since i do this for a living and really wanted to do something nice for my own child also , these were very intensive to do and no client or very few at least ! would ever order something like this it 's very cost prohibitive due to the time it takes to line envelopes , do a color letterpress job , print and cut belly bands , etc anyway , here it is ! i lined most of the envelopes while still pregnant i did the design while pregnant as well the little insignia at the top with the p in it says little p est and next to it says p is for paige after paige was born , i updated the information in the design and sent out for the letterpress plates i then printed all the belly bands out on my inkjet printer and trimmed them when my mother in law was here hanging out with paige i finished lining the envelopes and even ordered a custom rubber stamp i designed to do the return address on the back of the envelope and i can continue using the stamp for all my mailings now ! then , on a sunday , chris spent the day with paige while i letterpressed and trimmed her announcements down i also assembled them all and during her naps they were short last week so i use the term loosely or fussy evenings , i stuffed and addressed the envelopes that took all week ! it 's finally finished and i'm happy with how it came out phew ! i hope you like them too ! save
