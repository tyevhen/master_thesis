i recently re watched al gore 's an inconvenient truth , which is now somewhat out of date , and was wondering what 's happened to co since the movie came out here 's a recap first , the most recent year 's worth of data from mauna loa carbon dioxide levels which for are above ppm vary more or less sinusoidally throughout the year why ? most of earth 's land masses are north of the equator plants bloom in summer and consume most of their co in the warm months in the northern hemisphere winter , co builds up because northern hemisphere plants shut down and australia is largely desert here 's mauna loa data for the last years the graph shows that co levels in the atmosphere have gone up about ppm in years , so around ppm per year we have ice core data going back , years , and it 's reliable because the snowpack accumulates in definite layers , and we can sample the actual air bubbles in the layers to get co ppm in the past , years , co tyically has rarely been above ppm and got to ppm briefly just once temperatures not shown tend to follow co levels closely , albeit with a bit of lag due to oceanic entrapment and subsequent release of co , with ppm of co equivalent to about a degree c change in air temps sometimes co appears to lag slightly sometimes air temps do but overall , the two correlate strongly which means that at ppm , we 're due for c higher temps over historic levels exactly how long it will take for that c increase to show up , i do n't know many people say it 's already begun , of course ! , but a c increase is pretty much inevitable skeptics can argue all they want about whether the co buildup is man made but there is no question that co levels are higher by at least ppm today than at any time in the last , years that part is not open to debate also , the fact that co is a greenhouse gas that traps heat is not really open to debate so connect the dots however you like presidential candidates , please discuss tired of lies and half truths about mental illness ? arm yourself with some facts check out my free book mental health myths debunked tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , suicide , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data , so you can weigh the evidence for yourself the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms are based on obsolete data but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend please retweet this post 's url in the meantime , i want to thank the following people for retweeting me yesterday have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
