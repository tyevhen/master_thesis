part of an occasional series within a couple of weeks of starting as an unqualified generic social worker in charwood in the autumn of , i began to acquire a caseload it was quite a mixture being a complete novice , i did not question their histories , assuming they were normal for charwood , but when i look back now , i realise how extraordinary some of these people and their life experiences were first , there was benjamin private benjamin he was my very first mental health client benjamin had been a young man during the nd world war , and had been called up to serve in the army he had previously spent his life in a village in the charwood area , living with his parents and family in a large timber frame farmhouse , and working on the family farm he had a fianc e , whom he had to leave behind when he was called up she promised to wait for him until his triumphal return while in the army , benjamin was badly injured it was not in active service a munitions lorry backed into him in the army depot , crushing him against a wall and damaging his legs and spine he was medically discharged , returning to his village permanently disabled , and only able to walk with the aid of sticks his fianc e , on seeing his injuries , promptly left him , and married another broken in heart and body , and no longer able to work on the land , he retreated to the family farmhouse , where his parents still lived with his sister and her son he took over the attic rooms , and became a complete recluse his mother would leave food and the daily local newspaper at the top of the steep attic stairs , he would take it once she had left , and return the empty plates to the landing when he had finished he continued to live like this for the next or more years no one in the household ever saw him , although they would hear noises emanating from the attic from time to time , so they knew he was alive it is unclear how social services came to be involved with him perhaps the noises in the attic became more disturbing perhaps his family began to get concerned that they had allowed this crippled ex serviceman to isolate himself in this way whatever the trigger , in the mid s an assessment was carried out under the mental health act the mental welfare officer , his gp and a psychiatrist climbed the steep stairs to the attic and entered the attic room in which he had lived unseen for over years the entire space was taken up with a warren made of old newspapers they picked their way through these narrow corridors until they eventually discovered him , huddled in a nest of old newspaper his hair and beard had grown down to his waist , his fingernails were several centimetres long , and worst of all , they discovered that , because he had not used his legs for decades , and had instead negotiated his warren by shuffling along on his bottom , his legs had atrophied under him and were completely immovable he was detained under sec of the act , which was the equivalent of sec , and admitted to the local victorian asylum for assessment he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and detained under sec the equivalent of sec , for the next years when i took benjamin on , it was with the specific purpose of facilitating his move out of hospital and back into the community although still physically disabled , physiotherapy had restored use to his legs , and he was again able to walk with the aid of sticks his mental illness was in remission , and there was a project under way to decant the long stay patients from the hospital and back into the community it was not considered a good idea for benjamin to return to the family farmhouse , where his elderly and frail mother now lived alone , and there was nowhere else in his village where he could live , but i did find a place for him in a hostel in charwood , where he had his own room , his meals were provided , and he had company he was content with this for a year or so , until his elderly mother died , and the farmhouse was sold he received a considerable share of the proceeds , and decided to leave the hostel and travel around the county , looking for a suitable place to buy a bungalow and settle down as he was mentally capable , i could not stop him he bade farewell , and left charwood , and my caseload i thought i would never see him again however one day nearly years later , i was asked to assess an inpatient on the older people s psychiatric ward he had been detained under sec and they wanted to further detain him under sec it was benjamin since i last saw him in the late s he had spent over years wandering around the county , staying in bed and breakfast accommodation , until being allocated a local authority flat in charwood about years previously he had had no involvement with mental health services for years i was the only professional who actually knew his history over the previous few months , he had been refusing food , and had become emaciated and very frail when assessed at home , they found him living in a warren of newspapers when i interviewed benjamin in his room on the ward , i found a very elderly and frail man he was by now in his s i asked him if he remembered me from the best part of years ago he did there were no significant signs of dementia , but he was displaying clear symptoms of psychosis he was paranoid about food , and objected to the ward staff forcing him to eat he thought they were poisoning him with food and medication he wanted to go back home so that he did not have to eat or take any more medication there was no option he needed to be detained under sec he recovered his nephew , his sister s son , who had known him as the mad man in the attic , when he had been a child , and who had reconnected with him when he had settled again in charwood , offered to accommodate him in his own home benjamin was his last living relative benjamin agreed to this , and he was discharged next time more choice cases
