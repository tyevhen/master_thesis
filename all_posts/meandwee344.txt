hi friends ! i 've spent some time and re listed lots of items that have n't been seen in my shop for a while i did custom silhouettes for customers back in and then stopped because it did n't fit in with my career goals at the time now , i'm back to offering custom silhouette portraits of your or your loved ones' children the details are in my shop here is a silhouette portrait of paige i did when she was months old using a photo i took of her profile it 's funny how different her profile is now months later i 'd add more hair in the back in little flips and a bow on top i can do any color of frame around it this one is robin 's egg blue they go for which covers the illustration time and the cost time for the portrait printing additional prints or materials like calling cards would cost less since the illustration has already been done feel free to email me if you are interested in one ! or check out my shop here save
