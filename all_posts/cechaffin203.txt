i realize that my last post could have been dispiriting to readers , so i just wanted to say that this blog ai n't dead yet i will be inspired , i will return it 's that i do n't have the need to blog the way i did when i was depressed i needed it for survival then now it 's more of an option then i needed to give a sense of definition to myself through the construct of words when i was losing all definition funny how when you 're healthy you do n't need to attempt to assure yourself that you might exist through an engagement of words it 's the disconnection from everything that makes the depressed writer seek objectification through words , though the hope of feeling myself could never be realized , just a verbal record of the stranger inhabiting it i do n't know where this blog is going but i have n't abandoned it here 's a revision of my poem , reflection reflection someday when you were only meaning to look out the window , your face will appear suspended in glass see mine , beard quilled in white ? above , a vast forehead like a desert as if the skull were pushing through ? right , a scar from cop 's batons extends my eyebrow and my mustache is split by a brass knuckle 's kiss the right eye 's green , the left is blue with crow 's feet spread out like shatter proof glass shattered then all the luggage below , harvest of late nights drinking nose ? flat and aboriginal , strong even teeth but yellowed by smoke and coffee , wide smile , full equal lips upcurling at the corners laugh lines outnumber other furrows though puzzlement grooves much i do n't surprise that easily now not a rich man 's face , it lacks a certain earthly satisfaction though i pray it 's free of envy ii the poor you have with you always , the rich man ca n't help but rub it in , his mere existence fathers envy which powers ambition which feeds achievement which seeks comparisons which breed dissatisfaction giving birth to envy it 's not the thorn against the rose but both against the deer the deer make them equals and the sun , confederates iii on and on the human engine runs toward the swimming pool purchased on credit from a second mortgage to the notion that having all might cure not having all on we fly like wasps disturbed by a lawnmower , no furies needed but our lust the ouroboros of desire is sadly predictable how much is that buddha in the window ? kilobunnies , ce
