i 've written prior articles about gratitude for this psychotherapy blog see psychotherapy , balance and gratitude , keeping a gratitude journal , the importance of expressing gratitude to your spouse and being in the present moment i'm focusing on a particular topic relating to gratitude in this article , which is a question that often comes up in therapy is is possible to feel gratitude even when you 're sad ? is it possible to feel gratitude even when you 're sad ? it might sound pollyanaish or naive to talk about feeling grateful when you feel sad but cultivating an attitude of gratefulness on a regular basis helps you , especially during the times when you 're not at your best why is this ? well , when you develop the ability to find things in your life that you can be grateful for , you 're developing a particular skill that will help you during good times and bad in many ways , it 's easier to focus on the things that are n't going well in your life and , at any given time , you might have numerous challenges but if you have developed a habit of looking for the positive things , the things that are going well in your life , no matter how small , it helps to alleviate some of the emotional pain that you might be going through is it possible to feel gratitude even when you 're sad ? developing a habit of noticing things to be grateful for does n't mean that you 're trying to deny that you have problems or that you 're upset or depressed see my article what is the difference between sadness and depression ? it 's a way of getting a bigger perspective about your life and the people in your life that includes the challenges as well as the positive aspects so , how to you do this ? how to begin to develop the ability to notice positive aspects of your life if you 've never tried to develop the ability to find the positive things in your life to be grateful for , you can start in small ways by jotting down things that were positive each day make a list this list can be as simple as the smallest things someone smiled at you and lifted your spirits for a moment you heard your favorite song you remembered a happy memory you heard from a friend you noticed a job online that you could apply for to get out of your current job someone complimented you you found a parking space easily the sales assistant in the store was helpful to you keeping a gratitude list and so on getting into the habit of noticing the positive aspects of your life each day helps you to begin to be attuned to these experiences on a regular basis it can also help you to realize that , even though you might be sad , life is complex and good feelings can still coexist with sad feelings developing a sense of gratitude once you 've begun to notice that there are usually at least one or two things that make you feel good and that you can appreciate , you can learn to deepen these feelings by using the mind body connection using the mind body connection to deepen your sense of gratitude it 's not unusual , especially if you 're feeling sad , to notice positive aspects of your day and experience them in only an intellectual way experiencing something in an intellectual way is very different from feeling it on an emotional and physical level one way to go from experiencing these positive aspects from purely an intellectual perspective to deepening the feeling to an emotional and physical level is to use the mind body connection using the mind body connection to deepen your sense of gratitude one method that i use with my therapy clients when they 're starting therapy is called internal resource building when we 're engaged in internal resource building also known as developing coping skills , i ask clients to bring in positive memories from their life , no matter how long ago it was and no matter how fleeting the memory might be if they ca n't come up with , i 'll use whatever they bring in and that 's just fine i ask the client to close her eyes , get back into the memory and notice what emotions and sensations she feels in her body then , we use some form of what is called bilateral stimulation from emdr therapy to reinforce that feeling the bilateral stimulation can be done with tappers one tapper in each hand that provide alternate or bilateral buzzing in each hand this is done for only a few seconds to focus on the positive aspect of the memory and to try to prevent negative aspects from coming up so the memory remains positive since you wo n't have tappers , you can use another emdr therapy technique , which is alternate tapping alternate tapping , which is a form of bilateral stimulation can be done by using your hands to gently tap , and it can be done in several ways alternate tapping of your leg right leg , then left leg , back and forth see laurel parnell 's book , tapping in the butterfly tap where you cross your arms in front of your chest and do alternate taps of your upper arms bilateral music that goes from one ear to the other see bilateral music the idea is that you 're focusing on the positive emotion that you 're feeling in your body , and this helps to strengthen the positive feelings by strengthening the positive feelings , your experience of gratitude usually goes from an intellectual experience to a felt sense of gratitude it also provides you with a reprieve from your sadness so , to answer the question that i posed at the beginning of this article yes , it is possible to feel both sadness and gratitude , but it can be challenging to feel gratitude when you 're overcome with depression or unresolved trauma at that point , you might need the help of an experienced psychotherapist getting help in therapy there 's a difference from feeling sad and feeling depressed when you 're depressed
