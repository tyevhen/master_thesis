reading dinah 's post about talk therapy inspired me to think about my view of what it means to be a psychotherapist the people who have been reading this blog for a while will now exclaim , wait a minute you do n't do psychotherapy well , that 's kind of the point let me begin with an illustration over the weekend i went to a party where i got involved in a conversation with a friend 's wife as these things happen , the topic turned to what i do for a living the conversation went something like this so , you talk to criminals to find out why they did their crimes ? no , i'm a psychiatrist i treat brain diseases oh , so all you do is give them medicine yeah , like all an anesthesiologist does is put a tube down the patient 's throat so he can breath well , that 's pretty important do n't you ever get to talk to them ? i do n't do psychotherapy i treat brain diseases oh , so they do n't get counselling is n't that sad ? i 've had this conversation with people so many times that i no longer have the impulse to run screaming from the room i can resist the temptation to say , no , all i do is give them medicine so they do n't rip their clothes off and stand masturbating all day or curse and attack the officers or break the windows out of their cells that 's all i do they are civillians they have no clue they ca n't help it we had a therapeutic prison fad back in the 's and ' 's when thorazine was first invented and we suddenly had the ability to treat psychosis it seemed like anything was curable criminality became a disease and so they were given therapy in therapeutic prison sentencing laws were modified to allow for indeterminate sentences no fixed endpoint so that release was dependent upon the treatment team ah , the unintended consequence of how to determine when psychotherapy ends ! inmates discovered that the sentence , like the psychotherapy , became endless so they did the logical thing that all inmates do in these situations they sued they sued for the right to end psychotherapy and leave therapeutic prison the court agreed that indefinite involuntary confinement was unconstitutional even when it was for well intended therapeutic purposes and so we are back to our starting point today inmates still want to search for the answer to why i do the things i do and they insist , coincidentally , that this can only be done in therapeutic prison they do n't want to hear that the answer to why they repeatedly use drugs and drink is because they 're addicted to it it must be because of trauma x or dual diagnosis y , or some other answer that is the key to never coming back to prison honestly , i'm a bit skeptical about the utility of psychotherapy in these situations i'm of the opinion that if a trip through a year old prison is n't enough to convince someone that breaking into houses and robbing people is a bad thing , then all the couch time in the world is n't going to do it fortunately , it is possible to be therapeutic without doing psychotherapy a good therapeutic relationship of any kind can keep an inmate alive people with personality disorders have a lot of trouble staying alive they die from medical diseases because they do n't take care of themselves they use bad judgement and take risks that get themselves killed they are annoying to other personality disordered people and end up getting murdered and then there 's the suicide issue a therapeutic relationship involves being available to answer questions and explain how the system works it involves treating the inmate humanely and with respect it involves explaining to the inmate what their disease is and how to care for it it involves giving the inmate a safe place to sob away from the other prisoners when needed sometimes it means i walk down the street and hear a voice calling from a distance doc ! hey doc ! remember me ? how ya doin' ? and then the former inmate tells me about something i did years before during a brief med check that really helped and yes , i also give medicine
