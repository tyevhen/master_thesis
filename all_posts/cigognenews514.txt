the psychological climate of hypnosis what psychological elements are involved in hypnosis ? first of all , one could say that we have already been partially hypnotized through our preconceptions and expectations before we visit the hypnotist we anticipate going through a process which the reputation of hypnosis has already preordained when the hypnotist obliges us , these elements are immediately reinforced even more important than these anticipations is the desire to be hypnotized what motivates this desire to surrender one 's critical mind ? to understand this motivation , i believe , is to understand how hypnosis works a person 's desires are not only motivated by healthy drives but also by neurotic processes that result from unmet childhood needs barber says that a subject goes into a trance because of his desire to please the hypnotist , to make the hypnotist look good , to be thought special and be complimented , and so on barber might as well have described the everyday motivations of the common neurotic the profound implication of barber s viewpoint is that hypnotic success is dependent upon pre existing neurotic motivations this is further support for the proposition that hypnosis and neurosis involve the same mechanisms to many people , hypnosis appears inexplicable or magical in reality , what is called dissociation in hypnosis is really the everyday state of the neurotic all the classic hypnotic phenomena amnesia , time distortion , age regression , hallucinations , anesthesia , and catalepsy depend on dissociations in consciousness what trances of different depths have in common is a certain amount of dissociation , or disconnection within the self , such as when we repress traumatic emotional pain for years , or temporarily stop feeling a sore throat or headache i maintain that hypnosis is not an altered state in relation to the common neurotic condition , but it is altered in relation to what is healthy the isolated consciousness of hypnosis is only a circumscribed demonstration of how neurosis works the difference is that neurosis is set down during the critical period when the brain is forming and hormones are achieving their set points it is then a permanent state hypnosis is a temporary one by redirecting one s behavior through the manipulation of conscious awareness it is an unconscious input that attempts to stem the primal tide to block the effects of the imprint it does not change the imprint , ever one can stop smoking with hypnosis but the need to do so never changes the price we pay for lying to ourselves is a premature breakdown of the system sooner or later psychotherapy addresses the left frontal brain while the hypnotist bypasses it and seems to input the right frontal brain , the emotional , inwardly focused brain neurosis as a hypnotic or post hypnotic state i have maintained that hypnosis can be understood by looking at neurosis in fact , neurosis is the sine qua non for hypnosis now let 's see if we can just as easily understand neurosis by looking at hypnosis is there any fundamental difference between the two ? hypnosis is an intentional procedure , voluntarily submitted to for a distinct purpose neurosis is a global state , involuntary developed as an adaptive response to emotional trauma very early in life it can be argued that neurosis is a post hypnotic state , maintained by constant reinforcement of repression and dissociation hypnotic procedures can easily tap into that state to produce definite and recognizable post hypnotic episodes what do i mean when i say that neurosis is a hypnotic or post hypnotic state ? it is apparent that in order to feel , the human brain requires the full use of its consciousness yet , as we have seen , the brain possesses the capacity to shut down part of itself to defend against the full conscious experience of pain the left brain can be disconnect ed from the right so that one side doesn t know what the other is doing or feeling this ability is brought into play when the na ve and vulnerable system of the developing child is faced with more pain that it can handle when for example the child is rejected , abused , or abandoned the child 's mind represses the pain by functionally detaching much of conscious awareness from the lower brain functions such as emotion and sensation where the pain is stored we call this state a split , dissociation , or disconnection the behaviors which arise to maintain it we call neurosis the dissociated person is left with a host of unresolved primal needs which , from their obscured position of repression , exert a continuous but unconscious force this force directs a person into symbolic attempts to fulfill primal need the person becomes an intellectual because that is what the parents' expected a smart student who got good grades and whose main interest was books being an intellectual can be a symbolic route to feeling loved and to having one 's other needs met yet this neurotic diversion plagues him with all manner of symptoms such as migraines and compels him to act in ways which maintain the disconnection , living in his head totally detached from his feelings only thoughts guide him he therefore makes the wrong choices of partners in life because he is out of touch with himself and his real needs an adult grows up around the unfulfilled child whose urgent needs remain the dominant preoccupation he continuously seeks fulfillment while attempting to avoid experiencing the reality of deprivation
