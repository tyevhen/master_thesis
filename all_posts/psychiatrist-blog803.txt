as our publisher was designing the cover for our book , we put in a request we 'd like a duck on the cover no duck , we were told as we dusted ourselves off , our editor came back and said the design department had agreed to put a duck on the spine of the book we rejoiced ! here and there , roy would mutter about the duck remind them , do n't let them forget about the duck as the cover was finalized and the galleys were finished , we received a note from our beloved editor are you sure ? of course ! people will think you are quacks but we 're not quacks , anyone who reads our book will know that roy was convinced that it would add to the idea that this is n't just another dry reference textbook , it 's an easy to read , ducky kind of book i thought a little duck would be fine our editor sent the picture of our duck now let me tell you i did not like this duck i did not like this duck at all the duck had long lashes , looked way too happy for a psychiatry book , and looked like a toddler 's bath toy we 're shrink rappers , but we do n't squeak ! oh , and we 're not quacks here is the duck i wanted very small , very subtle think of the penguin logo for putnam books only think of it as a duck here is the duck i wanted our editor agreed , i think , that it was a better duck and happy with our duck though clinkshrink thought the first duck with the flirty eyelashes was fine i get an email from the marketing department it is a very serious email about how well they think our book will do , and how packaging is important to the overall product the upshot there will be no duck our opinions were not wanted , the duck was gone , it was a done deal quack ? oh , the duck would have been just fine
