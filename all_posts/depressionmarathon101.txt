i 've written about this before , but it 's what 's happening right now , so bear with me i 've been working more often lately , more days and more hours , and i'm wiped out this frustrates me because i do n't think i should feel so worn out when i'm not even working full time hours i know that may be a bit harsh , but i ca n't help it that 's how i feel before this illness struck i worked full time since i 've had depression , however , part time is my max that 's frustrating my life would certainly be easier if i was able to work more hours than i do now i 'd be less financially challenged and probably have less stress but even with that incentive sitting out there tantalizing me , i do n't do well when i work more i do n't regularly work more than days per week my typical weekly schedule is monday , wednesday and friday plus an additional one or two saturdays per month it 's not a lot i know i'm embarrassed to even admit that meager schedule but when i work more hours or more often , my brain ca n't keep up i get really tired i'm tired now tired is not good for my mood i could have worked today , but i had to turn down the opportunity i worked days two weeks ago followed by days last week , and they were long days by yesterday afternoon i was physically and mentally exhausted that led to an evening vegging on the sofa rather than exercising i ran today , because that 's a priority in my life , but my training suffers when i feel so wiped out that 's not good for my mood , either so far , thankfully , my mood is holding steady i'm hoping to stick to my day schedule this week in order to regain some energy but dammit , why ca n't i work more ? do n't get me wrong , i'm grateful to be working i love what i do and i'm grateful i can survive and even play a little on the income i earn i'm very fortunate in that regard my life is good i just wish working more than usual did n't exhaust me that would be nice
