this week a major problem developed for me at work i am not responsible for what happened , but the fallout could affect our business significantly i first learned of the issue through an e mail , and my symptoms exploded confusion , sweaty palms , shakes , anger , fear , and despair my mind raced as i envisioned everything i worked for crumbling as the result of something for which i had no involvement i ll spare you the details in the end , they don t really matter for the past few days it has been difficult to spot my symptoms in fact , i don t think i really wanted to i allowed my mind to play out scenarios i coddled my feelings and i permitted my imagination to be on fire i know how to maintain my mental health , but the situation was so overwhelming that i didn t want to make the effort to change my thoughts the days ahead will reveal the final outcome fallout of what happened , and i m now beginning to spot that symptoms are distressing but not dangerous , that to know is to know that i don t know what will happen read that a couple times to get it i m making an effort to not let these symptoms overwhelm my years of hard work toward improving my mental health i m trying to be a realist and not let my imagination get carried away it s so easy to fall into my old patterns during a crisis ultimately , this is a triviality in my life , but it seems so pressing and important right now i don t feel like endorsing but i will , because before recovery i would not have made the effort to put my mental health first i would have wallowed in my misery , talked about the situation to anyone who would listen and even those who didn t want to , and worked myself up so much that my recovery would be threatened no matter what happens , my mental health must come first , and that realization is worth a hearty endorsement
