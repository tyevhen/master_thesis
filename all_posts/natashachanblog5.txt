i often have to ask and remind myself what i want this blog to be right off the bat i get a bit afraid and overwhelmed because part of me is afraid to let people really know my thoughts i doubt anyone really reads this however just the fact that it is out out of my head and publicly somewhere gives me a bit of anxiety my goal is to break past that because i have always enjoyed blogging and it does make me happy for me this blog is sharing events in my life to remember opening up about my past struggle with depression and my current struggle with anxiety writing more so my grammar and vocabulary can expand movie reviews ? beauty reviews pictures of food ! ! living with pcos practicing photography trying new recipes pinterest projects this big changes in life coming up ! ! possibly a fitness weight loss healthy lifestyle blogs ? overall i want this blog to my happy place where i can share whatever is on my mind
