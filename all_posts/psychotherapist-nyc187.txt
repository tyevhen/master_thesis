part of being an adult is knowing and accepting that there will be loss and difficult times no one can escape experiencing emotional pain at certain points in life and , even though we ca n't change what 's happened to us in the past , we can learn in therapy how to change how loss and traumatic events affect us see my article reacting to the present based on the past you ca n't change your past , but you can change how it affects you in therapy without even realizing it , many people who experienced loss or psychological trauma in the past continue to experience these events as if they 're happening now on an intellectual level , they know that they 're not experiencing the event now but , on an emotional level , they continue to feel it as if it 's happening in the present even when someone is aware that s he is stuck emotionally and s he wants to get unstuck , it 's often hard to do alone how to go about getting unstuck is different for each person and situation for many people , in order to start the healing process , they have to grieve for the loss or change in their life this can be challenging because , even when people want to feel better , there can still be a part of them that wants to hold on grieving is often an acknowledgement of irreparable loss , which can be painful as compared to holding on and having the illusion that life can go back to how it was before the loss or traumatic event each person will go through this process in his or her own way , but working with an a licensed psychotherapist , who has experience in helping clients to overcome these types of problems is usually more helpful than trying to do it on your own after someone acknowledges that the loss or event has caused a change , it 's beneficial to look at how this loss or event is affecting you now and what you can do to change how it 's have a negative effect let 's take a look at a fictionalized scenario , based on many different cases , to understand how therapy can help sandy when sandy was five , her father left the household to move in with another woman prior to his moving out , sandy heard her parents arguing at night about this other woman when they thought she was asleep because of these arguments , sandy feared that her father , whom she was very attached to , would leave so , when he actually left , her worst fear came true and she was very upset not only did she feel that she lost her father , she also felt that she lost her mother too because her mother became depressed and withdrawn after sandy 's father moved out sandy could see that her mother really tried to put on a brave face and tried to assure sandy that everything would be okay but sandy knew that her mother was devastated and things would n't be the same her father came to see sandy on the weekends he tried to seem cheerful and assure sandy that he would always be there for her , but sandy felt confused , angry and unhappy that he moved out even though he tried to explain to sandy that his leaving had nothing to do with her and that it was a problem that was between sandy 's mother and him , she could n't understand why he would n't just move back in and , as is natural for children her age , she felt like it was her fault that he left , no matter how much he tried to reassure her her father tried for a long time to repair his relationship with sandy but by the time sandy was a teenager , she still had a lot of anger and hurt , and she told him that she did n't want to see him anymore at that point , her father gave up and told her that if she was ever ready to have a relationship with him again , she could call him although she never realized it before she came to therapy , sandy 's experience with her father colored her adult experiences later on with men you ca n't change your past , but you can change how your past affects you in therapy by the time sandy came to therapy , she was in her late s , and she could n't understand why all of her relationships with men fell apart her most recent relationship had just ended , and she was in despair , wanting to be in a loving relationship , but fearful of ever attempting to be in a relationship again see my article an emotional dilemma wanting and dreading love her ambivalence about men and relationships was evident almost from the beginning when her therapist asked her to describe her relationships with men , she said in a negative tone , oh , you know how men are and then she described a string of relationships where she ended up heart broken in each of these relationships , her boyfriend hurt her by either cheating on her or leaving her for someone else this had happened so many times to her that she believed that all men are dogs and since she believed that all men were emotionally unreliable , she felt she was in a unsolvable dilemma because she wanted love , but she did n't believe it was possible because she feared she would always get hurt when someone has a propensity to choose emotionally unreliable romantic partners , it 's often hard for him or her to see that there 's an unconscious process going on in terms of choosing these unreliable people the fact that it 's an unconscious process makes it difficult to see because , at least on a conscious level , most people want to make healthy choices in relationships as sandy and her therapist explored these issues further , her therapist asked sandy if she knew any women who were in happy relationships with men who are loving , kind and trustworthy sandy named several of her friends who were in good relationships with kind , loving men as soon as sandy said this , she surprised herself even though she knew how she felt about men and she also knew that she had women friends who were in happy relationships with men , she never put the two contradictory knowings together when she thought about these two contradictory knowings at the same time , she realized that they could n't both be true if her women friends were in good relationships with men that they were happy with , then all men ca n't be dogs rather than thinking that her feelings about men were objectively true , she realized that her feelings were her own personal perceptions then , she became curious as to why she had these longstanding negative feelings about men not just about the men that she had been in relationships with , but about all men as her therapist worked with sandy on this , sandy realized that her perception of men was based on her early experience with her father and that , until now , this had been unconscious shortly after that , sandy told her therapist that she did n't understand how it would help her to work on this issue because she could n't change the past in response , her therapist agreed that no amount of therapy could change the past , but they could work on changing how the past affected her her therapist also discussed how early childhood trauma often gets unconsciously repeated later on in an adult 's life sandy gradually realized that she was unconsciously choosing men who were unreliable and who would be more likely to hurt her , so it was n't about all men it was about the men that she was choosing over time , sandy realized that her perspective about her father was based on her childhood feelings as a child , she had only a limited perspective about her father and his leaving as an adult , she could have a much broader perspective and , while , even as an adult , she did n't condone his infidelity , she understood that her parents' relationship was much more complex than she could have ever understood as a child see my article looking at your childhood trauma from an adult perspective shortly after that , sandy contacted her father he was genuinely remorseful for hurting sandy when she was a child over time , they were able to reconcile their relationship getting help in therapy to change the effects of unresolved trauma sandy was able to make healthier choices about the men that she dated eventually , she met a man that she loved and who loved and respected her , and he became her husband conclusion many people avoid attending therapy because they believe that nothing in their life could change because they ca n't change the past even though no one can change the past , we can develop ways in therapy to change the way the effect of the past adult relationships are often based on earlier childhood experiences , both positive and negative when an adult has unresolved childhood trauma , the trauma has an unconscious effect , especially when it comes to choosing partners for a romantic relationship people are often surprised to discover what a significant impact an unresolved childhood trauma can have without therapy , many people spend their whole lives affected by an unresolved trauma without therapy , many people do n't question their assumptions similar to sandy in the vignette above who really believed that all men were dogs therapy can help clients to uncover the unconscious cause of current problems so that they can be free of their traumatic history getting help in therapy if you 're
