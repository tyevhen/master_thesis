i went on a date last night , someone i met online he was attractive intelligent and respectful plus he wants to see me again ! ! ! all the other people i have met over the last year or so i just have n't been able to imagine a future of any kind with this guy was really nice , i was comfortable with him and enjoyed the evening it went really quickly i am trying not to get too excited or carried away , but even if this man is not the one , it has given me hope that i can be happy in a relationship ! !
