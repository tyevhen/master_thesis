it 's been forever since my last post i finally moved , my family stayed with me for two weeks so it did n't really sink in at first i am really close to them all so saying goodbye was really hard harder than i expected it to be , and i have basically been an emotional wreck the past month , especially on thanksgiving i have been writing a solid words a day though so , that 's something i have also been having tons of fun with my best friend , basically netflix marathons and binge eating which leads to the purpose of this post perks of living with your best friend they throw chocolate at you when you 're sad , maybe this is just my friend , but she whips it chocolate can hurt someone to laugh with about your life especially when you 're both twenty one and jobless losers every night is a slumber party we are like actual twelve year olds , we have been watching old 's shows like goosebumps and are you afraid of the dark , and eating bags of halloween candy constant video game buddy zelda , halo , and mine craft in other words we are never bored someone who is up for anything , i wanted to go on the shed roof , to get pictures she was like , kay and let me stand on her shoulders we 're both short someone to get scared over stupid things with dumb shows , the dark , our futures intense late night conversations that we both forget the next morning insults , insults all day long it 's like a competition having someone to be antisocial with we both hate people and doing things , normal things like driving just having someone who always has your back even when your wrong someone who wo n't judge you no matter how much you eat so ya , that about sums it up , and sorry about the gif storm i am just finishing up the last season of 'boy meets world' and i was feeling nostalgic
