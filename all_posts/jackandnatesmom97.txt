do you remember that obsessive , unprepared feeling you had the first time you were taking a trip with your baby as a new parent ? now , multiply that feeling x that s where i am right now , and that s saying something because i was one of the most prepared moms out there the first time we took jack out of town zip lock bags of all favorite snacks , every baby product known to mankind , multiple strollers , pack and play , well you all know but what do you take for a day stay in the hospital in which your autistic toddler is going to be absolutely miserable , likely sleep deprived , and continuously wanting to pull approximately electrodes off of his body ? not to mention the fact that since he s not sick thank god he is not likely to want to sit still at all seriously what ? i got an itinerary from the study coordinator today and discovered that we will be transferred to another room at night time for the sleep study and will have a technician hanging out with us all night this further complicates my packing list , as i will have to choose a small number of things to carry with us each night when we trek over to the lab they have put in for a gluten casein free diet for nate , but i very seriously doubt he will eat much of what they give him the boy has a crazy picky palate , which means that i really need to pack enough food for three days and i need to keep his hands and mind busy a ream of paper would likely accomplish this since he loves to shred paper and dangle it in front of his face right now and i will be bringing paper with us the boy can stim away as much as he needs to this weekend , i have no plans to redirect that behavior it gives him comfort i found several new fidgets on amazon which came today one is a glitter wand clear plastic wand with glitter in water that moves back and forth , one is a water wigglie which you can squeeze i think he will like that and then there are the old standbys , barrel of monkeys this boy can make a chain longer than him ! , and some favorite movies , especially happy feet , a laptop and the ipad i am bringing a book hahahahahahahahaha not likely mommy say some prayers for both of us , but especially nathan pray for no seizure activity , decreased rem cycle length i think , and a smooth process for both of us god i love this little boy , and i just hope that all of this will lead to something positive for him
