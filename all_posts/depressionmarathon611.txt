things are moving i'm feeling a little better i 've been forcing myself to take the next right action , to keep moving forward despite the urge to sit still , and i think it 's made a difference my mood is slightly better , and i think it 's because i 've forced myself out the door yesterday , i made it to an aa meeting i picked up a friend along the way , which forced me to go and stay for the entire meeting afterwards , i went out to breakfast with a couple of other friends they know i 've been struggling , and they were kind to suggest the outing after returning home i crashed on my sofa , as that was a lot of activity for my fogged brain but i survived surviving is the extent of what i 've been doing over the past few days work has been especially difficult i 've been in a state of gray , suspended animation i 've been such a fake i could see myself from the outside looking in , as i performed with one patient after another a performance , that 's what it was i acted as if , and wondered who i was the entire time but again , i survived i did what was required , and in the end , despite feeling like crap in the moment , maybe it helped in the long run who knows ? today , as i start my day , the sky is clear , and the sun is about to rise i doubt i would have noticed that even yesterday so things are maybe , cautiously , looking up i will continue to move as much as i can i 'll fake it if i have to , but hopefully i wo n't have to do that for much longer i wish you all a day of sunshine and serenity keep moving
