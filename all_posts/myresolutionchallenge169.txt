last week 's 'how to de clutter in easy steps' certainly struck a chord with my readers judging by the emails i received a clutter free home makes for a clutter free mind and i'm glad i was able to motivate so many people to feel better about their environments and themselves this is my day job after all ! still concentrating on my 'adopt better habits' challenge i decided to venture outdoors not such a good choice with the torrential rain we 've seen here in the midlands , however it did help with the spade work for this week 's resolution , to grow my own food anyone who knows me will confirm , my home contains no living plants as i have a tendency to kill anything remotely green , so this challenge could be quite interesting a few years ago my dad made me a vegetable patch , he used some old timber and boxed out a part of my garden , my eldest son and i dug over the soil in readiness for the bumper crop of salads and vegetables we were going to grow fast forward three years and we have a bumper crop of weeds and quite an impressive variety too so this week was going to be the turning point for me to adopt a better habit i dodged the rain and with spade in hand tackled the knee high jungle , i turned the soil , i de weeded and i planted the tiny specs of dust that fell from the packet labelled 'lettuce' i watched , i waited and then i got bored and made a cuppa growing your own is not the best activity for an impatient gemini like myself , fortunately i received an email this week which gave me the perfect tools no pun intended to while away the hours douglas mcpherson , author of circus mania , informed me that saturday june th is world juggling day a perfect past time for a restless green fingered wannabe like me douglas assured me that juggling was great for uniting the left and right sides of my brain , apparently his blog www circusmania blogspot co uk has facts about juggling did you know that juggling can burn calories an hour ! there is also a how to guide if you want to give it a go yourself as you can see , my juggling is about as good as my gardening so i will be logging on for a top tip or two by the time my lettuces and potatoes are ready for harvest i should be a pro juggler watch this space what are your top gardening tips ? how do you pass the time between planting and eating ? let me know , i 'd love to hear from you
