for years our mornings have been complete and total chaos my kids with rad wake up ready for battle and come out of their rooms looking for any takers we have a new routine that is working great ! ! first thing i put the mozart on the cd player they get dressed and i absolutely do not say one word if they want breakfast they will get there in time if not they can always go to school in their jammies with an empty stomach while i am fixing breakfast they come and do their strong sitting choice of minutes of strong sitting or minutes of weak sitting http www attachment org ss htm here is nancy thomas' description and instructions on strong sitting they then sit down and eat their scrambled eggs , toast , bacon and large glass of milk protein and calcium are both calming and eggs and milk are full of them afterwards they write in their journals if there is time they may start chores , if not , that is fine it is so much more relaxing than what we used to have and we start our day calm and ready
