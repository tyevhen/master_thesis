this is a nasty hack it 's so useful , though so useful suppose you want to insert a new page a new window object and dom document into your existing page not a new xml fragment or subtree on your current page i'm talking about a whole new page within a page an iframe , in other words the usual drill is to create an iframe node using document createelement and attach it to the current page somewhere but suppose you want to populate the iframe programmatically the usual technique is to start building dom nodes off the iframe 's contentdocument node using dom methods okay , that 's fine , but it 's a lot of drudgery i'm sweating already at some point you 're probably going to start assigning string values to body innerhtml or whatever but then you 're into markup stringification hell is there a javascript programmer among us who has n't frittered away major portions of his or her waking life escaping quotation marks and dealing with line continuation after line continuation in order to stringify some hellish construction , whether it 's a piece of markup or an argument to regexp or whatever ? well all of that is best left to internet explorer programmers if you 're a mozilla user , you can use ex as your get out of stringification jail free card , and you can use a data url to load your iframe without passing through dom hell suppose you want your iframe to contain a small form first , declare it as an xml literal which you can do as follows , using ex mypage html body form action a bunch of markup here form body html now create an iframe to hold it iframe top document createelement iframe now the fun part you just need to populate the iframe , which you can do in one of two ways you can attach the iframe node to the top document , then assign mypage toxmlstring to iframe contentdocument body , or much more fun you can convert mypage to a data url and then set the iframe 's src attribute to that url convert xml object to data url function xmltodataurl thexml var preamble data text html charset utf , var octetstring escape thexml toxmlstring return preamble octetstring dataurl xmltodataurl mypage iframe setattribute src , dataurl load frame attach the iframe to your current page top document body insertbefore iframe , top document body firstchild a shameless hack , as i say it works fine in firefox , though , even with very large data urls i do n't recall the exact size limit on data urls in mozilla , but i seem to remember that it 's megabytes msie , of course , has some wimpy limit like characters maybe it 's changed in ie ? in my opinion , all browsers should support unlimited length data urls , just like they should support ex and must support javascript notwithstanding any of this , microsoft may go to hell
