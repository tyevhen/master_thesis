dear victor , i'm sorry i forgot to wish you happy birthday on the actual date i hear you were rock climbing with clinkshrink and hurt your knee , so i hope you are okay i would email you , but i'm at the hospital , and the computer here does not let me access my email addressbook i 've never understood why that is i would put up a picture for you of pretty rocks or of a birthday cake , but the computer here does n't let me transfer images i would call you , but you do n't have a phone this is a psychiatry blog , not a birthday blog , so perhaps here is where we can find a psychiatric theme in your cell phone free state what does it mean when someone does n't own a cell phone ? it has to mean something , right ? wwfs ? what would freud say ? would freud have a cell phone ? i called your landline and sang , in my own tone deaf sort of way , but you did n't answer that either happy birthday , victor let 's eat !
