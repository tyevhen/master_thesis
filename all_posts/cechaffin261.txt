yes , you 're all here tonight , all the plankton spirits and their keepers , the locavores praising their beets when you are confronted by monsters and every monster is a version of a human that you 've met and every one of those humans gets inside your head and talks , yeah , that really sucks if your beliefs conflict with the truth , open your eyes and tame your heart i felt sorry for a man without feet until i saw a man with no knees , but when i met a man with no hips my compassion tanked if science can duplicate nature , why is natural still used as a promotional quality ? to train the young mind music , math and essays i lay the stone of my foul heart in the lap of your fiery hem aging is not for cowards the more critical a person , the more sensitive we labor under the illusion that life makes sense all our fantasies , religious and otherwise , are directed toward supporting that illusion if we have such a need to make sense , does it make sense that it really does make sense ? the traits you least like in others are your own the key to happiness is to be born with a sunny temperament god is not on your side his is the only side the internet is the virtual end of privacy either live by subsistence in the woods or drop your pants does anyone today really want privacy ? only after celebrity has been achieved norm ball understands these things , but we do n't know if our insights are due to our competitive narcissism and jealousy of celebrity or clear headed cultural observation at a psychological level there are no clean hands though time is relative , happy new year ! ce
