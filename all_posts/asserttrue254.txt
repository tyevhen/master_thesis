secondary structure of the trad gene encoding a mutt hydrolase in truepera radiovictrix in the s , a tin of meat was exposed to a dose of radiation that was thought to be capable of killing all known forms of life , but the meat subsequently spoiled , and deinococcus radiodurans dubbed conan the bacterium by some was isolated from it various members of the deinococcus thermus group have shown themselves to be incredibly hardy , able to survive extremes of temperature and doses of radiation that , frankly , they should n't be able to survive if any group of bacteria were able to survive space travel , this group surely could members of the deinococcus group probably learned their dna repair tricks very early in the history of terrestrial life , before there was sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to support an ozone layer in those times before about one billion years ago , ultaviolet light from the sun would have been strong enough to sterilize almost any exposed surface uv radiation , when it 's strong enough , causes single and double strand breaks in dna just as ionizing radiation from radioisotopes or cosmic rays will how deinococcus manages to survive such radiation is still something of a mystery , although several repair modalities have been elucidated we know that these bacteria have high copy numbers of their genetic material , and this no doubt facilitates repair still , double stranded dna breaks , in most organisms , are quickly fatal if they accumulate it turns out , dna from deinococcus group bacteria is unusually rich in internal intra strand complementarity , which means single strands of dna are capable in theory of folding back on themselves to form elaborate secondary structures of high thermal stability one such structure , for the trad gene of truepera radiovictrix a radiation tolerant member of the deinococcus group , is shown above this particular structure has a c gibbs free energy of minus kcal mol meaning the structure is more likely to form than randomly coiled ssdna and a tm melting temperature of c , meaning it should be thermo stable to around f almost the entire gene folds back on itself the only portion that does n't self anneal is the flat line on the bottom containing bases if the separated strands of truepera dna can assume stable self annealed structures of this type , it would go a long way toward explaining how the organism could survive double stranded breaks fire a random bullet at the dna and you 're bound to hit secondary structure , not canonical b form duplex dna a double strand break in a stem structure might liberate a stem loop from one strand , but the other strand could unfold to form a template for immediate repair of the damaged strand something like this is probably going on in radiation resistant deinococcus members , which have evolved to allow more than the usual secondary structure in their dna
