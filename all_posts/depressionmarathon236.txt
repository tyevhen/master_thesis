it 's been a little while since my last post chalk it up to more pleasantly boring living well that 's not entirely true while i 've been feeling emotionally well , my physical body began a bit of a revolt this week after five runs last week , four of them very encouraging , i was having another really good six mile run on tuesday at mile four , my right soleus muscle the lower part of the calf tied up in a knot of course i failed to heed the warning , choosing instead to continue running , and made what may have been a slight injury into a major one i completed my six miles , but i could barely walk the next day i have n't been able to run since so much for pleasantly boring being injured is tough on my psyche i spent a couple of days wallowing in chocolate and cookies that turns out to be a pretty ineffective strategy for dealing with anything when trying to lose weight and if i do n't lose the extra pounds i gained after my hip surgery my running will suffer i believe it 's called self sabotage i sabotaged my weight loss with chocolate and cookies which ends up sabotaging my running and it all started because i felt like a slug when i was n't able to run does that make any sense ? it does n't to me , but it 's not the first time i 've self sabotaged i do n't quite understand what 's behind it , but i'm glad i'm aware of it it means i can work to change the pattern i'm back on the horse today i'm changing the pattern i went grocery shopping last night and filled my house with good , healthy food and rather than fretting about not being able to run , i got my bike out of the closet this morning i rode hard for almost miles an hour and seventeen minutes of oxygen sucking , heart pounding hard work was just what i needed i feel much better now perhaps pleasantly boring is on its way back into my life i 'll take it
