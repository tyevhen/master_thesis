i do n't know why i am suprised , but the last few days for me have been filled with anxiety i never even thought seriously about preparing for the family get togethers so would n't you know it christmas eve morning when i am supposed to go to a family who ville christmas breakfast , i am in pure panic mode in my closet what if i am sick and ca n't eat anything and i ruin the breakfast ? i know its so important to my sister and i did n't want to be a downer and on my thoughts raced i tried to login to the website but my computer 's battery was dead so i decided to nip it in the bud instead of letting it draw out all day long i simply called my sister up and told her that i was having a lot of anxiety and we would still come , but i may not be able to eat much since i was n't feeling good worst case scenario , i could put it all in a doggy bag and eat it later there it was out in the open , she knew , and i did n't have to try to be perfect anymore and then the wave of anxiety quieted that was the worst of it i still had more ripples here and there , but no more panic attacks christmas morning and this morning i found myself uneasy , but nothing overly serious i am always a mess during the holidays i get so wrapped up in how they need to be perfectly memorialized events that the thought of me ruining them with my anxiety always creeps in i am my own christmas grinch for some reason i feel that if i am sick , it will ruin it for everybody when in reality , if i was really sick , it would really ruin the holidays for me , and most likely just me so i will say it again , being open and honest about your panic and anxiety with those around you always seems to be better for me than trying to hide it and pretending like everything is just fine how was the christmas holiday for everyone else ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like look what i got for christmas ! traveling with anxiety trip if it 's your birthday , you can be more prone to panic my story linkwithin
