this morning i had a great speed workout at a small town track a few miles from here i stopped at the local convenience store for some bananas and a cup of coffee on my way home while filling my coffee cup , i heard someone behind me say my name i turned around to find a former therapist gazing at me , questioning if i was , in fact , etta what a nice surprise ! i was quite happy to see her ! we exchanged a hug and caught up as quickly as we could her family was waiting to take her oldest son to college weird her three kids were small children when heather and i worked together of course that was , we realized , and years ago she was my first psychologist we worked together during the first few years of my illness that was a long time ago though we were only together for a few short minutes , our surprise meeting left me reminiscing all day i 've been reviewing those first couple of years of depression i 've been remembering how quickly this illness came on , how severe and debilitating it became , and how disorienting the whole experience was during those initial years i was sad , bewildered and confused if only i knew then what i know now i'm not going to go into the gory details of those early years that 's not what all this remembering has been about actually , the memories of the pain , the chaos , and the losses have left me with a deep sense of gratitude when i think of those years i am filled with gratitude for where i am today i am so grateful to know what i now know and to have the coping skills i now have i guess years of one illness has made me a bit of an expert on depression i definitely was not an expert back then back then i suffered from depression over time i 've learned a few things , and today i live with depression one day , someday , i hope to be a survivor of it what a wonderful day that will be
