continuing with the recent conversations about the definition of unschooling , and about what terms people use for this educational style of learning through living , i wanted to post something i found here to the frequently voiced complaint that the word unschooling seems negative , this was written years ago and has not been bested lots of people make this point , but i never see the negation as negative in a value judgment sense when i use the word to me unschooling is as positive as unchaining , unbinding , unleashing , unfolding , unfurling , unlimiting all mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me suzanne carter and that , my friends , is a good part of the reason why i happily say unschooling to me , school is a negative word by unschooling myself , i'm setting myself free from the rigid constraints of schooling in all it 's forms ! peace , idzie you might also like why i use labels the term homeschooling sucks unschooling is not relaxed homeschooling a handful of words linkwithin
