some time back i posted a string of seminal thoughts on a new theory of the mind i went on a descartian journey that i never completed but in musing upon those posts i will here assert that will is the central fact of human existence think of thought as a funnel much of it swirls like napkins in the wind some lodges in the cabal of cogitation some becomes focused , and when it does , it must be filtered through the will a sort of binary yes no circuit , and when the will is engaged , that narrow field of deciding , action follows , a new funnel that with one choice can set a course where other decisions follow naturally in support will is incarnation , the incarnation of thought , both cerebral and automatic once in a basketball game someone pushed me from behind and i pivoted and threw a right jab right to his jaw without thinking this is bodily will , the natural instinct of self preservation , the deepest law of the body , hard wired as for cerebral thought , where , for instance , a man mulls over the purchase of a house or the prospect of divorce , much analysis obtains , but only when that analysis is funneled through the will can incarnation result god spoke and the world came to be what is inevitable speech but the pronouncement of incarnation ? when the all powerful speaks a word , thought is not divided from will or action , thus a word is sufficient for creation , but only because that word was willed are you seated ? be still for a moment and contemplate raising your right arm you must have the consent of your arm to lift it a bodily response is required for incarnation will enacts the transfer of thought into reality i forget which th century german philosopher emphasized the will , but i am in agreement i will , therefore i am here is no adlerian intent because the will to power is another matter altogether of what practical value is this , then ? of great practical value by your deeds you shall be judged saith the prophets , from egypt to hammurabi to islam deeds are proof of thought until then thought may be forgiven christ takes it further if a man hates another in his heart he is guilty of murder just so a festering thought can incarnate through the will into the action of murder , and the more the will aligns with the thought , the closer one comes to the deed stop evil before it is realized , in the chambers of the heart and the labyrinths of the mind an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure as a man thinketh , so is he why am i telling you this ? because i was sitting on the porch and these thoughts came to me then the choice of reading in bed or sitting down to blog was presented i willed my body from the porch to the living room , turned the television off and sat down and surprise , my computer opened up to the new post option , a blank screen i had previously indicated to myself that i might want to blog , apparently nevertheless , until i put my fingers to the keyboard it was all a fantasy and briefly , before typing , i thought about reviewing my series on a new theory of the mind , but ultimately i decided that the reader would not be interested except for excerpts , and i had no desire to plow through old posts to retrieve a chestnut or two meanwhile my thought tells me that i am fairly certain about my next post litnet archaeology in researching magazines in which i have been published , i noticed their eventual fates and found a pattern in e zines which has probably not been noted before until then , at kilobunny , ce
