when i added a week of 'no facebook' to my challenge list i honestly did n't think it would be a tough one it was only for days , no problem how wrong could i have been ? i have really missed it , which confirms a niggling suspicion i had about myself i am a social media fanatic cynics will tell us that all this mumbo jumbo social media has caused the fall of our society my own dad ca n't understand why i comment , like pages and post pictures for , and i quote 'the entire world to see' i have tried to explain the privacy settings to him but this is the man who could n't find the 'b' on his keyboard and had to call me ! for me , facebook allows me to interact with my family in yorkshire and my friends who are scattered across the globe on a business level i am able to share news and events about body soul holistics with my clients , as well as people who may not be able to utilise my spa facilities but find my ramblings quite interesting facebook is also great fun as everyone knows , writing is my passion so i follow a number of author 's on facebook as a reader i love the opportunity to interact with the 'real' person , they 're not just a name on the front cover any more you can get involved , join discussions and add your own book reviews it all makes one feel a part of their community as a writer i relish that connection and adore the feedback i receive about my blog , newsletters and stories if oops when my first novel is published , i know having that reader author relationship will help me to create better stories and characters if anyone wants to follow some amazing authors , i can highly recommend the following authors who are on facebook www facebook com howtoeatloadsandstayslim della galton www lossdeplott com stephan j myers so a week without facebook could you cope ? i have friends who log on intermittently , i have friends who last logged on in and i have friends who , like me , stay logged on and comment every thirty seconds in my humble opinion you get out of social media what you are prepared to put in i love sharing some of the affirmation pages as i know which quote will be just what one friend may need the funny sayings i share often receive multiple 'likes' or re shares which means we all have a warped sense of humour anything 'beer' related gets a great response such as my recent photo post ca n't risk my beer getting warm ! anything child related gets an 'omg how much have they grown ' this is normally followed by a direct mail catch up with friends living in oz i never get the time difference right sorry girls ! facebook makes the world a smaller and more intimate place old friends , new friends , colleagues , clients , celebrities , fans and of course family are only a click away take five minutes to evaluate your own facebook page , cull any acquaintances who do n't make you feel good or post status 's like 'big shop done for another week' actually i think i may have posted that once ! re kindle friendships and support one another 's business ventures and successes , follow interesting pages where you learn something new every day comment on photographs , laugh at the funny stuff and embrace the social media age my challenge to you is this why not give facebook up for a week it will either kill or cure you of your social media habits kill i miss the news , views and updates and will never be without my facebook family again my name is and i am a facebook addict and proud of it cure not a problem , i did n't miss it and with all that extra time i wrote an epic novel and now have a multi million pound publishing deal ! go on join in , have fun and while you 're at it why not 'like' my page , i 'd love to say hello
