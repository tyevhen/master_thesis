it 's a day i always dread , yet by early december , i ca n't wait for it to arrive , for once it 's upon me , i can begin to look for the light again from the moment we turn our clocks back , i dread the oncoming and ever increasing darkness here in the far north , darkness is a prime complication of winter december st is the shortest and therefore darkest day of the year i hate the long dark like many with depression , i much prefer the sun , the light , and the energy of longer days yesterday , the sun officially rose at am and set at pm our day was only hours and minutes long almost of yesterday was darkness the high temp was a whopping one degree fahrenheit , and the wind chill hovered in the to degree range , but it was the darkness of which my depression riddled brain took note like i said , i both dread and anticipate december st every year it is equal parts culmination and initiation we culminate the dark and initiate the light it is a unique day , and i'm very glad it 's passed six months of darkness fading are ahead what a beautiful reality
