oh , actually , i love my work i love seeing patients for therapy and i 've seen over and over how helpful medications can be , so i'm glad i can prescribe them , and i love that most people feel better or they quietly move on and i do n't know so far , i chose the right profession hoping that holds for a while i entered college with plans to become a psychologist i did n't really get the differences between a research psychologist and a clinical psychologist my university also offered a major called the biological basis of behavior , and there was a strong graduate program in experimental psychology but not clinical psychology i thought i wanted to be a researcher , and i majored in both psychology and bbb as it was called at the end of my second year , i had the thought that i would like to do research but i 'd like to see patients as well there was no one to tell me that clinical psychologists can do both , and so i figured that going to medical school and becoming a psychiatrist would give me more options down the road so i went to medical school in new york city , where psychiatrists back then were often psychoanalysts and i 'd never even heard the terms med management or split treatment and i became a doctor , then moved to maryland and became a psychiatrist i liked that there were so many options , and i realized i really liked seeing patients and that research was more about writing grants and praying you got them and concerns with data in a way that i'm not primed for back then , i had no idea that social workers did psychotherapy as a medical student , and even as a psychiatry resident , i saw social workers do family therapy on the inpatient unit and arrange for discharge planning , help patients obtain benefits , and arrange for aftercare programs i was well into residency training before i realized that psychotherapy was mostly done by social workers i had no idea that there would ever be any expectation that i would see patients an hour and confine my work to asking about symptoms and side effects , much less the time consumption that filling out paperwork soon to be computer work would become in clinic settings i brought this up because we 've been talking about capitated care versus fee for service care on an earlier post i think the capitated care folks are winning so far , they seem to like their system but in , in capitated care systems , psychiatrists do management , they do n't do psychotherapy where would that leave me ? am i worried ? no , there seems to be a demand for what i do , and neither presidential candidate has come knocking at my door for suggestions , so i'm just hanging out to wait and see i am feeling a bit obsolete and like somehow , i ended up on the wrong train what do you think ?
