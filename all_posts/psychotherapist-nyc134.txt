understanding and developing insight into your problems is important but , unfortunately , it 's often not enough to change your problems see my article healing from the inside out why understanding your problems is n't enough why you ca n't think yourself into wellness many people either never go to therapy to deal with emotional problems and many others leave therapy prematurely because they believe they can think themselves into wellness see my article when clients leave therapy prematurely there 's no denying that understanding and developing insight into your problems is important , but it 's only the first step you use your logical mind to understand and try not to repeat the same problems , if it 's in your power but when your problems are deeply rooted in psychological trauma , your logical mind often is n't enough you need help from a licensed mental health professional to help resolve on the underlying problems that go beyond the logical part of your brain you need a skilled therapist to help you deal with the problem on the level of the emotional brain let 's take a look at a fictionalized vignette that illustrates these points ed ed grew up in a family that was nearly destroyed by his father 's gambling he saw first hand how the family struggled whenever his father lost money at casinos when ed was , his mother threatened to leave the father if he did n't stop gambling , so the father stopped going to the casinos instead , he started drinking heavily cross addiction switching one addiction for another ed 's mother resigned herself to being in a marriage with a man who came home and locked himself in his man cave in the basement and drank every night she was relieved that , at least , she could pay the bills but they continued to drift apart as is often the case when people give up an addiction without getting help for the underlying issues , drinking replaced the gambling and led to the father having a fatal heart attack when he was in his early s by that time , ed was a successful manager at a top company in nyc and married to a woman that he met in college looking at ed from the outside , it appeared to most people that ed had it all see my article but ed had a big secret that he was very ashamed of whenever he got paid , he made big bets on sports events sometimes he won , and sometimes he lost but no one , except the person who placed bets for him , knew about his betting , not even his wife sometimes , to cover his losses , he had to withdraw money from his savings then , he was desperate to recoup his losses and he would frantically place more bets logically , ed knew that he needed to stop betting , but he could n't control his impulses he kept chasing his losses and if he won , he wanted to win more one day , his wife , nina , happened to look at their bank statement and she was shocked to see such a low balance compared to what had been in the account only a few months ago normally , she did n't look at the statements because let ed manage their finances so , when she saw the balance , her first thought was that either the bank made a mistake or someone hacked into their account when ed got home , she showed him the statement and asked him what he thought had happened at first , he hung his head and did n't respond , and nina began to feel sick why you ca n't think yourself into wellness reluctantly , ed told her about his gambling problem and that he had been withdrawing the money nina went into the bedroom and began to cry ed tried to convince her that he had a good feeling about an upcoming football game and he knew he would win he only wanted to place one more bet to recoup his losses and then he would stop ed and nina argued for most of the night , and both of them called out sick from work the next day after being up all night , ed promised nina that he would never bet again he apologized profusely for keeping these secrets and betraying her nina responded by telling ed to seek help in therapy but ed knew what he needed to do he needed to stop gambling he told nina that he did n't need a therapist to tell him this he could do it on his own for the next few months , whenever the person who placed his bets called him to find out it he wanted to place a bet , ed told him that he was n't going to bet anymore each time , when he got off the phone , ed felt dejected and tired , as if he was physically ill after a while , ed began to feel bored and depressed he was tempted to place a bet on a basketball game , but he told himself over and over that he had promised his wife that he would n't do it , so he could n't do it but he knew that he really wanted to do it , so he struggled with this internal conflict then , one day , one of his colleagues , jim , called ed into his office and showed him a picture of a sexy , beautiful woman ed knew jim 's family and he knew the woman in the picture was n't jim 's wife , so he asked him about the woman jim closed the office to his door and told ed about the woman , who was with an escort service he told ed in a low voice that he saw this woman from the escort service every few weeks and since he started seeing her , he felt on top of the world he said she told him that he was sexy and attractive and he felt like a million bucks then , jim told ed that he should call the service and have fun with one of the beautiful escorts he told him that they 're very discrete and his wife would never know ed laughed it off , but the image of the beautiful , sexy woman stayed in his mind he fantasized about how much fun it would be to be with her the more he thought about the happier he felt when ed realized that he was feeling so good by just thinking about it , he told himself that he could try the service once and then never do it again he would n't tell anyone about it , not even jim it would be his secret see my articles infidelity married , bored and cheating and overcoming addiction boredom as a relapse trigger at the time , ed did n't know about cross addiction and how a person could replace one addiction , like gambling , with another addiction , like sexual addiction months later , his wife discovered an ad for an escort service in the pocket to ed 's jeans as she was doing laundry and got very upset when ed got home , she threw the ad on his lap ed froze and remained silent a week later , ed began therapy with a psychotherapist who specialized in working with addictions , even though he was n't convinced that he needed to be in therapy over time , ed learned about cross addiction and remembered that his father stopped gambling and began drinking heavily he also began doing the necessary work to understand the underlying issues that were part of his addiction , in addition to the possible genetic component , and what triggered him why you ca n't think yourself into wellness the work was n't easy or quick but , gradually , ed began to realize that he could n't just think himself into wellness he could n't just tell himself not to gambling or engage in sex with escorts because that was n't enough to override the deeper emotional issues that had to be worked through in therapy as he worked through the underlying emotional trauma and became aware of his triggers , ed 's impulse to gamble or have sex with escorts began to diminish because the underlying issues were getting worked on at the same time , ed knew that he could never allow himself to become complacent and , along with therapy , he also attended gambler 's anonymous and worked the steps with a sponsor conclusion there 's a common misperception that if you understand your problems , you can avoid making the same mistakes while this might be true for certain problems , when you 're dealing with more complex issues that have involve unconscious underlying issues , just telling yourself to stop is n't enough you might have the best intentions of never engaging in this behavior again , but it 's not enough as many people know who have tried to stop engaging in addictive or dysfunctional behavior , it 's very easy to replace one dysfunctional behavior with another , as the vignette above illustrates whether it 's gambling , sexual addiction or any other addictive behavior , you can get the same dopamine rush from many different types of dysfunctional behavior and this makes it difficult to stop until you work through the underlying issues and discover your triggers , you will , most likely , continue to struggle or white knuckle it for a while , risking your relationship , your family , your job and everything that is precious to you getting help in therapy it 's not easy asking for help see my article overcoming your fear of asking for help it 's much easier to be in denial and to tell yourself that you can do it on your own many people wait until they lose everything before they seek help , but it does n't have to be that way see my article the myth about having
