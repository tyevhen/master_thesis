photo by blmurch yep , my hubby got fired this week from his job the stress is horrible so many thoughts race through your head what are we going to do for money ? what can i do to comfort him ? what kind of changes are we going to have to make to our budget ? are we going to have to move ? am i handling this the right way ? should i be angry ? the list goes on also , i think this would be a great time for him to go back to school , but he is still deciding i have told him my thoughts several times , but i can only nag so much and its his life its so much easier for me to say what to do when i do n't have to do it so for now we will see what happens honestly i think its a blessing because the company he worked for was horrible and did n't appreciate his hard work at all plus now he can hopefully find something he loves doing or like i said , finish school i have tried to be very supportive and loving i have tried not to worry too much because i know he can find another job easily if he needs one soley to pay the bills its still stressful though i am not sleeping well lately at all my latest favorite song on the radio is by sara bareiles , called love song and the first few lines of the lyrics are , head under water and they tell me to breathe easy for a while the breathing gets harder , even i know that hits home right about now has anyone ever had a spouse in this same position , and if so , how did you handle it ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like what to do when feeling overwhelmed we must see past what it seems my story celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip linkwithin
