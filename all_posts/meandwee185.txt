we 've lived in our house for almost exactly years and have n't done anything yet to make it ours the house was only years old when we bought it and all the choices and window treatments are from the previous owners we 're finally getting around to making some changes around here , so as we go ahead i 'll be sure to show you some before and afters i hated these brass colored candle light fixture thingies over the mantle barf they are fine for someone else just not for me do n't you also love all the random crap we threw on the mantle ? it 's mostly sticker books that i do n't want paige going nutzo with when i'm not looking so , we got some polished nickel sconces at home depot for about bucks apiece and chris installed them pretty quickly they are also on a dimmer switch which is nice to still have ahh , much better i need to find a new big thing to put on our mantle i'm not loving the painting anymore hmmm i welcome your thoughts on that i'm looking for something large , more interesting and more meaningful save
