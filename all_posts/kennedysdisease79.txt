i believe that most people are generally good and want to be helpful i can recount many experiences where someone came to my rescue most often , a family member , neighbor , or friend was there to help me out however , what impresses me the most is the stranger that helps and then wanders off never to be seen again i can just say , thank you , and hope he or she understands how important their help was to me at that moment i had two experiences , however , where i needed help and a person or persons ignored me i am sure these two stories are not unique and that others living with kennedy 's disease have had similar experiences fortunately , there are many more positive stories and in these two cases , someone was there to help philadelphia airport everyone knows how hectic flying can be especially on a friday afternoon everyone is anxious to get home and any delays just make matters worse i was flying back from atlanta around pm on a friday when we arrived at the terminal , i was the second person in line when the flight attendant opened the hatch i noticed that the jet way floor was about four inches lower than the hatch i slowed and reached out to each side to lower myself down when i was nudged from behind my foot was almost on the jet way ramp when it happened and the contact caused my knee to buckle i went down and my overcoat and briefcase went flying i rolled over just in time to see a mass of people stepping out of the plane the horde never slowed down as they stepped around or over me heading up the ramp i knew it would take me a couple of minutes to regain my strength so i crawled over to the side and tried to gather my possessions people continued to flood out of the plane and most everyone saw me sitting there , but no one bothered to stop and ask if i needed assistance after five minutes or so and dozens of people passing me , a man stepped off the plane and made eye contact with me he asked if i needed a hand when i said yes , he yelled back to the flight attendant at the door to hold the people back a moment he then reached down and helped me up the flight attendant then came out and walked with me up the ramp to make certain i was fine i will never forget how thoughtful the man was and he will never know how much i appreciated him taking the time to help montreal hotel i was on a business trip in canada i had a busy day where i toured a couple of warehouses miles of walking and many stairs and visited a few customers that evening we had a seven course customer appreciation dinner at a five star hotel downtown not to be named except to say that it had something to do with british royalty it was a cold day and i was fatigued that afternoon my legs were a little wobbly i pulled up in front of the hotel 's main entrance , gave my keys to the parking attendant , and grabbed my bags as i walked over to the revolving door , i noticed two steps that needed navigating in order to enter the hotel the way i was feeling at the time , those two steps looked like a mountain there was a finely dressed bellman right inside the door and i tried to get his attention without any success i was already cold , so i tried to step up while leaning forward to grab the door handle hoping to use it as leverage halfway through the motion , my knee just would not hold me up and i went down in the fall , i wrenched my knee causing a shooting pain through the leg sitting on the first step , i found i was too fatigued to get up , so i slid over to the side to rest meanwhile , the finely dressed bellman just stood inside and watched me the only thing i could conclude was that he must have felt i was drunk or something fortunately , after only a few minutes a man stepped out of the hotel and saw me sitting on the steps i was hard to miss he asked if i needed assistance and when i said yes , he raised his hand to signal the bellman the bellman almost flew out the door to help the two lifted me up and helped me inside as i put weight on the leg , the man noticed i was limping badly and asked if the bellman should call a doctor i said i was okay now that i was standing and thanked him for his help they helped me to a chair so i could rest for several minutes before trying to register before stepping away , the bellman mentioned that if i needed his help , i should not hesitate to ask for the two men mentioned above that were there for me when i needed some help , i again want to say ,
