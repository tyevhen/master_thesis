my september article , unexpected benefit , explained the results of my experiment of daily foot massages for several years , the bottoms of my feet and toes have been numb or tingly i tried different techniques to stimulate the nerves , but nothing seemed to work in early august , the feet were particularly bad one evening , i used my hands to massage my feet the feet were more sensitive than i thought they would be when i performed a deep tissue massage at times , it was slightly painful yet , they felt better afterward modern reflexology reported the follows signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy gradual onset of numbness and prickling or tingling in your feet or hands , which can even spread to the entire length of your legs and feet sharp shooting , jabbing , throbbing , freezing or burning pain unable to control movements touch sensitivity that sometimes reaches extreme levels weakness of muscles or paralysis if motor nerves are affected it has been five months since i started the daily massages it only takes minutes my feet no longer tingle and are not numb i can feel all my toes and they have better movement when i massage the feet , it is no longer painful it is actually enjoyable i also notice that my feet do not feel as cold that would make sense since the massage should be stimulating the circulation it is nice to be able to feel the bottom of my feet and toes it makes standing easier i still experience an occasional numbness in my right pinky finger , but it is not constant however , my finger strength has improved with the daily routine has anyone else tried this ? what is your experience and results ? photo modernreflexology com
