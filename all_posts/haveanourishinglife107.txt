so many times i want to quit because i think i am not good enough i am a really good quitter i might even quit this blog sometimes i feel good about my writing i think it is helping people and effectively getting across the message i want to get across most of the time , however , i feel like i am rambling into an empty abyss and not making sense at all i could come up with thousands of reasons to quit this blog people have worse problems than me who wants to hear about my wimpy ness my page is amateur , people probably think the whole thing is lame , i am not a good enough writer , i am not savvy with webpage writing and html script , and so on and so on the moment after i decide to quit blogging , god reminds me that i am a rusty tool meaning , i am not perfect or in the best of shape like an old tool in your garage however , just because i don t look the best doesn t mean he can t use me in his workshop the term rusty tool is from the militia immaculata or military for the immaculate conception founded by st maximilian kolbe it is a movement of the catholic church for lay people and consecrated alike thousands of people have enrolled in the m i and are spreading the good news of the gospel through the devotion to the blessed virgin mother if you want to check out the m i , you can view their website here if you d like to learn more , you can email me at craigmaryborchers at gmail dot com i d be more than happy to give you information so , for the time being , i ll keep plugging along with this blog i ll keep going because , i believe , god can use me as an instrument to work in other people s lives even if i don t think i am doing a good job even if i feel rusty and old and useless , i can still work i am still alive and capable of , at least , trying to do my best he can still use me to bring about a greater good god can work miracles , even today but he needs our cooperation we don t have to be perfect to cooperate with god s will we just have to be open by sharing my difficulties and sufferings with others , god can use my imperfections to bring about a greater good i shouldn t stop working with god , just because i do n't think i'm good enough one way i remind myself of this truth is by purposefully not making my blog the best it can be for example , i don t mind typos it s a good reminder for me that i am not perfect this is just a blog it doesn t have to be perfect i am human just like you if the typo changes the whole meaning of the sentence or what i am trying to say , then i ll fix it otherwise i ll just let it go it s challenging sometimes , but it is good practice for me to not give in to my perfectionist tendencies and it helps me to keep things in perspective
