i ll be quoting a few pieces from the actual legal document stating claims against johnson johnson in the tmap case the lawsuit alleges that j j i ll just generically refer to the defendants as j j aka johnson johnson throughout this post unduly influenced at least one mental health program decision maker to become a chief proponent of risperdal s inclusion in the tmap protocol and to help secure tmap s adoption and implementation additionally , after tmap s initial adoption by texas mental health program decision makers , an implementation project was developed to facilitate the expansion of tmap throughout texas the defendants continued their financial support of and improper influence in the tmap project through this implementation plan , also know sic as the texas medication of medication algorithms , or tima as a result of the continuing improper relationship between defendants and at least one texas mental health program decision maker , defendant s product , risperdal , received a preferential recommendation as a medication of choice for children on the tcmap algorithms used to treat children and adolescents defendants product did not have an fda indication for use in children and adolescents when it was placed on the tcmap algorithms one more defendants bypassed governmental safeguards and scientific review by promoting tmap and the related child and adolescent algorithms , tcmap as treatment models developed by panels of experts defendants relied upon paid consultants on their expert consensus panels , peer to peer , or viral , marketing strategies , and administrative decisions made by a select few public officials to facilitate the adoption of tmap like programs in other states to date , at least seventeen states , including texas , have implemented tmap or are in the process of doing so in effect , tmap became the standard bearer for defendants risperdal marketing plan here s the lowdown tmap is allegedly based on expert consensus but , the lawsuit is essentially saying that these experts were , in some cases , acting as paid j j shills these folks were wined , dined , and received payments from j j while putting the tmap related materials together how many of the experts and government officials were in on this ? that will hopefully come out during the legal proceedings as lilly learned earlier this week , release of company documents often makes for some pretty bad pr i am by no means stating that more than a few of these experts or governmental officials were on the take if the correct wheels are greased , one needs not bother to bribe everyone you can bet there will be more on this
