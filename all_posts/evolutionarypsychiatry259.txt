what with the very recent post link from panu , and chris kresser tweeting and facebooking eesh is that a word ? my last post thanks chris ! , it looks like i have some new readers hi ! i can understand you not wanting to go back through some odd posts to catch up , but a lot of my posts build on previous ones , which have built on previous ones well , i would n't want anyone to miss out and one of my goals of this blog is to break down these topics so that the layperson can understand it sometimes i am more successful at that than other times , but i do n't want to keep repeating myself , either so here we are , an evolutionary psychiatry primer , if you will basic premise includes monetary disclaimer , for giggles one of the key factors in studying obesity and metabolism is the idea that inflammation is the root of all evil well , it turns out the same is true of depression and other mental illness here are a couple starter posts for that depression inflammation boogaloo , and depression crashed your party here 's one related to autism another theme of my blog is how mental illness is changing over time as an example , back in the age of large asylums , a great many folks with schizophrenia were of the hebrephrenic type meaning they were disorganized and silly , and generally obstinate in recent times the hebrephrenic type has essentially disappeared i 've seen only one in my career no one knows why as far as i know perhaps it is particularly responsive to medication , perhaps it was due to some sort of severe vitamin deficiency issue that general vitamin repletion has fixed in society at large all total speculation changes like that in mental illness interest me , especially changes that have escalated with the escalation of obesity and metabolic syndrome , because that says diet to me here 's a post on the history of depression depression not quite what it used to be here 's one about eating disorders here 's some important stuff about the links between metabolic syndrome and depression chronic stress is chronic illness and stress is metabolic syndrome if you want the basics on how neurons work , look at ketogenic diets and bipolar disorder here 's my most popular post by a lot and requires no explanation your brain on ketones one of my themes is that a single nutrient on its own is rarely the answer we need an anti inflammatory diet rich with nutrients and do the best we can to control sleep and stressful lifestyle factors as well alzheimer 's pathology and the dementia free kitavans is a bit heavy , but makes the point here 's another self explanatory one your brain on omega s so i think that pretty much covers the bare bones basics however , if you have a particular interest , i encourage you to check out my post map , which more or less has everything broken down by condition or nutrient and , last but not least , a few of my favorite posts though i'm narcissistic enough to like quite a lot of them , perhaps i 'd be better off writing less and thinking revising consolidating more ! zombieland the evolution of serotonin that tapeworm ate your depression the case for evolution genius and madness
