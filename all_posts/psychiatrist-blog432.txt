yesterday , i heard dr glenn treisman talk at the department of psychiatry 's grand rounds at johns hopkins on what is a doctor you 'd think we 'd all know what a doctor is , but dr treisman always has a unique and humorous slant to those obvious slices of life his talk was about the forces pulling physicians to look out for the best interests of the patient , while also looking out for the best financial interests of the institution they work for as well as the best financial interests of society he threw in some historical references and his talks are always entertaining as well as informative at the beginning of any professional presentation , the doctor must disclose any conflicts of interest in other words , if he receiving any money from pharmaceutical companies dr treisman started his talk with a series of disclosure slides which reflected both his wit and a statement of the problem he let me borrow them to reprint here first slide i am engaged in doctor patient relationships that i was taught ethically constrain me to work in the best interest of my patient i work in an institution that was founded by johns hopkins to provide care to the poor and indigent of east baltimore i have been instructed to provide excellence in my work second slide i am paid by johns hopkins which has directed me to decrease the time patients are in the hospital maximize reimbursement for hospitalization maximize the revenue i generate i am barraged by cost saving efforts by insurance companies that use bullying insurance reviewers and time wasting paperwork barriers to decrease the delivery of the care i recommend for my patients third slide i have been recently informed that i am a steward of resources and that i need to conserve medical resources i have been recently informed that patient satisfaction is the coin of the realm i have been informed that my ryan white funding is contingent on efficient care shorter visits and improved measurable outcome targets fourth slide i have been informed that i am to use evidence based interventions and follow guidelines and protocols that i find less than optimal for many of my patients some of these conflicts of interest may have affected the views and information presented in this presentation , or perhaps are the subject ah , dr treisman has a lot of disclosures , touched with a little sarcasm , but he does a good job of illustrating the conflicting pressures doctors are being put under to act as agents for society and institutions in ways that conflict with being the advocate for the best interest of the patient so that you know , he works with aids patients in an outpatient clinic , and with inpatients on one of the country 's two psychiatric inpatient pain units his patients travel from all over the country to be admitted to this unit , often arrive in a state of desperation , and the struggles with insurance companies to permit their care are considerable just a word on the graphic it 's from a show called get smart the 's perhaps about a spy named maxwell smart who had his phone in his shoe it 's where i learned about double agents i figured i needed to explain this one
