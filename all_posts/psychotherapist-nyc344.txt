guilt and shame are two emotions that are often confused , but there are basic differences between them in earlier articles about shame , including overcoming shame , i discussed shame , what it is , what causes shame , and what can be done to overcome shame in this article , i will describe the differences between guilt and shame and give examples to clarify those differences shame vs guilt let 's take a look at the differences between guilt and shame differences between guilt and shame shame is a pervasive feeling about oneself vs guilt which is usually about behavior whereas shame is often a pervasive , negative feeling that people have about themselves that can be emotionally crippling in severe cases i'm a bad person , guilt is n't a feeling about oneself it 's a feeling about a particular behavior i did something bad shame has no redeeming qualities whereas guilt can lead to taking responsibility and to change there are no redeeming qualities to being ashamed of oneself when people feel ashamed , they feel badly about themselves and it often makes them want to isolate or avoid whatever makes them feel ashamed shame about oneself can actually cause someone to avoid looking at whatever s he feels ashamed about but feeling guilty can force someone to look at himself or herself and take responsibility for negative behavior feeling guilty can have redeeming aspects to it if it leads to people making amends for things they feel badly about doing feeling guilty can lead to making an effort to reconcile with others and to making other changes guilt can help people to avoid making similar mistakes in the future shame can be longstanding whereas guilt is often transitory whereas feeling guilty about a particular behavior is often temporary , feeling ashamed often goes to the core of how a person feels about him or herself shame can contribute to depression and anxiety feeling ashamed can contribute to mental health problems , like depression and anxiety , because it 's an overall pervasive feeling about oneself it usually goes to the core of how people feel about themselves , whereas guilt usually does not affect people in this way examples of the difference between shame and guilt shame joe felt ashamed because he felt so socially inept that he avoided attending gatherings , including the funeral service for his friend 's mother feeling ashamed and avoiding people and situations his shame had a snowballing effect because not only did he avoid the funeral , but he felt so ashamed of himself that he avoided calling his friend or going to places where he knew his friend would be after a while , joe and his friend became estranged , which made joe feel even more ashamed guilt sharon felt guilty that she did n't go to her friend 's mother 's funeral service because the timing was too close to her own mother 's death and it was too hard for her feeling guilty and apologizing but she called her friend in advance to express her condolences and offered to see her one on one when she knew her friend would be alone and feeling lonely after everyone else had gone her friend accepted her apology and they remained close friends shame betty suffered with a lot of shame because she gained lbs over the last year due to overeating her doctor recommended that betty see a nutritionist to change her eating habits , seek help in therapy to overcome the underlying issues to her overeating , and go to the gym to exercise but betty felt that her weight gain made her ugly feeling ashamed , isolated and immobilized instead of taking steps to lose weight , she isolated herself at home and continued to berate herself for gaining the weight this , in turn , made her feel more ashamed and she continued to overeat to deal with her pervasive feelings of shame it became a vicious cycle guilt cindy felt guilty about overeating for the last year and gaining lbs her doctor advised her that cindy needed to take steps to lose the weight for health reasons cindy knew that she was successful at losing weight in the past and that she could do it again feeling guilty but taking steps to get healthy rather than dwelling on the fact that she had been overeating , she made a commitment to her doctor and to herself to make important lifestyle changes to get healthy then , she made an appointment with a nutritionist to develop better eating habits she contacted a therapist to deal with the underlying issues involved with her overeating she also began going to the gym three times a week whenever she was tempted to overeat , she remembered how guilty she felt in the past , and she used that feeling to motivate herself to change as she lost weight and got healthier , she felt more motivated to continue getting healthier shame and guilt can be difficult to handle on your own while it might be easier to overcome feelings of guilt , as compared to feelings of shame , they can both be difficult to overcome on your own getting help in
