after dinah and i got trapped temporarily at roy 's place i had this sudden mental image of all three shrink rappers homebound together in a snowstorm dinah baking cookies , roy tweaking the blog template and me climbing the walls it occurred to me that we have a diagnosis for people who have trouble leaving the house agoraphobia but we do n't call it an illness if somebody goes crazy being at home for a long time i know people who always have to be on the go after a day or two of hanging around the house , or sometimes a few hours , they have to get up and move around or at least take a walk they 're out shopping with friends or going out to lunch or otherwise on the move me , i have learned the art of being a homebody it was a necessary skill in my early days when a really good blizzard could strand you , doors drifted shut , for two or three days at a time i'm convinced that upper mid westerners became laid back and easy going through natural selection anyone who could n't handle several days together in close quarters just killed each other off regardless , it 's now an innate trait for some of us some people describe themselves as homebound the stay at home mom for example but i know from my parent friends that stay at home moms are rarely at home they 're on the road constantly to and from doctor 's appointments , school , sporting events and children 's social activities we also now have the 'stay cation' , people who spend their vacations at home because of the economic downtown however , even stay cationers are n't in the house the entire time they 're taking day trips or sightseeing local attractions they do n't usually go to they 're just not going as far as they usually go we 've even invented gender based words for being a homebody women nest , men retreat to their man caves i cringe a bit at this , with the implication that for women to justify nesting they have to have kids , or that men need a place presumably to grunt , watch sports and scratch places they would n't scratch in public but there you have it , that 's our culture , and mainly i was just amused when the pleasure of being at home became a fad my innate instincts had become trendy the key to being happy at home is to first relieve yourself from the guilt of doing nothing if you look around and all you see are the dust bunnies and a kitchen that needs to be renovated , that 's a problem if you ca n't rid your mind of all the errands the dusting , the bills to be paid , the unpacked boxes leftover from your move several years ago it 's going to be hard to be comfortable in your nest personally , all i need is a quilt , a good book and a place to curl up and a good snowstorm
