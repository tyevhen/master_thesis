we have had a relatively event free month all done first of all , jack has not slept more than an hour and a half in a row in the past week and a half he has even taken this a step further and will not sleep at all unless i am in the bed with him last night i woke up about times with him at one point i found him sitting on me reading a magazine we have his iep meeting on thursday i am a nervous wreck i know he needs a full time aid i have no idea how to accomplish this i am embarassed to say this however i need an advocate for him he does not have discipline issues , he is not a risk to the school i need to prove to the powers that be that he needs this aid for attention issues and motor issues to accomplish his educational goals his teacher freely states that he is falling behind academically because he cannot focus on his work i have letters from his pediatrician and his private ot i have samples of his work from the past few months with and without the aid i know this is not enough i am doing all the research i can , and unfortunately all of this research has told me i need the advocate that i am not going to be listened to i am a basketcase advocates cost thousands of dollars we also have our next appointment with the developmental pediatrician this friday lab results , more tests i am sure , and more meds oh , and before that , nate and i are going to be videotaped playing again so that should be fun we also have the hour day at the seed study coming up thus my post of facebook this morning i have decided i no longer want to be an adult if anyone needs me i will be in my couch cushion and bed sheet fort coloring awesome
