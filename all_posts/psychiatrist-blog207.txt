there was an op ed in the new york times recently by the executive director of the colorado department of corrections about the hours he chose to spent in solitary confinement ad seg , i think is what our forensic friends call it see my night in solitary confinement in a similar experiment , psychiatrist blogger simple citizen spent a day going through the motions of being a patient on a residential treatment unit where he is the psychiatrist he details his experiences in my day as a patient i do n't believe these experiences are anything like the real thing , nor do i believe they are meant to be for one thing , the person having them has not gone through the lifetime of events , traumas , distresses that led the inmate or patient to be in those places or in the case of the patient , the doctor also is not experiencing both the internal discomfort that comes with the mental illness , or the side effects which come with the medications , or the emotional upheaval that comes from having been left there by their family , and the insecurities that come with being a teenager or any brand and they both get to go home why , dr simple citizen , do the kids have to stand on line facing straight ahead without talking while they wait for breakfast ? what 's wrong with talking ? still , i like that these people did this , it 's good that they want to try to understand what their charges are going through even if it 's not a complete understanding , it still acknowledges that the condition is different with a willingness to see and understand what the other is going through , for better or for worse on a completely different note , simple citizen pointed me to his post by mentioning in our comment section that he used to work at an involuntary state hospital what 's an involuntary hospital ? i ask because clink has pointed out to me that the rates of patients in public facilities varies greatly , state by state , for involuntary hospitalization wait , so there are facilities that only take involuntary patients ? in our state hospitals in maryland , at this point , the vast majority of beds are for forensic patients you get there by way of a judge if you have a chronic , severe psychiatric disorder requiring long term treatment which you 'd like to get voluntarily , you 're out of luck , we do n't do that or if you have a chronic , severe , intractable condition which makes it so you ca n't live in the community , you may have no where to go but when we did have state hospitals , many of the patients were there voluntarily , and some got better and discharged in a matter of weeks so i'm perplexed about a hospital that only has involuntary patients , what if they want to sign in ? help me out here , simple citizen and others
