a colleague sent me an e mail this morning about a story that focuses on changing the commitment standard to a need for treatment rather than dangerousness she asked me if i thought it would be an effective measure so that more people with psychosis are treated decreasing the risk of mass violence perpetrated by psychotic persons as a background , most states have civil commitment statutes that involve imminent dangerousness that literally means that the person in question has already done something dangerous or they appear to be at high risk for doing something dangerous in the near future my first reaction is that it would not do a thing and here is why states routinely ignore lesser standards and default to dangerousness because it limits court and treatment costs at least until there is a bad outcome and then for a while the standard is broadened again let me illustrate what i mean by using the statutes that pertain to civil commitment in the state of minnesota the following are the statutory definitions of a mentally ill or chemically dependent person who could be considered for civil commitment in the state subd person who is mentally ill a a person who is mentally ill means any person who has an organic disorder of the brain or a substantial psychiatric disorder of thought , mood , perception , orientation , or memory which grossly impairs judgment , behavior , capacity to recognize reality , or to reason or understand , which is manifested by instances of grossly disturbed behavior or faulty perceptions and poses a substantial likelihood of physical harm to self or others as demonstrated by a failure to obtain necessary food , clothing , shelter , or medical care as a result of the impairment an inability for reasons other than indigence to obtain necessary food , clothing , shelter , or medical care as a result of the impairment and it is more probable than not that the person will suffer substantial harm , significant psychiatric deterioration or debilitation , or serious illness , unless appropriate treatment and services are provided a recent attempt or threat to physically harm self or others or recent and volitional conduct involving significant damage to substantial property b a person is not mentally ill under this section if the impairment is solely due to epilepsy developmental disability brief periods of intoxication caused by alcohol , drugs , or other mind altering substances or dependence upon or addiction to any alcohol , drugs , or other mind altering substances subd chemically dependent person chemically dependent person means any person a determined as being incapable of self management or management of personal affairs by reason of the habitual and excessive use of alcohol , drugs , or other mind altering substances and b whose recent conduct as a result of habitual and excessive use of alcohol , drugs , or other mind altering substances poses a substantial likelihood of physical harm to self or others as demonstrated by i a recent attempt or threat to physically harm self or others , ii evidence of recent serious physical problems , or iii a failure to obtain necessary food , clothing , shelter , or medical care chemically dependent person also means a pregnant woman who has engaged during the pregnancy in habitual or excessive use , for a nonmedical purpose , of any of the following substances or their derivatives opium , cocaine , heroin , phencyclidine , methamphetamine , amphetamine , tetrahydrocannabinol , or alcohol the first thing that should jump out at any reader is the fact that dangerousness most commonly defined as a danger to self or others is only one of several relevant criteria see bolded sections a significant part of the statutory definitions for both mentally ill persons and chemically dependent persons has to do with self care can they provide food , clothing , shelter , or medical care for themselves ? can they manage their personal affairs ? i would suggest that the majority of people in this country with psychotic disorders and both substance use and psychotic disorders who are acutely disabled by those disorders meet this standard rather than threatening or aggressive behavior suicidal ideation and behavior is also less common than deficits in functional capacity or self care there are also a number of important legal interventions that are as important as civil commitment to address these issues among them conservatorship or guardianship that provides substituted decision making for the person with impaired cognition due to mental illness i worked with an even better option in the state of wisconsin and that was a parallel system of protective services and protective placement that could be used in place of civil commitment to assure that the person had adequate resources for their day to day needs and medical care the article i received today talks about mental health being the default position for legislators who do not want to take on the firearms issue the politics of this situation and the deadlock are quite obvious so i wo n't belabor the point the legislator in this reference wants better training for the police and a commitment standard based on treatment considerations rather than imminent dangerousness i have already demonstrated how imminent dangerousness is a de facto standard that the courts and managed care systems collude with , but it really has nothing to do with existing statutes on the books i will take a page from the gun advocates who claim we have enough gun legislation on the books it is just never enforced we have enough commitment standards on the books they are never recognized or followed to say that the commitment standard is imminent dangerousness is simply false the politics of civil commitment is always an interesting process and it does shed some light on why the standards are ignored it actually happens at all levels in minnesota , if a person is on a hold in a hospital they need to be seen during that time frame by a pre petition screener from their county of residence pre petition screeners come from many counties and they vary considerably in their clinical acumen and political orientation it becomes fairly easy to predict which counties will proceed with commitment and which will not some counties have pre petition screeners who actually consider themselves to be civil rights advocates and they will fight any suggestion of commitment that fight should occur at the next level and that is the county attorneys who represent the county in the commitments and the defense attorneys outcomes vary with the personality of those attorneys and some of those outcomes are not good the final step is the probate court judge , commissioner , or referee responsible for making the determination of commitment the quality and experience at this level varies considerably ranging from judges who are consistent and handle cases very well to those who clearly make wrong decisions to judges who overstep their authority and start to make medical decisions such as ordering a specific medication or quantity of mediation per court order as far as i can tell there is no uniform training or standards for any member of the commitment process so variable outcomes should not come as a surprise with the issue of civil commitment laws that use a treatment standard , they are already on the books but they are rarely followed that has to do with the culture of rationing mental health services as much as anything how do i know this ? i have been part of conversations where staff involved in a commitment were told by a county bureaucrat that they were doing too many commitments and it was costing the county too much money i never really understood that argument because all of the people involved are there , on salary , and show up every day whether there is anyone in commitment court or not the cost should be the same if one person shows up for a hearing or people show up at o'clock everybody goes home , so there is no overtime i have never seen the court so saturated that they could not move through the necessary hearings and decisions the only thing that this false economic pressure creates is a change in the way the commitment statute is interpreted suddenly the only rule is dangerousness to self or others that also translates to imminently dangerous to self or others notice that the statute says nothing about imminently and any form of the word danger is limited to a special section at the bottom about mentally ill and dangerous i conclude the changing the commitment standard and expecting that to have an impact on mass violence will not work , basically because that treatment standard is already on the books and it is routinely ignored in minnesota , the entire chemically dependent person statute is frequently ignored and i often hear we do n't commit anybody for chemical dependency there are a number of financial , avoidance of work incentives , and lack of quality standards that have facilitated that process it is readily observable by any psychiatrist who sees their patient back , realizes that they did not receive any care in a hospital , and notes the patient was discharged at his or her request because they were not imminently dangerous the financial interests of managed care systems and the counties involved overlap perfectly at that point once again i keep coming back to the old term quality quality care never involves discharging a disabled person because it is convenient to do so and it can be rationalized by a community standard that is determined by everybody except the experts involved and in this case the state statutes the focus of psychiatric professional organizations should be on defining what that standard of care should be and how to optimize treatment instead of throwing in with a managed care model for rationing care rationed care has resulted in a non existent system of care for the patients with psychosis and as long as that system remains non functional , the small percentage of people who are violent and psychotic will also not get the care they need the prevention of violence by individuals with psychosis starts with improving the standard of care for everybody rather then trying to pick the violent individuals out of the crowd george dawson , md , dfapa
