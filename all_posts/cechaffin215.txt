i have not been blogging because my involvement in actual life has increased , aided by the nba playoffs , in which my lakers have gone up against denver i hope there 's no letdown for the fourth game meanwhile i will not blog about my slightly improved mood without at least a month behind me i ca n't recall which of my recent poems i posted here and which i did n't and in what form so consider this a redux of recent works in a more polished though never finished form not much of a blog , was it ? today , april , is another day and i'm hungover and bloated from gorging thai food and drink for the first time in years my chief literary correspondent and critic next to kathleen sent me some illuminating critique about my poetry , and to simplify , argued that i needed more passion , as if my intellect were a nail in the tire of emotion i concur i had my poetry labeled inhuman long ago at a certain forum part of this defect is my deplorable tendency to over revise many poems , squeezing the juice out of them on the way to perfection i 've probably ruined more poems than i 've helped i ca n't help it it 's searching for the logos through logos the ineluctably indomitable , the predictably unavoidable , the kairos moment when time stops and you hold experience in your hand like a baseball squeeze the seams ! just say no to kilorats , ce dare because i doubt my being i drape you in words like papier mache' that when you withdraw i have a hollow to inhabit everyone is jesus to me , everyone who leaves a space to occupy notice how many hollows letters contain and the spaces between words dare you to find me ! too many voices i 've lost myself some mad imposter puts on airs , practices smiles , greets my mailman , pages through yearbooks and journals seeking my erasure the angels , in particular the obese ones dedicated to pleasure , laugh , it is their job if i could laugh i might remember in my dream i lead the sheep to safety only to discover at last , the joke they are all wearing my face each time i wake i lose another piece of me out of charity i embrace what 's left there was too much of me anyway , too many voices , a chorus of purloined identities valentine you are a granite waterfall , my love your stone is slippery and sensuous i fall into a pool beneath your feet and lie upon a thousand polished stones i look up at the alders overhead and marvel at how you give yourself to them without diminishment , without attrition , a steady miracle of sacrifice downstream trout fingerlings mouth bits of algae because your pounding fed them oxygen the vines that weave the cliffs live off your spray bright orange salamanders make their bed there a pale succulent grows in your cleft , its purple stalk a wand of yellow stars inside the moss lipped haven of your granite i hide behind your thundering skirt of water your clarity dissolves all self deception i would not recognize myself without you the shelter of trees is never so generous as your pouring and thinning of yourself into the forest air i kneel and drink and like the alder rise up satisfied
