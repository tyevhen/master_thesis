dear oscillating fan , i commend you for your selfless efforts at keeping me comfortable no matter how hot it is , you patiently sit there and blow air at me without stopping to question the fairness of the situation you do n't mind staying awake all night and all day , tirelessly blowing air on me even when i trip over your cord , knocking you violently to the floor , you keep on faithfully doing your job sometimes i forget to unplug you when i leave the house you do n't ever get upset about this you seem to simply assume that i want you to keep blowing on things , even in my absence the other day , i thought it would be fun to see what happened when i stuck a piece of paper in you i wanted to see if i could make confetti i feel terribly guilty about this i do n't know why i did it i should n't have amused myself at your expense you saw me coming at you with the paper and did not even flinch you trusted me , and i stuck a piece of paper in you and messed up your rotor i am sorry when i realized that i had hurt you , i tenderly removed the mangled pieces of paper from your inner workings i told you i was sorry and you looked like you understood when i put you back together and plugged you in again , you started blowing air on me like nothing had ever happened i admire your extraordinary capability to forgive you are a good fan i would like to do something nice for you , but i do n't know what types of things oscillating fans enjoy i have had a couple ideas , but every time i ask you if you would enjoy them , you just shake your head i tried to surprise you by cooking you dinner , but you just spit it back in my face that was kind of rude , but i suppose i can forgive you because you are such an awesome fan anyway , i just wanted to thank you for being so nice to me if you ever need anything , do n't hesitate to ask
