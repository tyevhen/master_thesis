the shen of the heart the shen of the heart plays a prominent role in memory partly by itself and partly because it coordinates the yi of the spleen and the zhi of the kidneys which also play a role in memory the shen of the heart plays a role in memory in the sense of memorizing but especially also in intrinsic memory see below information that we have to consciously work to remember is known as explicit memory , while information that we remember unconsciously is known as implicit memory implicit memory is not always unconscious as it includes what we call muscle memory which in psychology is called procedural memory see below explicit memory when we are trying to intentionally remember something like the names of acupuncture points or a list of dates for a history class , this information is stored in our explicit memory we use these memories every day , from remembering information for a test to recalling the date and time of a doctor 's appointment this type of memory is also known as declarative memory , since we can consciously recall and explain the information some tasks that require the use of explicit memory include remembering what we learned in a class , recalling a phone number , writing a research paper , and remembering what time we are meeting a friend , etc there are two major types of explicit memory episodic memory these are our long term memories of specific events , such as what we did the day before or our high school graduation semantic memory these are memories of facts , concepts , names , and other general knowledge information implicit memory things that we do not purposely try to remember are stored in implicit memory this kind of memory is both unconscious and unintentional implicit memory is also sometimes referred to as non declarative memory , since we are not able to consciously bring it into awareness procedural memories , such as how to perform a specific task like swinging a baseball bat or sewing , are one type of implicit memory since we do not have to consciously recall how to perform these tasks while implicit memories are not consciously recalled , they still have an influence on how we behave as well as our knowledge of different tasks some examples of implicit memory include singing a familiar song , typing on our computer keyboard , daily habits , driving a car , riding a bicycle , sewing riding a bicycle is another great example even after going years without riding one , most people are able to hop on a bike and ride it effortlessly the shen of the heart plays a role in both extrinsic and

spleen and is responsible for applied thinking , studying , memorizing , focusing , concentrating and generating ideas the post natal qi and blood are the physiological basis for the yi thus if the spleen is strong , thinking will be clear , memory good and the capacity for concentrating , studying and generating ideas will also be good if the spleen is weak , the yi will be dull , thinking will be slow , memory poor and the capacity for studying , concentrating and focusing will all be weak the spleen is responsible for memory in the sense of studying , concentrating , focusing and memorizing data in the course of one s study or work note that the chinese character for yi is based on the heart radical this indicates two things firstly , it indicates that the memory of the spleen

overlap between the yi of spleen , the shen of heart and the zhi of kidneys the main differentiating factor is that the spleen is responsible for memorizing data in the course of one 's work or study for example , it is not uncommon for someone to have a brilliant memory in his or her field of study or research a function of the spleen , and yet be quite forgetful in daily life a function of the heart the heart and kidneys also contribute to this function , but they are also responsible for the memory of past events and implicit memory in particular , the overlap between the yi and the shen in thinking activity is very close , so much so that the ling shu says in chapter the heart function of recollecting is called yi in turn , the memorizing function of the yi is so closely related to the zhi of the kidneys that the same chapter continues the storing of data of the yi is called zhi these passages confirm that shen , yi and zhi are a continuum memory and sense of self in modern psychology , memory is more that just the ability to store facts and information in our brain it is actually an essential part in which our consciousness exists , works and manifests itself and working memory plays an important role in our consciousness even the thought i live in the present requires short term memory even the immediate present requires involves memory what we know about the one present moment is basically what is in our working memory working memory allows us to know that the here and now is here and is happening now this insight underlies the notion , adopted by a number of cognitive scientists , that consciousness is the awareness of what is in working memory ledoux says the self is in part made and maintained by memory and both implicit and explicit forms are involved thus , in a broader sense , zhi is much more than memory in the sense of being able to remember past events the zhi together with the shen contributes to our working memory and also to the long term memory together with the shen of the heart , this contributes to creating our consciousness and sense of self treatment of poor memory memory can be stimulated by treating heart shen he , he

reasons it flows through the heart and therefore affects shen it originates from the kidneys and therefore affects zhi it is the vessel through which the kidneys sea of marrow reaches the brain the three main points are du shendao , du baihui and du shenting the lungs and memory however , remember that there are other factors at work in memory , e g the lungs affect memory by regulating the amount of qi reaching the head thus lu and lu are important for poor memory due to qi not reaching the head the explanation of the acupuncture points says that lu can make qi rise to treat forgetfulness , sadness and weeping due to qi not rising to head forgetfulness is an important indication for this point this is forgetfulness due to clear qi not rising to the head according to the explanation of the acupuncture points , this point treats forgetfulness by stimulating the ascending of qi of both lungs and heart phlegm and blood stasis in memory finally , it is important to remember that memory is affected by full conditions , especially phlegm and blood stasis obstructing the brain this happens especially in the elderly in particular , phlegm is a common cause of poor
