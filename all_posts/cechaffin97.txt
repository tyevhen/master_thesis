my stepson just got a bill for a one night stay in the hospital , , i kid you not he fell off of his motorcycle and had one laceration stapled on his head i called sutter health here are some of the charges ct scans trauma room stapling a superficial laceration in the trauma room of course he ca n't pay it , and the billing person i spoke to is going to send him a charity application you wonder what 's wrong with the healthcare system ? it 's unbelievably expensive , and sutter health does all it can to make a payday determined to start a garden once again before the deer get hungry , i spent on flowering plants only yesterday , eschewing all vegetables , and most of the flowers are in the daisy poppy category , supposedly deer resistant although deer will eat anything when they 're hungry , in my experience i love poppies , though showy , primitive flowers with four petals icelandic , though i 've put in some new varieties it 's hot on the coast today , maybe and windy i'm soaking the new plants for fear they may dry out i must interrupt this post to move the soaker back ! for any who missed the announcement , i now have songs ready for free download from soundclick all you need to do is click on the picture of me playing bottleneck in the upper right corner here feedback welcome some cuts are professional studio work , some rough cuts at home on this very computer my voice will soon improve when we quit smoking again on april , no fooling but i pride myself most on melody , which i find in short supply in much contemporary music , to say the least i 've been fighting a cold but it was suppressed by the prednisone i took for a week to combat my tick bite allergy the prednisone also had me flirting with depression powerful stuff steroids , nsaids and antihistamines are all dangerous drugs for causing depression in my case our brain chemistry is weird , what ? in april some new reviews of my book will be out in eclectica and pedestal and elsewhere , i think i 'll post them here , naturally tonight at our men 's circle i 'll be leading a discussion group on the river of life embracing the feminine , the topic i hope will be picked up for this year 's retreat i 'll be going through jung 's four female archetypes , from eve to helen to mary to sophia each represents ongoing progress in understanding the feminine , and sophia is the internalization of the feminine as my friend , kelton , says i'm married to my inner bitch lol ! so far i 've received only five entries in the contest for a signed hardback copy of unexpected light i need more entries ! simply mail them with the subject header contest to cechaffin at gmail dot com that 's all for today , save the obligatory poem let me look through my unpublished archives , as i have not written much of anything for a week ah , this seems appropriate as it is nearly easter the arrest they thought it would be easy to cow him with eagled breastplates and the clank of scabbards on greaves until they saw the royal toleration in his eyes in the glaze of a mideastern sun he could have been apollo if any man thirsts , let him come after me a thirst beyond roman canteens no man spoke like this man , they told their fuming captain he knew better than to go himself his god had warned him kilobunny , ce p s i just re read this post and felt ashamed this boy seemed so full of himself that trivial detail passes for blog material he 's worse than the confessionalist poets but i promise to repent
