i went snooping around on facebook the other day bad idea i discovered my ex apparently has twin baby boys the ex and i had talked about having kids we had planned to have kids at this point in our lives , we would have had kids together if only all had gone according to plan as we all know , plans do n't always work out if they did , i would n't have spent the last ten years of my life battling mental illness i would have been pursuing multiple dreams instead , including the dream of having children but the best laid plans i do n't have kids i'm too old now to tempt fate , and i do n't have a partner anyway so children are likely not in my future it 's my biggest regret the fact that my ex continued along the path we had set , without me , stings this discovery has me suffering industrial strength sadness i 've cried more tears in the past few days than i have in the past year the depth and intensity of my sadness caught me off guard i'm sad very , very sad there is a hole in my heart it is a hole which will likely never be filled perhaps it 's been there all along , and this discovery brought it into my awareness i feel like i am grieving i guess i am grieving i'm grieving for what will never be children , my own children there is a hole in my heart , and i am sad
