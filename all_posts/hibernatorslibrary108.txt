little house on the prairie , by laura ingalls wilder the area around the ingalls' little house in the big woods is getting crowded , and pa decides to hop in the wagon and head off to indian country in kansas the family finds a nice place to settle and spends months building a home there but just as things are beginning to settle down to a normal life , they begin to have troubles with the natives in the area , who are angry about all the settlers moving into their territory this plot was a lot less passive than the story from little house in the big woods , and as a result i enjoyed it a good deal more this is my first time reading the series and it 's exciting to experience the story that so many people rave about maybe i 'll even check out the tv series , though i hear it 's nothing like the books one thing i had trouble with in this story was the handling of the native americans and their culture obviously , this book was written in a time when there was a lot of tension between natives and white settlers , and the language and attitude expressed in little house was acceptable however , this may be one of those books that i would discuss with a young child if they were reading it i do n't believe in telling a child not to read a book , but i do believe in discussing certain points of books with children if it 's possible for them to misunderstand the context this is definitely one of those books in the long run , though , i'm really enjoying this series and am eager to move on to the next book
