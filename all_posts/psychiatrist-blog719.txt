duane and others have mentioned this rule , which essentially suggests making small changes in medication doses over extended periods of time year a decrease in dose every weeks is often quoted it 's a rule that makes a lot of sense in response to a change in the brain 's biophysicochemical stew meds , trauma , chronic stress , etc , it generally takes neurons a couple weeks to fully generate new or recycle old protein machinery to adapt to changes this duration can be shorter for some proteins , longer for others thus , small changes would be expected to minimize the shock to the system this just makes good homeostatic sense there are problems with this as dogma , however there is not useful research , at least that i am currently aware of , to demonstrate whether the best interval percentage change is or or we also do n't know if the best interval is one week , two , four or eight or which medications and their affected pathways are best tapered at what intervals and amounts please share original source ie , pubmed links to peer reviewed research below if you have relevant references
