ect brain that 's my excuse when i forget something simple which i should know , or as was the case this morning , something i 've known forever but have now forgotten i returned to work this morning i was nervous about it after all , it was my first day back in the working world since being hospitalized in april , and more importantly , it was my first day back since completing ect that 's why i was nervous my weekend physical therapy position is a computer laden position we do everything on the computer everything there are passwords , protocols , codes , and procedures by the dozens since i only work a couple of days per month , even a normal weekend can be challenging to my memory and today was no normal weekend day today was post ect day number one so i was anxious i prepared as best i could for the onslaught of computer dom i came in last week and set up a new password , as i could not remember the old one i reviewed some of the shorthand we use for common terms and i played around a bit in order to get used to the feel of the place again i was as ready as i could be , but just to make sure , i decided to arrive extra early this morning just in case as it turned out , it did n't matter that i got to my department minutes early , for i forgot go figure ! to rehearse one very important detail that detail became quite clear as i stood at the department door i forgot to re learn one significant code the department is locked on the weekend , and i forgot to re learn the series of digits which open the door ! ect brain , i exclaimed ! i 've known that code for nine years ect brain , i repeated , and i sat down to wait fortunately , my friends , that was the worst thing that happened today i'm smiling about the silliness of it now sometimes , that 's all you can do
