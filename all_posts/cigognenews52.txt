i have often described the timetable of needs that a baby must be touched immediately after birth to be touched for the first time at age six is to late to stop the damage of unfulfilled need to be talk to and listened to and explained to an example of my life might help i wonder why there has always been a terror of death in me i remember that at age six there was an accident with my dog who was hit by a car i did not know about soothing and easing the blow with my dog i walked away at the very moment when his whimpering and cries begged me to stay with him now i am primalling about how sorry i am that i left him i never knew there was such a thing as compassion and kindness i never had it and never knew how important it was now i beg him for forgiveness and i am in agony over it how could i have been so unfeeling ? but what also was imprinted was the fear of death and the desperate need to have it explained to me and mollified but my parents never talked to me , and i sensed that they never would if someone had talked to me about fears that i had i know it would soften the blow but it went missing and the terror was deeply imprinted and in my primals , i learned not only is there a specific time to be held and hugged to ease the pain and fear , but there is a time to talk to children which would ease their terrors and because it never happened , my terrors went on into the night and became exacerbated into devastating nightmares plagued night and day by terrors and night terrors and add , another phrase for night terrors , the same ones that plagued me all of the time in the daytime i could not sit still or pay attention as i had terrors that fed into my system all of the time how could i pay attention when internal input was nagging me all of the time ? those terrors were night terrors , imprinted from birth on when the deprivation of oxygen was so great above all , i could not move towards anesthetics , couldn t move toward air and breath i was trapped and i needed to move to respond to be put into so much hurt trapped is a lifelong feeling i carried with me my primal i have to get out of here or i will die i never articulated the notion of death but it was there the approach of death and more terror that was the holdover from the past that dogged me constantly so now a happy thanksgiving to all of you and to me too ! i am making it better every day
