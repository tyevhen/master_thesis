i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a psychotic episode in the summer of i think i had a mixed episode with psychosis and anxiety it was really frightening and i believed i was dying but no one would tell me i did not sleep for over a week but i did not feel tired and would pace and walk around rather than sitting still ! my mind was racing and my beliefs got more and more terrifying i was first diagnosed with depression in when i was and i had three severe episodes of depression before i was diagnosed with bipolar the summer of was the first time i was psychotic and i would rather die than go through that again i thought i was dying and no one would tell me i also thought my mother was dying at one time i played out some of my most deepest fantasies all my life , up to my diagnosis , my view of the world had been darkened by depression , this had made fantasies a large part of my life and they had also become very dark i remember feeling very anxious since i was extremely young , my first memories of school when i was years old were about anxiety , of course i did not understand what it was at the time i would not speak to the teachers , i was frightened and i was getting told off for being rude because i would not answer the teachers i was always in trouble but i never said a word i now believe i had selective mutism which is an anxiety disorder which was only recognised as an illness a few years before i suffered i was just seen as rude and naughty at the moment i am well , i take mg sertraline also known as lustral or zoloft for my anxiety and i take mg od aripiprzole also known as abilify as a mood stabiliser these provide few side effects but i am trying to reduce these as much as possible to try for a family since my diagnosis in i have been relatively well , i have had a few episodes of depression , some deeper than others i have also had a couple of periods where i have needed to work reduced hours mostly because of an extremely stressful job i have also had a couple of periods where i have got a bit carried away with things and felt far more confident than usual , i usually look back at these times with shame and regret in the summer of this year i married my man mr r i am very happy and along with all the love , he also supports me , lets me talk , lets me hide under the duvet and provides stability life was very dark before i was diagnosed , i always knew i was different and did not fit in but did not know why getting the correct diagnosis has been the best thing that has happened in my life however , i had to get extremely sick before i managed to get the help i needed i first wanted to kill myself when i was about to everyone else i was just a moody teenager who spent all my time in my room nobody ever came to see what i was doing i thought nobody cared i was an easy target for bullies and i would hang around with all the other kids who were bullied some of whom are still good friends but i was not happy , i planned my suicide , i put the suicide note under my mattress and planned to take an overdose about a mile from my house down a farm track called green lane i just never went through with it i clinged to the hope that life would get better please read on , come back and visit again or leave a comment and introduce yourself i like to know who is reading my blog
