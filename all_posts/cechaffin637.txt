nothing is more boring than waiting around in interminable uncertainty on dec we will have been here four months , when we only came for a week we now have the best connected lawyers in town and the case is in a judge 's hands , but there is some question of exactly what felony our maid is guilty of , since the stuff is at her house i should think kidnapping sufficient , but it 's mexico , and here , more than the u s , one 's home is one 's castle i stay busy answering psychiatric needs of various folks , finishing my book on eliot , editing the last issue of the melic review , singing in the choir and attending church , and playing some music here and there bloom where you 're planted as they say trouble is , we 're not planted i do n't know if i 'll be here next week ! this discourages me from extroverted behavior , though i know i must strive harder for involvement than i have kathleen has been much more isolated we go out to eat , usually once a day , and she sees acquaintances at our usual haunts but as you know , she ca n't use the phone , and her friends say call me unthinkingly she had several good friends here at one time , but things change , people get into their own shit wait , everyone 's always into their own shit except for exceptional humans and so it goes , billy pilgrim kathleen reads close to a book a day and she is helping me edit my long essay on four quartets as for humor , our son , who sleeps in our van , was especially frisky this morning i correctly surmised he 'd been physically serviced the night before after a long draught although he attends church with us for reasons unknown , he is not a christian , therefore fornication is no sin for him but given my experience with church youth , avoiding fornication has long been deserted as a standard anyway hell , i was a virgin when i got married the first time , and that was my worst marriage but we should n't judge standards by results it does , however , bug me that the only deacon at our church parades around town with his younger mexican boyfriend , as the entire anglican communion , except for new hampshire , is opposed to such shenanigans among the sacerdotal ranks nevertheless , when he serves me communion i do n't scream fag ! god uses him like everyone else it is n't any antipathy on my part , just the feeling that without standards there would be no religion , as there would be no need for forgiveness this philosophical tendency in myself and my writing is likely the reason i was a virgin when i got married in high school i used to bore my dates with discussions of goethe and nietzsche instead of telling them how lovely their eyes were then i was a pizza faced geek in any case , but as they say , sometimes even a blind pig finds an acorn so here we are , suspended between pole and tropic , awaiting the slow wheels of mexican justice to free kathleen 's beloved service dog , kenyon we are bored out of our minds , truly our apartment abuts a main bus line that turns our lungs into diesel bags the menu at the posada is so limited we 've begun to eat cup of noodles for relief we buy cheap brandy and mix it with apple soda at night and fade into tv land unfortunately , only rarely do we get english captions , which tries kathleen to no end just yesterday i found out our host has a dvd player but i'm too bored to go to blockbuster maybe i 'll get the energy up tomorrow who knows ? meanwhile , keep those cards and e mails coming to cechaffin hotmail com anything new is great my sister sent a hilariouis link to an e bay sale of leather pants maybe i can find the link what do i have for e bay ? nothing our former maid has it all may she burn in hell like an aztec sacrifice that was burned before having its living heart excised then she 's so fat , they 'll probably need a machete and a wheelbarrow as a good christian i do n't actually mean the above , but i do have feelings prick me , do i not bleed ? damn straight wish the deacon was , too your ever faithful literary doctor , c e chaffin
