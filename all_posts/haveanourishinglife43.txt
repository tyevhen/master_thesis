a while back , i wrote about pre party anxiety i think many people can relate to the nervousness or butterflies you get before going to a big social event , party , or gathering some experience the anxiety worse than others especially if you have agoraphobic tendencies or social anxiety in general on the flipside , i m sure there are some people who don t have trouble at all however , for those of you who are familiar with the symptoms of anxiety , you know that it s no fun previously , i thought that after an event was over , i was out of the woods , in the clear , free from harm done with anxiety for the time being but after last weekend , i became aware of this other anxiety that came after an event i realized , begrudgingly , that there must also be a post party anxiety social events drain my batteries even though i do enjoy them and participate in them because , to me , it s worth the work nonetheless , the company , the conversations , and all that good stuff , still get me overwhelmed and nervous even after the event is over , i noticed that i get a different kind of anxiety that threatens to take over my brain i spend time mentally preparing for social situations , and i try to equip myself with the skills i need to get through it joyfully and relatively pain free yet , i haven t been prepared for what comes after , even when i ve successfully stayed at a gathering without leaving early because of anxiety it s probably the result of low resources being at parties takes a lot out of me and i don t have the strength to fight off the anxiety demons post party but , i think a lot of it can be prevented or at least , reduced if i have a game plan it s worth it to me to attend social gatherings i m not just going to stay home all the time i want to learn how to cope with the anxiety so that it s not so bad and being aware of what causes me anxiety is a good first step in learning how to deal with it after a party , i find myself unable to relax it s like i need to decompress , move really slow , and reorient myself to my surroundings i find that i analyze conversations , re live certain moments , and think and think and think and think about the day did i say the right thing to that person ? i didn t get a chance to talk to that one person that one moment was really awkward why did i say that ? sometimes , i don t know why i say certain things i should think before i talk ! did i unintentionally blow off anyone ? i didn t finish that conversation with that one person i hope they don t think i didn t want to talk to them and vanity and pride play a part as well did i sound silly when i said that ? did i overdo it when talking to that person ? did i look dumb ? did i eat too much or too fast ? is that person still going to like me after that interaction ? are they still going to think highly of me ? is this one person still going to want to hang out with me in the future ? my mind feels like it s going mph and i don t feel like i can stop it or slow it down sometimes i find myself walking around the house in circles doing random things that aren t necessary like , i ll fluff the couch pillows , fill up my water bottle , and organize the books on my end table at midnight i think that i can help myself in these situations by first becoming aware of this post party anxiety , how it affects me , and what i can do about it i think a good way to deal with this type of anxiety is to first get rid of the desire to appear a certain way whether it s about physical looks or whether it s about personality appearing smart , composed , or graceful a lot of my anxiety stems from the fear of not being a certain way and the fear of not being a certain way comes from the fear of not being accepted and loved i need to remember that i am who i am and that this good enough for me i need to care less about what others think of me , because , in the end , it doesn t matter what they think anyway comparing myself to others is useless because it only leads to discouragement and self pity i need to remember that i am loved , i am accepted , and i am good enough first and foremost , because my self worth comes from god himself also , i need to remind myself that i m not weird it s ok to have a transitional routine nothing out of control or really lengthy just a few things that help me settle down i was doing this before without realizing what i was doing , but my mistake was that i thought i was crazy and i felt weird for doing it but i can see now that it is helpful to have a specific routine in order to transition from a particularly taxing event what i need to add to the routine is the awareness of what i am doing and the confidence that when i m done i can let go of the anxiety and i need to give myself permission to wind down when i get home instead of expecting myself to go perfectly from one thing to the next a transition routine can be anything from brushing your teeth to taking a shower to sitting for a few moments with your eyes closed or mediating i think a good practice would be to pray the rosary because it is so rhythmic and repetitious a rosary can calm the anxiety while getting you back into a pattern of peace and trust or , if not a whole rosary , i ll try just a decade or even just a short prayer , lord , i offer you this anxiety i pray for everyone i spoke with this evening i trust that you ll bring good from all my weaknesses help me always to desire to lead others to you all for your greater honor and glory amen
