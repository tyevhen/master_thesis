if you 've spent far too much time messing around with twitter as i have , you 've probably run into a few brutal learnings , such as the fact that of your followers are not online at any given moment and therefore will never see what you tweet , and only a percent or so of the people who do see your tweets will click on any embedded links which means twitter is a very low power way of reaching people if you have , followers , only , to , will see a given tweet , and only to people will click the url in the tweet check your analytics at https ads twitter com user username tweets to see what i mean this kind of pathetic low impact reach is why twitter is in trouble right now marketers know twitter is a terrible way to reach buyers to reach more people , you have only a few options gain more real followers not fake followers this is n't something you buy it 's something you work at tweet more often set up more than one account some marketers , like forbes top social media influencer chrisvoss , have or more accounts twitter will let you have as many accounts as you have e mail addresses if you start to do these things , you 'll quickly reach a point where it 's unmanageable without proper tools the native twitter ui simply is n't suitable for things like mass follow unfollow , discovery of non followbacks , scheduling of tweets , etc quite a few third party apps exist now for managing twitter accounts different ones do different things well almost all offer a crippleware free version plus various paid editions the good news is , you can accomplish just about everything you need to do with the free versions the bad news is , almost all of these tools have recently reset their daily limits to fall in line with various twitter best practices and some of the daily limits , on free versions of the tools , are absurdly low let me tell you what i use my main wmd , at the moment , is tweepi , an all purpose tool that will let you discover non followbacks , do mass follows unfollows , safe list people , and much more tweepi click to enrage tweepi recently underwent a massive ui overhaul frankly , the new ui is highly functional but also annoyingly cluttered plus , the new daily limit structure is downright horrible you can follow up to new people a day which is good , but can unfollow only a day bad in the platinum mo version , you can load rows of data per screen instead of , in the free version and the limits are higher follow a day , unfollow my advice live with the free version it does the job one thing you 'll notice about all of the free tools is that they require a lot of click click clicking you have to click a button for every individual you want to follow unfollow because twitter asked the appmakers to eliminate one click bulk ops the workaround for this is to cobble together some bookmarklet code that automates the clicking of all action buttons tweepi thoughtfully provides a bookmarklet for this at least for its platinum customers but write to them and demand the code , if you 're a free user it 's a lifesaver , because otherwise , to follow people you 'll be manually clicking buttons if you 're handy with javascript , you can put the necessary code together yourself tip the better tools such as tweepi and manageflitter use jquery in the background , which means you can just call click on any dom node to spoof a click see below a huge problem with tweepi is that if you follow people a day , the unfollows a day limitation will quickly put you in a situation of violating twitter 's followee follower ratio limitations , at which point your account will be capped for follows to stay out of trouble , your followee count needs to be no more than of your follower count you need a mass unfollow tool that will let you drop more than people at a time here , i'm talking about people who are n't following you back on twitter the mass unfollow tool you need is manageflitter just create a free account and use the ui to unfollow people when you reach the person a day limit , a prompt will appear at the top of the screen telling you how to unlock a further unfollows day by doing a few simple things like signing up for the manageflitter newsletter and tweeting a one time promo tweet which you can delete immediately just saying note that to follow people with manageflitter , you need to be a paying customer at a month but you can unfollow a day for free manageflitter has powerful tools , but many are locked in the free version to gang unfollow people in manageflitter , you need a bookmarklet that contains the following code javascript b document getelementsbyclassname process mode basic unfollow for var i i i b i click note be sure to put the code all on one line , because a bookmarklet is actually a url which has to begin with the javascript url scheme rather than http put the bookmarklet in your button bar , and you 're all set you can unfollow people at a click the only bad thing i can say about manageflitter , aside from the fact that the free version allows you only to unfollow , not follow , is that it takes minutes or so to load your account if you have more than a couple thousand followers allow for a coffee break while loading if you need a free tool for automating scheduled tweets , you need twuffer this is an admirably streamlined , well behaved app that does one thing well offline tweet scheduling sadly , it does not yet support image tweets and there seems to be a bug with tweets scheduled for midnight to a m but hey , it 's free and it mostly works twuffer is a good tweet scheduling tool and the price is right free for all around twitter account management with automated dms , many people like crowdfire formerly justunfollow i happen to hate it i do n't like automated welcome dms , and i do n't much care for crowdfire 's non jquery enabled , click intensive , space wasting ui , nor do i appreciate the ridiculous a day follow limit on the crippleware free version of the tool crowdfire formerly justunfollow is much beloved by some i happen to hate it even so , crowdfire has millions of users who seem to find the product irresistible , so by all means give it a look and decide for yourself you might like their instagram automation features bottom line as free tools go , tweepi is still hard to beat and you might enjoy the new ui more than i do , though the a day unfollow limit will probably drive you nuts for better unfollowing capability , use manageflitter and consider the paid version for tweet scheduling , use twuffer if you found
