so many of us are addicted that i want to write a bit more on it first of all , we are addicted to need the lack of fulfillment of need the depth of the neglect of the need determines how seriously addicted one is we choose our addiction due to many reasons but basically , how early the trauma or lack of love there is may be one factor then the compounding of the very early neglect , say , the lack of touch dating back to right after birth and on into infancy , is another component so the continual lack of fulfillment exacerbates the pain never been touched , held or soothed makes matters worse it all wraps around need if there were a grandma who caressed the child a bit then the need is less severe those needs start in the womb , which is a massive kick start to addiction if the mother drank to ease her pain then perhaps the offspring will sense physiologically that alcohol can soothe pain the beginnings of addiction if the pain goes on due to constant neglect by the parents , becoming severely debilitating , a devastating addiction is on its way if the mother takes drugs during pregnancy then a pill taker is coming soon and usually , the pills will be the opposite of what mother took if she was on cokes , cocaine , speed , coffee , hyping up the baby in her womb , then we may have an adult who is addicted to tranquilizers and painkillers in order to calm his hyped up system the needs are at first life saving so that lack of fulfillment generates great pain as we mature the needs are important but not as life saving needs before birth are much stronger than later on they deal with survival once we survive well physiologically we can move on to social needs to be listened to be looked at , understood , helped , guided , etc i cannot emphasize this enough we are addicted to need the earlier the need the more powerful its neglect that is why hollywood doesn t destroy people they are already destroyed by events that may antedate birth the neglect may drive one to hollywood because it is basically the land of the seriously damaged it is the goal for those who are underappreciated and never paid attention to the size of the pain leads to neurotic solutions commensurate with that force now we need the whole world s approval how better than in the cinema ? we don t want to ignore genetics but in my opinion genetics is minimal but life in the womb is critical and so what is the addict doing ? fulfilling the need from that time that is , trying to equalize or normalize the chemistry that was warped from very early on he takes more serotonin prozac to calm him he would have had enough all through his life if his levels were not dislocated by trauma in the womb or at birth he is trying to get himself back get the parts that were missing from the start that is why drugs make us feel like ourselves again they make up for the deficit the choice of drug may be any number of things food for jewish families who put such importance on it wine for the french you get the idea but the force and strength of the addiction is not cultural it is biologic , much the same the world over if we just think , the need for drugs , food alcohol is first of all and most importantly , the need period if we make the mistake of treating the need for as the problem instead of the need itself we will never cure anyone of anything that is , if we neglect history and address only the apparent problems we are bound to fail those few words , need for , and need , must be clearly differentiated one is the need direct pain history primal therapy the other is need for calming agent kill pain cognitive therapy the latter is what the cerebral therapies address , believing that is the problem no the problem is real need which drives the need for how deprived the real need is how overpowering the addiction so many parents wonder what they did wrong because their child was and is addicted maybe they did nothing wrong because the root of heavy addiction goes back to long before they had a chance to mistreat the child never forget life in the womb my book on this will be out in five months the reason that both addiction and psychosis have been so hard to treat in conventional therapy is that the origins lay back before we set foot on earth damage during this period is most often the origin of later addiction psychosis but there is no therapy extant , other than primal that can go so deep
