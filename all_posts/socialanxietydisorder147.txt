i ve been reading and it seems like adrenal fatigue is only curable through at home , change in life style type of ways i made an appointment to go see the doctor about it i have been having a problem reacting to stimulants caffeine , sports performance , etc and i have over of the symptoms listed for adrenal fatigue one way it is said to be caused is from bad eating habits , sleep deprivation , etc but i am a fitness fanatic i eat clean , healthy get over hours of sleep so the only way i think i could have gotten it would be from excessive use of caffeine , as my stress level isn t all that high i do , however , get mild depression which is a symptom is there anything the doctor can prescribe to me ? i don t have much as far as anxiety goes how can i cure this quickly ? answer are you talking about adderal ? if so the dr can prescribe you a different brand like ritian , etc or prescribe you a lower dose question is this sleep deprivation ? i sleep okay i just recently got on a new sleeping schedule i go to bed at around and wake up at every morning before i went to bed at and woke up at in the afternoon right now i feel really , really , really , tired and out of it and i jist feel deprived from sleep , and i dont know why because i m sleeping i haven t had a good sleeping sschedule in years due to anxiety and stress , and i still deal with that everyday but take meds for it could i just feel this way because my body isn t use to the schedule yet ? ? it s confusing me and i m worried and freaking out help answer i recently started on a new sleeping schedule that s your problem , and it s exactly because your body isn t used to it the good news it your drifting towards a natural sleep schedule you seem to be on the right track to a good sleeping schedule if you don t feel drastically better in a little while , i would be concerned i would also recommend joining a gym , exercise is great for stress and it should improve your nights sleep
