i suppose it s a human thing to always drift towards routine routines are comfortable and reassuring one can mechanically move through a day without a lot of effort with a routine but they re so damned sticky my routines have always gravitated to sedentary pursuits and dark interior buildings right now i ve gotten myself into the most exaggerated form of that rut i literally spend hours a day sitting at my computer in a basement i rarely leave the basement , not to the mention the house i climb the stairs a couple times a day to eat and maybe to shower but other than that i sit at this computer i sit here because it s my job i goof off a little , too , but mostly i work it s a good environment for work but not that great for thinking happy thoughts no sunlight , no exercise , no human interaction it s a pretty good recipe for downward spiraling depression an acquaintance called me on saturday to confirm plans that we d made i had completely forgotten about them and was on the tail end of this cold i just can seem to stop coughing ! anyway , we d agreed to drive to a nearby city to drink beer and listen to live music at a blues jazz club he knows my wife didn t want me to go because of the cold but i d bailed on this friend before so i didn t want to again i think that she was also a little pleased to get me out of the house both for my sake and hers she rarely gets the house to herself so we went the time wasn t really all that extraordinary we went to the bar , drank beer and listened to the music but i had a remarkably good time it was a very refreshing deviation from my routine could it be that not acting depressed helps one not be depressed ? if i inject things into my routine specifically designed to counter depression , will my depression lift ? i ve said this before and i ve silently made this promise to myself hundreds of times but i am going to start walking tomorrow it will be the first thing that i do tomorrow after waking up i 've tried this before and it really seems to help it 's just hard to do every day once it becomes routine it will be easier but until then it will be an effort hold me to it
