in continuing anticipation of my book 's release , here 's another poem from the volume christ 's lighthouse there is a pillar of light stuck in the rocks like excalibur above a harbor of heavy water , hushed and heavy with suffering , where waves swallow their foam but much can obstruct your view i used to lose sight of it , thinking the ocean 's furious slam dance the thing , me roped to the mast between the cold salt walls of death or ships would block it , horns and radios distract me until only a slip of light in the marbled sky recalled its jeweled foghorn , a dog whistle for the deaf do i dare now ? do i dare say i see it always , through iron bars and self revulsion as if the great stone of the world were rolled away ? what terrible temptations do i then tempt , what unexpected holy thing may morph into evil , baiting my inner eye with self congratulation me a blind man beating his dog with a white stick ? earlier version published in mindfire yesterday i was jonesing for a cheeseburger and satisfied myself , oh how i satisfied myself , at jenny 's giant burger in fort bragg as i was wadding up my napkins and paper to throw into the trash , i lifted my cup for a sip of coke and managed to jam the straw up my nose rather deeply in years i ca n't remember this happening before , but i had another fast food epiphany once , where i was sucking on a drink in the bathroom while peeing i felt like an in and out factory strange i'm really a sushi and potatoes kind of guy if any have trouble with today 's poem , please query or comment below it 's not one of my easier poems , though i constantly strive to be clear yet there are some things that can only be said in a more complicated way , and sometimes i am not a good enough poet to simplify adequately the neurologist said of my neck injury and nerve impingement that i can get by without surgery hooray ! i hate surgery and the stress it puts upon the body 's recovery systems to be avoided if at all possible i'm furiously writing editors who have published me , trying to obtain as many reviews as i can as they are published i 'll post them here writing the book took a long time , but promoting it is a new endeavor , and i ask your help with it in other words , tell your friends ! i 've also started a facebook group around the book , which anyone can join here 's the link unexpected light thanks for stopping by ! at kilobunny might be two if i did n't have this cold hope the jammed straw helped with the congestion , ce
