posted by dinah you know , it 's the damnedest thing a patient came in today and told me she 'd called medicare to ask why she had n't been reimbursed for her care and they told her they 'd never received a claim from the physician i could swear i filed one actually , i could swear i filed the this exact same claim for this exact same patient three times , because that 's how many times she 's told me that medicare has n't received the claim what i have n't figure out is why they get some of the claims , but not others , when i send them all in the same envelope it 's like the phenomena of the dryer and the missing single sock okay , sometimes they get the claims , they just reject them there are columns and rows and codes the language of these things is a mystery to me i was ranting at a patient recently much as i love to rant , there are a limited number of things i can rant to patients about and i 've decided that medicare claims are one of them about how i could n't even understand the forms they send me and i do n't even know what coins is ! referring to the name of one of the columns it was the patient who told me he imagined it stood for co insurance wow , i thought , assuming he could be right , it was this eureka moment where i got an answer after years of subconsciously wondering , only to have my bubble burst when it occurred to me that i did n't know what co insurance meant any more than i knew what coins meant some of the codes are subscripted with sentences that approach english some of my claims are returned with pr , pr means patient responsibility amount that maybe billed to a patient or another party means charges exceed our fee schedule or maximum allowable amount only the fee i charge is the fee determined by medicare as the limiting fee for a non participating physician in a non facility as a psychiatrist , i only bill for a few codes mostly minute psychotherapy session with medication management , so what is it sometimes deemed wrong and not other times ? and then there 's ma your claim contains incomplete and or invalid information , and no appeal rights are afforded because the claim is unprocesssable please submit a new claim with the complete correct information it would be so nice if they told me what information is incomplete or invalid and of course , there 's ma receipt of this notice by a physician or supplier who did not accept assignment is for information only and does naot make he physician or supplier a party to the determination no additional rights to appeal this decision , above those rights already provided for by regulation instruction , are conferred by receipt of this notice there 's nothing like being succinct my favorite medicare form story a couple of years ago , medicare announced that the physician 's name , address , phone number information which i have on a handy little rubber stamp designed to make it fit in the space needed to be placed in box before that , the information needed to be placed in box they put this in a bulletin and somehow i did n't see it a patient complained he could n't get reimbursed , and since this pre dated the time when a significant portion of my claims were 'not received , ' i called for the patient after sitting on hold for minutes , i was told i had n't placed my info in box i pointed out that the exact same information was available to anyone who wanted to look in the immediately adjacent box , but i suppose it 's hard to shift one 's eyes those few millimeters please forgive my sarcasm here funny , but not a single psychiatrist i asked had seen the bulletin , some had simply been wondering why they or their institution had n't been paid in months
