dear a b thank you for the additional thoughts i ca n't deny that i felt quite helpless i must have a lot of repressed fear my sister 's note probably contributed to that sense of helplessness fear i can see that there are nuances and levels to the situation i do want to get the deeper growth , not just the superficial winner status you said in the other e mail , i would know things were better when i viewed his anger as his problem so these are the things i need to work on standing on my own two feet , relinquishing notions of how another should emotionally be there for me getting in touch letting go of some repressed fear i know i 'll never unload it all ! acquiring the mindset living from it that his anger is his problem not the end of the world none of which will be easy , but at least i have a clearer idea of what i need to do i thank you for so generously sharing sincerely , g
