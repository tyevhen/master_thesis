when i was six years old , at a summer fair with my mother , i came across a table on animal rights , with photos maybe a video playing too ? of how animals are treated and killed in slaughterhouses i do n't remember this myself , or at least i do n't think i do it feels like one of these phantom memories , lodged in your head from hearing a story so many times , you can almost remember it yourself and apparently , i instantly decided i would stop eating meat and i gave almost all meat up instantly almost all because , well , i was six , so hotdogs and mcdonald 's chicken mcnuggets were hard for me to give up however , even the allure of those wore off , and by age eight i was completely vegetarian as you can tell , it was originally for ethical reasons as i got older , i went through various reasons health , ethical , environment , meat just did n't appeal to me , but whatever the reason i gave when i was asked why i was vegetarian , i have been since age eight i got used to all the stupid questions and comments pretty quickly , and just learned to smile vaguely and ignore anything i found insulting recently though , there 's been lots of talk i 've seen online among more radical people very anti vegetarian stuff coming from anti civ anarchists , that i honestly find slightly hurtful i think it stems from lierre keith , author of the vegetarian myth , doing lots of talks recently , bringing up a lot of very interesting things to think about , but also making a lot of people very angry and defensive even to the extent of harassing and harming her but , here 's the thing i want to read her book ! ! i 've listened to parts of her talks with interest i want to learn more yet , i'm vegetarian and i do n't plan to stop being vegetarian anytime soon the anger directed at all vegetarians is completely misplaced , as far as i'm concerned attack the vegetarians and vegans who have actually been assholes , not all vegetarians and vegans ! this goes against something i find very important , and try very hard to do myself , and that is to attack the ideas beliefs institutions , not the people or if i really do feel a need to condemn individuals , i make sure it 's the specific individuals who i feel have done wrong , not others who simply share some of the same beliefs and ideals but getting back to the topic of my vegetarianism if i believe as other anti civers do , that agriculture the destruction of all life on a piece of land to plant monocrops is harmful and unsustainable , why do i have the diet i do ? well , it 's been something i 've been thinking about a lot lately , and i think i 've come up with the basics of it firstly , it 's both habit at this point , and something i feel good with i do n't feel a lack because i'm not eating meat when i'm eating healthy vegetarian food i feel healthy ! secondly , if i was ever to eat meat , it would only be meat from animals i knew had been treated well and killed with respect that 's both expensive and often hard to find , unless you hunt yourself which brings me to another reason i do n't eat meat i have this feeling that whatever i eat should be something that i myself would be willing to harvest or kill pulling up a carrot is just as surely killing as shooting a deer , and i recognize that fact where i think too many others do n't but i can bring myself to kill a carrot where i ca n't bring myself to kill a deer , so i eat carrots where i do n't eat venison i would n't kill a chicken , so i do n't eat chicken my feelings may change at some point , but that 's where things are right now i try to eat as much organic , locally grown produce as possible , both for health and sustainability reasons really , the two are the same things ! unsustainable practices means unhealthy or dead humans , and this year i want to grow more veggies myself i'm also experimenting with my diet this summer , seeing how i feel cutting out virtually all grains and processed foods from my diet but for now , meat is not going to be a part of my diet , and i 'd really appreciate it if i was n't made to feel bad about that fact ! peace , idzie p s i want to make sure , because i'm not sure how what i said about others views on eating meat came across , that all the anti civers i 've ever met online and in real life are strongly against factory farming and animal abuse most just see eating meat , that 's either hunted or raised kindly , as part of a sustainable diet you might also like vegan for a month , at least the interconnectedness of life food love fun with 'environmental studies' linkwithin
