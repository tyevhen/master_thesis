clinkshrink and i are working on the psychotherapy chapter for our book so far , it 's still called off the couch so clink does n't see patients for psychotherapy , her role has been to focus my rambling and to connect the thoughts i did n't know she had a talent for this , but she 's good ! we started talking about how it is that one person can go to one psychiatrist and be told to come in weekly for therapy , while the same person can see another psychiatrist and be told to return in a couple of weeks for a med check without getting a recommendation for therapy clink asked so where does the recommendation for therapy come from ? does a patient want psychotherapy and look for a therapist who offers this ? or does a patient go to a psychiatrist with a problem , get evaluated , and have psychotherapy prescribed to treat their problem just like one gets handed a prescription , as part of the package known as the treatment plan ? and what about those patients who come with preconceived ideas about what they need an unwillingness to entertain other options so the patient who wants therapy but refuses even a trial of medications , or the patient who calls and says before they 're even evaluated that they just want to be seen every three months for meds and are n't interested in talking ? i thought i 'd invite you to join our conversation !
