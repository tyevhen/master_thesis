i wrote yesterday about the fact that the internet as a whole has a lot of non human traffic , while social media sites , in particular , have tons of bots , spammers , zombie accounts , and fakes six months or so ago , i began collecting some data of my own , using the fake followers app at http www socialbakers com twitter fakefollowercheck which is currently down for maintenance , unfortunately there are many such apps online i liked this one because it broke out twitter followers into suspicious , inactive , and good categories suspicious accounts are ones that have no profile pic just an egg , no bio , and or no followers inactives are , of course , accounts that seldom , if ever , tweet abandoned accounts , basically i ran the fake followers app on a bunch of popular accounts , including many popular authors and media accounts bear in mind , some of these numbers are six months old , and there is no guarantee as to accuracy , in any case i'm relying on socialbakers makers of the fake followers app to know what they 're doing account suspicious inactive good followers kasthomas k inkmuse k contently k kmweiland k lukeromyn k chuckwendig k thecreativepenn k writeintoprint k guykawasaki m calvinhelin m ceebee k bigthink k scobleizer k linkedin k annericeauthor k adobe k stephenking k wsj m facebook m paulocoelho m writersdigest k timoreilly m dannysullivan k chuckpalahniuk k dickc m britneyspears m nytimes m twitter m buzzfeed m katyperry m medium k barackobama m theellenshow m the accounts with or fewer good follows are highlighted in pink among them is dickc , the account of twitter ceo dick costolo the account with the fewest good followers is theellenshow , with barackobama coming up close behind nytimes ranks poorly just below britneyspears , which naturally makes one wonder does having a large twitter account automatically mean you 'll acquire a ton of suspicious followers ? i tried to get some insight into this by plotting the non good percentage suspicious plus inactive against account size , in what i call the bogosity graph percent bogus followers x axis and account size in thousands , y axis i think the graph says two things first , lots of points spread out along the bottom , which means it 's definitely possible to have lots of fake followers even if your twitter following is small which we kinda knew secondly , as you go up the y axis , it 's clear that once you get past million followers , the odds are good that half or more of your followers will be bogus in fact , it 's virtually guaranteed i think it 's possible to understand what 's happening to large accounts this way when you first join twitter , you 're prompted to follow certain large accounts probably less than half of new twitter signups stick around most lose interest right away , or were only there out of morbid curiosity and decided to leave immediately , etc so celebs and media sites get stuck with tons of inactive followers abandoned accounts , through no fault of their own the no fault of their own argument does n't apply across the board , though , because it 's absolutely obvious , if you use a tool like tweepi com , that many would be twitter celebs have deliberately pumped up their follower counts by buying followers in a future post , maybe i 'll call out some of these clowns by name why twitter and dickc do n't clean up their accounts , i do n't know it speaks poorly of twitter that its own corporate account has mostly bogus followers do n't you think ? have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ? tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms lie but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend i want to thank the following great folks who retweeted me yesterday on twitter my advice ? follow these guys they retweet ! have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
