photo of st remy 's by craig borchers dear jesus and mary , my anxiety level is extremely high i am having trouble focusing on one thought at a time even as i write this my mind is working faster than i can think i can t keep up with my own brain i am sorry for being so distracted here with you in adoration i desire to just sit and be in your presence to just be yet , i can t shut down my think tank i can t even bring it down a couple notches to a manageable level my heart is pounding , my head is aching , and my vision is blurry i don t think that my prayers are effective when i am in this state of being blessed mother , i trust that you can take any prayer and bring good out of it take this pathetic attempt and refine it into the most beautiful gold offering for your worthy son i feel like i am either holding my breath , or i am taking in too much air and not exhaling i want to exhale deeply to let go of the air i am holding onto in my lungs symbolically , i want to let go of all the thoughts that are running rampant in my head as well jesus , my lord and my god , you are the only one , oh my lord , the only one who matters all else is nothing all else is nothing jesus i trust in you i will trust that you ve given me the gift of thought and memory i will trust that you will take care of me and help me to remember those things which you want me to remember now help me to let go , so my mind will be clear of clutter empty my mind and fill it with you ! lord , i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof , but only say the word and my soul shall be healed let it be done unto me according to your word do not forsake your child amen
