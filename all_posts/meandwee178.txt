hi friends ! we 've been away for the past couple of weeks i took the kiddos to visit my parents in maine and then we all went to chris' parents' house for a big visit it 's been fun to do vacation y things i love the summer ! i 'll admit , i got exhausted a lot with the two kids and everyone always needing something from me at the same time luckily , i had a lot of help too , so everything worked out i'm happy to be home and getting back to a new routine paige has started summer school for preschool she 's busy each day learning about the ocean and its creatures and comes home exhausted ! noah is busy learning to roll around the floor and i ca n't believe he 's so mobile now time to re baby proof the space and figure out where everything needs to go all over again i feel like we just did this ! mothering is one busy job it 's never dull , that 's for sure ! as i mentioned in my last post , i 've been thinking a lot about my artwork and how it 's been so long since i 've done anything with it i have done so much praying on the topic for the past few years and simply could not come up with the idea for what i truly wanted to be doing it 's bothered me for a long time so , i shoved it out of my mind and tried to forget about it as i busied myself with the kiddos and paige 's special needs but , now p is in school and they are working with her so i'm back to having time for my own goals again i 've decided that i want to create illustrated art prints targeted for children or adults wanting whimsical art there i said it i 've been sketching in my little moleskine book for a few years now just waiting to hit on some magical idea of what i 'd like to create and i finally uncovered an illustration style i never knew i had it was like unearthing buried treasure or what i imagine that to be like ! the inspiration came the literal day after i had a big prayer session where i asked for help coming up with the idea for what i most wanted to do i'm shy talking about the power of prayer , but i will say that it 's worked wonders in my life in the most unexpected ways there 's definitely something to it and it never hurts to ask , right ? the next day , i came across some drawings that struck my eye and the ideas began to flow i began drawing and doodling like mad and found i have a thing for drawing animals that are in funny little situations so i decided to go with that as my running theme and to see that i actually have a particular illustrative style i never knew about really shocks me i thought i would need to spend so much time developing that but it 's been there all along just waiting for me to discover it for the first time since i was a kid i'm completely excited , giddy , and pumped to draw my university art education sort of squashed the joy for me when it became about getting good grades , competing with ridiculously talented people and pleasing crazy professors somewhere along the line i lost the joy and what i most wanted to do but , i 've found that excitement again and i 've been riding the high i 've just finished different illustrations and am developing more i'm finding time during the kids' naps or stolen moments during the day i get so much relaxation in working it 's very therapeutic to get lost in a drawing it quiets the mind and strangely enough , it 's very energizing i feel like i could work all night long if i knew i did n't have little ones needing me to be awake in the morning ! so , i plan to dust off the shelves of my etsy shop and do a product overhaul i'm even considering a new shop name in the meantime , i'm developing my illustrations and researching the best papers to print with and all the other nitty gritty details that go into running my little store efficiently here 's a sneak peek at a piece of an illustration just to give you a taste of what i'm doing ca n't spill all the beans yet ! things still need to unfold i 'll be back soon to talk about this more , no doubt ! until then , my friends ! save you might also like career dreamin' back in the saddle again it 's all coming together linkwithin
