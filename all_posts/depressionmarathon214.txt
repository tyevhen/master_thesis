my mood has dropped while i'm not shocked , it still stinks i 've noticed my mood slowly descending over the past few weeks i'm at the point now where doing everyday chores , errands , and work is getting overwhelming and challenging but what i notice most is that i'm going through the motions i'm not enjoying life right now i'm doing life , but i'm not really experiencing life that sucks i do n't like going through the motions it 's difficult to motivate for that on the other hand things could be worse i was expecting this divot , and i think that makes it easier to deal with i know the impetus for this slow decline it is n't coming out of the blue i'm worried , but i'm aware i knew wearing this boot , which makes everything more difficult , is exhausting , and prohibits me from almost all exercise , would put me at high risk for a depression relapse thankfully , i'm not there yet things could definitely be worse i do n't want things to get worse i have no desire to approach a full blown depression relapse i'm going to continue doing whatever i can do to keep this dip to a divot i'm not going to allow it to become a canyon not if i can help it ! and i think i can help it with a little conscious effort , i'm hopeful i can stop this slow descent where it 's at i'm going to do that by sticking to my schedule and routine , regardless of how dull or overwhelmed i may feel i'm going to continue to eat well , get enough sleep , take care of jet , take my medications , exercise as best i can , go to work , keep my appointments , and make it to meetings i'm even paying attention to things like showering and doing my dishes i know if i let the simple things go , everything else will become more challenging conscious effort that 's what i need i need to keep the darkness at bay i feel like it is waiting in the wings , and i 've got to fight to keep it from enveloping me it 's weird my depression today feels like a thing a being , even a very patient being waiting to pounce i 've got to protect myself simple steps , one foot in front of the other , i 've got to keep moving forward sounds cliche , but for me it 's true it 's the only way i know to combat the darkness waiting for me
