besides pride , trust is also a handicap to me remember the quote , pride comes before the fall you can replace pride with trust because both can get you in a world of trouble before kennedy s disease , i trusted that my muscles and reflexes would be there for me when i needed them whether work or play , my muscles and reflexes could be counted on for example if i tripped , i would catch myself before i fell if i dropped something like a tool , ball or cup , i would catch it before it hit the ground if i became tired walking , biking or hiking , i would take a short break and everything would be fine nothing was ever too far if something was too heavy , it just meant i needed a friend to help carry it i never thought about not being able to get up from the ground i never worried about climbing a ladder or the stairs like pride , trust always seemed to get me in trouble as my kennedy s disease symptoms progressed i felt i could still do whatever , whenever , until proven wrong and , often , the proof was much worse than just a loss in trust
