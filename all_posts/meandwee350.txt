hi there ! today 's book is called little green by keith baker paige has loved looking at it and hearing the tale since she was weeks old and in her little bouncy chair she continues to squeal with delight at it she seems to have a crush on the guy in the book since she always smiles and shrieks when she sees him the guy watches a little green hummingbird out his window and observes as it flies around in different directions so he can paint it 's path it 's cute i think the appeal is the very colorful and vibrant illustrations that cover the pages one neat thing for when she is older is that there 's a little caterpillar hidden on each page for the kiddo to try and find where 's waldo style it 's another winner ! save
