last wednesday , december th , i celebrated months clean and sober i'm an addict this is n't the first time i 've gotten clean the first time was in after a devastating break up with a girlfriend that took about years to get over i relapsed went back out , in step parlance about months later near the end of another relationship soon after that , i moved from boulder , co to missoula and stayed clean for years i relapsed again sometime in of course , my girlfriend and i were breaking up do we see a pattern here yet ? , and this time i stayed out for around years there was a period of months or so during that time that i was abstinent not using , just sort of taking a break from using , although intending to go back to it eventually , which i did when i did start again , it was at the beginning of a relationship , not the end i had found a sexy girl addict to use with me our relationship mostly consisted of smoking weed and fucking and me talking about how i should n't be smoking weed and fucking her she disappeared months later and i 've never heard from her again there 's a good chance she 's dead katina , i'm so sorry for how i treated you i love you and you deserved better i miss you i got clean yet again the wake up call that time was my t boning a county sheriff officer 's truck on the way to my dealer 's house i was n't stoned at the time lucky for me , so there was no breathalyzer test and i was n't arrested i got lucky because the accident was my fault and i was driving without insurance god , the things you do when you 're getting high just imagine what could have happened if i 'd hit him after visiting the dealer i got clean again on a vacation trip back to boulder a kind hearted and gentle man with strong recovery agreed to act as a temporary sponsor for me when i got back to missoula , i got serious about working a program i started going to lots of al anon meetings and eventually worked the steps with a man who 's the best sponsor i 've ever had and is still my sponsor today thanks , chris the gifts you 've given me are something i can never repay i stayed clean for years , from to that was the longest period of sobriety in my life , at least from drugs i relapsed during a particularly hard stretch of a wait for it a relationship ! ca n't fool you , can i ? you 're just too smart i started with alcohol and pot , my doc drug of choice for all you flat landers , then moved to snorting ritalin this was a new and alarming behavior in my addictive life i 'd pretty much been just a pothead for years pot is surely a drug and is addictive , but it 's at least a naturally occurring substance that 's minimally processed , though it 's been hugely inbred and is much , much stronger than it was or years ago ritalin is a wonderful drug my brain just accepts it as cocaine , which i love , although i 've never done a lot of it i 've always loved stimulants very strong coffee and mt dew are prime examples i doubt i would have made it through school without mt dew anyway , ritalin beats out coke as a drug any day in my book because it 's legal even taking it intranasally , as i was doing , is not illegal in and of itself it 's virtually identical to cocaine in its effects on the brain it 's cheap generic ritalin costs about for a month 's supply thanks , wal mart of course , when i say month 's supply i really mean about days worth it 's easy to get gone were my days of white knuckling it while waiting for my dealer to call me back gone was the nervous drive home , taking care to obey the speed limit and not attract any attention suddenly , my dealer was every pharmacy in town ! beat that , coke ! you get a lot of shit done in more , now , again , elizabeth wurtzel jokes that a speed freak can water a plant for days straight she 's not kidding ritalin is a web developer 's dream i 've never had such focus or appetite for minutia in my life i could work straight through , hours a day the months i was snorting were the most productive of my professional life on the other hand ritalin 's not such a great drug because it kills you taken in large quantities , ritalin causes permanent damage to your central nervous system while slowly poisoning you ever wonder why meth addicts look like shit ? do enough ritalin and you 'll probably find out it destroys your self respect this was the first time in my life i 've ever truly felt like a junkie i got a little taste of what the guys who panhandle me in front of the court house are living with i had visions of ending up that way it could happen although the drug itself is not illegal , the method of procurement usually is i was faking prescriptions , the most common method of obtaining large quantities of pharmaceutical drugs i have some skill with photoshop , and montana has weak prescription monitoring laws there was no centralized system to track that i was getting the same prescription filled at different pharmacies simultaneously faking a prescription is a felony offense i totally get why elizabeth wurtzel fell in love with ritalin it 's wonderful it produces the most lovely , euphoric calm i 've ever experienced it makes all the fear and loneliness and depression and hurt instantly go away i 'd be lying if i said i did n't miss it , even though it 's the surest path to death i can think of , short of putting a shotgun in my mouth i 've been wanting it , craving it lately , even though i know what would happen it would be so easy just one phone call i need to get my ass to some meetings
