so what did i do on vacation ? lazed around a lot , talked with the other kids , swam a bit , took lots of pictures , finally finished the teenage liberation handbook , looked at quite a few trashy magazines , ate some good food i did n't enjoy the adult company there particularly all of these people have know me since before i could crawl , and they still treat me like a kid and around them , i feel like a kid normally , i talk quite happily to any age , without feeling inferior , but that group just makes me feel little i guess is the right word not great i still had an okay time though here are some pictures so thats a bout it for the vacation week i guess i'm rather happy to be home , and i'm looking forward to seeing the friend my sister and i have been writing to , since he 's coming back this week ! i 'll write a post for yesterday and today
