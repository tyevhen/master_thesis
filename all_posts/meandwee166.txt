yowza ! we 've been squeezing noah into his miracle blanket up until yesterday yep , he was squished and jammed into that thing without an inch of fabric to spare in fact , it was totally stretched to the limit well , now , he gets out of it pretty much instantly and i just ca n't cram him in there anymore but he slept so well in it ! soooooo , we sadly moved him into a sleep sack it 's been an epic nightmare thus far he just does n't know what to do with himself and his arms flail all around he rolls over and gets stuck his paci falls out blah blah blahhh i figured hey ! i 'll just swaddle him in one of those fancy swaddle blankets we got ! they are bigger ! i did a good tight swaddle but the stretchy material allowed his little arms to come right out of there darn it ! he just rolls around the bed and cries as he tries to figure out what to do sigh looks like it 's going to be a long few days i 've decided to just rip this band aid off and continue on with the sleep sack and ween off the paci he has to learn how to soothe himself and fall asleep on his own but that does n't mean it will be easy ! there will be tears and screaming and rolling around , and then i 'll need to deal with noah ! ha ! wish us luck i'm gonna need it save you might also like an update many faces addicted linkwithin
