i just read a very touching article on the new york times well blog by an oncologist who talks about a visit with a deceased patient 's wife and children i finished the article , the widow 's doctor visit and thought , if i ever have that illness , i want this man to be my doctor i never think that , but this oncologist 's insight into what a grieving family is going through is remarkable , as is his willingness to openly discuss it he tells the widow that the patient was lucky to have such a supportive wife he tells the son his father wore the same shoes , so he too must be a spiffy dresser , like his dad oh , actually the writer said 'fancy' but i like spiffy better he tells the children that it 's okay if they are a little glad that they do n't have to watch their father suffer and to have their worlds revolve his medical condition he has some sense of what it is that families are looking for , and that 's nice but it is n't actually true that i would want this guy to be my doctor the truth is , if i had a bad illness , i 'd want the doctor with the best outcomes , not the doctor with the best beside manner and really , i know the i know this doctor can write a moving article this is worth a few points in my book but it does n't mean that his interpersonal delivery is wonderful it may be and i certainly liked him from what i read but if i had a chronic illness , or one where a bad outcome was virtually guaranteed , then i 'd want the best bedside manner and the doctor who could pad the ride with some kindness and sensitivity they do n't teach you in medical school to tell the wife who has just cared for a terribly ill husband that he was lucky to have her they should what do you think ? oh , and do surf over to the well blog and read the article then , if you want , surf over to kevinmd and read this article and let me know if i was mistaken to find it offensive i just could n't get a feel for the author 's tone
