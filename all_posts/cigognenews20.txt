why do we care so much when our team loses or wins ? why do we high five each other when our man scores a touchdown ? after all , it is he , not us but wait not so it is us too there is something we have in the upper reaches of the brain called mirror neurons in an area called pre motor cortex these are nerve cells in his brain that light up when the man scores a touchdown and also light up the same area in our brains when we watch it happening we feel what he feels if he wins , we win it is neurological , which allows us to live through someone else , and also to empathize with others it enables us to feel the same emotion when someone sings with feeling it triggers all of the associated memories with that feeling , our loss , rejection , our finding warmth and or losing it when we think about a song , we can have all of the related emotions all over again it has been engraved in the brain and can be recalled at any time the grand orchestrator seems to gather up all the disparate facets of memory , assembles them into a meaningful event and remembers it entirely the memory is a network of brain circuits joining in an assembly of nerve cells to fill out previous experience thus any feeling in the present has the ability to trigger a whole host of memories and feelings that resonate with the present and glide along the same neuronal frequency in this way a pain now , a rejection , can resonate with serious past rejection from our parents and thereby produce an anxiety attack it gives weight to the present reaction , which may seem inordinate , but in reality is the bottom rung of a neuronal circuit it is in this way that we can summon up the memory of love , feel love and offer it to others if we never had it , we cannot offer it to anyone , because the feeling is not there pain in the present , a humiliation , sets off an old memory the gates rush in to block the resonating circuits to keep our reactions under control the circuits involved are all part of the entire experience we can block part of it from our past so we can function in the present my work involves getting below the gating , which keeps old memories at bay , to penetrate the antipodes of the unconscious and allow individuals to heal because they have felt all of the old pain that has gnawed away at them for decades suppose the circuits of the mirror neurons evolve early in our lives , even before birth , and are adversely affected by womb life that may mean that the ability to empathize , to feel what others feel may be impaired the person grows up without those abilities the mother 's body , which was the whole world to the fetus , has shaped a being with diminished capacity of mirror neurons for now a supposition imagine that she was depressed and transmitted her pain through her hormones to the fetus who suffered he could not feel what she felt because it was too painful he withdraws one way he may do that is through diminished mirror neurons we will wait to see about this on the evolutionary scale , the feelings in music are much older than words , which came along millions of years later it is why music can move us far more than words it therefore has a greater impact hence the singing commercials , which did not come into being until after world war ii the discovery of these neurons was made by an italian team of scientists who used brain imaging techniques to find an entirely new class of neurons that become active when we are feeling what someone else is feeling is extraordinarily important for us to become humans who care for and about others these nerve cells are found in the parietal lobe and allow us to imitate unconsciously the actions of our parent so in some cases a male child will have an effeminate walk as his mirror neurons pick up clues from his mother this is another way of saying that he identifies more with his mother than with his father in essence , mirror neurons match actions and feelings of others with our own it shows we are social animals , otherwise why these neurons ? if we were social isolates we would not need mirror neurons so we can undergo what others undergo we should high five we feel what they feel it is a way we live through others and it is a way we can block our own painful feelings through what others achieve in life we therefore have a greater interest in baseball and football than what would be expected , because that is us out there
