a useful concept my current counselor taught me is to consider , what way is the train heading ? when you 're anxious , it 's easy to lose sight of your progress it 's easy to feel defeated yet recovery is a journey anxiety usually does n't develop overnight , so neither will problems dissipate as quickly as we would hope so consider where you are in your recovery process are you taking healthy steps to feel better ? if so , you probably are headed in the right direction your train may slow down at times , but with hard work you can keep it chugging toward your destination a healthier , less anxious life it 's not easy to stop , let alone turnaround , a train , so if you stay on track , you will reach your goal
