this week would be a good time to hedge any positions you have on spls the stock could break much higher , or much lower , after its earnings announcement on weds feb short interest on the stock has been running around mm shares three days worth of trading perfect for a short squeeze if the company reports an upside surprise but that would be a surprise indeed it will be interesting to follow the puts vs calls volume on the stock for the next two days longterm , i think you can only short this stock down to to say i'm not bullish on this stock is like saying i do n't think toilets flush upwards they only flush downwards unless you 're in deep space ironically , staples owes its existence to the early efforts of mitt romney friends , but is currently in dire need of a bain capital moment the company will only survive if it finds a suitor or new management , imho and i do n't think it will be the former i'm anxious to hear the feb earnings call in particular , i'm anxious to know management 's explanation of why stores are eerily empty quiet as a library , in my neighborhood and what they will blame their poor results on will it be the weak dollar ? the high cost of gasoline ? the recession ? competition from amazon ? competition from office max ? oh , i could be way wrong short term maybe staples had a stellar christmas season and a wonderful start of the school season maybe results wo n't be nearly as bad as i think they will be maybe same store comps will be up for the first time in recent memory maybe staples has a wonderful secret that they 've not yet shared with the rest of the world but you know what ? the felt marker writing , i think , is already on the wall staples is and always has been a small business play and recently , a soccer mom play small business , though , has been decimated by franchise chains over the past years staples' original base of support is all but gone and the new base of support soccer moms buying school supplies for their kids is too thin to support the existing infrastructure who wants to drive to staples to buy inkjet cartridges that you can find cheaper on amazon and show up at your door via ups ? not to put too fine a point on it , but staples is basically finished , if they still consider small business to be their core customer base we 'll know the score on wednesday in the meantime , i say hedge your bets this one will break big , one direction or the other and i , for one , do n't want to be on the wrong side of the trade
