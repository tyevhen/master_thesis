there 's a new technology trend afoot in the auto industry that 's going to arrive , bigtime , in a showroom near you , sooner than you think it 's a trend that 's been brewing for years but now stands ready to gain truly historic traction it 's called turbocharging turbocharged engines have been available on certain popular car models such as the volvo series and mercedes diesels for decades but now turbocharged engines are poised to make a major showing in auto and light truck lineups the reason ? gasoline prices are on the rise , which means vehicle buyers are increasingly conscious of the need for greater fuel efficiency until recently , achieving greater fuel efficiency has simply meant ordering a smaller engine but to get the performance back , auto makers are now increasingly turning to turbocharging as a simple , bolt on way to get more oomph while at the same time actually improving rather than degrading fuel economy it 's not like the auto makers have much choice the u s government will be imposing much tougher mileage standards for to model years new corporate average fuel economy cafe targets are set to jump , in stages , to an average of mpg by an increase of about percent from current levels this sets an incredibly high bar for vehicle makers who are already struggling to do all they can to reduce vehicle weight , improve engine output , and reduce emissions , all at the same time the only realistic way to meet the new cafe standards is to add turbocharging to existing engines turbochargers are deceptively simple devices , in theory what they allow you to do , in effect , is put an exhaust gas driven pinwheel in the exhaust system , with the cold side of the pinwheel coupled to a fan a compressor that blows air into the engine 's intake system this is no ordinary pinwheel , however the turbine wheel in a modern turbocharger spins anywhere from , to , rpm sometimes more , making it quite easily the fastest moving part in your engine to last more than a few hours , the wheel itself must be made of exotic nickel based superalloy that can withstand continuous exposure to high temperature exhaust , and the entire assembly needs to be balanced to jet engine standards , lest the whole affair suffer catastrophic spontaneous disassembly engineering speak for an explosion at operating speeds only a handful of companies have deep experience in mass producing high output turbochargers one of the oldest such companies is the former garrett airesearch founded by cliff garrett in , which was acquired by signal oil gas in signal , in turn , merged with allied corporation in to form allied signal the latter bought honeywell for billion in , and although allied signal at the time of the acquisition was twice honeywell 's size , it chose to rename itself honeywell international because of honeywell 's superior brand recognition today , honeywell turbo technologies is the division of honeywell international that continues to produce the former garrett line of turbochargers it 's easily the largest turbocharger manufacturer in the world , producing some , units a day with plans to significantly increase that number later this year when honeywell 's new slovakian plant comes online honeywell 's three chief rivals in the turbo biz borg warner , mitsubishi heavy industries , and ishikawajima harima heavy industries , put together , produce about the same number of turbos per year as honeywell so honeywell is indeed the dominant player currently , only around of gasoline engines in the u s are turbocharged compared to more than in europe that share is set to grow to by and could top by , according to honeywell in part because of the regulatory tailwind mentioned earlier it 's clear that honeywell stands to see a significant increase in its turbocharger business in the coming years , even assuming motor vehicle production remains constant but vehicle builds have actually been increasing sharply of late in the u s , for example , the domestic auto build for is predicted to top million handily exceeding 's million if you combine steadily ramping vehicle production with a huge increase in market penetration for turbocharged engines , you have potentially , at least a home run for honeywell honeywell already has more than oem turbo applications in place with companies like bmw , caterpillar , ford , and volkswagen , with new applications in the pipeline this is a serious growth market for honeywell , and it is already showing signs of becoming a huge moneymaker for the company turbochargers form the bulk of honeywell 's transportation systems division revenues , and honeywell in its most recent k filing specifically credits its turbocharger business with that division 's year over year revenue growth , and yoy profit growth by contrast , the company 's larger and more mature aerospace division is experiencing only year over year growth the transportation systems division accounts for a little over of honeywell 's overall business , currently but at current growth rates , it will soon be a much bigger share of both top line and bottom line revenues is there a down side to the business ? not really even if fuel prices were to level out or decline over the next several years , government mandated cafe standards will still virtually guarantee that honeywell will continue to see vibrant growth in its u s turbocharger business all the more true when you consider that auto makers truly have exhausted their engineering bag of tricks when it comes to wringing more fuel economy out of today 's engines going forward , turbocharging is a must , if cafe standards are to be met pound for pound , turbocharging is the least expensive , easiest , most reliable way to get more performance and more fuel economy , simultaneously , out of an engine no one seriously questions that fact honeywell international nyse hon has recently been trading in the high fifties , with a week range of to and a p e multiple of around the stock pays a dividend of and is institutionally owned the most recent k filing is here the author does not hold any position in honeywell stock , nor the stock of its competitors
