dear brian , no doubt this letter finds you in a sea of demands , wave after wave as apt to boil over you as take you for a fine ride to shore , with its leisurely strolls and happy findings at this moment i imagine barb running along the gulf shore in alabama , soaking in warm sunrise it s as likely to get a call from her saying a cold wind blows the rain in fits , a picture of your days perhaps last night i spent a fair evening with whitney s father , ricardo , as i affectionately call him on our boozy jaunts he calls me carlos , and his friend juan , since our wives are retreating together at the hitchcock s condo we figured we owed ourselves this indulgence ironically , i had pledged an oath of sobriety for health reasons and , thus , was designated taxi upon our arrival at the old toad parking lot , we noticed the attendant s light on , meaning an extortionist s fee to stable my steed however said bandit was nowhere to be seen on such a bleak and rain sodden night so being men of reason , we falsely assumed a free pass much carefree talk ensued , the consumption of red stripe para mis amigos , coke para mi , and a homely meal of shepherd s pie with british chips upon our sated leave we found my copper steed , my quest , no longer kept safely in her place memories of the hijacked caravan flooded me like so many drops of rain and i was soaked with dread then he appeared , a dwarf of a lad by the name of fred , unkempt under a purple umbrella , smirking at our fate are you the owner of the quest ? he baited it was towed just five minutes ago now the unrelenting downpour turned to what i imagined as blows i pictured myself choking the fungal mushroomed man he righteously advised us to call the extortionist 's livery to ransom the steed and assured us of his valor , our accusations of perfidy unjust i m just doing my job i ve been working my ass off when an appeal went forth to our common ancestry and good will , when i said , we looked for you to pay our fair share , he scoffed , yeah , right it was then a shot rang out in the alley and i saw what looked like a crimson stain on fred s breast , his eyes wide with fright to my consternation , upon closer inspection , it was only ketchup and the backfire from an old car it was futile to engage our delinquent toady and we hastened to the shelter of the friendlier pub a desperate call was placed to a mutual friend who bailed us out for the bond of a brew and some brotherhood an hour later our brave party rejoined the quest for a sum of the livery sentry was dressed in plaid flannel and denim , smelled of stale garlic , smoking a cheap cigar he glared us off the lot while i thought briefly about trampling him with the steed on the way home , ricardo and juan began plotting fred s demise , being highly trained scientists with a penchant for perverse experimentation earlier that evening , ricardo regaled us with a harrowing tale about flares and seagull feathers you can be assured the planet suffers one less scavenger this day i for my part am happy to have my quest back in sight along with my sober wits intact in perpetuity , charles
