why is the first movement of brahms' first symphony so unsure of itself , seeking , trying , thirsting for a melody but always avoiding it , unlike the fourth movement it 's what i'm listening to as i write this he 's my favorite composer jeez much to say , so little time due to sleep deprivation the night before last , my mood has temporarily improved the literature claims sleep deprivation gives only a short term boost but i know no study that tested it while the patient 's medications were maximized speaking of medications , we have no insurance and must pay cash for them just to stay within barking distance of the light near the top of the pit two characters i met yesterday were preminently hootable one , half hopi indian , told me his frizzy hair was typical of the hopis he also told me about peyote ceremonies and how he had seen angels twice tall men in white , glowing , with large wings i saw three when my mom recovered from her cancer who am i to doubt him ? another fellow was a grower and seller of marijuana who proudly informed me that in this county each resident was allowed lbs of pot for personal use and a garden of cannibis no larger than ' by ' or plants he has his plants , romuluns and monkey balls , in gallon containers so he can move them to the legal square footage if need be i asked this character how much an ounce of pot would sell for in his town , rumored to be the hub of our county 's herb business , and he laughed you could n't buy it there 's too many people growing it someone would give you an ounce i would he also said that of our crop gets shipped to washington and new york , almost none to la harrumph ! now that i'm past fifty and have lost my youthful infatuation with herb , i can get it free else grow it legally thankfully i have enough tomatoes and cucumbers to keep me busy , not to mention the marigolds and nasturtiums and thank you , sam rasnake , for being the first member of the chaffin cargo cult club soon your pin and t shirt will arrive meanwhile you are honorary president of the cult unless annette funicello gets out of her wheelchair what a babe she was ! i 've always preferred brunettes preferred hmmmm how about a poem that may piss off feminists ? as if i care though that 's not why i wrote it listen to the voice of the poem it is not that of craig erick , rather some haughty nobleman it is not misogynistic but what in many cultures would be called traditional and the speaker is not as bad a fellow as in browning 's my last duchess his preferences when walking bow your shoulders back to lift your breasts and steel your lower spine to cinch your waist , but relax your ass , let cheeks bob on femurs like carousel horses and let your toes land first to swing your strong legs forward weightlessly in dress i favor solids or fine prints so not to distract from your own coloring jeans are good , tight though not uncomfortable , in blue or black avoid white , i think it pretentious and impractical while you are not when dressing or undressing in my presence , do it self consciously like botticelli 's venus who shielded her mons with hair of gold and partly hid her breasts with the other arm if we should kiss while standing , put your nipples lightly to my chest so i can feel them stiffen , but wrap your hips close to feel my need and please , try not to cry during sex i'm calling myself rodent neutral today let 's see if the sleep deprivation has a longer effect thine in kilorats or kilobunnies , c e chaffin
