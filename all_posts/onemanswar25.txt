things , in no particular order , for which i am thankful from the perspective of a man who deals with mental illness my wife she has stood by me through good times and bad compassionate but candid when i need to be called out for not trying hard enough would not be here without her and my kids valium sometimes it s the only thing that quiets my anxiety and slows down those racing thoughts my psychiatrist and my therapist good doctors who really understand mental illness are hard to find if you are depressed and aren t getting the help you need from an internist , i d make it a new year s resolution to find a specialist chewing gum gum is definitely underrated drug companies tar and feather me for saying this , but if they didn t invest millions in r d , we wouldn t have anti depressants that improve the lives of millions i have no problem with them making a profit starbucks they say caffeine can actually help with depression and their mocha gives me mojo when i'm feeling down so drink up politics it s a good diversion when i don t want to think about my problems and it makes me realize there are people who are more confused about life than i am blue bell ice cream i read somewhere that too much sugar can impair the brain s ability to make enough serotonin that s okay refer back to and my children for making me laugh , making me cry , for teaching me about patience and for giving me three really good reasons to get out of bed on the days i do n't feel like it football an even better diversion than politics only when my team loses , i have to refer back to i know it s been a while since i last blogged , but i haven t had much to say happy thanksgiving , and feel free to share what you re thankful for , especially if you deal with mental illness
