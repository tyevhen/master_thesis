first , check out our podcast with return guest dr ray depaulo then , let me tell you about my weekend i went away with my husband on a quick trip to my aunt 's th birthday party she looks fantastic , her sister was there , her brother in law has n't slowed down any and he had a few too many and was out on the dance floor with his grandchildren it was a nice time and there were maybe of us there for a nice celebration in a hotel banquet room across the hall , there was a wedding in the adjacent exhibit hall there were oh , guests there for extreme cage fighting i 've never quite seen anything like this i'm not sure how to begin to describe it okay , so i tried to go in to check it out i 've never heard of cage fighting but apparently it 's the ultimate in brutality two men in a cage trying to beat each other to a pulp what fun i was dressed like i was going to my aunt 's th birthday party security stopped me may i help you ? i did n't know what to say i guess i'm at the wrong event he looked me over and said , you 're at the wrong event everyone else was in wife beater shirts my tattoos well , let 's not go there he let me stand there for a few , i watched as the police dragged out a few people , it was quite the scene so the hotel had lost my reservation and we ended up sleeping at another hotel minutes away i heard from my cousins that this was not a bad thing the extreme cage fighting observers were drunk , rowdy , and raucous through a good part of the night someone erroneously reported a fight in my cousin 's room and the police came pounding on her door at am , she sent them away saying that she and her year old mother were not fighting down the road , my husband and i spent a quieter night , away from our teenagers we chatted , i told him about fat doctor 's trouble with her difficult day care provider and how she wants to adopt another child this is what my life has come to so everyone i tell about the extreme cage fighters says to me , you 're the psychiatrist , why do people like this ? i guess i could ramble about the baser of human instincts , a pull towards competition and violence something freudian honestly , though , i do n't get it i wo n't be jumping in any cages any time soon and roy , count me out for the mud wrestling
