it 's always nice when others recognize the changes we 've made , especially if those changes were positive and intentional tonight , i unexpectedly received such recognition i am very grateful it was a thoughtful gift in my otherwise desolate recent existence ironically , this feedback occurred quite publicly from a man i know only in passing we were at a large meeting he was speaking about his experience during years in our program of sobriety to the crowd of approximately people , he relayed his joy at watching one member grow over the past couple years he stated when this person arrived he she never lifted their head and could n't even look anyone in the eye then , he continued , they came to meetings and got involved in service , and today you would n't even recognize 'em as the same person he was quite careful to remain gender neutral , but i assumed he was referring to a man i immediately scanned the room for a pride filled face i also scanned forward to the bright face of a slight woman a few seats from me i had immediately noticed her when i 'd entered the room ironically , i 'd attended to her for the exact reason j , the speaker , was describing now from the stage this woman originally came around just a few months ago she looked sad , timid , battered , weak , and tearful now , she was glowing i thought , i need to tell her she looks great ! i need to let her know she 's changed beautifully ! she was looking up , talking , and meeting the eyes of all around her she looked like a totally different person , and i wanted to congratulate her i wanted her to know someone had noticed after j finished , and our meeting wrapped up , i was moving toward this woman to say hello before i reached her , j tapped me on the shoulder he cheerfully informed me that i was the transformed person to whom he had earlier referred ! me i was absolutely stunned ! i was n't quite sure how to respond fortunately , before i could over think it , my face broke out in a huge grin i sort of felt like i should cry you know , the i'm so touched cry but i was really , really happy ! i think i said , really ? in my best junior high , bobby really likes me ? voice and then , a bit startled by my helium tinged vocalization , i simply thanked him over , and over , and over , i thanked him i thanked him for noticing the change , but more importantly , for telling me he noticed the change we so rarely get positive feedback to get positive feedback about this the state of my being , my character , and the work i 've done to develop this character wow ! ! this was big feedback ! yet , ironically , it is feedback i have not received from my closest friends my friends ca n't seem to let me out of the hole in which i used to fit rather than see positive change , their response has been to freeze me in the past , and to see me less and less presently as i grow , we grow apart that 's ironic their loss hurts less today than it did a few years ago , but only because i continue to grow and as i grow , i get more and more okay with letting go i do n't need to stay in that ill fitting hole just to cling to old friends j would be proud in the past , that person who could n't look anyone in the eye would have desperately contorted to make herself fit the hole thankfully , i do n't have to do that today instead , i can stand tall and step out of that hole apparently , i 've been doing that , and at least one person has taken notice thanks , j thanks for the positive feedback thanks for the gift i 'll be sure to pass it on
