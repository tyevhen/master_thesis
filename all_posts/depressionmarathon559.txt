in my last post i was fretting about my fragility and longing to be normal well , not too much has changed in the past couple days i'm still worried about my mood it 's still not up to par with where i was a few weeks ago for example , i ran miles this morning it was a really good run , too my last two miles were faster than the pace of the previous thirteen that 's always nice i felt great immediately after the run , but that has n't held i 've been sinking ever since my psychiatrist , who i saw yesterday , is concerned she wants to increase one of my meds again we decreased it a few weeks ago it was making me gain weight i did n't like that obviously , i balked at increasing it she respected that , but if my mood continues to slide , i'm pretty sure i wo n't have much of a choice the next time i see her and that 's okay , i guess i trust her , and i doubt i 'd be alive without her i'm grateful for her compassion , assistance , and excellence while i was running this morning , i was thinking about my last post and normalcy i wonder how many years i 'd have to go without a significant dip in my mood to lose the mistrust of the future i wonder how long it would take for me to gain the air of certainty that my plans would come to fruition i wonder if i 'll ever stop expecting the other shoe to drop i wonder ideally , i suppose i should stop wondering and begin working on acceptance after all , i have only so much control over what direction this illness will take i ca n't imagine how miserable i might be if i did n't exercise , eat right , stay sober , and attempt to keep my life stress low the fact that i still suffer , despite taking these steps , should help me accept this is a biological , physiological illness so why do i still get stuck feeling like it 's a character defect ? boy , i'm all over the map with this post today i guess that 's consistent with my racing brain right now it 's all over the place , too another sign i'm not doing the best i 'll close by thanking all of you for visiting my little blog i appreciate it i hope something i said makes life today a little easier for at least one of you
