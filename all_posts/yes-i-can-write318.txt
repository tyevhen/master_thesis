i have n't really talked about my spiritual beliefs in this blog before , although i 've certainly mentioned and state at the top of my blog that i'm an animist so , when i stumbled upon this post on the blog the center for bioregional animism , i wanted to share this definition of animism , which i find to be very accurate the most common definition of animism is the belief of spirits inhabiting animals , plants , and inanimate objects however , this is an over simplification based upon western colonial concepts animism is being re evaluated by many in the fields of comparative religion and anthropology a new understanding is surfacing in the writings of graham harvey , he explains that animism is not the projection of human qualities upon objects he argues that these old ideas are outdated on the contrary , animism is an absence of the idea that humans are superior and or separate from the living world animism relates to the world as a community of people , only some of whom are human by relinquishing our dominion over the rights and consideration of person hood , the world is no longer a collection of resources for consumption , but is seen as a delicate web of relationships peace , idzie you might also like it begins in fire core values green anarchy depressing world we live in , is n't it ? linkwithin
