my wife constantly tells me i have too much time on my hands since i retired perhaps she is right this post has nothing to do with kennedy 's disease and yet everything to do with 'living with kennedy 's disease' almost everyone enjoys magic i ran across these three videos on ted the other day and thought i would share them with you i felt great after watching these talented entertainers once again it proves that laughter is the best medicine ! this was an enjoyable five minute presentation that will get you warmed up for more tricks marco tempest the magic of truth and lies using three ipods like magical props , marco tempest spins a clever , surprisingly heartfelt meditation on truth and lies , art and emotion this is a fun twenty minute presentation of magic of the mind keith s second sight demonstration is amazing the ending had me laughing so hard because a member of the audience believes he is smarter than the magician until the tables are turned enjoy ! keith barry does brain magic first , keith barry shows us how our brains can fool our bodies in a trick that works via podcast too then he involves the audience in some jaw dropping and even a bit dangerous feats of brain magic this is a longer minute presentation , but mr green is so funny and talented i could not stop watching lennart green does close up card magic like your uncle at a family party , the rumpled swedish doctor lennart green says , pick a card , any card but what he does with those cards is pure magic flabbergasting , lightning fast , how does he do it ? magic are you smiling ? do you feel better ?
