i'm taking a late afternoon coffee break i 've spent the day cleaning my house i do n't think there 's much i dislike more than cleaning do n't get me wrong i would n't be embarrassed if someone dropped in just about any day or time i keep my house picked up and the dishes washed , etc but i really dislike cleaning things i 've been doing today , vacuuming , washing floors , dusting , scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom these are the things i do n't care to do but i 've got company coming i guess that 's the good and the bad reality of impending company i get a really sparkly house out of the deal , which i love , but i hate making it sparkle ! i'm surrounded by sparkle right now , although i still have to clean the bathroom ! damn ! i'm looking forward to my company , d , arriving tomorrow evening he 'll be here until mid day sunday i wish we could spend more time together , but that 's the major challenge of living hours apart it 's one of many big challenges but so far , i think it 's been worth the work i'm sure we 'll spend more time working , i e talking , this weekend i sure wish d could assure me he wo n't disappear again if i have a depression episode , but maybe it 's not fair to expect such assurances this is a developing relationship after all nevertheless , i worry i try not to think into the future but i ca n't help but wonder what will happen if i get sick and end up in the hospital if he 's unable to say he wo n't leave , i guess i have to decide if continuing to see him is worth the risk work i try not to have the worry thoughts i much prefer to stay in the moment and enjoy our time together and for the most part , that 's what i plan to do this weekend i think it will be a good weekend , too short , but good nonetheless i 'll keep you updated
