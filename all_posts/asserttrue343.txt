lately i 've been reading a terrific book called now write ! screenwriting , tarcher penguin , edited by sherry ellis and laurie lamson it 's a collection of short one to four pages long tips from various successful screenwriters , presented in the form of exercises in addition to practical advice on story construction , the tips and exercises are meant to help with ideation hence the book is potentially of great help to any writer , in any form or genre i wo n't ca n't attempt to recap the book 's tips here if you 're a fiction writer , go seek out the book , either at a bookstore or the library you 'll thank me later after reading a few of the essays in now write ! screenwriting , i started ideating here below is one idea that came to me warning not fully baked intake of half baked ideas may lead to intestinal and or intracranial distress consume at your own risk begin weird idea a twenty something cubicle drone from cupertino whom we 'll call tyler schremp , having fallen into a deep existential depression triggered by the sudden passing of cordelia , his pet chinchilla , decides to seek psychotherapy he has had depression , episodically , all his life in terms of therapies and meds , he 's been through the mill nothing works it 's all palliative , at best schremp gets a tip from a trusted friend of the family , a retired therapist , who recommends the ultimate last resort , a therapy known as bosonic avatar therapy , or batty , practiced by its developer , dr egon pringle i understand bat but what does the 'ty' stand for ? answer it stands for thank your lucky stars but in that case should n't it be battyls ? look , do you want the therapy or not ? it 's just a goddam mnemonic schremp seeks pringle out and finds him to be how shall we say a tad eccentric but he comes highly recommended diplomas , publications , awards , etc pringle hands schremp a puppet this is your starter avatar it 's rough , i know it 'll have to do for now we 'll get you a proper avatar , one that looks like you , soon enough pringle explains that for proper disjunction of the subconscious anti self , it is crucial that all therapy be conducted via the avatar in other words , schremp sits on a rug on the floor next to a couch , and he has to lay the puppet down on the couch and speak through the puppet pringle , in turn , produces a freud puppet with cigar and speaks only through the freud avatar back me up a second , schremp says what does it mean , this 'bosonic avatar' stuff the freud puppet moves its mouth please state your question through your avatar schremp moves his puppet 's mouth okay , sorry what does bosonic mean ? freud puppet my god , man , did you not take elementary physics in school ? what the hell college did you go to ? surely you know that the universe is constructed , broadly speaking , of only two types of particles leptons and bosons light and heavy electronics are leptons that 's what makes your brain work , electricity bosons are protons and other heavy forms of matter solid stuff that chair the rug you 're sitting on the air you breathe schremp puppet air is n't a solid freud puppet this is why you need my help ! you 're not perceiving reality correctly fast forward a couple weeks schremp is now under doctor 's orders carrying around with him , , a schremp puppet , schremp like down to the sad sacky sunken eyes , complete with a miniature iphone in its pocket coworkers give him odd looks when he needs to express his true feelings , schremp has to use the puppet avatar the avatar mouths off to people schremp 's supervisor at work is increasingly annoyed schremp finds himself at a bar after work , wanting to drown his sorrows schremp avatar do you serve ventriloquists here ? bartender yeah , sure well , i 'll have a vodka martini , and my big dummy friend here will have a root beer sorry , we do n't serve root beer make it a black russian then a short distance away , at the bar , is a sullen looking , nerdly young woman , sipping a pina colada next to her is a puppet replica of her , with a shot glass in front of it containing tequila and a rubber worm schremp puppet to nerdgirl avatar does your friend come here often ? nerd girl avatar to schremp puppet one woodpecker joke and i'm outa here schremp puppet how 's the bosonic avatar thing working out for you two ? we 're fucking shit faced , how do you think it 's working out ? and so on when dr pringle has decided individual therapy has gone far enough , he insists that schremp and his avatar progress to the next phase group ten patients sit in a circle , each one holding a puppet clone of him herself one of the patients is a muslim woman with full body burka her puppet also wears a full body burka and so it goes , until months later , schremp who has made little progress with his depression except that he has begun to write comedy routines in his spare time but meanwhile he 's increasingly suicidal hears from pringle , during a session , that his avatar is deeply disturbed and needs special therapy wait , schremp puppet says what are you saying ? i'm just speaking through my partner dr pringle 's freud puppet , to the schremp puppet partner schmartner you are now the patient here , your partner is fine you , i'm deeply concerned about you need intensive therapy , immediamente comprende ? do n't make me baker act you the baker act is only in florida nonsense ! i can commit you both to an instutition , right now , if that 's what you want all right , all right what are you suggesting , exactly ? dr pringle , through his puppet , hands schremp a card i want you to see this man he 's an eminent puppetologist , the best in the city you mean yes , your avatar is in serious need of deep contrabosonic therapy , cbt i 'll make the appointment for you right now dr pringle tries to dial a number with the freud puppet when it does n't work , he tosses the freud puppet aside and the puppet 's lit cigar starts a fire on the desk eventually , schremp ends up in the office of a dr yung , who operates a jung puppet this time , the schremp puppet sits on a rug while schremp lies on a couch schremp must pretend that the rug puppet is a ventriloquist making him speak end of ideation now obviously , the story needs a lot of work the nerdy girl has to figure into schremp 's life in a big way and there need to be additional minor characters a best friend , someone in the office who 's a friend , maybe an ex who can help steer schremp through the madness that 's become his life maybe at the end , the bartender whips out his bartender puppet and offers some poignant advice , the kind you can only get from a bartender puppet i 'll see how far i can take it for therapy 's sake
