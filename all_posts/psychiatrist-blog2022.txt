i take my psychiatry board recertification exam tomorrow i was in the second year of people who had to recertify every years , to prove that you keep up to date , rather than coasting on your laurels for the rest of your life the initial exam is a nerve racking affair , consisting of two parts , about a year apart part i is a written now computerized exam , hours of delightful multiple choice and k questions , pencils and monitored bathroom breaks you know how a watched pot never boils ? well you know part ii is where at least a third of examinees fall down , succumbing to anxiety stricken paralysis or fumbling mental status exams as you examine a real live patient in front of two real live psychiatrists for precisely minutes , then spend another minutes getting grilled and probed to determine if you know what you should know a colleague of mine had a patient who peed in the corner of the room , then just stared , not uttering one word for half an hour he passed , with a measure of sympathy thrown in , no doubt the recertification exam is a or hour computer based test i have n't studied one iota , lazily figuring that it should test me on real world knowledge at , it 's a bit of a gamble to not study but as long as i do n't pee in the corner of the room , i figure i should be okay
