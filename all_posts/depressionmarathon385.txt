my little boy , jet , will be year old tomorrow it 's hard to believe he 's that old already of course , he and i have only been together for months , and we 're still working things out now that he 's able to take walks , post arthroscopic elbow surgery , we 've been getting in some good training time we walk about blocks every night , and i'm training him to heel tonight , for the first time , he did it on a loose leash ! he 's catching on unfortunately , i do n't think the surgery fixed his elbow four weeks post op he still seems to be having discomfort in that joint he does fine being quiet around the house , but after we return from our walks , he usually ends up limping for that reason i have n't stopped the keeping him quiet routine with the exception of one day , when he was too wild out there and came in limping , he has n't played in his backyard since surgery he goes out on leash with me every time he needs a potty break , so his only activity is our daily walk i'm planning to continue our quiet routine until at least weeks post op , so we 've got a couple weeks to go he should be really good at heeling by then ! with the exception of that bright spot , however , i am concerned i hate not allowing him to play , but i'm still hoping for the best long term outcome i really do n't want him to be in pain his entire life i do n't want him to be prematurely lame either , but right now i'm scared that 's where we 're headed i'm going to follow up with the surgeon or my local vet tomorrow i pray the surgeon says he 's doing as expected and things will continue to improve i'm grateful jet 's still as enthusiatic , creative , and funny as always his right elbow may not be fixed , but his personality is far from broken ! he 's a joy !
