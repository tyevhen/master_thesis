to tie together some loose ends after my initial contact with the detective re stolen goods in our neighbor 's house , we talked once more and he wanted to meet with us sunday but we were n't back in time to do so he got off sunday at pm since then no messages and no contact we continue to be cordial to our neighbors officer ricky told me that this was a last ditch attempt , as the theft from their former landlord was six months old nearly the amount of time that they 've spent at their new residence kathleen loaned the suspects her digital camera in the hopes of getting fingerprints but all this suspense is for naught the detective does n't seem interested in the case , else he has more important things to tend to since we identified four items in our neighbors' house with certainty from his photographs , maybe he does n't want to bust them or maybe he wants to connect them to a ring of thieves or something but i never saw a cop not eager to bust a perp when he had the opportunity to catch him red handed even the cops up here seem laid back today 's emergency is kenyon those of you who followed our travails in mexico will remember our eleven year old , much traveled pooch he quit eating yesterday , threw up several times and passed blood stained mucous while straining to poop he 's listless he did n't even climb the stairs last night to be near kathleen , something i 've never seen before he 's at the vet now she 'll probably do a barium x ray of his bowels whatever it is , i hope it 's not fatal kathleen was already crying when i stopped by her work just to communicate the preliminaries as for my mood , i'm too sleep deprived to estimate it sleep deprivation helps depression temporarily i got nearly a week 's boost from the last all nighter but i did n't stay up all night last night as i got a few hours in still , i do have that drained feel of sleep deprivation meanwhile the task of matching all my credits to my published poems continues in its tedium , a nice distraction to have my filing system was done on the fly and is plain stupid one file held html pages and was sorted by magazine while the other held only word documents of poems published without annotations as to where so far i 've found the following online journals to be defunct , and when i say defunct i mean without archives , though some home pages remain , curiously afternoon apples and oranges a writer s choice artemis avalon beauty for ashes brownflower conspire disclosures free cuisenart horsethief s journal olympus poetry now poetry tonight in the grand scheme of things my filing project seems trivial nevertheless triviality is what i seek no major cosmic questions , please because of my mood i'm globalizing anyway i worry about things like how we 'll survive when i'm , my inability to crack the glass ceiling of recognized poets , and how the last ten years of my life may have been a waste in pursuing an art that has more authors than readers but the good news is that we got a tv ! a ilo tube television with a digital tuner for the amazing price of at wal mart i did my research online and phoned the nearest wal mart to make sure they had it in stock no , it 's not a flat screen , just your basic cathode ray model not bad for what it is enough babbling i 'll close today with a poem am i a poet yet ? i cut my head off with a chain saw , paraded like perseus with medusa 's , wishing i 'd put my hair into a net am i a poet yet ? i clove myself from crown to anus like those hanging pig carcasses you see , discarding my intestines on a bet am i a poet yet ? i went to bed with men , women and sheep , contracted syphilis , anthrax , took the cure romantically , clicking a castanet am i a poet yet ? i married and divorced and married again then divorced and married again the kids i do n't regret am i a poet yet ? someone slipped me powder , crystalline i put it up my nose and down my vein and danced all jangly like a marionette am i a poet yet ? i 've gone insane , been hospitalized , was shackled hand and feet while beaten by a connecticut police sextet am i a poet yet ? is the most i 've made in cash for a published poem or a reading in thirty years the only job that really makes me sweat am i a poet yet ? two kilorats , ce
