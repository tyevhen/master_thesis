yesterday 's new york times appears to be dedicated to psychiatric bloggers i got a head start with the article on ssri 's , but it 's going to take me a while to catch up jesse ca n't i get you to post about richard friedman 's article , why are we drugging our soldiers ? you 're my military buddy ! so i 'll start with in therapy forever ? enough already oh my by psychotherapist jonathan alpert who authored be fearless change your life in days excuse me , mr alpert , but when is your next opening ? i got me some issues that could use a quick fix alpert writes talk to friends , keep your ears open at a cafe , or read discussion boards online about length of time in therapy i bet you ll find many people who have remained in therapy long beyond the time they thought it would take to solve their problems according to a study published in the american journal of psychiatry , percent of people in psychotherapy use to visits for treatment , while in have more than sessions for this percent , therapy can become a dead end relationship research shows that , in many cases , the longer therapy lasts the less likely it is to be effective still , therapists are often reluctant to admit defeat he goes on to say therapy can and should focus on goals and outcomes , and people should be able to graduate from it in my practice , the people who spent years in therapy before coming to me were able to face their fears , calm their anxieties and reach life goals quickly often within weeks why ? i believe it s a matter of approach many patients need an aggressive therapist who prods them to face what they find uncomfortable change they need a therapist s opinion , advice and structured action plans okay , so i'm all in favor of goals and structure and action plans but a lot of people come for longer than visits , they are n't all failures or stuck in a bad place some , granted , are , and putting into words what happens in therapy and why it is helpful is really , really hard the psychoanalysts invented their own language for what happens in therapy , and it 's not one i was ever able to master okay , so why would therapy take more then appointments , in bullet points most people do n't come to see me to fix a discrete problem they usually come because they are uncomfortable with their feelings or behavior patterns and screaming really loudly stop drinking does not seem to work for me , maybe jonathan alpert has a better style these problems , like depression or anxiety or irritability or mood lability or panic attacks or being really stressed out , come and go the problems do n't get 'fixed' with an action plan they sometimes get fixed with medicines and therapy often provides some tools for better coping therapy offers a place to talk about feelings and behaviors that people are not comfortable talking to their friends about sometimes the issues are on going and a single dump is n't enough in these cases , therapy offers comfort insurance companies do n't want to hear that we need measurable goals that can be achieved in sessions comforting those who are suffering is not allowed please forgive my sarcasm people usually can generate their own list of action plans and they come to treatment because fixing the problem is complicated and often they have stuff to work through before they can leave the lousy husband , or feel good enough about themselves to quit the job , or perhaps they should n't quit the lousy job because while they want to , it pays the bills and they ca n't find another job psychiatric problems wax and wane and people need more support when their symptoms are more intense , and less when all is well it 's not uncommon for people to come in more often during difficult times and less often during the good times some people have problems such that they drive people away and have trouble with intimacy the therapeutic relationship may fill that void or be a place to examine those patterns sometimes people who do n't have problems with intimacy still find the therapeutic relationship to be really useful for people with behavioral issues , therapy provides a degree of accountability that can be very helpful some people come for a few sessions , they feel better , and that 's great some people have an on going mental disorder and regular therapy sessions provides a safety net a means to monitor moods , anxiety , delusions , hallucinations , or the stresses in life , and to talk about relationships , all as part of an ongoing process of coping with a chronic disorder and keeping the symptoms in check or catching relapses early some people find it helpful to go to therapy and talk about the thoughts that go round in their heads , and that 's about as scientific as i can get for them and finally , some people find that the therapeutic relationship adds a level of comfort , introspection , meaning , and focus to their lives that helps them siphon their emotional energies into creative and productive outlets there , i made up my own language so if you 're a chronic patient and it feels useful , do n't worry about it you may not even be a failure if you 're frustrated that therapy is n't helping you to fix what you wanted fixed , go see someone else for a consult and second opinion
