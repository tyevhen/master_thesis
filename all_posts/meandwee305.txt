hello ! so , yes , i 've finally cut off the television for paige during the day no biggie , right ? well , it 's a big deal to me see , my name is megan and i'm a t v holic the second i wake up until the second i go to bed the television is on in the background it always has been with paige around , i 've kept it on nick jr and she 'll watch a show or two and play the rest of the time glancing up on occasion to check it out i know what all the research has said about television and how it has a negative effect on babies and young children and should be limited to very little or no exposure there are a lot of factors as to why , which i wo n't get into here but , i 've noticed that paige has a bit of a speech lag going on she 's not delayed as of now , just a bit of a lag and i realized that having the t v on distracts her from what i am saying and so she 's missing out on valuable development time the more time spent focused on tv equals less time talking or listening to mama and interacting with her the other issue is i'm fully addicted to having the tv on i'm fine with her watching a show here or there but that 's not how i do it it 's just on all the time and i find that i ca n't control myself and leave it on constantly i feel like i need it for company or something i'm not sure what the deal is so , as of tuesday i turned it off for the day and have decided to do at least this whole week and continue on with no tv for paige going forward at least until i feel i can handle having the tv on for a show or two and trust myself to turn it back off that first day was hard ! i was getting itchy for the tv around mid morning and again around or so i had to force myself to avoid the entire tv area and it 's a lot more work to entertain and play with a busy toddler when there is n't the distraction box blaring i'm more tired for sure but , in a good way the second day went well it was still hard , but i felt more bonded to paige and we spent more quality time doing fun things together she seems much happier with this arrangement and is so much more cheerful although , i detect a bit of clinginess taking place her focus already seems better she 's certainly able to hear everything i say and react to it last night , chris even thanked me for trying this arrangement he found he enjoyed his paige time after work without the tv blaring and distracting his thoughts they had a lot more fun together chasing each other around the house and laughing we even ate together at the kitchen table and had quality conversation as a family quality all around ! something so simple is already making such a big change ! it 's wonderful to be present for life 's beautiful little moments and i'm already starting to enjoy the peace and quiet did i just say that ? ? ! one day i promise myself i 'll be able to put on a fun show or movie for paige to enjoy and i will be able to turn it off once it is over thus being able to move on to other things i wo n't let it rule my life for now , think we 've made a good start and are moving in the right direction save you might also like many faces the juggler an update linkwithin
