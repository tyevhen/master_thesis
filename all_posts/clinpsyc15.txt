according to a freshly published study , one in five depressed patients receiving services through the va healthcare system in the united states is taking an antipsychotic of those taking antipsychotics , were taking them at high doses schizophrenia doses rather than lower doses typically used in treating depression the study , published in the journal of clinical psychiatry , excluded patients with schizophrenia or bipolar diagnoses this means that the antipsychotics given to the depressed folks were n't mainly used to treat psychosis or mania the sample size was over , patients , so one ca n't fault the study for not including enough patients the researchers examined drugs taken within one week of their last antipsychotic prescription and found that of patients were taking multiple antipsychotics at that point the most used medication was seroquel this is not suprising patients seen in mental health speciality clinics were the most likely to receive antipsychotics so what are the consequences ? well , let 's see there 's the high rate of akathisia and medicore efficacy of abilify and there 's some tricky research involving risperdal that seemed to suggest the manipulation of the statistics was more impressive than the actual drug in treating depression seroquel 's unimpressive efficacy and problematic side effects are also not a ball of fun and so forth is n't progress beautiful ? i know what some people are thinking , so before you waste your valuable time with a comment , consider this i'm aware that many of these patients are suffering much more than a simple case of the blues that does n't mean we should throw heavy duty antipsychotics at them , particularly at high doses certainly there has to be something else what might that be ? some psychotherapy , some medications , some case management i ai n't saying it 'll be easy but i'm willing to bet that chucking antipsychotics at them en masse is not the solution
