as you know i am back at work and my silver lining luck is holding out what is silver lining luck you say ? sounds good does it not ? silver lining luck is bad luck with a silver lining bad luck that could have been worst but was saved from the worst scenario by a smidgen last time i had to file my ei report for my last week of ei , i had to call then because i declared that i had returned to work the second week of my report it took a few days to reach them so my half payment was delayed by a few days last week i found out that my paycheck would be delayed or reduced ? as i had an over payment of vacation i have no money and bad things happen but it could be a lot worst for example , i have food to feed us , i have a roof over our head and during the worst of the deep freeze we were warm i also have a car that works , has good tires and gas in it now i am scared that insurance will not cover me as i probably screwed up the phone interview but at least my part time pays as much as full ei it would be nice to have more as my bills are more and the cost of going to work gas parking is putting a further strain on my budget , it could definitely be worst another new thing that is happening is that i have started group therapy for social phobia it 's too early to tell if it will work yet but we seem to have a good group by their reaction to some things i can tell we have a lot in common by the end of the first session , their was already some small bit of bonding going on that 's pretty good for people dealing with social anxiety disorder i did sign a confidentiality agreement so there is a lot that i ca n't share , but i can admit to being in a group i have hopes that this group will help with my discomfort around people it may not cure the revulsion part natural part of a person who does n't like people over much working in client service for too many years on a side note , it 's almost tax time i hate doing my taxes but i love getting refunds i hope i will get a refund again this year , it will help a lot well that 's it for now , thanks for reading ! you might also like posts getting sporadic murphy 's law wind mobile the saga continues linkwithin
