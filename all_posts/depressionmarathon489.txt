my prayers go out to everyone on the east coast of the united states i hope everyone stays safe i have been watching this developing monster storm with particular attention , as i will be in new york city , hopefully , in just a few days ! so far it looks like things will be cleared up by this friday , which is when i'm supposed to arrive in fact , the extended forecast is for sun , sun , sun from friday through marathon sunday whether my plane will be able to land as scheduled i do not know , but if i can get there , the weather is looking like it may be okay i'm getting prepared to leave my plan is to pack tomorrow , even though i do n't fly out until friday i'm that excited , and i'm that worried i may forget something i want to prepare early silly , i know , but i think it will help ease my mind a bit i'm not sure why i'm so anxious about this particular trip it might be the size of this marathon , , runners , that 's freaking me out maybe it 's the gigantic marathon size combined with the gigantic city size there are a lot of logistics which go into getting to the starting line of such a large event for instance , just to get to the starting line , i have to take the subway , a ferry , and a bus ! i will begin that process at am , even though i do n't start running until am ! it 's a little overwhelming in very overwhelming surroundings ! no wonder i'm anxious ! hopefully , getting myself all set up tomorrow will calm me down i 'll be doing my final speed workout , a gentle by meters , when the sun comes up that will probably settle me a bit , too after that , i just have a few easy miles on thursday before boarding my plane early friday morning as long as the weather clears , i should be ready to go i pray the storm passes safely and quickly
