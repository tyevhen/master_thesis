day august th i found out that i have internet access ! ! the hotel provides it for free , which is great i decided what i 'll do is write a daily journal entry unless i'm too busy having fun ! but wait until home so i can upload photo 's to go with each day before publishing , except for this post , which i 'll post now to let people know what i'm up to i doubt i 'll have time to answer comments or emails before i get back , so please do n't be insulted if i do n't respond until then ! so , we were supposed to leave at at am this morning , but due to our usual taking forever to get out of the house thing , by the time we actually left it was closer to oo ! we had a cool drive as we passed through the mountains in vermont and new hampshire there were really low hanging clouds , so that we were literally driving through them they also partially obscured the mountains , so the whole place looked really surreal and magical way cool we arrived at the hotel at about pm , and as i write this at , i 've already met three people families i know ! i have a good feeling about this conference , and i hope that it 'll be lots of fun ! for now though , no socializing for me i'm tired , so i'm going to just go to bed tomorrow registration opens at , but hopefully i 'll get a chance to hang out with peeps earlier tomorrow , unless of course i decide i really just need to sleep peace , idzie you might also like the northeast unschooling conference ! unschooling gatherings overview of the northeast unschooling conference ! it 's official we 're going to the northeast unschooling conference ! linkwithin
