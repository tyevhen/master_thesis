i admit it i'm watching curling and you know what ? i 've actually curled ! oh ya , you betcha ! i grew up in northern minnesoooota , do n't cha know ! of course i 've curled ! i'm also sitting here eating m m 's , fretting about how heavy i am , and wondering why i'm not losing weight hmmmm i wonder i have m m 's to eat because i bought a pound of them to share with my sponsee today she was scheduled to do some work with me today , but she called and cancelled she not only cancelled , she said she needed to take a break that 's a very bad sign usually , taking a break from working the program is followed closely by taking a drink her taking a break causes me to wonder , again , why it is that some of us get it , and some of us do n't why am i enjoying a sober life ? why me and not so many others ? all i can do is pray for the others , i guess but i do wonder i 've been really tired this week during my workouts today i swam yards before doing the strength circuit twelve hundred yards would have been a cinch before i started this triathlon training , so i thought it would be even easier now after all , i'm finishing my th week of a grueling regimen instead , i had a really tough time in the pool today i had to take or rest breaks ! quite discouraging i hope i'm just having a low energy week thanks to my readers who 've been leaving comments lately your comments really brighten my days ! thank you a full moon is arising outside my window it 's beautiful it was a gorgeous winter day here in minnesota looks like it will be a gorgeous winter night , too enjoy your evening , everyone
