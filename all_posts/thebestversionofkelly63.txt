i want to share with you my make up story and how it has been affected by my fear of judgement this is how i turned my fear of make up into a love of make up make up is such a personal thing and each person has their own relationship with it i love that there are no rules and that it can be fun for many years , all i used make up for was to hide my spots and it wasn t fun at all my fear of judgement was first recognised about months ago , and i ve been working on facing that fear ever since one of the things i regularly spoke about with my therapist was how self conscious i have always been about my appearance because i felt that way i absolutely did not want to be judged on it so i tried to always ensure my appearance didn t alter thereby not drawing attention to it when it came to make up i had a very limited comfort zone i would not leave the house without make up on , not even to the local shop , not even to the post box however , i also wouldn t add to it for a night out from my early twenties until last year , each day i wore tinted moisturiser , concealer , blusher , mascara and maybe a nude lipstick no more , no less i even wore it to swim , i just left off the mascara and lipstick and prayed no one realised i started to wear make up initially at about age after one of my cousins taught me some techniques to apply it i still hated for it to be noticeable so i didn t wear foundation and i wouldn t add blusher as i was sure on my pale skin it stood out from a mile off so , i simply wore concealer , powder and mascara after a few years , i realised the powder was doing me no good and that i looked like a ghost ! so , i changed it to the routine explained above i believe it was two years ago , that the craze went around facebook to post a make up free selfie ? i was nominated but i couldn t bring myself to it vanity didn t stop me , downright fear did eventually my therapist got me to start going out without make up first on the school run then for days at work i needn t have been scared at all no one treated me any differently at all it was a revelation here s a recent make up free picture the next challenge was to wear more make up i went into town one tuesday morning on my own , i needed it to be quiet so i didn t lose my nerve i stood outside debenhams waiting for it to open , my intention was to visit a make up counter i had always avoided that before the heavily made up assistants made me feel so intimidated and i was sure they would judge me as not good enough i d imagine them thinking , why would someone who looks like you bother with nice make up ? i walked back out at first , then after some encouragement from a friend on the phone i went back in and found myself on a seat at the mac counter the lady who helped me was so lovely ! she was patient with me and reassured me , she was also very complimentary and told me i should wear make up more as it really suited me she picked some eyeshadows and taught me how to apply them i bought those , a blusher and a lipstick i was so proud of myself ! i came home and worried i wouldn t remember what she had taught me so i decided to search youtube for a tutorial that was it , i was hooked i loved watching all these girls and women doing their make up from teenagers to women in their forties and beyond they loved make up ! it was a passion , a hobby , an obsession even and you know what , it was fantastic they weren t wearing it for other people , they wore it for themselves whilst i still don t wear what many would consider a full face of make up , i am much more experimental than i used to be best of all i can now do the school run in full make up as happily as i can do it with none and regularly switch between the two make up is finally fun , if not a tad expensive ooops ! suggested posts my journey to healthy eating tackling my anxiety and fear of judgement
