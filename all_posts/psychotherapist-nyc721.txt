what is clinical hypnosis ? clinical hypnosis is a form of therapy which has been known to help clients to develop self confidence as i 've mentioned in prior blog posts , while hypnosis is n't a quick fix or a magic bullet to resolving problems , it 's often more effective than regular talk therapy in helping clients to overcome obstacles when performed by an experienced and skilled hypnotherapist , clinical hypnosis can help clients to access the unconscious mind where people often have untapped resources they are unaware of in regular waking consciousness with regard to developing self confidence , clinical hypnosis allows clients to access other experiences where , initially , they might have doubted their abilities to succeed , but they succeeded nonetheless it can be a very uplifting experience to succeed in an endeavor where , originally , you thought you would n't be able to do it using hypnosis to access these emotions is more than just remembering what it was like to succeed hypnosis can help you on an unconscious level to use the felt sense of that successful experience to develop self confidence in the present hypnosis can help to amplify your former state of self confidence in a particular situation from the past and use it in the here and now why affirmations often are n't enough many people use affirmations to help overcome a lack of self confidence affirmations can be helpful but , for many , they often remain a superficial experience that does n't go very deep the advantage of using hypnosis is that it can help you to access deeper states of consciousness where you can often bypass the negative thinking that creeps in on a conscious level are you giving yourself negative hypnotic suggestions ? you might not even realize , until you experience hypnosis , that you are giving yourself negative hypnotic suggestions as strange as that might sound , most of us have experienced times when we 've engaged in automatic negative thought like , i ca n't do that or i'm not good enough to do that that keep us trapped in a state of low self confidence if this type of thinking is habitual , it can be a powerful way to keep us in that state break the cycle of negative thinking breaking the cycle of automatic negative thinking can be a challenge , but it can be accomplished having access to the felt sense experience of earlier successes from any time in your life and being able to apply it to a current situation can help you to overcome emotional obstacles that keep you stuck in your current situation it does n't matter if it was a feeling of success that you experienced yesterday or when you learned to ride a bike when you were five it does n't have to be related to what you want to accomplish now it can be any experience in your life it 's all stored in your unconscious mind and accessible through clinical hypnosis lack of confidence is often related to earlier trauma for some people , their lack of self confidence is related to earlier trauma if this is the case , a skilled hypnotherapist can help you to overcome the trauma once again , this is n't magic and it 's often not quick , especially if there are multiple traumas for other people , their lack of self confidence is part of their depression hypnotherapy can also be helpful to overcome depression how long does it take to develop self confidence ? there 's no way to tell in advance how many sessions might be needed to overcome a lack of self confidence everyone is different there can be many factors involved , including the client 's level of motivation and willingness to change developing the self confidence to succeed at what you thought you could n't do through clinical hypnosis can be a life changing experience choose a licensed therapist when you 're seeking clinical hypnosis treatment , make sure you choose a licensed psychotherapist who has the clinical skills and expertise to help you there are many hypnotists who have learned hypnotic techniques , but they 're not trained mental health professionals if more complex underlying psychological issues arise , they do n't have the skills to deal with it when in doubt , ask about licensure before you start treatment to find out more about clinical hypnosis , visit asch american society for clinical hypnosis i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist i provide psychotherapy services to individuals and couples , including clinical hypnosis , emdr , somatic experiencing and dynamic talk therapy to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist hypnotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
