welcome to 'my organised life series' over the next four weeks i will be looking at various ways to organise yourself and streamline your life by the time january st rolls around , you will be ready and raring to take on the new year week creating a home workspace as a writer , i have developed a knack for writing anytime , anywhere it can be in a coffee shop a la j k rowling , or on the train during a commute i ve even been known to take a pad and pen into the bath with me ! but , nothing compares to having a desk for my creative pursuits most office workers will have a desk that they call their own , and they can become highly territorial about it it s a place to house your potted plant , family photo , folders , files , a collection of coffee mugs , and somewhere under the mess , a laptop or computer having a desk at home is vital to your wellbeing and sanity this is where you can plan , organise and streamline your life a dedicated workspace allows you to stay prepared , and be on top of the household comings and goings so how can we use our home workspace ? here s how i use mine aside from my writing projects , my desk has a diary week to view with all my appointments and the children s social activities , parent teacher meetings , and various clubs i also have a notice board to keep my current vouchers on tesco clubcard vouchers ready for the next clubcard boost , together with the children s timetables i send all my emails from here and have a small filing cabinet where i can store my bills once paid on my desk , i have a stack of filing trays for bills , receipts and school related letters once i ve finished my writing projects for the day , i clear the desk down so it s ready for the children to do their homework , or for me to sit at and write christmas cards , or sort out my household budget i will go through my bank statements here and then file them away immediately so i don t have copious amounts of paper cluttering the house it helps me to stay on track with running a home , a business and coordinating three teenagers everything has a place and i know that i can put my hand on what i need fairly quickly if i didn t have a workspace at home then i wouldn t have a clue what was going on in my life ! no post about organising workspace would be complete without a quick shout out to my favourite past time de cluttering ! it s great to have a dedicated area to sort bills , send emails or schedule family activities , but clutter breeds and it needs to be sorted out on a regular basis , otherwise your beautifully well thought out desk space will become another stress point it s so important to have something at home that you can use as a control centre , or a home hub it doesn t have to be a huge desk , or take up a lot of room before i was able to use one of the rooms in my house as an office , i had a small desk tucked into the corner of my kitchen it worked well think about where you could base a workspace in your home if you haven t already got one if you have , then what could you do to make it more organised ? pen pots , filing trays , noticeboards are all helpful items to keep the flow of positive , organised energy moving if you wanted to be spiritually organised then why not try arranging your desk to the rules of feng shui ? it involves placement of certain items within particular areas of the desk to bring about positivity in that area of your life for example you would place a family photo in the top right corner of your desk to boost your relationships i would love to hear about your organised workspace , be it at home or in an office do you have any tips you d like to share ?
