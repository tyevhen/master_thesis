i'm still getting back into life after the boston marathon it always takes me a bit of time to get back into a routine after traveling speaking of boston , i'm still recovering from the marathon that fact alone tells me i did n't have enough training under my belt prior to the race i'm still feeling fatigue and soreness in my legs almost one week later , whereas i typically recover within a few days i guess i should n't be surprised missing over weeks of training had to have an impact i am planning on increasing the intensity of my training beginning this week i know i had planned to take time off to let my left achilles tendonitis heal , but i just ca n't do it i 'll keep treating it , but i 've already gotten back on the road i had a nice , quick mile run yesterday like i said , my legs were still a little sore , but running a quick pace , after slogging through boston , felt refreshing besides returning to my running schedule , i plan to increase the intensity of my cross training as well i 'll continue to use swimming and walking on recovery days , but i 've got to get back into the weight training and biking on the other days i have n't been able to consistently weight train since my knee surgery last october i felt that lack of strength training during boston i finally have full range of motion of my right knee now , so returning to my cable training class , for example , should be okay i think i returned to it too early last month , which is why i ended up re injuring my knee i 'll test out my knee in class tomorrow morning by returning to strength training class , i hope to regain another routine my mood remains good i was prepared to fight off the inevitable drop after the excitement of traveling and the marathon , but so far so good i have n't had the typical drop i have n't totally gotten back into my routine , but my mood is stable i'm on guard , waiting , but also feeling more confident every day that i 'll be okay i'm grateful for that now for the next marathon challenge
