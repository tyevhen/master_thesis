the other day , i was grousing in public on twitter about firefox memory consumption on my machine i started posting my memory consumption stats to twitter every few hours , showing firefox using megs , then , then , then gigabytes , etc , over a total period of about eight hours eventually , mozilla 's ben kelly reached out via twitter to offer help kelly suggested i open a new tab and go to a url of about memory by doing this , you can get numerous views into memory usage including some extremely verbose reports turns out this trick works in chrome , as well i sent kelly a memdump and he then asked if there was any reason i was still running firefox on vista i sheepishly told him there was no reason other than sheer laziness and sloth on my part he pointed out that the latest version of firefox incorporates memory related fixes i knew what i had to do visitors to this blog tend to be users of firefox or chrome why so many people still use internet explorer , i do n't know that evening , i upgraded to firefox it was a suitably painless process in that it went quickly , requiring minimal intervention on my part , and resulted in a new version of firefox looking much like the old version , thankfully with all my bookmarks and old settings in place however , the first time i went to a site that relies on flash google finance , in this case , i was presented with grey boxes insisting i upgrade flash i went ahead and did that , and of course i had to restart firefox to make the changes take effect a similar scenario happened with the acrobat plug in upgrade required not a huge deal nevertheless it 's the kind of small inconvenience that , if you multiply by a dozen or more plugins , acquires a chinese water torture aspect after a while it gets to be annoying enough to keep you from upgrading firefox as often as you should while i was visiting someone 's web site , i wanted to know how they were doing a particular html trick , so i typed f to pop the firebug console except , nothing happened crap , i muttered firebug is n't compatible with the new version of firefox i went to the firebug site , figuring if i downloaded the latest version of firebug it would solve everything to my horror , i learned that the latest release of firebug is compatible with firefox but not fortunately , i was able to locate a beta version of the next release of firebug and it works fine with ff so far so , but did the upgrade to firefox solve my memory usage issues ? short answer , no firefox is certainly less memory leaky than firefox , but it went from using megs of ram to gigs in hours , then died and popped into mozilla crash reporter shortly thereafter a certain plug in seems to have brought the world to an end i had half a dozen tabs open twitter , blogger , blogger , gmail , blockbuster , bigthink com i 'll keep you posted as to what i find out about memory leakage in firefox as of now , i consider it to be an ongoing problem maybe not for everybody , but for me , at least note i still consider it important to stay with firefox for most of my browsing needs why ? because of the many privacy oriented plug ins extensions available for it i am troubled by privacy issues around chrome and ie firefox is a clear least evils choice for me for now
