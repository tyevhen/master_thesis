i'm writing about when things go wrong in psychiatric treatment i have to say , we 've gotten a lot of ideas for our book from our blog readers ! we 've heard a lot of stories about both loved and hated shrinks , and you 've made us think about psychiatry in a new way i still think that lots of what we do is good over time , i 've come to have a huge appreciation for the individual differences people have , and for how dismissive it may feel if those differences are n't appreciated i 've also come to appreciate that everyone is not helped by our worked , that sometimes the support and the relationship really help when the symptoms are unrelieved , and that when someone says enough it 's usually best to respect that i almost feel like i'm signing off here but i'm not tell me your stories
