i'm sitting here with a billion other people watching the opening ceremonies to the summer olympics in london so far it 's quite a good show i love that they highlighted their national healthcare system in this worldwide event with the healthcare debate , usually unintelligent , accusatory , and partisan , in this country right now , i thought this highlight was quite admirable and that 's all i have to say about that i had a good week of working and running i 've been working extra hours , usually about four per day , on my typical days off i work on call for several other nursing homes in the area , so i have lots of opportunities to work more than my usual monday , wednesday , friday schedule i'm really tired of living paycheck to paycheck , so i 've been working afternoons on tuesdays and thursdays for a couple of weeks i run in the mornings , try to run one or two errands , and then go to work it 's tiring , but so far i'm handling it okay speaking of running , i had two difficult but successful runs this week i ran my speed workout on the treadmill tuesday it was just too damn hot and humid to run outside i ran x meters followed by x meters i really did n't think i was going to be able to hold the paces i was supposed to run , but i did i felt really great when i was done on thursday , i ran a fast mile tempo run that was very difficult , and i felt very tired when i was done today i'm recovering for my second miler tomorrow morning i'm already up way past my bedtime ! i'm planning to be on the road by am at the latest that being said , i should probably tape the rest of this ceremony and get to bed things are clicking along i'm busy , but i'm holding it together thus far i'm grateful for the ability , energy , and motivation to run , work , and live my life free of the black fog of depression today
