well , the precipitous plunge was fast and severe , but it did n't last long i 've already lightened up in fact , i began feeling more energetic and less hopeless yesterday just like the plunge , i seemed to lighten up overnight weird on monday night i could barely move yesterday i was able to do my speed workout without too much difficulty and today i was able to work , run some errands , and take puck for a walk so it seems things are already getting back to normal i appreciated all of your comments on my previous post it was nice to know some of you could relate i'm still amazed at how fast i fell so low it was strange and it was so scary once i dropped i did n't know how long it would last i did n't know how low i would go this time it was short lived , but next time who knows ? it 's hard not to think of the worst when the worst is so bad you know what i mean ? i'm grateful to be feeling better and more energized already a little blip on the radar that 's all this turned out to be here 's hoping the radar trends upwards from here on out
