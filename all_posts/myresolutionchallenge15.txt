january review i didn t strictly adhere to my must write a new year resolution list at the start of the month , in fact , i adopted an altogether new approach for which involves only a few goals , and a more laid back attitude so far , so good one of the goals i did set for my blog was to publish a monthly review where i could check stats , assess the posts i ve written and the interaction they received , as well as sharing the links in case anyone missed one over previous years i ve been a bit lax with analytics , but i ve come to realise that if i want to provide valuable content , then i need to see what you , my dearest blog reader , enjoys i have also been asked to provide a few guest posts for other blogs this month , and i ve embarked on a couple of advertising boosts to lift the profile of my blog and hopefully get my articles in front of a wider audience , after all , that s the whole point of writing i want to help as many people as i can to embrace their best self , to be confident in their skin , and to believe that they can achieve anything they want how was january ? stats i m delighted with the increase in views overall , the blog received , new visits which is an incredible leap yay ! the most popular post of the month was adopt a skinny thinking routine to help with your weight loss published posts week how to ensure you have a great year using a happiness jar week releasing negative emotions week how to avoid self sabotage week adopt a skinny thinking routine to help your weight loss guest posts rosie amber s blog week how to review the last months rosie amber s blog week power words for rosie amber s blog week setting goals for rosie amber s blog week planning for a perfect year socially shared business network change your beliefs and change your life goals for february february is the month of love ! those of you who know me well will understand when i reach for the sick bucket i don t do romance actually , that s not strictly true i ve never met anyone who does romance and i therefore only know about flowers , chocolates , and romantic weekend trips because i m a sucker for a rom com film sshh , don t tell anyone as i can t produce love infused blog posts from a personal perspective unless we count my horrific experiences on a dating site ! , i thought i d concentrate on self love i know a great deal about this topic as it s one of my main goals for learning to appreciate myself , flaws and all , and turning the negative inner dialogue into positive self talk february s theme will cover this in more detail , and i hope you enjoy reading my posts on this subject over to you your mission if you choose to accept it is i thought it might be a fun twist if at the end of every monthly review i set you some fun exercises i want you to think about the following questions , grab your journal and note down any thoughts or feelings that bubble to the surface or feel free to add your thoughts in the comments below q where do you see yourself in years ? what small steps can you take between now and december st to achieve it ? q what does a day in the life of your dreams look like ? write your perfect day from the minute you wake up to when you go to bed where are you , who are you with , what would you do ? q if money was not an issue what career would you have or what lifestyle would you adopt ? i ll add another three questions to the february review you don t need to share your answers they re for your personal development if you can keep all your notes together in one journal then by the end of the year , you ll have a great overview of to work with when you want to do a review , set goals , or release anything that isn t serving your greater purpose until next month thanks for visiting my blog , i hope you enjoyed this post want more ? connect with me here twitter shelleywilson , instagram or check out my facebook pages http www facebook com fantasyauthorslwilson and http www facebook com motivatemeblog you can also find me on pinterest
