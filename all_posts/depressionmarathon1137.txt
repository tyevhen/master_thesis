decided to try running today it 's been days since the last time out with the marathon coming up on sunday , i need to make a decision about running it i tentatively set tomorrow as decision day if tonight was any indication , the decision likely has been made while i had a bit less pain than last week , i still had pain with every single step of my mile run it was impossible to get comfortable it was impossible not to focus on it in a marathon , pain is not something i can afford to focus on from the first step , especially since my ultimate goal is to qualify for boston i hate the thought of having done all of this training for nothing i hate the thought of having to maintain my current level of fitness , somehow , if i choose to wait for a december race date but , if tomorrow does n't feel any better , i think the decision has been made , and it will be back to the pool for me what a bummer
