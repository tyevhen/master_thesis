hey , honey , you 'll never guess who came into the office today ! these are words a psychiatrist never says the work we do is dressed in secrecy , mandated by a need to preserve patient confidentiality started by hippocrates , finished by hipaa , and filled in in the middle by a need to be certain that the shameful or not drippings of one 's fantasies and the guilty or not remnants of one 's misbehaviors have a safe outlet which wo n't come back to bite but , at the end of the day , what about the psychiatrist ? how many blanks can we leave in our stories ? for surely we 're human , too , with some need to talk about our lives , and our days are filled with stories often fascinating stories we ca n't repeat really , we ca n't even write blog posts without confabulating our patients beyond recognition it 's a border we ca n't even get close to what if we 're upset by an interaction , want a suggestion on how to handle a difficult situation , want counsel as to what to do next with a complex medication issue ? or what if we just want to be heard ? of course , we can seek formal consulation or supervision , but what about the day to day stuff ? years ago we wo n't go into how many enough , i worked in a clinic with another fresh out of residency psychiatrist who also had a new baby just in case it 's not enough to be a new shrinks starting together at the same institution , parenting issues were an instant form of bonding and this psychiatrist 's baby was and remains a constant source of enchanting stories eventually , we both left the clinic , and she relocated to another area code our friendship , however , remained fixed , and through an assortment of associations my friend has somehow acquired the nickname camel so that we 're clear , this is not a reflection of her physique camel is often my go to person when a child generally my own says or does something that taxes the limits of my self control , i call camel she 's on speed dial and she often can provide empathizing stories when something good or bad happens in my life , i call camel when i need a support psychiatrist to fly to psychiatric conferences with , i take a camel she 's better than a duck and almost as good as a goat when i win the lottery , i will call camel when i need a friend to have a drink with well , sometimes , the distant area code thing gets in the way so i have local friends for such emergencies camel is also my first stop for curbside consults she knows a lot about medications and is kind about my ranting clinkshrink , while my first stop for all matters forensic , does n't do psychotherapy , and whenever i ask her about her experience with any medication patented after , she says we do n't have that in jail camel keeps up to date and remains an invaluable resource , friendly ear , and the origin of many entertaining stories i put an asterik here because , really , i have no idea what psychiatrists tell their spouses i never divulge the names or identifying information about any of my patients to either my spouse or my camel unlike the blog , however , i do n't go as far as to confabulate new information to create a hypothetical scenario happy birthday , camel
