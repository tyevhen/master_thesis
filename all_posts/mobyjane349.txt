the last couple of posts i have been talking about my latest experience in changing my mood from a downer to a real up mood i wondered if it might be helpful to include this snippet from my book depression is a choice , which i am now trying to reformat for kindle but not quite through yet it occurred to me that , unless you have at least the intellectual idea that you are separate from your feelings and not a prisoner of them , as people believe who believe that depression is a brain disease , changing your mood as an act of will might seem preposterous i ran across this early experience of my thinking where i was just starting to get the idea that i could actually separate myself from my feelings in the past i always was happy or was depressed i didn t separate out myself from my feelings and look at them as simply a part of me they so enveloped me that i thought i was my feelings certainly i didn t think i could change my feelings as an act of will here s an example of my first work on separating myself from my depression at first i thought of the difference between depression and feeling good in terms of being conscious or unconscious , because freud s model of the mind was what i was trained in the minute i realized i was depressed , i would remind myself that i had gone unconscious , and that any conscious activity on my part would get me out of it i remember having an insight once that went something like this , oh , i get it now depression , being a defense mechanism , means it is unconscious , and any conscious thinking or behavior takes precedence over any unconscious thinking i refined these concepts later but perhaps seeing depression as going unconscious was a necessary step ultimately i saw that i had to differentiate myself from my enmeshment with my whole mind , not simply from my depression i began to understand that if i was depressed i was never in present reality i would test this out when i got depressed i would ask myself questions about exactly what was wrong right now my fears were always either regret or anguish about the past , about what i had lost or anxiety about the future , and what i was not going to have any time i started to question myself seriously about my situation i could always see that in this exact instant i was really not so bad one of the mind tricks i created to help me to a more objective view of my moods was that when i was depressed i would visualize saving some of it in my hand to take into the next high , to remember how i was when i was down this was not terribly difficult and when i was really high i would save some of it in my hand to take into depression to remember how it was when i was high this was much harder since depression by its very nature is hopeless , it necessarily seems endless thus , it is hard to remember being high in the midst of a down , with the implication that another high will also come but i insisted on doing the exercise and slowly , little by little , i got to the point where i could hold onto the idea of both extremes as being temporary moods switching from the idea of one mood to the reality of the other , back and forth , back and forth , regardless of which mood i was stuck in , i learned to feel my strongest feelings without losing my sense of objective reality that i was not my feelings , i was simply having them i learned to raise my awareness and observe myself carefully when i was deep in depression , but not to the point of experiencing myself , until one day my depression was separated out , and i was alone , looking at it
