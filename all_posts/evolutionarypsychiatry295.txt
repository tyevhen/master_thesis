in yesterday 's post , i discussed some of the evidence that parkinson 's disease is possibly caused by defects in the energy efficiency of the mitochondria of susceptible and poisoned individuals i do n't mean to do a whole parkinson 's series or anything , but the post did bring up some interesting questions we already know that a ketogenic metabolism seems to increase energy efficiency in the brain but what else might do the same ? well , researchers are already looking into some trials of a few compounds of interest coenzyme q also known as ubiquinone and creatine there are a few published animal studies , a few small clinical trials of coq , and human trials are ongoing for both coq and creatine coq is an interesting vitamin molecule yesterday i compared mitochondria our cells' energy factories to a ski resort there are proton pumping complexes in the mitochondria that pump against a gradient , rather like the ski lift carrying skiers up the hill eventually the energy is used to transport electrons across membranes in the electron transport chain and atp is created skiers set free to fly down the hill to beat the analogy to death , coq is a bit like the attendants at the top of the ski lift , making sure everyone gets off the lift okay , and guiding skiers between lifts while small doses of coq did n't seem to help symptoms of parkinson 's large doses mg seemed mildly helpful , and even larger doses are being tried now creatine is a compound made from amino acids , and basically helps the body make atp more easily according to the wikipedia article , we make a lot of creatine from dietary amino acids , but about half of our creatine is taken directly from eating skeletal muscle , and the muscles of vegetarians are lower in creatine in animal studies , supplementation with creatine combined with coq was helpful for parkinson 's symptoms anyone who reads statin skeptic literature knows that statins lower coq levels a pubmed search reveals a lot of papers on the subject questions arise as to whether statins cause heart failure due to coq depletion the heart , like the brain , is energy hungry , and coq depletion over time might damage the heart the study i linked showed lower coq in statin users and worse heart failure in people with low coq , but no link between statin use and worsening of heart failure there are also questions if the coq depletion causes als lou gerhig 's disease and whether the coq depletion causes the known rare statin side effect , diabetes so the obvious question is would statins cause parkinsons ? this small study found that there did n't seem to be a link between parkinson 's progression and statin use , and this brief editorial notes that in population studies , higher ldl cholesterol levels are associated with lower risk of parkinson 's disease , but in the rotterdam study , statin use seemed to have no correlation with parkinson 's disease risk , and other small studies showed the use of cholesterol lowering drugs was associated with a decreased risk of parkinson 's turns out that serum cholesterol levels and triglycerides are the strongest determinant of serum coq levels the reason being that coq rides along with the lipoprotein complexes in the body moderate alcohol use also seems to be associated with coq increases and the best dietary sources of coq ? meat , eggs , and certain vegetables such as broccoli dietary intake was n't correlated that much with serum levels , though that could be because serum levels had more to do with how much cholesterol was floating around what can i make of this confusing mess ? coq is a powerful antioxidant , one of whose jobs is likely to protect cholesterol and triglycerides as they are transported through the scary circulatory system people with lots of inflammation will have high triglycerides , high cholesterol , and high coq the high coq is probably protective against parkinson 's disease and perhaps a robust amount of cholesterol is too statins are also antioxidant and antiinflammatory , so it is possible that those attributes make up for obliterating the cholesterol making machinery and depleting the body 's coq , at least in the case of parkinson 's disease the jury , though , is still out
