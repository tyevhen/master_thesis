i could be i guess , i find it very hard to know sometimes and impossible to distinguish a natural high from a hypo manic episode i was buzzing after going salsa dancing on sunday night , i was so nervous before i went in i said the lord 's prayer to myself over and over again i am not even religious but it keeps the negative thoughts away and it is a comforting feeling that someone is looking over you i guess i was a little high afterwards i think i was just pleased with myself for going salsa dancing i had a lot of energy sunday night , the guy i was dancing with wanted to sit every other dance out ! i could have been a little high ? i do n't think i was too high or caused myself any problems i did loose my routine a bit yesterday and stayed up far too late i will make sure i get to bed on time today and eat properly as for blogging a lot i think i was bored more than anything else o raine thank you very much for your concern , i will make sure i stick to a routine this week and take plenty of time out to slow down and relax !
