this is one reason to live , my grandson , jacob alexander chaffin wall the kid is a corker , a live wire , a handful , very self determined and adventurous , a real boy 's boy god i love to see him up here in the wilderness where there 's nothing to worry about as for his name , a lower birth rate may be influencing some parents to add more names ya think ? as for my children 's generation , i like the new label the entitlement generation perfect , yes ? inflated self esteem expecting easy rewards , ignorant of how the world works eeek i 've met a few like that i think they 're entitled to a smack up the side of head , and life , no doubt , will oblige here 's the next in the sine wave sequence , mercifully short , but one can see the increasing grandiosity of the speaker , along with his bizarre experiment , though he has n't lost his sense of humor in mania every result is interesting and there is no such thing as failure in mania and hypomania one does n't make lemonade out of lemons one makes year old johnnie walker bread upon the waters i cornered divine immanence with a shotgun but it slipped away , almost present its silence fooled me because it wasn t silence but the frozen stutter of a blank expectancy guarding some deeper sentience so i designed an experiment to see if the world might grow conscious of its unconsciousness i tore up a bible and fed its leaves to the wind they scattered without purpose i tracked them for months until just one sheet was missing when i found it i laughed all genealogies ! my mood continues at kilobunny , a term i have thought of changing to kiloraven because of my fondness for the bird , but it would n't wash because black birds are n't associated with happiness now for a prose poem , an entity towards whose existence i am utterly opposed drung me , i'm flaxed the kiddishcat rumpled with great noisomeness the custard of my belly preserve the face through masks i'm not free associating , this is just one channel of my mind , hardly freeborn with an alaskan stake there are many parallel and contiguous other channels , such as how my testes feel at this moment a little cramped or how 's ratdog on the grateful dead hour ? doublescoot , doublescoot to work o thrall with that leash dangling from your collar , phallic control by insidious institutions swallow your penis sorry , down the snatch kiss your own ass one for the money two for the show a really big shew ! should i have said it in just that way ? way down in the bottom of my throat where the carbon whales sleep beside the plastic bon bons equipped with nuclear powered spy cameras ? cameramen never take my picture , i am not picturesque also too tall too tall too tall for the frame photographers and journalists are pond 's pond scum , verily in their majority , self rigtheous gin journalists chewing cheap swishers , in debt but loving it like peppermint loves christmas , like catholics like blood , like steel craves an edge i am not james joyce nor was meant to be did you find today 's post mildly entertaining ? i hope so and having hope again is one of the greatest boons in coming out of depression , which is easily defined by a sense of hopelessness , helplessness , and worthlessness thine at one kilobunny , ce
