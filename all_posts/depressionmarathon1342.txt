on becoming a non runner what an awful , disheartening title for the first time in my competitive running life over the last couple weeks for the first time i have allowed contemplation of that title up there on becoming a non runner it is more than the fatigue it is more than the frustrating weight gain it is more than the right hip that just wo n't get quite right it is more than the lack of motivation it is more than the depression it could be all of those things but it is n't it is something else something 's wrong i 've never been able to even contemplate this before it was n't allowed there was always hope there 's been fatigue , and weight , and sore hips , and low motivation before constantly , there 's been depression i actually became most competitive in the midst of depression running has saved me from depression running has saved my life from me running has saved my character , my soul , my personality running has occasionally been me identity running has forced relationships running has moved an immovable me running has cemented the only meaningful connection i can always count on , no matter the desperation , ugliness , and pain circulating in my soul if not for his four feet , perfectly trained heart , and reliance on me to survive , there would likely be no me no reason to walk , or run , or unfortunately at times to live the line got that thin it 's only because of him and now the guilt of not taking him far out weighs my frustration with not taking me for a run but even that enormous guilt is no longer enough to push me beyond now , running hurts my heart does n't like it my body just wo n't go my brain ca n't push past it there used to be satisfaction once i pushed myself out the door on a difficult day now only indifference awaits there used to be exhileration after a tough workout or painful race now only spiritual exhaustion awaits the ease , joy , fluidity and freedom slowly , but completely , faded away adapting to my new limits seemed reasonable until no adjustment seemed to take fewer miles fewer days less time less speed it all ended the same spiritual exhaustion spiritual ache i love running i love being a runner i do not want it to become punishment a daily reminder of another thing lost to this fucking illness , or age , or life but lost just the same if i let it go now , maybe it will come back ? or is that just setting me up for future frustration , and loss , and ache and how do i let go anyway ? what does that look like ? i do not want to close this door i want to be a runner perhaps this is just one step in a journey of letting go of becoming a non runner i do n't know i do n't know
