regarding the feel good flash essays written on the side of starbucks cups normally , they are just nothing statements , advancing the niche brand of warm fuzzies capitalism but today , mine was so earnest , so naively paradoxical that i couldn t help but call attention to it reading the cup , i felt like alice marveling at another wonderland absurdity and looking for somebody else to agree that it s crazy but she only has the cheshire cat , who does nothing to confirm her sanity ok , here it is the way i see it my cousin in tibet is an illiterate subsistence farmer by accident of birth , i was raised in the west and have a ph d the task of our generation is to cut through the illusion that we inhabit separate worlds only then will we find the heart to rise to the daunting but urgent challenges of global disparity losang rabgey , ph d national geographic emerging explorer and co founder of machik , a nonprofit helping communities on the tibetan plateau it would be monstrous to disagree with the sentiment behind the statement on the cup how can anybody not want children to hold hands in a circle around the world ? but does it not seem completely ridiculous , absurd , insane to be trying to end global disparity on the side of a cup of venti caffee mocha with skim milk and whip cream ? do the suits at starbucks not realize that if we replaced global disparity with global equality , nobody would be able to afford luxury coffee ? don t believe me ? it s already happening , check out this ny times article about the rising price of grain or maybe they do realize that , but are banking on the assurance that nobody else will american rates of consumption are already ecologically unsustainable , and it would be disastrous if they were multiplied by the rest of the human population so any economic increase in poor countries will eventually mean a decrease in american wealth and as we ve already seen , the first thing to go is frivolous spending it s pretty funny to think of starbucks writing its own demise on the side of its cups in such a cute font again , i m not writing this blog to make a political statement but we rich westerners should think about whether we really would sacrifice our expensive coffee among other luxuries so that the rest of the world can have an improved standard of living i d like to think i m that good of a person , but i don t know if i am on the contrary , i m the jerk who actively fears that somebody in my family will need me to give them an organ cause i really really do not want to go through my life with only one kidney nor would i want to sentence a family member to a lifetime of dialysis another thing , this essay works on the assumption that somehow it is better to be a western doctor than a tibetan sustenance farmer and , since you re reading my blog , you should be painfully aware by now how fatally wrong that assumption could be ps for what it s worth , the bottom of the cup comes with this disclaimer this is the author s opinion , not necessarily that of starbucks
