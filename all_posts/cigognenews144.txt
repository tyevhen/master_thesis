neurosis is inherited people exude who they are from every pore of their being i mean that literally an uptight , tense mother radiates her repression an angry father radiates his rage they do n't have to do anything just be but it is worse than that when their underlying feelings show themselves , we instinctively sense we should avoid them or be very careful around them they distort our words , detour our natural movements and disapprove of almost everything we do , not by words but by those looks and worse , when they show no emotion , we know that feelings are what we keep to ourselves the point is that even before we have words a child is undergoing a lifetime of experience and the earlier that experience , the more impactful it should be obvious those early experiences that directly affect breathing , digestion and elimination are going to do a lot of damage and will last a lifetime our genes form the matrix of later life that much we agree on but our epigenes , transformed by severe experiences , build a new genetic base that changes or distorts the evolution of our genetic code those new altered traits then become inherited as i ve noted , we too often confuse this with our genetic heritage , which is largely impervious to later events the person becomes a meld of genes and epigenes , of genetics shaped by experience instead of saying , she looks and acts just like her mother , we need to say , her mother was infected with neurosis , which got imprinted into the system of the offspring , and now she is just as hyperactive and add as her distracted and hyperactive mother in other words , the infant who is being carried has caught what could be a fatal disease neurosis , the same one lying inside the mother the baby will reflect the internal life of the mother and that is what will be imprinted inside him and last a lifetime why ? because this is what had been learned in order to adapt and adjust no words , no reprimands , no social neglect , just who she is , does it all researchers at the university of california , san francisco , looked at what they call emotional synchrony , the non verbal communication between mother and child waters , west mendes , in a phenomenon they dub stress contagion , the baby is learning how to manage the incoming stress of the mother they did studies of several different mothers who gave a talk with a different audience one approving , one neutral and one not approving guess what ? the month old babies reflected what happened there were differences in heart rate and a greater stress response in those children of mothers who had disapproval the children learned through some kind of osmosis they were inculcated by the mother s emotional state as lead researcher sara waters stated in an article on the website of the association for psychological science , which published the research your infant may not be able to tell you that you seem stressed or ask you what is wrong , but our work shows that , as soon as she is in your arms , she is picking up on the bodily responses accompanying your emotional state and immediately begins to feel in her own body your own negative emotion now imagine that the baby and mother are one , where the baby lives inside the mother the influences are far more impactful so what gets transmitted ? odor , facial expression , lack of feeling , body movements and on and on all of the parent is transmitted to the child even food preferences can be imprinted in the womb and passed on through generations if you love sweets and cannot resist , it could be due to womb life in other words , the mother s compulsion becomes your destiny this can explain a good percentage of obesity in children bad eating habits begin in the womb , as do so many other compulsions for the most part , people only see the visible manifestation of these hidden forces so they ask , for example , why does this person eat so much ? we know that it is not current culture that is the sole cause it could also be because the mother was indulgent and ate compulsively while in the womb the baby is learning about his world and what to expect from it hence lots of food is to be expected from a mother who indulges more evidence is piling up to show how this early start can predict the early onset of disease and a shortened lifespan the fetus is not only aware of certain tastes and smells in the mother while she is carrying , but those memories can last a lifetime , and can affect so much of our interests later on mothers ingesting carrot juice during pregnancy , for example , had children who preferred it researchers at emory university in atlanta , georgia , found that even the memory of a specific smell can be inherited dias ressler , the scientists trained male mice to associate the smell of cherry blossom with an electric shock , making them fearful of it they then impregnated females with the sperm of these mice and found that the pups were also fearful of the cherry blossom aroma even the grand pups inherited the fear of that specific smell how did this olfactory trait get passed down through generations ? researchers attribute it to epigenetics , noting that dna from the grandfather mice and their pups revealed epigenetic marks on the gene encoding the receptor for that specific smell , known as m in other words , this inheritance came through experience , not just genes like their traumatized grandfathers , the grand pups were more sensitive to the aroma of cherry blossom because their receptors were also acutely attuned to it , more than control mice the research provides some of the best evidence yet that memories or developed traits can be inherited , according to a report on the experiment published in new scientist knowing how the experiences of parents influence their descendants helps us to understand psychiatric disorders that may have a trans generational basis , and possibly to design therapeutic strategies , says senior author kerry ressler , md , phd , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at emory school of medicine in , ressler , who is also an investigator at emory s yerkes national primate research center , delivered a stockholm psychiatry lecture on the biology of fear at the karolinska institutet in stockholm entitled neural circuits mediating fear , risk and resilience from pavlov to ptsd , the hour lecture can be viewed online so are we born fearful ? could be we can be jumpy , nervous and erratic , all due to epigenetics it seems so early as to be genetic , but it is more likely to be epigenetic , the condition of the mother and father while carrying so you say to yourself , did i inherit my mother s craziness ? the answer could be , yes but not in the usual sense of inheritance rather , who she was while carrying hyperactive or depressed and down left you with a neurotic inheritance that still shaped your life this should teach us something about memory for memories while being carried can last decades and drive and or channel behavior we do not simply grow out of it for infants , stress may be caught , not taught , february association for psychological science retrieved from http www psychologicalscience org index php news releases for infants stress may be caught not taught html see the work of keith godfrey , professor of epidemiology and human development , and others at the university of southampton in england http www southampton ac uk medicine research groups human development and physiology research group page geddes , l fear of a smell can be passed down several generations new scientist , , doi s mice can inherit learned sensitivity to a smell , december retrieved from http news emory edu stories smell epigenetics ressler campus html https www youtube com watch ?
