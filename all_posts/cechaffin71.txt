most of us have seen a sparrow or some other diminutive bird fly into the house and break its neck against a window a common occurrence , one might say but the other day i witnessed something extraordinary there is a flock of wild turkeys near our home and i often let my dog chase them they rise in flight in their ungainly way , and though they outweigh him they suffer from inter species fright and flutter away anyway , when j alfred my dog , see picture took off after them all rose and flew sw except for one old tom who rose and flew ne towards the cottages i heard a resounding crash and thought no , it could n't be then i walked to my neighbor 's and there was a large window broken and the turkey , splayed on the ground , its neck bent , reflexively flapping and moving its feet in a death spasm like a pithed frog animated by electric current i took two nearby feathers for a souvenir of the kamikaze he was n't suicidal , just confused but a fifty pound bird crashing into your window ? too bad hitchcock did n't think of it one turkey would have smashed the phone booth in which tippie hedren took refuge i have tried to publicize this menace through my liberal friends , those who legislate helmets and seat belts and food additives , the mommy brigade , but none thought my crusade as valid as the end of million lawn dart sets after one boy was killed who will protect us from flying turkeys ? certainly there should be government regulations against the danger call your state representative today ! here 's a recent poem about turkeys turkey heaven three wild turkeys foraged above the leach field , pulling their great teardrop bodies behind like u haul trailers as if their red pistoning heads propelled them forward , chest feathers dangling in long pendants in shadow , grave , funereal they stepped lightly forward as if avoiding pebbles like puritans in a queue treading carefully over sins to meet a god unappeased by burnt offerings i thought of mather and edwards in long frock coats filing forward to the altar , heads heavy with theology , pulling congregants behind , dark bodies hauled to heaven but when the birds broke into sunlight they were transformed by brass and crimson highlights etched in metallic green , equal to any peacock raising his paisley fan if metaphors could fly , they flew at my dog s frenzied approach , oversized wings pumping , boulder bodies rising , gravity upended in a miraculous roosting all for today at one kilobunny , ce
