making the decision to start couples counseling is a big commitment it requires time , effort and money to participate in couples counseling , and most couples want to get the most out of treatment for the commitment that they make many couples , who could benefit from couples counseling , never start because one or both of them have concerns or misconceptions about the process or they do n't know how to choose a couples counselor as a couples counselor , i usually address these concerns early on either when i receive a call from someone who is considering couples counseling or during the first session if you and your partner are having ongoing problems that you 've been unable to resolve on your own , you could benefit from couples counseling before you begin , there are some important factors that you should know and consider choosing a couples counselor when you call a couples counselor , you should describe your problem briefly and ask if he or she has dealt with this type of problem before if the couples counselor has not dealt with this type of problem , it does n't necessarily mean that he or she ca n't help you you might have a very successful treatment with that counselor , but chances are better with a licensed mental health professional who has helped clients with this issue before also , ask about general experience and credentials you want to go to someone who has mental health license also , it 's important that both of you feel comfortable with the couples counselor so that you to get the most out of treatment starting couples counseling one or both of you fears that the couples counselor will be on the other person 's side most skilled couples counselors are even handed in treatment and do n't take any one person 's side their job is to facilitate communication between you and your partner and to help each of you develop skills to improve your relationship of course , that does n't mean that the couples counselor wo n't call you or your partner on any particular behavior that is destructive to the relationship if that happens , that 's not about taking sides that 's about stopping destructive behavior couples counseling is for two people , not three if one of you is having an affair , most couples counselors will not work with you most couples counselors will require that whoever is having the affair must get out of it completely in order for you and your partner to begin couples counseling couples counseling does n't work when one partner is seeing someone else on the side if one of you ca n't make that commitment , then you should each consider individual psychotherapy instead alcohol or drug abuse must stop before starting couples counseling if one or both of you is abusing substances , you need to take care of that problem first if you or your partner is drinking excessively or abusing drugs , getting clean and sober first must be the priority starting couples counseling when there is a substance abuse problem involved will only make the person with a drug or alcohol problem want to use more when difficult issues come up in sessions also , you ca n't be fully present in couples counseling if you 're abusing substances , so it 's a waste of time , money and effort most couples counselors want clients to have at least a solid six months of clean and sober time , preferably with active participation in a drug and alcohol program and or in one of the step programs like a a or n a before they begin couples counseling domestic violence must stop before starting couples counseling if there is physical abuse in your relationship , you must consider your safety first if you 're in a dangerous situation , seek the help of family , friends , or programs like safe horizons to ensure your safety if you 're the one who becomes violent , either get individual treatment or go to a batterers' program to learn how to control your temper starting couples counseling when there is domestic violence is a recipe for trouble even though the violent partner might appear calm in session , afterwards , a difficult session might bring on violence when you get home both of you must be committed to couples counseling often , when a couple comes for couples counseling , one partner is more committed to the process than the other while it 's not unusual to enter into couples counseling with some mixed feelings , once you begin , it 's important that both people make the commitment to attend regularly , participate in the sessions , and follow through with any homework that the couples counselor might give you it 's not unusual for one person to know that , as far as he or she is concerned , the relationship is over , but he or she does n't want to appear to be uncooperative so the couple enters into a pseudo couples counseling where one person is committed and the other is just going along with it and is not being honest about his or her real feelings in those instances , often what happens is that the partner who is hiding that he or she already knows that it 's over finds excuses not to come to treatment or only engages in treatment in a half hearted way this undermines the treatment if you know that you want to end the relationship , it 's better to be honest about it from the beginning you and your partner have a better chance of ending the relationship in an amicable way in couples counseling than if you tried to do it on your own couples counseling is not about fixing the other person often , couples come into treatment where one or both of them is hoping that the couples counselor will fix the other partner it 's as if one partner is bringing in the other partner and saying , see ? he 's a mess ! what can you do to change him ? but couples counselors look at the dynamic between the two people rather than trying to change one person each person might have certain behavior patterns that need to change , but couples counseling is not a one sided process each of you needs to be willing to look at your own personal dynamic in the relationship and how if affects the relationship rather than focusing solely on the other person 's faults do n't wait until it 's too late to start couples counseling many couples come to couples counseling as a last ditch effort when the relationship is really over in some cases , they already have divorce
