hi friends ! the past several months have been so heart warming and wonderful alternately , there have been many challenging moments filled with frustration and exhaustion being a stay at home mother to a three year old and an infant can be a physical and emotional tornado as most people can understand being home all day , without the trappings of water cooler chat at the office or lunch breaks with fun co workers can be very isolating and lonely your sense of autonomy is easily vanquished and you start to forget the last time you had a funny conversation with a friend or came up with your own witty tidbits to make a peer laugh it 's easy to get tired and fall into a bit of a slump but , in times like this , i take heart knowing that i am living up to my potential as best i can in this role i 've been blessed with sometimes things are n't always how i want them or would like them to be but i know i am fulfilling my duties in this season of my life with as much humor , wit , and graciousness as i can i am grateful i am honored when days are long and i'm feeling sloppy and it 's day or wearing some version of sweatpants and a formula dribbled t shirt i like to remind myself about staying positive and grateful a trick i use ? i tell myself i get to for example , instead of saying i have to get up and feed the baby , i say i get to get up and feed the baby it works on many levels and conditions and always forces me to turn things around by adding more spring to my step i have to go to the grocery store i get to go to the grocery store i have to clean the kitchen i get to clean the kitchen i have to change the diaper i get to change the diaper i have to go to work i get to go to work for those that do i have to make lunch for the kids i get to make lunch for the kids it 's a simple little trick that does n't seem like much , but makes a big impact when it 's practiced i'm no expert at it yet , but i'm trying and i believe it will become second nature before long see how it can change your day see if it does n't give you just a little lift too here 's a tender moment of paige shampooing her brother 's hair one of life 's rewarding moments to witness save you might also like time to enjoy style of living acceptance motherhood is n't predictable linkwithin
