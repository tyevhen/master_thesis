first podcast is up it 's getting great reviews second the rest of chapter is up at double billing and now for our regularly scheduled post i do n't know michelle slatalla i 've never met her , never talked to her , have n't poked her i imagine she wears her pants too high , but i do n't know if she drives a cool car , if she sends text messages to her friends , what shows she watches or wines she drinks what i do know is that she does a good job of talking about my life maybe she reads shrink rap ? in thursday 's new york times , in cyberfamilias omg my mom joined facebook ! ms slatalla writes i have reached a curious point in life although i feel like the same precocious know it all cynic i always was , i suddenly am surrounded by younger precocious know it all cynics whose main purpose appears to be to remind me that i ve lost my edge many of these people are teenagers some of them i gave birth to wait , did i write that ? i do n't remember writing that does this person own the same children i that i do ? my newest comrade in parenting teenagers then goes on to recount how she joined facebook and repeatedly poked ? harassed her daughter and her daughter 's friends , asking them to be her friends her daughter 's friends allowed her in she now knows who is going where and with whom her daughter resisted , but ms slatalla , bless her heart , poked the child into at least partial submission , and the daughter finally befriended her , but with only limited access to her profile help me if i get the terms wrong here , i'm decades too old for this world okay , so i have a facebook page and i poked one of my kids he said no he came downstairs in real life and told me not to poke his friends i would never poke my kid 's friends , even i'm not that dumb sorry , michelle i 've left it , i poked only once i 'd previously been blocked from his instant messenger and i 've decided to leave it that i'm happy he does n't call screen me out , but that may be because i pay for his phone it seems i can e mail too so michelle slatella set up her facebook profile last week , according to her article i set mine up months ago this is the photo i 've put on my profile so six months and i have one friend my niece let me in i barely know her , she 's a college student , and her profile requests that you post memories you have of times you 've had together with her i started to write on her wall , describing how beautiful she was as a baby , how i loved dancing with her in my arms when she was months old she really was a total doll then i decided that no college student wants their aunt on their facebook wall dancing with them in infancy , so i sent it to her privately i have n't heard from her since and i 've had to content myself with looking at her photos and reading the birthday greetings on her wall i had another friend for a while rich poked me i accepted i 've always liked rich and i checked off that i knew him because we hooked up i 've never hooked up with anyone , i was married before hooking up was invented but patients talk about hooking up all the time and here was my cyber opportunity to pretend i was cool now i'm also friends with rich 's wife , and maybe this explains why he 's no longer listed as my friend ? apparently , i 've been unfriended wow patients talk about facebook and the truth is , they 're all under no one my age talks about facebook then again , no one i 've seen over talks about their blogs either it 's a whole other world , with all its own lines of significance and innuendos who pokes who , who does n't poke who , who lets you in , and who unfriends you i grew up in a world where people slighted you by not returning phone calls and and not saying hi in the hallway okay , enough , i'm going now to poke michelle slatalla i think she 's my age i wonder if she has a blog and a podcast if she wants to be my friend , i 'll write on her wall
