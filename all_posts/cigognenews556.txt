the title seems like an oxymoron but what i mean is that each of us marries our need we marry what we feel we need let me put this way because of a lack of love early in our lives we are left with unfulfilled need that need bubbles us later in life and becomes an idea of what we need it often isn t even an idea it is just an automatic behavior that directs toward fulfillment of an old need a man may idealize almost every woman he meets , and then as time goes on he begins to see who she really is then divorce , as is so often the case she is at first wonderful then someone with faults , and then someone who is terrible all because he never saw reality , in the first place this is the paradigm for so many divorces and breakups we need fulfillment so badly that we see it everywhere and later in life we see it nowhere and it is that screen or filter that we put up automatically when we meet someone new we don t see them we see ourselves we see what we need we don t exactly see who we need , mother , because if we did we would be rolling around the floor in pain begging for love , which is what my patients do then they are bereft of their illusions and can finally marry someone who suits them , who is who she is and not some fantasy creation we finally see reality and that is such a relief and avoids so much strife later on all those bitter recriminations because the person wasn t who we thought she was she had faults and they became more and more evident as the relationship went on the woman marries a strong , aggressive man so she can feel protected like she could not with her weak , passive father who let her mother beat up on her but , alas , he is demanding and driving and sometimes brutal because that is who he really is and then he could not protect her from himself and his rages and his drinking she knew he drank a bit but did not really see it because he was her protector or the woman who married a weak man who would not be a threat as her angry father was then reality sets in he wants her to work and earn the living he is so passive with the children he won t fight for her when there is a problem , and on and on disappointment set in but it shouldn t be there because that was the deal at the outset you be soft and unaggressive so i won t feel threatening and overwhelmed by daddy , and i will be the forward aggressive one fighting for both of us and if we look at the faults of our partner we will see our need we will see our history and what deep feelings we have we will finally see ourselves
