the genome of the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae stands as a remarkable example of dna in an apparent state of massive , wholesale breakdown of the organism 's genes , only appear to be functional , while are pseudogenes , which is to say genes that have been turned off and left for dead genes can become pseudogenes in any number of ways , including loss of a start codon , loss of promoter regions or degraded shine dalgarno signals , random insertions and deletions , mutations that cause spurious stop codons , and so on once a gene gets turned off , assuming loss of the gene in question is n't fatal , the gene typically undergoes a period of degradation leading to its eventual loss from the genome , but that 's not exactly what we see in the leprosy bacterium when leprosy germs from medieval skeletons were sampled and their genomes sequenced , researchers found that pseudogenes in m leprae have n't changed very much in the past thousand years or so not only does m leprae tend to hold onto its pseudogenes , it actively transcribes upwards of of them probably not all of the transcripts result in expressed proteins many lack a start codon ! , but some no doubt do get translated into proteins let 's put it this way it would be extremely unusual for an organism to conserve this many pseudogenes if none of them was doing anything useful this view of a segment of the two genomes shows how a region of around , base pairs in m tuberculosis maps to a similar , base pair region of m leprae notice that in the lowermost panel representing m leprae , many genes are shown as shrunken silver segments instead of fat green cylinders the smaller grey silver segments are pseudogenes click to enlarge to get a better idea of what 's going on here , i downloaded the dna sequences of m leprae 's normal genes as well as the pseudogenes in analyzing the codons for these genes , i looked for signs of genes that were still in the normal reading frame one way to detect this is by measuring the purine content at the various base positions in a gene 's codons in a typical protein coding gene , around of codons begin with a or g adenine or guanine this positional bias will , of course , be lost in a gene that has undergone frameshift mutations among m leprae 's pseudogenes , i found in which codons showed an average ag percentage a g content , codon base one of or more these are pseudogenes that appear to still be mostly in frame things get a lot more interesting where putative membrane proteins are concerned in a previous post , i showed that in some genes , the second codon base is pyrimidine rich i e , predominantly c or t cytosine or thymine these genes encode proteins with a high percentage of nonpolar amino acids bottom line , if a gene 's codons are mostly t or c in the second position , that gene most likely encodes a membrane associated protein see my previous post for some data this is true for all organisms viruses , cells and organellar genes , too , by the way , not just m leprae it 's a generic feature of the genetic code when i segregated m leprae pseudogenes according to whether or not the second codon base was on average less than , or more than , purines , i stumbled onto something quite interesting i found pseudogenes with ag less than meaning , these are probably membrane associated proteins of those , or are still in frame , with ag by contrast , the majority of non membrane pseudogenes ag appear to be turned off , with an average ag of long story short most non membrane associated pseudogenes are out of frame and likely dead , whereas of putative membrane associated pseudogenes appear to be in frame , and therefore could still be functional or at least , undead in looking at stop codons , i found that of the pseudogenes that still had stop codons , the average distance to the first stop codon is only bases whereas the average pseudogene length is bases pseudogenes for putative membrane associated proteins were shorter overall as membrane proteins often are bases instead of , but the average distance to the first stop codon was bases , significantly longer than for the other pseudogenes this suggests some of them are still alive by now you 're probably wondering how the heck a pseudogene can be of any possible use whatsoever when it contains a premature stop codon the thing we need to ask , though , is why m leprae tolerates indeed conserves so many pseudogenes in the first place could it be that the organism has adapted a frameshift tolerant translation apparatus ? maybe some of the stop codons are n't really stop codons we know that a wide variety of organisms not just viruses , where this phenomenon was first discovered , but bacteria and eukaryotes have evolved special signals to tell ribosomes to shift in and out of frame by plus or minus one see a gripping tale of ribosomal frameshifting extragenic suppressors of frameshift mutations spotlight p site realignment , atkins and bj rk , microbiol mol biol rev certain trnas participate in quadruplet codon decoding , making it possible for special frameshift signals to work the signals usually involve base long slippery heptamer sequences , such as ccctgac , right where a stop codon tga appears in other words , when a stop codon appears inside a slippery heptamer , it 's not really a stop codon depending on the kinds and amounts of trnas on duty , it can be a frameshift signal when i looked for ccctgac in m leprae 's pseudogenes , i found in frame occurrences of the sequence in pseudogenes only occurrences of the hexamer ccctga were found , in frame , in m leprae 's normal genes while this does n't prove that m leprae is up to any unusual translation tricks , it 's a tantalizing result also bear in mind , if m leprae is indeed up to some unusual tricks , it may very well be using frameshift signals other than or in addition to ccctgac the fact that mycobacterium species lack a muts mutl mismatch repair system means m leprae may have adapted different ways of coping with slippery repeats further work will be needed to confirm whether m leprae indeed translates some of its pseudogenes into proteins the high likelihood pseudogenes that , according to my analysis , might still encode functional or at least expressed membrane associated proteins are shown in the table below leave a comment if you have additional thoughts m leprae pseudogenes that have codons with overall ag and ag pseudogene possible product mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr conserved hypothetical protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr psta component of phosphate uptake mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr abc transporter mlbr possible ppe family protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr possible cytochrome p mlbr probable cytochrome p mlbr possible membrane protein mlbr pgrs family protein mlbr hypothetical protein mlbr dihydrodipicolinate reductase mlbr conserved hypothetical protein mlbr probable na h exchanger mlbr pe family protein mlbr probable ketoacyl reductase mlbr conserved hypothetical protein mlbr molybdopterin converting factor subunit mlbr psta component of phosphate uptake mlbr dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase mlbr kda antigenic lipoprotein mlbr pe protein mlbr transcriptional regulator lysr family mlbr pe family protein mlbr conserved hypothetical protein mlbr possible membrane protein
