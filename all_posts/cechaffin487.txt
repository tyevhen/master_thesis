our neighbors act as if nothing has happened they have a court date this month but seem dismissive of it i do n't know if they 've paid our landlord yet , but i try not to pry too much , balancing the traitor , the friend and the voyeur i want to attend their next day in court to see if any of their stories hold water i should think if they were wholly guilty of grand larceny they would have skedaddled by now they are being evicted at the least , but who knows how long that takes in california , the victim 's paradise ? they did manage to secure two old televisions from garage sales as soon as they were released , which are always on and usually too loud to talk over in the meantime they owe us for the cable bill we share i want my mopney surely as the landlord wants his then they owe him the great news is that our bed arrived today , shipped from virginia , latex memory foam sure to make our achy breaky joints more sanguine in the morning as for me , i have become more aggressive about achieving greater recognition for my verse i did n't win the last ns contest i entered , which received mss mss at per means , , much less than the monetary reward and cost of pubication the contest undertakes perhaps i should start my own ms contest and live off the overage face it most of the mss entered are simply glanced at and put aside as kooky or amateurish maybe twenty deserve more attention hand the last five to the judge and voila ! his prejudices decide the winner and the press makes a handy profit the judge for the contest was tim seibles , whose style gave me little hope , but that 's not the point the point is to keep trying yesterday i entered two manuscripts in ohio state university 's morse prize the manuscripts are sine wave from which i 've posted quite a few here and wear me like a river love poems for kathleen i'm working on a third manuscript until i can submit three at once to contests , provided i can afford the entry fees there 's a sucker born every minute i also submitted to ploughshares , the kenyon review , and the new yorker no , i'm not holding my breath but all three can be reached through online submissions , if you 're curious the foam beds are gradually expanding from the rolls they came as as kathleen and i toast each other on a bed worthy of our age and station with a cheap cabernet tomatoes and cucumbers and gourds are ripening my my garden peach and blood red dahlias bloom there , too and i 've blathered enough for one uneventful day my anxiety has been better , so i'm posting a poem about anxiety below my mood 's ok , say kilorat i put myself in the negative still because no matter how content i may feel in the immediate , i still feel the power of depression curled within me , mocking my sanguine exterior thine as always , ce anxeyeity i am running it is night a giant eye pursues me through the dark forest on silent pseudopodia branches bend against its malleable globe but never snap , the sound of their brushing enough to spook the nightingale that sang me to false safety i m never safe i am running it is night there is no i in eye , is there ? where is the white marble with the dark bull 's eye ? hiding in blue black between trees , hissing past pine cones , maintaining its distance ? how i wish it would close ! i m never safe i am running it is night should i lie down in this brief field under the moonless sky and wait ? will i be swallowed , sniffed , inspected , prodded , analyzed ? devoured , will i become a cartoon on its retina ? there is no i in eye it 's my eye , isn t it ? well is n't it ? i m never safe published in m a g along with others
