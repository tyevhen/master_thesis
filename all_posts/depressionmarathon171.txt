two days into , and i could n't be more pleased to i say , good riddance ! while was n't all bad , it was a long , tough year in a lot of ways i can only hope for smoother sailing in let 's take a look at the record i began in my third month of recovery , i e no running , from october , , hip surgery i did what i could to maintain my fitness , but my mood took a hit anyway i struggled with my illness for about weeks , from early january through mid february i began my slow return to running in late january , and perhaps not coincidentally , my mood began it 's slow ascent as well by march i was feeling emotionally well again my life was pleasantly boring for a few weeks but by mid march , shortly after guaranteeing an entry into the november st , new york city marathon , i developed what would turn into a debilitating running injury at that point , i was only sidelined for a couple weeks with a sore calf oh , how i wish that had been the extent of it ! april found me running again , albeit with a sore , right achilles tendon , working regularly , socializing , and otherwise participating fully in life i was on schedule to run grandmas marathon in june a trip to arizona with my boyfriend , don , however , changed that in arizona , on april , , a date i may never forget , at mile of a mile long run , i tore my right achilles tendon that arizona trip was a turning point in more ways than one within a few weeks , on the exact day an mri confirmed my achilles tear , i decided to end my relationship with don our relationship was no longer fulfilling or positive i needed someone capable of more support and commitment that being said , ending a relationship after four years was nonetheless difficult and sad may , june and july were primarily focused on working , attempting to heal and rehab my achilles , and forlornly standing by as one race after another passed without my participation i tried my best to take good care of myself , stick to a healthy routine , and see friends unfortunately , by late july , depression began another assault i could not have predicted what the next months would bring a full blown , devastating and debilitating depression relapse took me out of life for almost months i spent my entire fall desperately trying to release the grip of depression 's stranglehold two , week hospitalizations , many ect treatments , multiple medication trials , silly group programming , and countless appointments and meetings with concerned friends and professionals did not help life as i knew it ceased i was n't just walking wounded by early october , i was walking dead desperately suicidal and fearful for my own safety , i was n't sure i could outlast the depression in the span of nine days , however , that changed after yet another medication change , i went from walking dead , to wounded , to hopeful i began to feel lighter the depression vacuum released after months , i returned to life in late october but just as i was returning , two emergency , painful oral surgeries knocked me back i persevered slowly , cautiously , i found my way back to friends , work and exercise and after a month layoff , i even returned to running just barely november st , the very day i was supposed to be running the new york city marathon there was hope if you 've been following along , you know a lot of good has happened over these last two months my mood is excellent it 's miraculous when i consider how disabled i was just a few months ago i'm so grateful we found a new medication that works i'm alive once again my life is moving forward i just celebrated years of sobriety i am working four days per week , with the opportunity to lock up a regular , full time position within the next few weeks , if all continues to go well and while re aggravation of my achilles brought a halt to my running , once again , i am hopeful the specialist i am seeing thursday will be able to fix it i have to believe that and so hope begins a new year the long , challenging year that was is now in the rear view mirror the pain and loss are behind me i do not have to re live them i'm looking forward to healing and succeeding in i'm sure it wo n't all be sunshine and roses , but if i survived , i believe i can survive just about anything and so can you ! happy new year , my friends !
