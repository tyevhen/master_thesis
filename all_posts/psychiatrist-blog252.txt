warning boring content intended for medicare clinicians who file claims even a graphic wo n't spice this up blanket disclaimer i have no special insights and i did my best to get someone to figure this out for me i am not liable or responsible in anyway if the information below is wrong , if medicare cuts your fees or repossesses your first born medicare and i have a hate hate relationship , yet still , i remain a non participating provider and have not opted out it 's a matter of time , and grappling with my own guilt and inertia , but for the moment , i remain under their thumb over on reidbord 's reflections , dr reidbord blogs about why he 's opted out so there 's something called the medicare physician quality reporting system that needs to be done by the end of or clinicians will have a fee reduction in roy said put a number in a box and pray another dear colleague , who is involved with the apa , was kind enough to figure out the details for me and to actually follow up with me when i would have wandered off and forgotten about this , so let me share all his wisdom with you this has nothing to do with 'meaningful use ' you need to do this for one patient , one time in , to avoid a medicare fee cut in i confirmed this with the apa this is not an incentive thing , it avoids a fee cut but does not get you a fee increase that takes more work then i can even begin to think about starting with the box , to find the one to put the number in medicare claims are submitted on a hcfa form there are spaces for dates services on one line , do as usual and put the date , the place of service , and the cpt code for example and the corresponding fee on a second line , you may have the same date , place of service , and an add on code for example for psychotherapy , or you may not when you 're done with the cpt codes , go to the next empty line and add the date , the place of service , and the box you 're going to use is the one below the last entered cpt code the column is labeled cpt hcpcs here you will add a g or f code , explained below , to report a measure now that you have the box , here 's how to pick the code number there are reportable measures psychiatry boils down to or if you want an easy answer , scroll down to the red text here are some of the many the options for a patient with major depression being seen for a psych eval , a new patient eval , or a routine e m visit enter g if the patient with a new episode of depression has been treated with an antidepressant for weeks days during the acute phase of treatment enter g if the patient was not an eligible candidate for antidepressants or did not have a new episode of mdd enter g if the patient with a new episode of depression is not documented as being treated during the entire week acute treatment phase if you do n't like those options , there are codes for medication reconciliation after d c from an inpatient unit , or if you do an advanced care plan with a patient over aged one easy option might be f advance care planning not documented , reason not otherwise specified other measures relate to dsm which i am so far ignoring , so i'm not typing them in here for patients with major depression g suicide risk assessed at the initial evaluation f major depressive disorder in remission g suicide risk not assessed at the initial evaluation , reason not given documenting medications in the medical record including otc meds supplements herbals g documented medications to the best of your ability g patient is not eligible for medication documentation huh ? , go figure g meds not documented , reason not given there are measures for screening for depression in patients older than age , but i'm skipping those here there are also coordination of care codes that i 'll skip have n't found one you like yet ? here are more f patient screened for unhealthy alcohol use with a systematic screening method f patient screened for tobacco cessation intervention and counseled treated if a smoker f current tobacco non user so basically , you can pick one non smoking medicare patient , put the date , and put f , and then enter the fee for the service which is if your computer does n't allow a fee , put that will keep you from a fee cut in unless , of course , i'm wrong the prayer , apparently , is non specific and any religion will do
