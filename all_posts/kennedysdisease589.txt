note this research concerns als , but also associates this particular research to sbma kennedy 's disease article found on th space interactive the peripheral immune system is implicated in modulating microglial activation , neurodegeneration and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als specifically , there is reduced thymic function and regulatory t cell treg number in als patients and mutant superoxide dismutase sod mice , while passive transfer of tregs ameliorates disease in mutant sod mice here , we assessed the effects of augmenting endogenous cd t cell number by stimulating the thymus using surgical castration on the phenotype of transgenic sodga mice methodmale sodga mice were castrated or sham operated , and weight loss , disease onset and progression were examined thymus atrophy and blood cd , cd and cd foxp t cell numbers were determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting facs motor neuron counts , glial cell activation and androgen receptor ar expression in the spinal cord were investigated using immunohistochemistry and western blotting differences between castrated and sham mice were analysed using an unpaired t test or one way anova results castration significantly increased thymus weight and total cd t cell numbers in sodga mice , although tregs levels were not affected despite this , disease onset and progression were similar in castrated and sham sodga mice castration did not affect motor neuron loss or astrocytic activation in spinal cords of sodga mice however , microglial activation was reduced , specifically m microglia we also show that ar is principally expressed in spinal motor neurons and progressively downregulated in spinal cords of sodga mice from disease onset which is further enhanced by castration conclusions these results demonstrate that increasing thymic function and cd t cell number by castration confers no clinical benefit in mutant sod mice , which may reflect an inability to stimulate neuroprotective tregs nonetheless , castration decreases m microglial activation in the spinal cord without any clinical improvement and motor neuron rescue , in contrast to other approaches to suppress microglia in mutant sod mice lastly , diminished ar expression in spinal motor neurons , which links to another motor neuron disorder , spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , may contribute to als pathogenesis and suggests a common disease pathway in als and sbma mediated by disruption of ar signalling in motor neurons author rebecca k sheeanrichard h westonnirma d pereraangela d amicostephen l nuttbradley j turner credits source journal of neuroinflammation , published on news provider thspace interactive eupb press office copyright by the authors listed above made available via biomedcentral open access
