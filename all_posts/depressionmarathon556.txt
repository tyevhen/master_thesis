i am seven days away from the boston marathon it 's hard to believe it 's been quite a journey ! let 's start the journey with qualifying at grandma 's last june i ran a personal best , , despite walking several times it was my fifth marathon in the span of seven months , and i knew i could go faster i had planned to run the twin cities marathon in october , but in august i hurt my knee running the eisenbahn marathon i dropped out at the halfway point and was unable to run again for the rest of the fall on october th , , just months ago , i had surgery to repair the damaged knee i did n't know if i 'd get to boston , as my doc thought it might take months to return to running fortunately , i was able to get back to gentle jogging in december , but the layoff had apparently already taken it 's toll on my mental health i ended up in the hospital just before christmas that was the first of two recent hospitalizations depression had me in its death grip the second hospitalization knocked me out of running commission until the first week of february , yikes ! i was very far behind schedule and my mood and motivation were both lacking i'm looking back at my training calendar right now that first week i ran miles and miles , and my long run was actually a walk run of miles ! wow that was just over weeks ago things were going great for about weeks , and then struck what i thought was the final disaster i developed sudden , debilitating knee pain it was a floating body , probably a piece of damaged cartilage which broke free , which lodged in between the bones of the knee joint walking was painful , and i could n't run a step for about days things looked grim boston was only about weeks away then , just as suddenly as it came on , the pain disappeared apparently , the floating body dislodged itself i got back to work since then , my abbreviated training has gone well i 've run long runs of , , and miles in a typical training cycle , i probably would have run each of those distances at least twice but , as noted above , this was anything but a typical training cycle this was a convoluted , detoured , meandering journey and now here i am , just seven days away from the start of the boston marathon it 's hard to believe i think i better savor the experience
