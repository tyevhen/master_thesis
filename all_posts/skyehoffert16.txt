i turn tomorrow i am still not sure how i feel about that , for some reason i feel more affected by this one then my st i do n't even feel twenty and not maturity wise or anything , i feel nearer to in my mind sometimes it 's more like i feel young in spirit i am a well of inspiration right now , and i want to spend my days painting , drawing , reading , drinking tea and coffee , eating sweets , and basking in the sun this is obviously not a very realistic state of mind to have , especially at i feel like every age comes with expectations and once you reach your twenties you are expected to have your life together , or at least be getting it together i have fall into neither of these categories if i was being honest i have nothing together believe me when i say nothing that 's the miserable part , i am a perfectionist with some ocd tendencies so the fact that i do n't have my life sorted out , drives me crazy people also love to point out the things they think you are doing wrong , and i seem to do a lot wrong yet in spite of all of this , i am happy i like that i am not tied down or committed to anything , how my life is going to turn out at this point is anyone 's guess i have my dreams and hopes for the future , and i am going to chase those i am leaving it up to god where i go from here , and that is the magical part
