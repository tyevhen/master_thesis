warning i express my feelings openly in this blog , i talk about some very dark years in my life and my experiances of self harm and suicidal thoughts , do n't read any of this if you do n't want to if you have recognised me it might be tempting it would be to me ! but be strong and turn away now if you do n't want to know ok , here 's the story i started this blog in and i have kept it going far longer than i expected i ever would i have started to find it more and more easily in google searches and even through a few links on relevant topic pages in an ideal world it would be totally annonymous but as we live in the real world some people who know me well or have a lot of contact with me may recognise me through my actions , my experiances or my behavior this message is for all those people number one say hello in a comment otherwise contact me through facebook using my real name or by email and let me know you have read this , i really do n't mind if you want to approach me face to face that 's ok too but please warn me in advance number two do n't feel you have to discuss any of the content with me , try not to feel awkward i really do n't mind people knowing about my past problems or my current battles and i know the internet is a public place if you do want to talk about it that 's ok too number three i often use this to vent , if you recognise yourself keep in mind that i do n't worry what other people think of me anymore and i do n't judge other people the hardest part of what i have been through is believing other people do n't like me this has tortured me in the past and i never want any of the people around me to feel like that yes , i get frustrated with people ocasionally but i'm human and it never lasts i am a person who loves my family , friends , colleagues and acquaintences i do n't want them to feel the slightest hurt maybe the meds i take keep me well sedated number four do n't talk about me or my blog to other people who know me , even if you are saying nice things this tends to make me very paranoid and uncomfortable number five read the about me post for my reasons for writing this blog , and yes i know the risks but i want others to understand what i have been through and what i am still going through , i want to help people who are suffering and help their family and friends to understand
