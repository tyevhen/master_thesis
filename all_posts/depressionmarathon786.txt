things are still going well around here , even though i feel like i 've got irons in the fire i just got back from a walk with puck it 's been brutally hot and humid around here , with heat advisories nearly every day , so walking is about the extent of our exercise i did play softball last night it was even hotter then ! but we played really well , and it was a fun game even though we lost our season is now over , so that 's one less thing i have to think about i 've had my new vehicle for two days , and i'm fretting about it just a bit you see , with the two right hip surgeries i 've had and written about here previously , i ca n't sit in certain positions one of the positions which bothers my hip is good , upright posture unfortunately , my driver 's seat promotes good , upright posture no matter how many ways i adjust the seat , i ca n't get the pain out of my right hip and leg i'm hoping to figure it out , but i do n't know what i 'll do if i do n't if i do n't solve this dilemma soon , i 'll really be fretting ! my year old car left yesterday , and i have to admit , i was really sad kind of silly , i know i'm glad a young woman will continue to own it i think she 'll enjoy the ride , and i feel good about selling it to her now if i could just find a buyer for my motorcycle anyone ? she 's a beauty ! the work on my basement continues to progress soon , i 'll have to decide on a color scheme i 've got the bathroom figured out , but i'm not sure what to do with the large room where all of my exercise equipment will live white is so boring , but with it being a basement room , i'm concerned most colors will appear dark hmmm it 's nice to have such pressing problems ! ha ! well , i'm off to a mandatory staff meeting it 's my day off , but what can i do ? at least it will be air conditioned ! so long for now
