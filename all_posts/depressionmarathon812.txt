yesterday my energy returned i had a nice day at work , and then i covered miles on my bike and feet minutes on the bike followed by a minute run it was a beautiful evening after a very wet day i think the day off was actually helpful , as my legs felt really strong throughout my workout today 's been a nice slow day i started with my usual aa meeting , cleaned house a bit finally ! , took a nap and then went swimming it 's been another gray , rainy day , so the beach was n't an option instead i took my wetsuit to my usual , shallow pool for yards of laps i did challenge myself by not taking any extra breaths at each end of the pool i do n't do flip turns instead of my usual touch , breath and turn , today i touched the wall and immediately turned around without taking my head out of the water so it was more like a flip turn , as there were no breaks for an extra breath and i did it i swam my yards in minutes no breaks ! on the one hand , i'm encouraged by this , as i know i can swim the required triathlon distance without stopping on the other hand , i'm discouraged , because i know i ca n't do the exact same thing in a lake ! ugh ! why is it so different ? basically , it 's my fear it 's gotta be all about my fear tomorrow , i may get to confront that fear again one of my co workers is a swimmer she 's doing the sprint triathlon tomorrow she 's going to swim across a small lake with her sister rowing beside her she offered to take me along i'm anxious to see how it goes of course , i 'll let you know the triathlon is days away
