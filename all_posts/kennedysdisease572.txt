no , i m not melting , but i am shrinking it seems like this last year s wasting is more focused on my arms and shoulders yes , there has been wasting in the past , but it is much more noticeable now i suppose it goes along with my pencil neck j when i look at my arms this morning , they are much more skin than bones the skin hangs in certain places where there used to be muscle i m certain there is still some muscle there it is just much more difficult to find the good news is my leg strength continues to be good i am doing the same number of reps in all my standing exercises perhaps it is time to see my physical therapist again he can evaluate my current capabilities and , if needed , change my arm and shoulder exercises if you haven t been evaluated before , i highly recommend it just make sure the pt has experience in dealing with kennedy 's disease or at least progressive neuromuscular conditions a couple of questions have you noticed more wasting physical appearance in certain parts of your body ? what has been your experience with physical therapists ?
