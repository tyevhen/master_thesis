hi a b curtiss , i am a photographer and was photographing a house for a realtor this week when i finally came across the green frog paxil and celexa were prescribed to me on different occasions years apart and years ago they were semi adequate , but each time i came off them , things got way worse so i read your book , depression is a choice i tried to green frog it and it worked great it was so effective i had no symptoms for over a year when the symptoms returned , i green frogged it again again it worked the bummer is depression onset never goes away , but i do n't stress because for me green frogging always extinguishes the symptoms thanks for writing a great book ! t q
