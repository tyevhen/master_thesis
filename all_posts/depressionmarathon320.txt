i said something the other day , a bit in jest , but realized later that it had some truth to it , actually more truth than i 'd like admit but admit it is what i am about to do i 've become aware that i approach relationships from a position of defect that is , i feel i am defective i feel i am a defective person , because of my illness , in comparison to you and to you , and you , and you internally , i feel less than pretty much every person i meet and with whom i interact ouch that was n't an easy paragraph to write i am not proud of this fact this has been a hard realization at which to arrive but i wonder if i am alone i wonder if others can relate and if you can relate , what have you done about it ? this is not an attitude or feeling i want to continue i 'd much rather approach others feeling as if i were an equal as i 've noted , this is a fresh observation of an underlying belief i do n't think it is obvious to those around me i think others would be surprised to learn i feel this way i do n't think i act as if i feel less than my friends or coworkers , but feel that way i do i do n't totally understand it myself i'm not even sure how it impacts my life exactly , but it probably does , right ? it 's something i 'll have to work on , i guess feel free to discuss
