vi a sexualized vision of my addiction i saw the spirit of fire , tobaccohontas in her coronet of coals dancing in a leaf skirt of golden brown , her incendiary thighs burning burning burning before her only god breathed fire afterwards came dragons , venomous snakes and toads finally man 's penis swelled and woman 's labia grew bloody purple , pink and wet i heard tobaccohontas speak i burn for you , brave do not forget your love cleave me with your tomahawk , undo the seam so lightly stitched by nature or my own nails will ream it , drive your spear into the ravenous slit beneath the golden curls of my mons , pound me as a bear ruts a sow in a ditch littered with salmon bones and acorns my mouths have swallowed the seed of many warriors , come ah , tobaccohontas , i once fingered your moist fragrance in blue pouches of drum tobacco your scent still calls to me from the tent of elders puff by puff but such stoic moderation is beyond me i cannot sample you , i must devour and be devoured my lava grows hard in your ocean your undersea cleft shapes me my tip breaks off like a coal in your wet purse i shudder , deflate and die you are the siren of my death i stub you out in ashtrays as if they were vampires coffins through which to pound my stake now i can only suck the memory of your forbidden pleasure and cast its usage toward some future beyond obsession forgive me princess you were the best
