hello guys ! as you may know i have recently written a blog post for anna from 'a whole lot of chitty chat' i thought it would be a good idea if anna would write a blog post for my blog too , in the hope that it will help others in regards to what you 're experiecing with anxiety , but also to let you know of a great blogger ! hello amy 's lovely readers , by the looks of her twitter followers there could be a lot of you ! i love reading amy 's blog i can totally relate to her just like many others can too i'm sure i approached amy asked her if she would like to do a post for my blog which she happily got involved in sent me a post , which is now up over on my blog so now it is my turn , i did n't approach amy with the hope that she would want me to do a post for her blog too , not at all but i feel happy that she asked me to do one in return i approached amy in the hope she would say yes so i could then help spread the word share her blog with my readers so now we are on track know what is going on , i 'll tell you a little bit about myself my name is anna , i'm i blog over at a whole lot of chitty chat i started blogging at the start of this year when to be honest i felt very little purpose in my life that was when my blog was created , i thought it would be a good place to share my thoughts then i actually started sharing my blog about a bit over on twitter started gaining readers now i not only blog for myself but for others , others who probably like yourself feel so alone in your situation you are never alone just like amy , i suffer with anxiety i first started noticing when i was around the age of i know how hard life can be for those affected you can feel so misunderstood , you can feel so alone but that really does n't have to be the case you should n't have to suffer in silence either if you do n't feel comfortable speaking about your struggles openly , why not maybe start a blog anonymously just like amy ? i think blogging is a great way to have a voice a little place to build a friendship become part of a community i'm currently building friendships with a few lovely girls who also blog , it is fantastic ! i do blog mainly about mental health the effect it has on my life but i now blog weekly about my driving lessons do a post every sunday called sit down sunday which is where i just reflect on everything good about that week for a little while i had a routine for the days of the week i would blog on but sometimes life is unexpected changes plus having a routine kind of takes away the fun in blogging just adds pressure ! pressure is not fun i'm going to leave my post at that hope i have n't bored anyone to sleep oh well done if you managed to read to the end i feel that was really higgledy piggledy so i apologise thanks for having me over on your blog amy thanks to your readers for hopefully reading this post anna you can find me over on twitter awholelotof find my blog over at http awholelotofchittychat blogspot co uk if you do check out my blog leave me a little comment saying you 've come from amy 's blog thank you anna for writing it just shows there are many people going through the same experience as you best wishes , amy xx
