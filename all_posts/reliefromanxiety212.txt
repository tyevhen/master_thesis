for as long as i can remember , i 've strived to be perfect this can be used to my advantage because it makes me do things to a higher standard and work my socks off , but on the other hand it can drive you to insanity sometimes , it results in me not feeling as if i have the ability to tackle certain situations i guess this is where some of my anxiety lies i get extremely anxious at the thought i might do something wrong it 's not healthy , as doubt and fear are the biggest killers of ambition rather than run from fear , try and embrace it ! what you and i must understand is that no one is perfect , as much as we like to think we could be or feel people are we all make mistakes and it 's just part of nature and when we do make a mistake or 'fail' then we feel awful i guess this is why i 've been so obsessive over grades unfortunately , failure is inevitable and something you can run from , but will probably catch you up the important thing is , is to ensure you keep going as i 've grown older , the bigger the world has gotten and the things that once seemed so important , are n't so i now know grades are n't the end nevertheless i will still strive for perfection to ensure i do well as i 've grown , the power of failure has lessened , but still has a strong presence it is something that i must learn to accept is going to happen however , it 's still important to try your best at whatever you do this fear of failure is getting in the way of me living my life , such as taking my driving test i must n't avoid the situation , but i must tackle it head on so , let 's all try and do something we fear we may fail at try your best , and see where it gets you highly likely , you will do well failure will happen in life , and you cannot live a life without it best wishes , amy xx
