this is a tough one today , i read a nami stigmabuster alert about the trans allegheny lunatic asylum in weston , virginia last summer , joe jordan , an asbestos demolition contractor , bought the weston hospital in west virginia , which is registered as a national historic landmark he has renamed it the trans allegheny lunatic asylum , which was its name in another era constructed in as a psychiatric hospital , it housed more than , patients at its peak it was closed in the associated press ap has reported that jordan is trying to revive the property by offering tours and other attractions the planned attractions include a hospital of horrors at halloween season , a nightmare before christmas tour , as well as psycho path dirt bike races on the acre complex stigmabusters are outraged that the stigmatizing name has been resurrected and that the hospital , where many people once suffered , will be used as the setting for entertainment , featuring violent stereotypes and disparaging language like many of you may be right now , i was initially outraged ! however , after spending the last hour looking over the old hospital 's website , my outrage has mellowed from a boil to a simmer the situation is a bit more complex than it initially appears this building is quite historic and apparently was a centerpiece of the community for most of its years i am a big fan of historic buildings , and this one looks beautiful ! it is a gigantic , stone hospital like so many others around the nation , it was closed in the 's and has since fallen into disrepair due to the huge expense required to maintain it it was on the demolition block when it was purchased at auction by mr jordan the website appears to positively focus on the history of the hospital , it 's architecture , and it 's economic impact on the local community over its year lifespan some of the tour guests have commented on the site that the tour was done respectfully and actually highlighted the suffering of the mentally ill patients i do n't even have a problem with them resurrecting the old , stigma laden , stereotypical name as long as it is historically accurate and done in the name of preservation the problem is , with scheduled fundraising activities including hours of hospital of horrors tours before halloween and something called the nightmare before christmas on december rd , determining whether or not the name change is purely preservation driven is difficult note it 's also been reported that the upcoming truck races scheduled on the hospital grounds were to be called the psycho path races , but the hospital web site only refers to them as the mud bog races so there are more complexities here than it appears at first blush many of the comments on the website are either totally supportive of mr jordan , and unfortunately dismissive of the concerns of the mental health community , or they contemptuously blast mr jordan 's ignorance and dismiss any potential positive impact of his undertaking i think the reality lies somewhere in between these two extremes preserving a beautiful , historic building is laudable , maybe even altruistic , especially when that building has been instrumental to the community 's economic survival mr jordan has an opportunity to use a unique and spectacular platform to attract and educate people about the history and reality of mental illness imagine how powerful that tour could be if it incorporated personal statements from the doctors , nurses , patients and family members associated with the institution have you ever been to alcatraz or ellis island ? are n't those audio tours more educational and memorable because they include the actual experiences and voices of the guards , prisoners , and immigrants who were there ? heck , what a great opportunity for mr jordan to employ some people with mental illness as tour guides there 's no better way to change people 's ideas about a stigmatized , stereotyped group than to have them come face to face with each other i 'd volunteer to give tours if i lived anywhere near the place ! the opportunity for enlightenment is great unfortunately , it appears the financial stresses of such a massive undertaking and or mr jordan 's lack of knowledge or concern for the mentally ill have led to poor fundraising choices it is unfortunate and maddening that he and his supporters cannot comprehend why holding a hospital of horrors tour in a mental health hospital is offensive i ca n't comprehend why they ca n't comprehend that ! that 's frightening let 's hold it at a cancer hospital where guests can stick their fingers into darkened containers of real tumors and experience the side effects of chemotherapy firsthand how about having the horror tour at a rehab hospital for spinal cord and brain injury where guests could be temporarily paralyzed , blinded , or rendered mute and then asked to negotiate a staircase , busy street corner , or answer the telephone ha ! ha ! ha ! what a hoot ! oh , does that sound outrageous , insensitive ? exactly think about it nightmare before christmas ? hospital of horrors ? those titles would not work at the cancer institute or the rehab center if they were n't based on stigma and stereotypes , those titles would n't work at all they only work in a former mental institution because they are based on the stereotype that mentally ill people are violent , murderous , and scary it is a powerful , pervasive stereotype , and that stigma is what makes these ill conceived tours and programs appealing and profitable so i commend you , mr jordan , for standing up and using your own funds to save an important , historically significant building but i also urge you , mr jordan , to use your creative mind to develop alternative methods to raise funds for your undertaking hold a dance or a costume party how about inviting locals to use your grounds for proms , weddings , family reunions , or flea markets are you requesting outside assistance ? perhaps you could set up your website to accept donations please , mr jordan , out of compassion for those of us living with mental illness , and certainly out of respect for those spirits with whom you now mingle , please reconsider your fundraising decisions i look forward to visiting your beautiful site soon
