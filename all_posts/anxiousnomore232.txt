photo by chloemonster today spontaneously at lunch a coworker decided to grill up some hamburgers i was really hungry and they sounded so yummy so i added my name to the list of people that wanted one when it was time to eat , i didn t even worry about my anxiety i told myself i am going to eat what i want to and not worry about anything else it worked i was so hungry i was eating with everyone and not even caring what anyone might be thinking , and i am pretty positive no one was even thinking anything since i was scarfing it down ! i don t know if that somehow made it a little easier since i was starving , but i ll take it as a successful situation ! for some reason eating around coworkers is one of the toughest things for me and i did it today all by myself with no clonozapam as an aid i even forgot to pick up my zoloft refill last night so i didn t even take that today shhh ! sure the thought arose in my head that it could be hard for me but i think my subconscious told myself the positive affirmation that has been taped to my alarm clock , this might be hard , but i can handle it my anxiety never got above a i never had to focus on breathing or anything so i have successes in a row which makes me very happy if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like a year later same scenario , different outcome successful small trip bbq update level panic , but i survived linkwithin
