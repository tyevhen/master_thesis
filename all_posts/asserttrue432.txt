when talk therapy works , it can work wonders when it does n't work which is a fair amount of the time , all bets are off , because anything can happen while psychiatric drugs are required to undergo efficacy testing before being released to the public , no efficacy requirements are placed on non drug therapies talk therapy is just assumed to work for most people , and new therapies are routinely rolled out willy nilly on live patients with no oversight by anyone and no guarantee of safety , much less efficacy that 's not to say some therapies have n't been subjected to controlled testing in recent years , cognitive behavioral therapy cbt , in particular , has been the subject of hundreds of published trials there 's reason to believe , however , that many of the cbt trials are biased and that as with drug trials that do n't come out the way the researchers wanted unflattering trials simply go unpublished cuijpers et al in found substantial reason to suspect publication bias in talk therapy trials notice the asymmetry in this funnel plot in a paper in the british journal of psychiatry efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychochological treatments for adult depression , , non paywall protected version here cuijpers et al looked at published trials that made comparisons between particular talk therapies and a control group the funnel plot for these trials see graphic strongly suggests publication bias the majority of the trials involved cbt with drug trials , we usually think in terms of a med either helping or not helping in reality , patients tend to follow one of three trajectories the drug helps , it does nothing , or it actually makes the condition worse these trajectories exist for placebos as well individual trajectories typically are n't reported in the literature unless they culminate in adverse events , like suicide instead , they 're lumped together into an overall score that shows yea many points average improvement on the hamilton scale or whatever , for the treatment arm as a whole it 's difficult to say how often therapy goes off the rails but a meta analysis of talk therapy outcome studies reported in smith , glass , and miller , the benefits of psychotherapy , baltimore johns hopkins university press , found that of the time , effect sizes were negative , meaning patients got worse in therapy shapiro shapiro found much the same thing in meta analysis of comparative therapy outcome studies a replication and refinement , psychological bulletin , , , in a paper , charles m boisvert and david faust practicing psychologists knowledge of general psychotherapy research findings implications for science practice relations , faculty publications paper , available here tracked down the most highly cited researchers in the handbook of psychotherapy and behavior change th ed bergin garfield , and asked each one to agree or disagree with a number of assertions , including the statement approximately of clients get worse as a result of therapy the average response to that statement was on a scale of to , where meant i'm extremely certain that the assertion is incorrect and meant i'm extremely certain that the assertion is correct for comparison 's sake , the statement therapy is helpful to the majority of clients scored just while seems to be an accepted ballpark figure for iatrogenic talk therapy outcomes , the true number could be as high as see this paper if we count incorrect diagnosis as a form of patient harm , two of the most harmful therapeutic tools in psychiatry are the rorschach test or ink blotch test and the thematic apperception test around of normal individuals who take the rorschach test score as if they 're seriously disturbed professor james m wood , univ of texas , quoted here in , an extremely thorough meta analysis found the rorschach test , the thematic apperception test , and human figure drawing to have so many problems , not just with repeatability but with basic validity , that they should n't be used any more , basically in the much cited psychological treatments that cause harm , perspectives on psychological science , march pdf here , emory university 's scott lilienfeld identifies a number of different types of therapy that have been shown to have the potential to hurt patients more than they help them potentially harmful therapies identified by lilienfeld include the following type of therapy adverse outcomes source of evidence critical incident stress debriefing heightened risk for post traumatic stress symptoms rcts scared straight interventions exacerbation of conduct problems rcts facilitated communication false accusations of child abuse against family members low base rate events in replicated case reports attachment

analysis expressive experiential therapies exacerbation of painful emotions rcts boot camp interventions for conduct disorder exacerbation of conduct problems meta analysis dare programs increased intake of alcohol and other substances rcts did means dissociative identity disorder dare refers to drug abuse and resistance education lilienfeld is quick to point out that even a therapy that 's not bringing about actual deterioration in a patient 's condition can be harmful if it delays seeking out a more effective therapy for example , it 's well known that behavioral therapies tend to be more effective than nonbehavioral therapies for obsessive compulsive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , and phobias some patients have spent years trying to cure a phobia , only to find that by switching therapists and using a more appropriate therapy the phobia becomes manageable after one visit lilienfeld and others have noted that negative outcomes tend to be far more frequent in treatment programs aimed at adolescents than those aimed at adults , especially in group oriented programs , where social effects can overwhelm the therapy many examples of shockingly negative outcomes in youth programs can be found in the literature start by reading this excellent paper by rhule perhaps the most celebrated disaster in the u s , at least is the scared straight program ,
