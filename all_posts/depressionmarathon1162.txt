this day could not be more beautiful bluer than blue skies , wispy white clouds , warm sun mixed with cool , dry air it is a day to behold , an awesome and awe inspiring day today reminds me i am but one minute particle in this enormous collage we call the world i am so grateful it 's a beautiful day i picked her up from school we said our hellos she is quiet and shy she often looks uncomfortable in her own , ever changing skin i remember thirteen is a tough age , especially for a girl i would n't do it again if you paid me ! in this routine , now almost two years old , we 've become comfortable with silence once in awhile i do try to engage , but silence is acceptable to both of us ten minutes later , i drop her at piano lessons , and minutes after that , she 's on her way to confirmation as we pull into the church lot , i ask her if she knows who 's picking her up , something i usually do but ca n't today she says it 's her mom , and in the following seconds , we share the unspoken dread you 're going to call her when you 're done , right , i ask ? yes , she says , opening the door good , i say that 's a good idea the too wise for her age smirk tells me she understands we go our separate ways i arrive at her home minutes later she wo n't need to picked up for an hour , but i'm not confident mom will be prepared i want to see is mom even awake ? it 's not typical , and as expected , today is no exception mom sometimes rallies for these once in a blue moon responsibilities she 's even bragged about not drinking on days where she has to go out , the occasional doctor 's appointment or to pick a child up , but pm is a long time for her to wait i doubt she did wait today the empty bottles and cans are in their typical places they could be from last night , but the darkened house , quiet except for the blaring tv , suggests more recent activity i hang around to help the teenage son with some simple stuff maybe minutes at most yet , before i'm out the door , the phone begins to ring it rings , and rings , and rings , pauses , and then rings , and rings , and rings again i hesitate is it her ? could n't be , i just dropped her off but what if it is ? what if confirmation got canceled and she now needs that ride home ? i never answer their phone , and i make no exception this time despite my concern i exit the ringing follows me out , stopping only when i close my car door and drive away i reassure myself by thinking it is probably dad on the phone he 's likely concerned , too he 's likely phoning from his office to remind mom of her upcoming responsibility with each unanswered ring , i picture him becoming more and more agitated he knows she 's either sleeping , or passed out , or just ignoring the phone and why should n't she ? if there is never a hello at the other end of the line , eventually dad will leave his office to fill in he 'll walk blocks to his car and then drive halfway across town to fetch his daughter from a church which is only mile from their home the same home where mom is lying uncaring , or unconscious , or both in her bed i drive home feeling sick on a beautiful , beautiful day
