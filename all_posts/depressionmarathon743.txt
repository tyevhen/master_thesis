wow i do n't know what 's gotten into me , but i 've had a very productive couple of days ! after a wonderful thanksgiving day with my friends , i 've spent the last two days cleaning and reorganizing my house this is not normal for me ! but thank god i finally got a burr in my saddle and got going the biggest accomplishment was getting my basement re stocked i had to empty it out in order for the renovation to begin last spring unfortunately , that meant i had to fill up my garage with all the of the basement stuff i 've not been able to use my garage since last spring with the snow beginning to fly , emptying my garage had taken on new urgency and so i tackled it finally ! it 's amazing what you can do when you live alone i was certain emptying my garage and carrying heavy things back into the basement was a two person job it was n't by the time i had finished doing what i could do , i only had three things for which i needed a hand my friend bill obliged , and we took care of the remaining heavy items one funny note about this whole process i 've been toting around an extremely heavy , non operable treadmill for the past years it needed a new motor , but i never bothered to get one finally , with the help of bill and his daughter , we got the damn thing out of my house and to the curb i put a free sign on it , noting of course that it needed a new motor it sat there overnight , so yesterday i called my garbage company and scheduled a monday pick up five minutes later i looked outside , and it was gone ! thank you ! i hope whomever took it puts it to good use speaking of treadmills , i had to do my mile tempo run indoors on thursday i hated it , but it was just too damn cold it was almost as cold yesterday for my final long run before dallas , but i went outdoors anyway i stayed in the woods and let puck run free it 's so much easier to run when i can focus on him and his happiness plus , he can run so much further when he 's off leash we did miles together before i dropped him at home and finished alone i only had to do miles , and the sun was shining , so that was nice dallas is seven days away ! well i'm off to church i'm sampling a new venue i need a little more spirituality than my current church provides then it 's off to the pool for a nice recovery swim before i settle in for some afternoon football perhaps i 'll even begin organizing that basement full of stuff if i do , someone better take my temperature , because that would be unusually productive !
