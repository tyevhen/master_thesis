while chinese medicine has a rich tradition in the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological problems , fewer ancient or modern texts are dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of men s problems for example , chinese medicine refers to the uterus in all its classic texts , but no mention is ever made of the prostate the du mai , ren mai and chong mai are said to arise in the lower burner and flow through the uterus but where do they flow through in men ? the classics do not say the present article will discuss the physiology of men s sexual organs , some aspects of pathology and the treatment of the following conditions erectile dysfunction premature ejaculation low sperm count before discussing the treatment of specific conditions , we should look at the channels that affect men s genital system and how the penis , testis , seminal vesicles and prostate fit in chinese medicine chapter of the spiritual axis says the ren and chong mai originate from the lower dan tian literally bao the actual term used by the spiritual axis is bao which is often translated as uterus however , while the term zi bao refers to the uterus , the word bao indicates a structure that is common to both men and women in women , it is the uterus , in men , it is the room of sperm both these structures reside in the lower dan tian and store jing and , as the extraordinary vessels originate from here , they are closely connected to jing the golden mirror of medicine yi zong jin jian , says the du mai arises within the lower abdomen , externally in the abdomen , internally in the bao also called dan tian in both men and women in women it is the uterus , in men it is the room of sperm this classic text therefore states clearly that bao is a structure common to men and women , in the former corresponding to the room of sperm or room of jing and the latter to the uterus the room of sperm is in the lower abdomen but we know that the sperm is made in the testicles , seminal vesicles and prostate i think it is therefore legitimate to assume that the prostate is a structure that is equivalent to the uterus in women and that therefore the du mai , ren mai and chong mai flow through the prostate channels influencing men s genitalia the genitals are related primarily to the liver and kidney channels and to the ren , chong and du mai the liver luo channel , loops around the genitalia while the influence of the ren mai on the genitalia is obvious , that of the du mai vessel is often overlooked the su wen chapter describes an anterior branch of the du mai vessel that flows to the external genitalia both in men and women , and to the pubic bone and from here ascends up the abdomen on the same trajectory as the ren mai the branch of the du mai going to the penis in men and vagina in women has clinical significance because it means we can use the du mai rather than the ren mai for genital problems in both men and women we would want to do that when there is a pronounced kidney yang deficiency the pathways of the channels flowing through the genitalia are as follows a branch of the du mai flows down to the genitalia the kidney main , luo and muscle channels flow through the genitalia the liver main , luo , divergent and muscle channels wrap around the genitalia male pathology i would like to discuss two pathological conditions of the male genital aasystem i e phlegm and stasis of jing male genital manifestations of phlegm prostatic hypertrophy peyronie s disease priapism erectile dysfunction sweaty genitals male genital manifestations of stasis of jing although it may seem strange to talk of stasis of jing , it does occur in men and it is basically men s equivalent of stasis of blood in the uterus in women the clinical manifestations of stasis of jing are stabbing pain lumbar region pain in perineum hypogastric pain pain in testis and or penis erectile dysfunction premature ejaculation priapism prostatic hypertrophy premature greying of hair itching or pain pubic region abnormal sperm peyronie s disease purple tongue choppy or firm pulse the role of the heart in the male genital system the menstrual and sexual function in women and the sexual function in men rely on the coordination and harmony between kidneys and heart the water of the kidneys and the fire of the heart need to nourish each other while the kidney jing is the origin of sperm in men and menstrual blood ova in women , the heart plays an important role in erection and sexual arousal in particular , in men , the heart plays a crucial role in erection , orgasm and ejaculation just as the discharge of blood at menstruation and the release of the eggs at ovulation depend on the descending of heart qi , erection and ejaculation also depend on the descending of heart qi to perform these functions , heart qi descends to communicate with kidney qi kidney water needs to ascend towards the heart and heart fire the physiological emperor fire needs to descend towards the kidneys the coordination between the descending of heart fire and ascending of kidney water ensures a normal menstruation and ovulation in women and normal sexual function in both men and women the ascending of the kidneys and descending of the heart in the menstrual and sexual sphere is also ensured by the communication between the du mai and the ren mai in fact , both these extraordinary vessels originate from the space between the kidneys , both flow through the uterus in men through the prostate and both flow through the heart the du mai and ren mai form like a closed circuit and may be looked upon as one channel , one yang , the other yin the du mai represents the kidney yang and the ren mai the kidney yin in the fluctuation of yin and yang during the menstrual cycle the proper communication between heart and kidneys and between the du and ren mai ensures a normal menstruation ovulation and normal sexual function in both men and women with regard to sexual function , during sexual excitation the minister fire within the kidneys is aroused and flows up towards the pericardium and heart for this reason the person becomes flushed in the face the complexion is a manifestation of the heart and the heart rate increases during sexual excitation with orgasm and ejaculation , there is a downward movement of qi which releases the accumulated minister fire downwards in order for this to occur normally the downward movement of heart qi is crucial a normal sexual desire , arousal , erection and orgasm therefore relies on three main factors the ascending of kidney water and descending of heart fire the communication between kidneys and heart the connection between du and ren mai if the minister fire within the kidneys is deficient there will be a decreased libido in both men and women and an inability to reach an orgasm in women and impotence in men if heart qi and heart blood are deficient or not descending to communicate with the kidneys , there may be impotence or premature ejaculation in men and inability to reach an orgasm in women even in the presence of sexual arousal the discussion on blood written in by tang zong hai says fire is yang and generates blood which is yin on the other hand , blood nourishes fire and makes sure that fire does not flare up , whilst blood moistens the lower burner it is stored in the liver , it fills the sea of blood and the chong , ren and dai mai , and it warms and nourishes the whole body when blood moistens the lower burner and the sea of blood , and heart fire follows it down to the umbilicus , then blood is flourishing and fire does not flare excessively , so that men are free of disease and women are fertile from this passage it is apparent that the heart qi and heart blood need to flow downwards to the lower burner to interact with blood and jing erectile dysfunction factors affecting erection du mai kidney yang minister fire fire of ming men blood heart blood chong mai in four ways
