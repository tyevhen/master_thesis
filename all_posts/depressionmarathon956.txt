feeling less fatigue having a lighter mood handling stress more efficiently feeling less distracted questioning life 's meaning less it 's strange this better place how did i get here ? july , despite the sun , was so long and so dark it had no clear beginning it felt like it would never end it was no different than so many months before august dawned and brought new light though the days grew shorter and darker , my mood rose above nothing new or different that i recall doing , except those darn schedules they were new and different a running plan , a plan not to gorge on chocolate , keeping track of what i ate and if i exercised or not assignments from my psychologist in hopes of getting me back on track could that be it ? could schedules , combined with med changes and a supplement addition be the difference ? i hope so it 's better to have a reason for the mood change than to have it change for no reason at all that 's usually how it 's happened in the past no reason up and down with no particular cause and therefore no way to make it end this is different did i finally effect change by my actions alone ? or is it , as they say on law and order , circumstantial evidence at best ? i guess i 'll never know and that 's okay i'm okay with continuing what i'm doing circumstantial evidence works for me i 'd kinda like to get used to this new , strange place better it is a strange place to be , but i like it i like it a lot
