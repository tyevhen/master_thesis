hi friends ! thanks so much for all your encouraging comments on my last post ! i'm feeling much better and yesterday was a good day , which helped a good friend of mine sent me one of those emails about mothering an essay by anna quindlen it was so beautifully written and really touched my heart this section of the essay really sums up what i want to do with this blog and how i feel about having a child but the biggest mistake i made is the one that most of us make while doing this i did not live in the moment enough this is particularly clear now that the moment is gone , captured only in photographs there is one picture of the three of them , sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day , ages , and and i wish i could remember what we ate , and what we talked about , and how they sounded , and how they looked when they slept that night i wish i had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing dinner , bath , book , bed i wish i had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less even today i m not sure what worked and what didn t , what was me and what was simply life when they were very small , i suppose i thought someday they would become who they were because of what i d done now i suspect they simply grew into their true selves because they demanded in a thousand ways that i back off and let them be the books said to be relaxed and i was often tense , matter of fact and i was sometimes over the top i really want to treasure the doing more than the getting it done even when things are hard or i really want to be under the warm covers , i try to let myself be in the moment with paige and really experience it rather than let my brain wish the time away or wander off to the next task just begging for the end of the day this blog is a great way to document those moments and i hope to continue doing so as she grows ! happy memorial day to all ! save
