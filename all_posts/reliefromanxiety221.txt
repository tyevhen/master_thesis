i know we 've still got a few weeks to go until the end of december and the beginning of , but because it 's going to be a busy time of celebration , now seems like a good option to reflect on the past year this time last year , it was and the end of what i regard as the best year of my life so far the end of however , was a bit harder as my anxiety slowly began to creep in more and more arrived and as many of you may have read , i had a breakdown in january where i 've had to rebuild my life from the very beginning blood tests and mostly doctors appointments have been main parts of my life this year and almost twelve months later , it has brought me here thinking about this makes me feel sick to my stomach of frustration and sadness over how much i 've missed in the past year or so it 's safe to it 's been one hell of year in more ways than one on the plus side , even though this year has been a struggle , i have had a few good moments and it 's important to remember these amongst a few highlights are my as level results and university offers at the beginning of the year , when i could n't face school , many people said that i would n't do so well at school due my lack of attendance but , i was so determined i was not going to fail and i was not going to give in the determination to succeed was so huge and the crippling anxiety was just what encouraged me further i was not going to let my anxiety defeat me , even though i have had many moments in this year where i 've thought the only way to survive , was to quit school i spent many months revising and teaching myself in preparation for the exams , and i surprised myself and many others as a result i 've also learnt about myself more than ever this year and it 's helped me to understand more about the philosophy of the world if this is to teach you and i anything , it is that if you work hard you can reap the rewards and have faith in yourself that you can achieve in terms of my family , friends and teachers these are the people i am incredibly grateful for without them , i have no clue where i 'd be now they 've kept me going they have been so supportive it sounds very cliche , but this year has shown me who my true friends are and i cherish them remember , talking is the most important thing you can do to get on the road to recovery i ca n't thank everyone enough i hope these people realise how important they are to me ! looking back , i know this has been an extremely hard year because of not having the ability do what i love and this is something i'm still battling , so that one day i can live a full life it 's true to say that many will only understand if you 've experienced it there have been many times when i could 've given up , but i managed to hold onto the knowledge that i will get through this and that there are better things to come i know there are times when you can feel as one of my teachers put it just holding on , but you can do it and you will get there how was your year in review ? let me know ! merry christmas ! or as it is said in german froehliche weihnachten ! , amy x
