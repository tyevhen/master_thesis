it 's a bird it 's a plane no , it 's an elliptigo ! i am excited after years of yearning , and months of searching , i am now the proud owner of an elliptigo it 's my new training tool an elliptigo is basically an elliptical bike as you can see in the photos , i stand on the pedals and pedal in an elliptical motion that closely resembles running but without the impact i heard about the elliptigo several years ago and immediately wanted one unfortunately , they were way out of my price range as a result of my ongoing achilles injury , i decided several months ago i wanted to pursue purchasing a used elliptigo unfortunately , there are very , very few used elliptigos on the market and most were still out of my price range finally , after months of searching across the country , i found one in colorado the woman selling it was very generous we negotiated a fair price , and she agreed to have it disassembled and shipped to me now i'm the happy owner i'm still getting used to my new training partner , but i 've already ridden it several times i get very strange looks from everyone i pass while riding it not sure i like that , but it 's to be expected it 's not something one sees every day riding the elliptigo is fun , and it 's a great workout ! it works my legs like running , but i also get a good core and even arm workout while riding it i generally average just under minutes per mile on my rides i only wish i could run that fast , even for a mile ! i 'll keep dreaming once i'm back to training , i'm really hopeful riding the elliptigo will allow me to log more weekly miles than i 'd otherwise be able to safely log on my recovering achilles i may use it on my easy days instead of running we 'll see how it all works out , but i'm excited to add it to my training routine i feel like i'm taking another step in the process of getting back on the roads , and i'm really grateful for that
