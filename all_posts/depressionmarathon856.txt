it 's a gray , wet , wet day today actually , this is day two of gray and wet the snow in my front yard has dwindled from several feet to just inches unfortunately , that brings all of puck 's winter work to the surface ugh ! i 've got a lot of cleaning up to do out there gray is not great for the mood , but i'm still doing well i saw my doc today it was nice to be able to laugh with her rather than cry i hope this continues for awhile , but i 'll keep taking it one day at a time tomorrow is the big day for my interview i spoke with my former co worker , who now works for the potential new company , today she was helpful she explained some of the job expectations and suggested questions to ask during my interview it 's always helpful to have some inside insight wish me luck tomorrow as for the triathlon training , this week continues to be somewhat overwhelming , but i'm keeping up yesterday was tough at am we began with a minute spinning class as soon as we jumped off our bikes , we ran hard for minutes it was challenging after working hours , i returned to the gym for the strength and ab circuits like i said , it was challenging today 's workout was a yard swim interval later , i 'll bike for minutes my legs are really tired and a little sore the pool was probably good for them despite the lengthy interval workout the next three days i 'll be running a lot , biking , and doing one more strength circuit to finish out the week even though it 's difficult , i am enjoying the challenge of this program , and i'm pretty proud of myself for keeping up well , laundry calls i 'll let you know how the interview goes
