the fda evaluates studies on medications and deems them safe enough to justify use they also determine the indications for using any particular medicine , and once that 's done , physicians will often use a medication 'off label ' that means that medicine a was found to be safe or relatively safe , because even over the counter meds can be fatal for the wrong person at the wrong time , and it works better than a placebo at treating disease a , but some studies have found it useful for disease b , but the fda has n't gotten to approving it for this yet , and perhaps never will , but docs use it for disease b anyway this is very common with the ssri 's , where one has been approved for a condition , but maybe the patient is n't tolerating that one so well , so the doc uses another ssri with a different side effect profile , even though that particular med has not been approved for that particular condition just an fyi , the ssri 's are prozac zoloft paxil luvox celexa lexapro so the fda says inhaled marijuana as opposed to marinol , a pill form of cannabis has no medical uses and the discussion is ended it ca n't really be studied at this point , because it has no medical value so your local university ca n't grow or get any weed and do studies on it , because it has no medical value and the federal government says it 's illegal i do believe that with states disagreeing , that perhaps the fda should reconsider this stance and repeat a study or two on inhaled cannabis for nausea induced by chemotherapy or anorexia in aids so that medical marijuana can be studied , monitored , grown in a pure regulated way , prescribed for a known and proven condition with some parameters like other medical interventions day supply , directions on how much and how often to smoke it ah , the pharmacy could roll for you , reassessment so that if your doc decides to give it to you off label for your low back pain , and that pain is so much better but funny , you 've stopped working , you lie on the couch all day playing grand theft auto , and your life has virtually stopped , the doc can say , glad it 's helped your pain , but it 's put you into an apathetic , amotivational state and your life has now gone down the toilet , i'm stopping this so you can go back to work and pay the mortgage and feed those hungry children or for us shrinks , funny , but you did n't have schizophrenia until you started smoking this stuff , let 's stop it obviously , if the person has become addicted and yes , you can get addicted to weed , they 'll get it illegally , but the same is true of benzos or opiates , and really medical marijuana just ca n't be any worse then the fiasco we 've had in this country with oxycontin , especially when it gets mixed with a bit of also legal xanax and also legal vodka , and i can give you a long list of names of people who can no longer testify to this , famous and otherwise so for the moment , the demand for legalized medical marijuana is left in the hands of our legislators who better to determine medical indication , necessity , length of treatment , and methods of monitoring in maryland , there was a study group led by the state 's health secretary , joshua sharfstein the plan called for going slow , required training of docs to prescribe it , and required that it be distributed through academic centers two legislators who are pushing bills to legalize medical marijuana called it misguided and heartless delegate glenn of maryland has proposed house bill , a medical marijuana act it provides that marijuana could be used for a variety of conditions they include debilitating medical condition means i a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment that produces one or more of the following cachexia or wasting syndrome severe , debilitating , or chronic pain severe nausea seizures , including those characteristic of epilepsy severe and persistent muscle spasms , including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis or crohn s disease agitation of alzheimer s disease anxiety or depression or virus hiv debilitating medical condition includes i cancer ii glaucoma iii positive status for human immunodeficiency iv acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids v hepatitis c vi amyotrophic lateral sclerosis vii nail patella viii post traumatic stress disorder ix bipolar disorder or x the treatment of any of the above listed conditions on the positive side , the law does require that compassion centers to either grow or distribute marijuana be at least feet from pre existing schools because children ca n't walk feet ? i'm told this bill wo n't pass , but another one , with out the listed psychiatric indications for the use of medical marijuana , may well pass i might be more pro mmj if the stats did n't reveal that of recipients in colorado have cancer and aids , and that many people are prescribed marijuana by non psychiatrists for psychiatric reasons , including insomnia and if medical marijuana was distributed by a pharmacy with directions on how much and how often to use it the one year toke your heart out cards with the boutique flavors all as part of wellness do n't fly so well with me if people want marijuana to be legal , then legalize it , but this type of legislation puts physicians in the middle as an agent really , if we were talking about people smoking a little during their cancer treatments , this just would n't be the issue that it is okay , so my questions for you a person gets medical marijuana for back pain or anxiety or whatever he gets arrested should it be continued in jail ? prison not be such a bad experience if you get to be high the whole time ? shrink rap readers do n't really like uninformed consent with meds how do we feel about giving it to agitated alzheimers patients and how would that work ? can you smoke in nursing homes ? do they have to taken outside in restraints ? agitation is not usually associated with early alzheimers do we think it 's just a little weird that a state legislator is making laws listing which medical indications a drug should be used for ? i must have missed those lectures in residency where pot is the treatment for depression , etc can legislators also decide that methotrexate should be legal for the flu ? i sort of do n't get it okay , my rant for the day
