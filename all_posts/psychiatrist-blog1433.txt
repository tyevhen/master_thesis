this will be quick i'm actually headed off to work in his in practice blog , peter kramer discusses the issue of whether the concept of a chemical imbalance is still a useful one and he looks at the evidence for and against such a theory , concluding that the concept met a premature death since , other biochemical contributors to depression have claimed their roles , especially stress hormones and factors that influence nerve cell growth the new overarching biological model of depression i outline it in against depression integrates all three factors monoamines , stress , and cell growth but serotonin dysregulation remains very much on the table as a contributor to depression dr kramer talks about pet scans and genes and differential rates of monoamine metabolism , and the stupid little bouncing zoloft mascot with the smiley face for the shrink in the field , so far it does n't mean much i ca n't order a test to find out if someone has too much of one enzyme breaking down any given neurotransmitter and thereby telling me what to prescribe i'm waiting in the meantime , what i do have is patients who come in wanting to know what they have do i have a chemical imbalance ? now what does that even mean ? do you have too much serotonin in some places in your brain and not enough in others ? how would i know that ? too much compared to what ? monamine oxidase breaking down your noradrenergic neurotransmitters ? should we inhibit them and this will make you better ? let me get my probe what i do know is that while i do n't know what is meant by a chemical imbalance , my patients do for them it is a term that explains things , that writes the story , that has meaning there 's something socially acceptable about it i have poor coping skills is pejorative and equally unprovable i have a chemical imbalance is somehow explanatory , though still unprovable in a day by day psychiatric practice so , generally , if a patient with major depression asks , do i have a chemical imbalance ? i simply say yes it seems to work
