in yesterday 's post , i showed how to render an image into an html canvas element and then operate on it with canvas api calls when you 've made changes to a canvas image , the time may come when you want to save the canvas as a regular png image as it turns out , doing that is n't hard at all the key is to use canvas todataurl'image png' to serialize the image as a data uri , which you can of course open in a new window with window open uri once the image is open in a new window note you may have to instruct your browser to allow popups , you can right click on the image to get the browser 's save image as command in a context menu from there , you just save the image as you normally would the following code can be added to yesterday 's example in order to create a button on the page called open as png function createpngbutton var button document createelement input button setattribute type , button button setattribute value , open as png button setattribute onclick , window opencanvas todataurl'image png' document body appendchild button as you can see , there 's no rocket science involved just a little html magic
