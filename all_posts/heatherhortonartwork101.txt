wisdom is not a product of schooling but the lifelong attempt to acquire it albert einstein wyll , wisdom , oil on panel , x is another one of those paintings that came together in an instant i knew i was going to shoot reference of wyll , but that little old man just happened to be there , and that spun the feel of the composition around entirely we all know people in our lives that we feel are old souls friends that seem to have a quiet and unquestioned knowledge about the universe that we are just skimming the surface of wyll is such a friend , and has always been so we have known one another for a long time years , longer than half of my life yet the accumulated wisdom that she holds within her seems to surpass her years frequently when i travel to toronto to meet wyll we have dinner or lunch at fresh i have painted wyll twice now at different locations of this great vegan restaurant i like the warm palette of interior colours , the food , the service and most of all , the chance to spend time with my longtime friend on this occasion a little , older gentleman was in the middle of enjoying his meal when i took out my point and shoot to point and shoot , as it were i liked the obvious juxtaposition of young and old , but there was another connection that went even deeper this painting challenged me to re examine what it means to be wise , and that age does not necessarily determine an accumulation of knowledge granted , i do not know this gentleman , but here he is symbolic rather than literal i loved how their posture differed , their mind on different things surely and i was pleased to capture this brief moment in the painting technically this painting has a lot of little elements to it i tried to keep the background relatively loosely painted despite its complexity as you probably know by now i go insane with huge amounts of detail spread over the entirety of a canvas , but prefer to concentrate on smaller , selected areas of higher resolution personally , i like to be able to let my eye breathe when i look at a painting , and not be aware that every square inch has been rendered to within an inch of its life this tires the eye , and , while technically very well done , exhausts me it is good to have movement with broader strokes , a more expressive approach at least , this is what i strive for within my own work i take pleasure in the knowledge that my friendship with wyll has been chronicled by about five paintings over the years it is a little road map of our history as kindred spirits a pictorial record of a connection that will last the rest of our lives , of that i have no doubt have a beautiful day , wherever you are the winds of change are always blowing and every time i try to stay the winds of change continue blowing and they just carry me away willie nelson here is some information on the exhibition in november of i hope to see you there ! newfoundland portraits november nd , abbozzo gallery , oakville , ontario opening reception november th , pm
