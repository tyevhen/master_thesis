the guardian recently published this story about a longitudinal harvard study of , female coffee drinkers followed over ten years they found that there was a lower risk of clinical depression in the women who drank four or more cups of coffee a day compared to non drinkers this is consistent with a previous study of , female nurses followed over ten years , where they found that the relative risk of suicide was reduced even for moderate to low coffee drinkers , defined as drinking two or three cups per day this is good news for me since i usually start my day with a half a pot before i get to work yes , that much , really no wonder dinah sent me a link to this story and said , you 've gotta blog about this the trick is , there may be a ceiling effect to all this once you get to eight or more cups a day this risk of suicide starts to increase again according to one study somewhat gratuitously , the guardian article threw in reference to our druggy society and faulted the researchers for not considering other factors like social supports , involvement in religious groups or community activities , and even whether the women were drinking coffee alone or with friends as the scientists will also tell you , neurotransmitters respond to everything hugs , kisses , conversation , books , pictures , gardening , hunger , worry , rows , war all raise or lower chemical levels ah yes , clinical depression and suicide must be the result of not getting enough hugs or the fact that you have n't taken up gardening cringe worthy health reporting , at its best the reporter concludes supposedly scientific comments of this sort serve little purpose except to coax women into a state the doctors can then medicate amazing a simple study about caffeine and depression has somehow been morphed into another nefarous plot by evil dr pillshrink
