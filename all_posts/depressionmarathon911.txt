wow it 's the end of november already kind of a big month for me had that little marathon deal a few weeks ago that turned out okay , i guess ha ! briefly had a plan to run another one next month , but now trying to cope with not running while i heal from injury i think the rest and cross training are helping my leg yesterday i lifted weights and spent minutes on the elliptical god bless those of you who do those machines on a regular basis ! i do n't know how you do it ! i thought swimming was boring ! even with a tv right in front of my face , i ca n't stand doing the same thing in the same place over and over again but i did it like i said , i'm trying to cope with not running i 'll be back in the pool tomorrow puck 's trying to cope with me not running , too he 's not any happier with our minute walks than i am plus he 's got all sorts of excess energy i ca n't sit still for one minute without him bringing me one of his toys he 's used to miles a week , too half hour walks are a pretty significant drop in activity hopefully , he wo n't have to wait much longer to run with mom again on another totally unrelated note , i'm stressed about having to confront one of my assistants at work she 's been making some questionable treatment decisions lately unfortunately , she 's also very defensive so rather than allowing for a learning experience , which is what i 'd prefer , she will likely defend her decisions to the bitter end and fail to hear any constructive feedback i'm afraid it 's going to be a totally useless and unpleasant interaction it 's too bad here 's hoping december brings healing , happiness , and joy for one and all
