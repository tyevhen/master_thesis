couturier reviewed rtms for major depression via a meta analysis , which was published in link to her study here here s a quote results six studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the meta analysis two of these reported a significantly greater improvement in mood symptoms in the treatment versus the sham group when combined in the meta analysis , the overall weighted mean difference was on the ham d confidence interval to , and the results of a test for heterogeneity were not significant , p conclusions this meta analysis suggests that rapid rate rtms is no different from sham treatment in major depression however , the power within these studies to detect a difference was generally low randomized controlled trials with sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference are required there were some legitimate criticisms of her method , which you can read here along with her reply couturier s reply seems to have addressed the criticisms aptly since that time , two studies have shown greater efficacy for rtms over sham therapy here and here to my knowledge , there has not been a meta analysis that has accounted for these new studies the effects seemed reasonably large , though i ve only read the abstracts at this point so what s the story with rtms ? it s pretty murky fda may approve it because it seems to have two studies showing efficacy yet there are a fair number of studies showing no efficacy all told , it is going to be one controversial decision that i look forward to discussing more as it develops i'm certain the folks at neuronetics are crossing their fingers !
