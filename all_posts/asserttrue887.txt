the common perception ignorance of the crowd is that javascript is slow what i'm constantly finding , however , is that people will hand craft a javascript loop to do , say , string parsing , when they could and should be using the language 's built in string methods which always run fast example you need a trim function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from user entered text in a form if you go out on the web and look at what people are doing in their scripts , you see a lot of things like function trim str var whitespace ' n r t f xb xa u u u u u u u u u u ua ub u u u' for var i i str length i if whitespace indexofstr charati str str substringi break for i str length i i if whitespace indexofstr charati str str substring , i break return whitespace indexofstr charat ? str '' i took this code verbatim from a web page in which the author of it claims ironically that it 's an incredibly fast routine ! compare with function trima return a replace , replace , in testing , i found the shorter routine faster by on very small strings with very few leading or trailing spaces , and faster by or more on strings of length with ten to twenty leading or trailing spaces the better performance of the shorter function has nothing to do with it being shorter , of course it has everything to do with the fact that the built in javascript replace method on the string pseudoclass is implemented in c and runs at compiled c speed this is an important point interpreters are written in c spidermonkey or java rhino the built in functions of the ecmascript language are implemented in c in your browser harness that power ! use the built in functions of the language never hand parse strings with indexof inside for loops etc when you can use native methods that run at compiled speed why walk if you can ride the bullet train ? the implications here for client server web app design are quite far reaching if you are using server side javascript , and your server runtimes are java based , it means your server side scripts are running asymptotically , at least at java speed well written client side javascript runs asymptotically at c speed therefore , any script logic you can move to the client should be moved there it 's madness to waste precious server cycles madness , i say
