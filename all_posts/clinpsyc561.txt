i just saw a brief headline that corcept therapeutics announces mln private equity financing co announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement with certain accredited investors for the private placement of mln shares of its common stock at a price of per share pursuant to the agreement , the investors , who are led by paperboy ventures , have irrevocably committed to purchase the shares there are only three logical explanations these people are looking for a tax write off when corcept collapses due to the poor performance of its corlux mifepristone ru product in treating psychotic depression when the fda determined the drug is not approvable , they ll drop a tax bracket or two these investors have been snowed by someone they do n't know what they 're doing they have n't read posts such as this , this , and this they do n't know that the efficacy of corlux is nothing to write home about , as it appears to help little with depression and not particularly greatly with psychotic symptoms either they know something that i do n't maybe the fda , circa vagus nerve stimulation , is going to approve corlux regardless of its actual efficacy
