i'm trying not to panic things have been going so well physically my knee has been feeling really good i 've not noticed it at all with any of my runs the only time i 've even been reminded of my surgically repaired knee has been with squats and lunges during strength training and therein lies the problem apparently i attended my favorite strength training class yesterday afternoon i so enjoy working my muscles and strengthening my body a strong body makes my running so much easier lunging and squatting during yesterday 's class was exactly what i was doing when my right knee began bugging me a bit i , of course , worked through it it did n't feel critical just soreness , i thought i thought wrong the minute class ended i stood around for a few minutes chatting with the instructor and then made my way to the locker room my knee felt odd and sore after getting changed i began walking to my car and bam ! suddenly i could barely walk pain shot through my knee i had to walk on my tip toes to make it to my car i was totally freaked out ! by the time i got home , the knee felt a little better it was sore , but i could walk i was determined to walk it off , or perhaps i was just being stupid , so i took puck for his usual mile walk i iced it off and on for the rest of the evening i said a lot of prayers that it would be better by this morning it 's not i'm afraid my medial meniscus might be torn i 've e mailed my orthopedic surgeon , and i will call for an appointment as soon as his office opens , but i'm so , so disappointed ! i 've been doing so well i 've been sticking to and following every planned workout , whether i felt like doing it or not my running has been slowly getting back to normal i 've been cautiously optimistic about actually being able to run the boston marathon rather than walking the majority of it i 've been through so much to get here , and now this ? ? why ? dammit ! dammit ! i pray it 's just a temporary set back please pray with me and i 'll try not to panic
