for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god romans in the previous clinical tip i discussed sadness and grief deriving from loss as a pervasive emotion in western patients in this clinical tip , i discuss another common emotional cause of disease in western patients , i e guilt guilt is a pervasive emotion in western patients it is completely missing from chinese medicine books and one could say that it simply does not exist in the chinese psyche it could be argued that guilt is intrinsically related to the judeo christian religions and especially the christian religion with its concept of original sin i have never seen expressions referring to feeling of guilt as an emotional cause of disease in modern or old chinese books it could be argued that this is due to the fact that a feeling of guilt is more or less absent in eastern societies in fact , the concept of guilt is totally absent in all three major chinese religions philosophies of confucianism , daoism and buddhism indeed , confucius did not even believe in the value of punishment for crimes fingarette concurs that the concept of guilt is absent in the analects of confucius the analects do mention the word chi in several passages but this is shame rather than guilt fingarette says if we are unaware of the crucial differences in perspective , these texts on chi lend themselves easily to the assimilation of confucian shame with western guilt although chi is definitely a moral concept , the moral relation to which it corresponds is that of the person to his status and role as defined by li rituals chi looks outward , not inward it is not , as is guilt , a matter of the inward state , of repugnance at inner corruption , of self denigration , of the sense that one is as a person , and independently of one s public status and repute , mean or reprehensible the confucian concept of shame is a genuinely moral concept , but it is oriented to morality as centering in li , traditionally ceremonially defined social comportament behaviour , rather than to an inner core of one s being it should be stressed that what concerns us here in dealing with emotions , is not guilt but the feeling of guilt which is totally unrelated to an actual crime or transgression for example , a person may have committed a crime but feel no guilt at all conversely , a person may have committed no crime or transgression but feel guilty which is usually the case in our patients guilt and shame are considered by some to be moral emotions as they bear upon morality wollheim says the role of the moral emotions is to provide the person with an attitude , or orientation what is distinctive of the moral emotions is that the attitude is reflexive it is an attitude that the person has towards himself herself as a person guilt is strongly linked to a sense of self and specifically to a negative sense of self this is probably an important reason for the absence of guilt in chinese culture as the self in chinese culture is not the individualized , inward looking , psychological self of western culture , but a socially constructed self this may also account for the presence of shame in chinese culture related to a social sense of self and the absence of guilt related to an individual self guilt can manifest in many different ways , e g feeling of responsibility for negative circumstances that have befallen oneself or others feeling of regret for real or imagined misdeeds , both past and present feeling responsible and guilty for any negative thing that occurs to members of one s family or one s partner taking responsibility for someone else s misfortune or problem the above are only a few examples of the sort of behaviour induced by feelings of guilt a feeling of guilt may be due to the transgression of social or religious taboos or from having done something wrong which is later regretted however , a feeling of guilt may also be innate and not related to any specific action this innate feeling of guilt derives often from upbringing this latter feeling is indeed the most destructive one guilt is self reproach for some actual misdeeds or an in born feeling of guilt totally disconnected from any misdeeds guilt includes a sense of inadequacy and despair not found in shame guilt does not require any particular offence and the doctrine of original sin is an example of this when assailed by a feeling of guilt , a person is one s own judge and a more ruthless and less reasonable judge than any real judge guilt is inwardly directed and its object is the self in this sense , it is almost the opposite emotion to that of anger as this latter emotion is usually directed at another person guilt is based on a moral criteria of having broken a law of morality real or imagined the mythology of guilt is the doctrine of the original sin the authority providing the criteria is absolute and unquestionable guilt is a dark emotion with no redemption it is a much darker emotion than shame and in my experience , more difficult to treat if that is the right word as for disharmonies induced by guilt , this emotion can have different effects in different people first of all , it may lead to qi stagnation it affects any organ and especially the lungs , heart , liver and kidneys due to its dark , stagnating character , the qi stagnation may cause blood stasis easily this blood stasis may be in any part of the body and any organ but particularly in the lungs , heart , liver and kidneys the pulse is wiry or firm under certain conditions , guilt may also cause sinking of qi and affects the kidneys causing some urinary problems or menstrual problems from sinking of qi the tongue has a red tip and possibly purple body when guilt is the emotional cause of disease , the pulse is wiry or firm if there is qi and blood stagnation if there is sinking of qi of the kidneys , the pulse is deep and weak on the kidney positions , possibly slightly overflowing on the heart position and choppy in general without wave how does one treat guilt ? it is possibly the most difficult to treat it is a dark and deep seated emotion and that is probably why it easily gives rise to blood stasis i generally choose the points depending on the patterns induced by guilt i generally treat the heart , lungs , liver and kidneys some examples of points used would be he shenmen , p daling , lu lieque , lu tianfu , liv taichong , ki dazhong , ki zhubin , g b benshen , du shenting of course , possibly with guilt more than any other emotion , a true healing cannot take
