written by cindy boersma in her high school years i sit alone on the back of a river longing to see your face i peer through the warm heavy fog across the deep murky waters and strain my eyes to the far shore was that you ? i call out your name but you do not hear the ruthless wind has whisked my pleading words away i try again but it 's no use are you looking and calling too ? at my post on the bank of the river i hope for the fog to clear friends come along and stop by my side with confidence they point your way i think i see a shadow of you is it enough to hold on to ? i want to see you so i keep trying , seeking , calling , and crying until exhaustion takes its tole from a fretful sleep i raise my head the fog is rising over the water will i be able to see ? just a cool mist remains over the river running by without hesitation i jump to my feet i search the far shore until my longing eyes rest on your face were you there the whole time ? we reach toward each other but find the distance still remains i search your face for meaning for something to grasp for some hope to calm my fears are you searching too ? do you know that i long to be with you again ? can you understand my pain ? can you sense my fears ? or from such a distance can you tell the mist from the tears ? can you tell the mist from the tears ?
