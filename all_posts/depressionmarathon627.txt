i'm afraid my body is against me my right knee has been steadily improving it has improved so much , in fact , that i was able to run on it today i did a one mile lap with puck to warm up , and that went really well after dropping puck at home , i set out again i was just settling into my relaxed pace when i felt a tug and then burning in my left calf i knew immediately it stopped me in my tracks i pulled my left calf muscle again my body , apparently , is revolting i'm so frustrated i was only two miles into my run when this happened i do n't know what to think i 've been working hard and doing the right things , but to no avail i guess i 'll make a massage appointment my massage therapist fixed my calf in august maybe she can work her magic again the twin cities marathon is looking more doubtful every day oh well , maybe this is god 's way of telling me to rest if so , i do n't like the message !
