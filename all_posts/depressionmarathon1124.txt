warning if vulgar language makes you blush , or you do n't approve of a lady who swears , tough shit ! you may choose to discontinue reading now just came from seeing my doc i saw her two days earlier than planned secondary to the lovely thoughts i 've been having lately i do n't want to get into the gory details , and trust me they are gory , but i did ask my doc , why ? why do i have these fucked up thoughts ? they make me feel fucked up they are disgusting , shameful , and distressing they make me feel like a bad person brain normal people do n't think like this ! me oh shut the fuck up ! after noting that my deteriorating language might be a sign of how poorly i'm feeling , my doc noted that these thoughts are not new for me when i 've felt poorly in the past , she reminded me , my thoughts have been similarly distressing intrusive thoughts have been part of my personal symptoms i guess she 's correct , after all she has notes while i have only my swiss cheese memory on which to rely however , i remember a time when depression , for me , meant sadness , despair , hopelessness you know , all the typical , well known qualities we love about this fabulous condition but , she 's right , over the past couple years it seems my distorted thinking has been a reliably clear indicator of the deteriorating condition of my fucked up condition i 've written previously about the diagnosis criteria for depression it includes all of the expected language regarding sadness , loss of interest , and lack of pleasure however , upon inspection you 'll notice these criteria lack any mention of fucked up thinking nevertheless , depression can rule a person 's thinking for whatever reason , i am one of the unfortunate souls who can attest to this fact and right now , it 's really pissing me off ! these thoughts are sucking the life out of me i hate them i do n't understand where they come from i do n't understand why they occur my scientific brain wants to know the inner workings of my fucked up brain why does my fucked up brain hurl these bloody daggers from unconsciousness into the dark light of my consciousness ? how does that happen ? what is the reason ? there must be a reason ! figuring out the reason would surely blunt the intrusion , would n't it ? no , of course it would n't the intrusive thoughts are not so simply quelled i know that for that reason , sometimes i just need to rant i need to flail angrily at this insane illness which robs my integrity , my sensibility , and my stability for no fucking reason the great tumor of depression is consuming my brain again , and i'm really , really pissed off ! i ca n't slice it out i ca n't radiate it to smithereens i ca n't even touch it ! but i can feel it i know it 's there my only recourse is continuing to move forward , one foot , one moment at a time , stopping occasionally to hold on , regain my balance , and perhaps to scream
