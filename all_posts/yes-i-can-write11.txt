i know , i know , this isn t exactly a post about unschooling and on an unschooling blog no less ! how could i ? but as the year comes to a close , and i look at my list of books i ve read in on goodreads , i wanted to share some of my young adult fantasy favorites why this genre , in particular ? because fantasy aimed at both teens and adults makes up at least of what i read , and because i thought some of you might appreciate some good recent books about young people doing extraordinary things each of the novels that made it onto my list is the latest in a series , so essentially i m reviewing each series rather than each book , and i ve listed the books which came previously and which were not published in in brackets i hope , if you choose to check out any of these books from your local library , that you ll enjoy them as much as i did ! poisoned blade court of fives by kate elliott kate elliott has long been a favorite of mine thanks to her spiritwalker series , so when she made her first foray into the world of ya fiction with court of fives last year , i eagerly snatched it up ! and neither that novel , or this year s follow up , dissapoint our protagonist , jessamy , wants nothing more than to compete in the dangerous and prestigious court of fives , a competitive obstacle course popular with all levels of society an athlete through and through , she doesn t want to have to worry about politics but having been born to and , shockingly , acknowledged by a high ranking patron soldier , member of the ruling class and race , and a commoner mother , a colonized and oppressed racial group in this roman esque empire , for jess her very existence is political , a fact she just can t escape because change is brewing rebellion is simmering amongst a people desperate to hold onto and reclaim their culture deadly political maneuvering is taking place in the highest tiers of power and war is approaching with neighboring countries jess must carefully make her way in this fraught landscape , striving to protect her family and make the right choices when there are no good choices more tightly plotted and faster paced than kate elliott s adult novels , i look forward to the next installment reader discretion some rather disturbing gory violence reference to and threat of sexual abuse violence the murder of children a torch against the night an ember in the ashes by sabaa tahir whereas the above series takes place in a carefully drawn world with distinct cultures , sabaa tahir s world , though similar in some ways to that of the court of fives series , feels like the world is simply sketched in a staged setting where , while a couple of elements might stand out , the majority fades into the background while that might not be something i d usually excuse , i can overlook it in this series because the story itself feels meticulously built tahir isn t flying by the seat of her pants , she knows where this story is going and let me tell you , where it s going is some pretty dark and brutal places ! the viewpoint characters , laia and elias in the second book a third viewpoint is introduced could not come from more different backgrounds laia is born to the scholars , a conquered people now brutally oppressed by the empire , and elias , taken as a child to be trained as a member of the elite soldiers interrogators assassins known as masks , is a bitter and deeply reluctant tool of the empire itself when laia s family is torn apart , she makes the desperate decision to become a slave and spy , and as her and elias paths cross and their lives become tangled together , they both have to find their own kind of strengths , and figure out just what sacrifices they re willing to make and what horrors they re willing to commit in order to survive , save those they love , and try their best to do right this is one of these extremely grim , dark stories with truly horrible things happening pretty much constantly , but which still manages to have hopeful threads throughout the characters and plot both are extremely compelling , and these books have stuck in my head long after i finished reading them i really hope the bright spots are built on in the final novels ? so that the darkness doesn t feel completely overwhelming reader discretion torture of both adults and children , including viewpoint characters murder again , of both adults and children slavery genocide yes , really attempted rape crooked kingdom six of crows by leigh bardugo six of crows sets itself utterly apart by being something i almost never see in fantasy fiction a heist novel , complete with a mastermind criminal who s always thinking several steps ahead of everyone else a sharpshooter with a gambling problem the best spy and thief , and occasional assassin in the city an incredibly dangerous magic user an explosives expert with a secret and an ex soldier and mostly ex zealot who s roped into all of this very much against his will members of an up and coming street gang in the bustling mercantile city of ketterdam , all of them are hand picked by the aforementioned mastermind to travel across the sea in order to steal something of immense value and dangerous political ramifications following their theft and all that comes after it , this series is fast paced , quite dark , often funny , and all around delightful watching the bonds develop and deepen between these characters is a real pleasure , and i hope to see more of them in future novels reader discretion gore , torture , murder , reference to past sexual abuse rape , all involving children and teens a gathering of shadows a darker shade of magic by v e schwab take multiple londons grey london , with no magic red london , steeped in magic white london , vicious and starving and black london , shut off from the others lest it consume them all a rare traveler able to move between worlds and a ruthlessly ambitious cross dressing thief with dreams of becoming a pirate , and you end up with this series forming a slightly uneasy truce , world traveler kell and thief lilah must work together to stop a creepy body stealing being , defeat a desperate sorcerer , discover the true nature and limits of their respective magic , and find their own place in the worlds though the first book started off a bit slow in my opinion , once i got into it , i was hooked i positively adore mean and prickly lilah , and i m pretty darn fond of brooding kell and his beloved and rather dramatic brother rhy who gains a whole lot of greatly appreciated complexity as the series progresses in many ways this is classic fantasy dark sorcerers and evil worlds and the like , but there s so much about it that feels fresh and original , and i very much appreciate v e schwab s distinctive voice reader discretion attempted rape , murder , torture , creepy body stealing being , mind control the raven king the raven boys the dream thieves blue lily , lily blue by maggie stiefvater if i had to pick just one favorite ya novel of , it would be this one i don t think i ve ever seen a more misleading cover jacket description of a first book , which i believe goes something like romance blah blah first love doomed to die blah in actuality , this is a book about relationships romantic ones sometimes , yes , but every bit as important are friendships and familial relationships , in all their incredible complexity , fierceness , devotion , tenderness , jealousy maggie stiefvater is a truly marvelous writer , moving from laugh out loud funny to lyrically moving between one sentence and the next , dragging the reader deep into a world where the rural virginian countryside and it s stark class divides are overlaid by a hidden world of sleeping welsh kings and mystical forests and dark beings following a year in the life of five friends the decidedly un psychic daughter of psychics a ferocious dreamer a scholarship student desperate to forge his own identity a quiet , insightful boy prone to disappearing and a driven , charismatic boy who is going to die you just can t look away from their relationships , the beauty of the world they discover , and the creeping horror that is every bit as much a part of these hidden worlds this series also includes one of the most nuanced and real feeling coming out arcs i ve ever seen , as well as deeply moving and sensitive explorations of the trauma of abuse , of loss , and of growing up those themes are every bit as magical as the more fantastic elements though there are a couple of things i wish were different about the final installment , it really does do an excellent job of closing one of the best series i ve read in recent years reader discretion child abuse strong horror elements murder suicide attempted and successful drug abuse what were your favorite novels this past year ?
