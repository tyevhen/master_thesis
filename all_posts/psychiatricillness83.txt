i have been thinking for a while that i need a new challenge and a new focus in life i have joined a social group and been out with them a few times it is a really nice group and they do all sorts of activities i have been out with them three times ow and i am going to go for a meal with them tomorrow evening i have applied for a new job i had two telephone interviews last week and i have also done some psychometric tests online the tests were really difficult though so i am doubtful i will get further i really want to though as this sounds like the perfect role for me i am also seriously considering doing a trek to everest base camp for charity next year my mum has offered to help me with the fundraising i think it will be a great focus for me and take my mind off of work for a while and give me something to get fit for i had a good work out at the gym this morning thinking about how i am going to to try really hard to get properly fit now i do feel a lot better now , i really need to enter a new phase of life i was starting to feel fed up and bored i would not say depressed , i just had nothing that made me want to jump out of bed in the mornings i plan to start posting regulary again too
