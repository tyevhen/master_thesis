i feel better no , i do n't i'm healing i'm not healing my pain is improved i'm in more pain i'm moving better no , moving hurts and so it goes over the last days i 've yo yo 'd back and forth from feeling like i'm on the path to recovery to feeling like recovery from my back surgery is yet a long way off it 's been a bit frustrating to say the least one step forward , two steps back that 's how i began the week on the heels of feeling better , i had a pretty big setback in my level of back pain i began taking my pain pill again , and things slowly improved as things improved i increased my level of activity as i got more active my pain increased by midweek i was really discouraged discouragement is not good for me increased discouragement caused my mood to crumble for a few days i had two things to battle , a painful back and a poor mood i'm happy to report i got out of my house and socialized at least once each of the past three days , and that has helped my mood i'm so grateful i have friends who sensed i needed to get out and offered me opportunities to do so i do feel better i feel better mentally , and as i sit here right now my back pain is also improved it 's tolerable it 's not gone , but i'm again weaning off the pain pills without ill effect that 's encouraging i'm trying to be a good patient i'm trying to be patient i 've increased my activity but not a lot i'm taking it more slowly than i did previously it 's still tough , mentally and physically , to have so little to do , but this too shall pass , right ? this is temporary , i have to remember that
