hello again my friends , thanks for caring and visiting my blog again yesterday i had another blind date which went much better than the previous one , i think i'm getting better at this , i was a little bit nervous before the date but when i got there i just said to my self lets do this and have fun , and than everything went smoothly and we had really nice time , if you 're asking if she 's the one ? well not really but it was a good experience and we had good time and got some practice at dating and communicating with people you do n't know which can sometimes be very alarming if you know what i mean soon i have another blind date , i will update on it too , however its way easier to deal with this using cipralex , cause you can really deal with the conversation and the other person and not with your anxiety and panic attacks cheers email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
