i had to leave work early yesterday it was my fourth day of work in a row i was n't able to function at the level i'm accustomed to , was near tears , and i was totally worn out i admitted my current struggles to my supervisors , and they said they understood , but i felt terrible about leaving i was , i'm just now realizing , ashamed i berated myself throughout the entirety of my drive home that was not new , as i had also berated myself while driving home the previous afternoon i was unhappy with how i behaved with one of my supervisors late wednesday afternoon nothing major , in fact she did n't even notice , but i was irritated with an addition to my caseload , and i felt i let that irritation show it was n't professional behavior , and i was n't proud of it i pride myself on being a good employee , one that accepts challenges , is kind and respectful to patients and coworkers , and deals professionally with each task i do n't usually get irritated at work the fact that i reacted with irritation to such a simple request bothered me to me it was further proof that depression had taken hold it was further proof that i was n't in control i was n't beating this thing , this illness i hate i wonder if people with other chronic , relapsing illnesses struggle as i do with expectations of themselves in the midst of debilitating symptoms despite everything i know about this biological brain illness , with its plethora of confounding and debilitating symptoms , i still beat myself up when i ca n't overcome it i make it a moral issue , a character judgment , even though i know depression is no more about poor character than is a brain tumor ! why do i do that ? i know this is an illness i speak publicly about this illness i 've even been featured in videos educating others about depression , the illness yet when i'm in the midst of it , i ca n't believe it 's got me i ca n't believe i ca n't will it away or overcome it with sheer determination and when will and determination do n't work , i get down on myself for it that 's not helpful i woke up this morning hoping for a better day i try to start every day with that attitude when i feel so low unfortunately , i was barely through breakfast when it became apparent the symptoms had not left the heavy limbs , muted thinking , and lethargy were pronounced but i'm working on acceptance today if i fret about simple things turned difficult , worry about how long this might last , or wallow in the heaviness , i'm not helping myself i want to help myself truth is , i 'd like to plow right through this day , and the next , and the next as if nothing was happening , but that 's not realistic with this illness i have to accept that i have to change my expectations , and be okay with doing less , still doing , but doing less depression wants me to throw in the towel i want to act like it 's not in the room i guess i need to find a happy , acceptable medium i have n't done much today , but i 've accomplished more than i would have if i 'd given up the fight
