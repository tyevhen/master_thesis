the main clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis hay fever are nasal congestion , a watery nasal discharge and sneezing in a few cases it affects the eyes and the conjunctiva may become red and itchy in of cases there is also asthma in conjunction with the rhinitis allergic rhinitis is due to an antigen antibody reaction in the nasal mucosa if the antigens responsible are only pollen particles then it causes seasonal allergic rhinitis hay fever if the antigens are dust , house dust mites faecal matter , fungal spores and animal dander , it causes perennial allergic rhinitis allergic rhinitis develops as a result of the interaction between the inhaled allergen and adjacent molecules of ige antibodies these adhere to the surface of the mast cells which line the nasal epithelium with the first exposure to the offending allergen after the first exposure , the mast cells are primed , i e high levels of ige antibodies adhere to their surface with subsequent exposure to allergens , the ige antibodies provoke an explosion in the mast cells with the massive release of histamine histamine itself causes an increase in permeability of the epithelium allowing allergens to reach ige primed mast cells sneezing results from overstimulation of the afferent nerve endings and starts within minutes of the allergens entering the nose this is followed by a greatly increased nasal secretion and eventually nasal blockage about minutes after contact with the allergen the western treatment of allergic rhinitis relies mostly on the use of antihistamine agents these work by preventing histamine from reaching its site of action , i e the h receptors and hence they are called h receptor blockers side effects include sedation , dizziness , fatigue , insomnia , nervousness , and gastro intestinal disturbances failure to respond to antihistamines is due to the fact that inflammatory chemicals other than histamine are released in allergic states all modern chinese books equate allergic rhinitis to bi yuan but this disease corresponds more to sinusitis than to allergic rhinitis there is , in fact , an ancient chinese disease entity called bi qiu which actually corresponds more closely to allergic rhinitis bi qiu means stuffy nose and it is characterized by a profuse , thin , clear nasal discharge , stuffed nose and sneezing another chinese disease category which may correspond to allergic rhinitis is called qiu ti which may be translated as stuffy nose and sneezing the only exception among modern chinese doctors is the book new general outline of chinese medicine by the guangzhou army health department which attributes the pathology of allergic rhinitis to a kidney deficiency and a deficiency of the du mai as i do the book also says specifically the kidneys control sneezing the du mai flows to the upper lip sneezing , stuffed nose , runny nose with a watery , clear nasal discharge is due to a deficiency of the kidneys and of the du mai itchy nose is due to wind bi qiu stuffy nose is characterized by itchy nose , sneezing , profuse , white watery nasal discharge , and stuffy nose on examination , the nasal mucosa is swollen but not inflamed allergic rhinitis vs sinusitis please note that it is important to understand the difference between these two conditions as they are frequently confused the term allergy or allergic is frequently used to describe the symptoms of sinusitis by both patients and practitioners sinusitis is not an allergic disease it is an inflammation of the tissue lining the sinuses due to an infection normally , sinuses are filled with air , but when sinuses become blocked and filled with fluid , germs bacteria , viruses , and fungi can grow and cause an infection by contrast , in allergic rhinitis , there is inflammation but no infection in sinusitis , the nasal discharge is thick and yellow and there is no sneezing in allergic rhinitis , it is profuse , white and watery and there is sneezing pathology of allergic rhinitis in my experience , allergic rhinitis is characterized by wind in the same way as in an external invasion of wind common cold the allergens could be seen as a form of wind wind obstructs the nose and it impairs the diffusing and descending of lung qi this causes sneezing and a congested nasal mucosa this is the biao manifestation of this condition the ben root is a deficiency of the kidneys and of the du mai it is the kidney deficiency that , on the one hand , allows wind to enter the nose and , on the other , it is the cause of the allergic constitution in allergic rhinitis , the kidneys are involved not only in the root of the disease , but also in the manifestation through the du mai the du mai emerges from between the kidneys and flows up the spine to the top of the head and then down to the nose and lips it is therefore the channel connection between the kidneys and the nose for this reason the kidneys are responsible not only for breathing , due to their function of grasping qi , but also sneezing sneezing itself is also directly linked to the kidneys and not necessarily due only to wind chapter of the simple questions says the kidneys control sneezing chapter of the simple questions discusses the consequences of inserting a needle into an organ and , for the kidneys , it says if we pierce the kidneys , this will cause sneezing and death will ensue within days thus the hyper reactivity of the immune response of allergic rhinitis is due to a deficiency of the kidneys and of the du mai with regard to the role of the du mai in allergic rhinitis , it is interesting that many of the herbs which li shi zhen connected with this vessel are expelling wind herbs which act on the nose these herbs are fang feng radix saposhnikoviae , cang er zi fructus xanthii , jing jie herba schizonepetae , qiang huo rhizoma seu radix notopterygii , xi xin herba asari and gao ben rhizoma ligustici the symptoms and signs of allergic rhinitis are those of wind cold as the nasal discharge is always white and watery this indicates a deficiency of wei qi which is spread by the lungs but has its root in the kidneys thus , although some books do refer to a kidney deficiency as the root of allergic rhinitis , the kidneys are responsible not only for the root of this disease , but also for the manifestation through their direct connection with the wei qi and sneezing and with the du mai which flows through the nose there are two types of allergic rhinitis perennial or seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis is due to allergy to house dust mites , cats dogs , horses , etc and the patient suffers from it all year round seasonal allergic rhinitis hay fever is due to allergy to pollen and it occurs only during the pollen season the timing of its occurrence varies as it depends on which particular grasses the patient is allergic to treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis hay fever the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis depends on the season during the allergic season usually spring , we must treat the manifestation biao , i e expel wind acupuncture with acupuncture , i would use these points bl fengmen , bl feishu , lu lieque , l i yingxiang , bitong , du shangxing , g b fengchi , yintang reducing or even method cupping is applicable on bl and bl during the pollen season , the patient must be treated frequently , i e at least once a week or more frequently herbal treatment prescriptions that can be used include xiao qing long tang small green dragon decoction cang er zi san xanthium

side effects than in a systemic administration of cortisone if we view cortisone as a kind of kidney tonic , it would make sense to inject it in the point bl which expels wind and spreads wei qi in the exterior
