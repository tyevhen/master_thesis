i have n't had much motivation to update this blog or do much of anything else lately i do n't think i'm coping too well with the new drama with my teeth my mood has definitely taken a hit i 've been struggling to move some days i missed work on friday because i had a migraine headache and just could n't get out of bed and since beginning the antibiotics for my tooth infection , i 've been consistently and constantly nauseous physical and mental discomfort has been the norm since tuesday , which is when the tooth infection was diagnosed life has n't been much fun i'm not happy with how i 've been coping i'm discouraged i'm not feeling hopeful and i'm fearing the worst it 's no wonder i have little motivation or energy fear , i think , is really weighing me down i 've been struggling to stay in the moment i'm projecting my fears way out into the future i do n't usually do that but now i find myself fearing the worst possible outcomes , especially where my teeth are concerned it 's mentally exhausting i'm not doing myself any favors by focusing my energy on my fears but i ca n't seem to stop i 've had so much bad luck with my teeth over the past couple of years , it 's hard not to feel cursed of course , i know i'm not cursed , but i am feeling incredibly unfortunate that 's the problem i need to stop feeling unfortunate , i e sorry for myself it 's certainly not beneficial if i ca n't cope with today , tomorrow is not going to get any better i 've already proven that this week migraines , low motivation , low energy , irritability not fun somehow i 've got to get a grip , focus on today and move forward
