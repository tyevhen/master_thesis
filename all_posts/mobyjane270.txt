dear a b i wanted to comment on your blog , but am having difficulty setting up an account you have been helping me for many years i was so happy when you started back on your blog , after your back operation for we all need you so much ! even though your book depression is a choice put me on the right track , i still get episodes of depression when life throws me big challenges yet , at least these episodes are short lived as i zero in on the brain switching techniques and within a few days or week , i 've been able to get back i have n't been hospitalized for suicide attempts ever since i started your techniques there are two blogs of yours which have helped me the most the one in which you told us to immediately focus on something to appreciate your most recent one talking about emile cou has been an eye opener for me recently i have been low again , and then when i read your blog i realized that i have been thinking far too many negative thoughts i'm now aware of them as they start to churn and have decided not to think them i started doing the i'm getting better day by day , everyday , in every way in the mornings when i first wake up and at night before going to sleep in such a short time , it has lifted me out of my funk so getting some energy at last , i 've started doing it all day long , when i notice negative thoughts starting i am having such success with this mantra that it has inspired me to change every negative thought into a positive one so i want to express my gratitude to you for starting back at your blog when you are still not fully healed from your back operation , and for sharing how you have been dealing with your anxiety you have always been there for me , when a crisis hits i go to your blog and what you are writing about seems to be exactly what i need i say prayers for your healing yours in gratitude , m dear m thank you so much for your rewarding letter i think it would be very helpful for others for you to describe how you change into positive thinking what kinds of thoughts do you substitute for the negative ones ? a b curtiss
