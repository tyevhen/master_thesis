there is exciting new research taking place on this serious disease and obviously , it has to do with epigenetics what epigenetics really comes down to is experience what kind of experience do we have and when ? because that is the harbinger of serious disease later on there is so much new research that points to gestation , pre gestation and birth trauma as heavily influencing the advent of afflictions such as cancer and alzheimers later in life we know now that one of the key ingredients for this change is a process called methylation genes borrow part of the methyl group and change their own evolution making some more expressive and active , while others are repressive and passive or inactive and this depends on what experiences the baby has from the very start of life and there may be a similar mechanism that is behind many types of cancer , and dementia , as well catastrophic diseases get their start early in life when cells are rapidly forming and the fact of a catastrophic disease often indicates a catastrophic and life endangering trauma in an era when cells are coming into life is the time when bad events can detour and damage them damage during this time can be life endangering , engendering diseases that become life endangering , themselves these diseases , therefore , often foretell of severe trauma very early on they are like measuring gauges that point to times of deleterious effects it is not cancer that damages adult cells these cells already underwent trauma and were weakened by it adult stress finishes the job the same may be true of heart disease and other common maladies the on and off changes produced by methylation may be a major element in any number of cancers one obvious reason is that the cells have been altered in radical ways by this methyl process so what seems normal to us adults may not be normal at all our changes occurred so early that they now seem like us and the doctor examining us asks , have you undergone any serious trauma in you life , and you say , not at all you feel normal as an adult even when you became someone and something else before you had a way of knowing anything that is why we can suffer from chronic serious allergies after living a womb life where the parents were constantly bickering tell me did you have any serious trauma in your life ? no not at all alas , the symptoms are screaming the contrary and asthma is explaining it all in its own language we began a cancer and alzheimer s study with a medical clinic which did begin to point to early trauma , but for a variety of reasons we could not complete it the point is that epigenetics can either favor cancer development or abort it our future study will be to see if our therapy by demethylating trauma can block the trajectory of deformed cells before they become lethal my hypothesis is that it can , but we will see this means that early damage , a mother smoking or taking pain killers , can imprint a cell change , which , when allowed to go on can result in disease altering the epigenetics will right the system and stop the detour voracious cancer has been awaiting its chance we are not going to let that happen we already see that in the very few cases of cancer we have among our patients and i believe it is because in our therapy we travel down to the far reaches and depths the antipodes of the brain where serious illness starts its life i recently wrote that parents don t have to do anything to hurt a child what they exude tension or depression can do it all this is especially true during our womb life where depression and or anxiety can exude from the placenta to affect the baby he is being spritzed with all kinds of chemicals which affect his development and in those spritzes are elements that are associated with cancer in later life march , univ of calif davis tell me , did you have any trauma ? nope that early trauma does enormous damage more than almost anything we can think of in our adult life if you ask that question in a different way , as we do , and examine primordial events to the fetus , we may find an answer as the fetus develops , the mother is informing her baby about herself is she depressed , anxious , tense , worried , apprehensive ? that information , seemingly benign , impacts him and affects his evolution and personality she doesn t have to act nervous the chemicals will do it for her but the baby imprints nervous , and we wonder where it all came from when the carrying mother is nervous she chews up her vitamins the baby needs those vitamins to synthesize methyl groups so when the mother is deficient , so is the baby and that again can change everything it is becoming more and more clear , as i have insisted for almost years , that our early life is critical that problems in the womb redound in later life and account for so many illnesses the real question by doctors should be , tell me about your gestation and birth tell me about your parents during that time
