i ve long held that i don t think classic literature is any better than newer literature i think stories and reading are wonderful things , but i also believe strongly that which of these are good or not is a subjective matter , to be decided by individuals not experts i wanted to like the classics when i was young i had visions of myself curled up in a comfy chair , reading jane eyre , and being able to tell people , modestly of course , what my latest reading material was amongst the much more traditional homeschoolers i was surrounded by , learning latin and reading only books older than years was a big trend , and i kind of wanted to include myself in that i tried , but i just couldn t do it i picked up various classics at various times , hoping that this one would finally be the not boring one , but i never found one that i didn t have to struggle through finally i gave up , deciding that the classics obviously weren t for me , and furthermore that the snobbery surrounding reading choices was counterproductive and harmful to readers of all ages i moved on , and enjoyed years of reading modern historical novels and fantasy fiction there was one area , though , where i did find myself enjoying old writing my mother , sister , and i developed a ritual of sorts , not one we practiced every day , but a frequent the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas occurrence we d curl up together on my bed in the evening , along with a stack of poetry books , and take turns reading aloud to each other my mother s favourite was the owl critic by james thomas fields emilie liked the owl and the pussycat by edward lear and i was a big fan of the lady of shalott and the eagle by tennyson , the introduction to the songs of innocence by william blake , and walking through woods on a snowy evening by robert frost though we all had favourites , together we read countless classic poems by dozens of different writers we all enjoyed poetry , but it became a special passion of mine for a homeschool talent show , i once recited the highwayman by alfred noyes i loved the melodrama of it and , inspired by the rendition of that poem in one of the anne of green gables movies , i decided to memorize it myself the audience was impressed , and although i was somewhat pleased by that , the real joy i took in the process were the hours spent alone , quietly reading and practicing it was relaxing and joyful , an activity that filled me with contentment i still believe strongly that there s nothing inherently better about classic writing , whether it s in the form of fiction or poetry , but i did eventually find some classics that i was happy to make part of my own life i m not sure if children outside of school are more likely to be drawn to classics or not , but i do think that not having to read them means that learners won t be turned off from them en masse when everything is treated as valuable , no matter when or by whom it was written , then classic works become just another potentially interesting option i could never get into anything by jane austen , but i sure did enjoy exploring the works of countless famous poets from the last few centuries had i been forced to read those works , to analyse and tear them apart , my experience would probably have been a lot less joyful instead , my exploration was done freely and enthusiastically , guided by my interests and whims and determination in short , it was fun that s the way learning should be in childhood , whether it includes anything classic or not ! you might also like learning by doing education made real i do n't want to build my own curriculum , i just want to fun is more important than education building life on a foundation of untamed learning linkwithin
