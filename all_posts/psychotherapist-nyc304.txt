in my part of this topic , i began a discussion about the effect of growing up with a parent who had borderline personality disorder in this article , i'm continuing the discussion with a fictionalized scenario as an example of this dynamic the effect of growing up with a parent who had borderline personality disorder borderline personality disorder , which i defined in the prior article , is a disorder that is a catchall for many similar traits , including chaotic relationships , unpredictable emotional reactions , a fear of abandonment , and a strong ambivalence about close relationships , including a longing for closeness at the same time as the person with this disorder experiences a fear of being rejected , hurt or abandoned as i mentioned in the prior article , there are some people who do n't necessarily meet the full criteria for borderline personality disorder diagnosis , but they have certain borderline traits as i also mentioned in part of this topic , even though a primary caregiver usually the mother might have borderline personality disorder and this usually has a detrimental effect on a child , if a child is lucky , there can be mitigating factors , like other close relationships another loving parent , a loving sibling , a nurturing grandparent , caring teacher or mentor , concerned coach or so on that can help to temper the detrimental effect we also know now that , due to the neuroplasticity of the brain the ability of the brain to change , even when there 's no one in the child 's life to help mitigate the effect or the child does n't have a particularly resilient nature , as an an adult , s he is often helped later on in life by having a loving , secure relationship or by getting help in therapy the following fictionalized scenario , which is composed of many different cases with all identifying information changed , illustrates how someone who had a parent with borderline personality disorder can be affected as a child and later on as an adult keep in mind that this scenario is only one possible result of this dynamic and there can be many other results karen karen 's mother , alice , gave birth to karen when alice

felt left out and lonely because she had to stay home and take care of karen on the one hand , alice loved karen but , on the other hand , she also resented her because she wanted to be a normal year old by going out and having fun alice also had a lot of resentment towards her mother , betty , for her verbal abuse and they would often argue even though alice told herself that she would never treat her daughter , karen , the way that her mother treated her , she had no awareness of how she like most children internalized this dynamic on an unconscious level and , as karen got older , without realizing it , alice was just as verbally abusive with karen just as her mother was with her karen grew up to be an anxious child as a four year old , she never knew when alice would fly off

completed family therapy , the counselor recommended that alice attend individual therapy , but alice refused and her case was closed then , things went downhill again when karen 's elementary school teachers told alice that karen was an anxious child , despite their assurances that they were not criticizing her , alice took their comments personally and felt they were saying that she was a bad mother alice got very angry and moved her to another school when karen was , alice got her ged and got a job where she could support them , so she moved out of betty 's household at first , things
