i usually do n't post a poem so recent , and this i wrote only a week ago while still in the clutches of depression for any who read yesterday 's extensive comments it should be obvious why i chose to post this poem don t look back i see my life as a black road stretching back through infinite potholes of time to a horizon where black bottomed clouds always threaten to storm , a sinister road flanked by trees blasted the color of ash , trunks hollow topped and jagged those are my trees by the sagging barbwire between the termite riddled fence posts those are my cows behind the wires starving , starving , barely standing the reason ? they have discovered who they are i want to tell them , you are not just meat but they know it is a lie i cling to my lies like a fat black spider hanging from a silver filament the lies matter , don t they ? well , don t they ? things don t become other than they are just because you want them to i close the eyes in the back of my head and shuffle forward and with that , i conclude today 's blog with brevity , a quality i sorely lack but only because i have so much to say ! thine at kilobunnies , ce
