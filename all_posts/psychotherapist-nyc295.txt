for many clients who start psychotherapy to deal with trauma , especially longstanding trauma stemming from significant unmet emotional needs from childhood , it can be difficult to feel hopeful that therapy will make a difference and help them to change their lives learning to feel hopeful in therapy clients with trauma can find it difficult to feel hopeful as a psychotherapist in nyc , i 've found this to be especially true of clients who have been in many different types of psychotherapy before and who have experienced no resolution to their trauma psychotherapy clients with a fear of being vulnerable and only a glimmer of hope often , clients come to see me because they know that , in addition to using talk therapy , i'm also an emdr therapist as well as a hypnotherapist and somatic experiencing therapist these clients usually come to see me because they 've have n't experienced relief from their emotional trauma in traditional talk therapy and although there might only be a small part of them that brings them back to therapy , often they feel too emotionally vulnerable to really allow themselves to feel a sense of hope that things could change for them clients with longstanding unresolved trauma can feel too afraid to be hopeful in therapy this is , of course , understandable when you consider that they 've been disappointed too many times in their life , including disappointments in therapy it becomes hard for them to trust others and , often , hard for them to trust themselves it 's also not unusual for people to come to therapy and not even know that they 've been emotionally traumatized this is especially common if they 've experienced complex trauma or they 've lived their lives since childhood experiencing one crisis after another they might be too emotionally numb to feel a lot more than fear , anger and apprehension they might only know in some vague way that they feel stuck in their lives , but they do n't make the connection between their current problems and their personal history see my article when you just do n't feel right and it 's hard to put your feelings into words psychoeducation in therapy knowing this , i usually provide clients with psychoeducation at the start of therapy about the different types of treatment modalities that i use and any research about the efficacy of these modalities i also tell them about my own evolution as a psychotherapist who originally trained in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy and who went on to train in different types of trauma therapy , like emdr , clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing i can also tell new clients what i have observed in my psychotherapy private practice with regard to the different types of therapy and how it has been my experience over the years that a mind body orientation in therapy tends to work better and faster for most people as compared to regular talk therapy intellectual insight in therapy usually is n't enough to heal trauma this is n't to say that psychoanalysis , psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy do n't work however , most of the time , these forms of therapy do n't resolve trauma clients in talk therapy often develop intellectual insight into their problems , which is important , but their trauma often remains unresolved intellectual insight in therapy usually is n't enough to heal emotional trauma clients , who have developed only intellectual insight , often feel that there must be something really wrong with them because their insight does n't bring about change clients , who have a history of trauma , often carry within themselves the burden of guilt and shame to begin with because of their trauma they blame themselves for what happened to them so , when therapy only brings insight and not healing , they often blame themselves for that too which , in many ways , is a retraumatization but the problem usually is n't with them it 's a problem with the therapy that does n't get to the core of their problems overcoming emotional trauma interpersonal neurobiology points the way due to the relatively new field of interpersonal neurobiology and the work of professionals like allan schore , ph d and daniel siegel , md , we now know that early childhood emotional trauma and attachment problems with the primary caregiver can cause deficits in the right hemisphere of the brain , specifically the right orbitofrontal cortex and that regular talk therapy often does n't help to heal these deficits see affect dysregulation and disorder of the self by allan schore , ph d and healing trauma attachment , mind , body and brain by dan siegel , md , which are both part of the norton series on interpersonal neurobiology , as well as the body keeps the score brain , mind and body in the healing of trauma by bessel van der kolk , md healing trauma with the mind body connection the neuroplasticity of the brain not long ago neuroscientists believed that , over time , brain cells died and the brain just continued to lose cells without being able to regenerate cells or to make changes hence the old saying , you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks fortunately , we also now know about the neuroplasticity of the brain neuroplasticity refers to the brain 's ability , under the right circumstances , to reorganize itself throughout the life cycle the neuroplasticity of the brain so , even in circumstances where there have been deficits in the right orbitofrontal cortex right hemisphere of the brain due to childhood trauma of early abuse or neglect , the adult brain can still change later in life to make up for these emotional deficits the discovery that the brain can change itself was a very hopeful discovery see the brain that changes itself stories of personal trauma from the frontier of brain science by norman doidge , md the mind body connection in therapy to heal these trauma related deficits , a treatment modality that takes into account the mind body connection is required , like somatic experiencing , emdr or clinical hypnosis , among others see my article mind body psychotherapy the body offers a window into the unconscious mind the mind body connection in therapy of course , there are no guarantees that therapy is going to resolve a particular person 's problems so , while i'm enthusiastic about the different types of therapy that i use , i'm also honest that there 's no way to predict in advance if therapy is going to work over the course of a therapy , i often use a combination of mind body oriented treatment modalities because no one form of therapy works for every single client also , even when a particular treatment modality is working for a while , there can be a treatment impasse and , in order to overcome an impasse , i 'll switch to a different modality that is better with that particular obstacle in treatment sometimes , the switch to another modality might only be temporary to overcome the impasse , and other times the client might prefer it so we continue with it see my article overcoming an impasse in trauma therapy emotional trauma and hopelessness getting back to clients' problems with feeling hopeful there are different types of challenges that clients face with regard to feeling too afraid to feel hopeful , including feeling powerless feeling unlovable or unworthy see my article overcoming emotional pain feeling unlovable having early , and possibly later , experiences of being physically and or emotionally abandoned feeling despair feeling helpless experiencing social isolation experiencing cognitive distortions for an example of this see my article overcoming all or nothing thinking feeling depressed feeling anxious and overwhelmed being unable to identify and express how they feel unconscious decisions see my article what unconscious decisions have you made that are impacting your life ? and so on in an upcoming article , i 'll discuss how clients , who come to therapy feeling too afraid to be hopeful , can overcome this challenge getting help in therapy if you 're feeling overwhelmed by your emotions ,
