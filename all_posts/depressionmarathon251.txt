i figure i should write something , even though , truthfully , i do n't want to just as i do n't want to get dressed , go to work , wash my dishes , shower , go grocery shopping , socialize , fix something to eat , exercise , and on and on and on i 've been sleeping on the couch lately because i have n't had the energy to get from the living room to my bedroom and i do n't live in a mansion i'm trying my best to keep my appointments god forbid i should be seen as a bad patient however , work has been another story i attempted it on monday but only lasted two hours i called in sick wednesday because i could not move after negotiating for some shorter days , i did make it to work yesterday and today and now i'm exhausted every day i check for signs of progress every day wonderful friends ask if i'm feeling better every morning i awaken hoping i can say yes depression so far has not obliged i'm feeling isolated , and stagnant , and delayed , and slow , and dull , and muted , and gray everything is gray god i hate gray
