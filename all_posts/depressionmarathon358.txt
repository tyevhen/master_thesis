i am back within the confines of my local mental health hospital i was re hospitalized yesterday afternoon unfortunately , though my mood seems somewhat improved , and i 've even had a bit more energy to expend , my thinking is off the rails my brain is broken i do n't have a lot more to report today to say i am discouraged is a massive understatement i am so discouraged and depleted right now i know this episode has to eventually pass i know it ca n't last forever but the depths of and length of this bout of depression has been beyond anything i 've experienced in the past i am praying for resolution i am praying to hang on until i am returned from the abyss and able to resume my life once again keep moving forward with me , my friends and thank you for your continued support
