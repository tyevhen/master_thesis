hello friends ! i hope you have been well ! we got the playroom all finished up , so i thought i 'd take time through several posts to show you around i can tell you that we 've been loving it and paige seems to love running straight in there come morning so far so good ! we first start with the reading corner i 'd heard good things about book slings and how this kind of bookshelf shows the covers instead of the spines thus making it easier for little ones to find the book they are searching for paige still enjoys taking the books out , but she also likes putting them back in when the mood strikes of course it 's much easier to keep things neat we chose a holder from one step ahead i wanted us to have a cozy place to sit and read together big enough for us both i found the cocoon jr here free shipping ! it 's very comfortable and is made from recycled furniture grade foam in a microfiber zippered case the filler goes in an inner liner with a zipper pull you take off so it 's safer for little kids and the microfiber outer liner is machine washable the lamp was a brass one that was given to us so i painted it blue the little wooden sun was a gift from my brother many years ago i also hung two of my favorite norman rockwell prints over the area for ambiance i 'll show them in better detail later on so , there we have it ! i have lots of books waiting in the wings to be rotated into the space once paige is seeming to be bored with these in the meantime , we are enjoying her little nook together and i find so much joy in seeing her flip through books by herself on her cushion too save you might also like art corner toy area music spot linkwithin
