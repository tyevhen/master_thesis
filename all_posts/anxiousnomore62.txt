i have been trying to write out a long post about my service efforts for this month , but i ca n't help but not like the way it comes out it 's like the scripture in the bible about saying your prayers in your closet , as opposed to the street corner where everyone can see you if you say them in private you do it because its between you and heavenly father if you brag about it , saying them loudly where everyone can hear how righteous you are , than you are doing it for everyone else 's approval and that is your reward matthew and when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the ahypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you , they have their reward but thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy acloset , and when thou hast bshut thy door , cpray to thy father which is in dsecret and thy father which eseeth in secret shall freward thee openly the idea of doing service this month is to take the focus off of yourself and think about others therefore , i do n't want to sit and list the things i have been doing to get kudos or nice comments , because then it all goes back on me and my focus is lost so i will just say this i am holding my end up on the monthly challenge by being more thoughtful for those around me and by helping a friend in need its been harder than i thought it would be , but i guess that 's how all good behaviors are i hope you are finding the joy that comes with serving others if you would like to share whether you participated in this month 's challenge i would love to know , even if its just to say you did it if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like why me ? endure it well lessons learned patience and determination having the faith to endure the hard times linkwithin
