over at the excellent last psychiatrist blog , you can see an example of a graph being used to paint the rosiest possible picture of the data in a study sachs et al , investigating the potential benefit of adding risperidone to a mood stabilizer in the treatment of patients experiencing a manic episode he points out that on the graph purports to show a large difference in remission rates between patients receiving a combination of a mood stabilizer and risperidone risperdal and patients receiving a combination of mood stabilizer plus placebo indeed , the remission rates are and , respectively according to the graph a patient reportedly had remission of manic symptoms if he she scored at less than on the young mania rating scale ymrs please refer to the last psychiatrist s site for questions about whether this is a valid rating is there really something magic to a score of less than on the ymrs ? it s a good read there s even more to this study that needs discussion there is a moderate effect size difference favoring the combination of risperidone and mood stabilizer over mood stabilizer plus placebo if you look at the endpoint data , which are based on taking participants last score and including it in the analysis for many conditions , this analysis makes some sense however , we know that manic episodes tend to remit with time you don t hear of many manic episodes lasting for several months at a time in this study , of patients dropped the study from the placebo plus mood stabilizer group versus from the risperidone plus mood stabilizer this means that the data from the placebo ms group are coming from an earlier point in time because the data are taken from the last observation of the patient than the risperidone ms group , so the risperidone plus ms group has a better chance of change , due to nothing more than being in the study longer , as manic symptoms tend to decline with time alone so part of the difference in the endpoint analysis is due to time we don t know how much , but i d bet it is substantial so one has to look at the differences at each week , and you ll find a small effect size favoring risperidone plus ms at week one , a moderate effect size difference at week two , and a small difference at week three all of these differences are smaller than the endpoint analysis let s also weigh the risks in table , it can easily be seen that risperidone plus ms related to twice the incidence of somnolence , three times the frequency of an extrapyramidal disorder , and six times the incidence of dizziness compared to the mood stabilizer plus ms if that is not enough fun for you , consider that the average weight gain for risperidone plus ms was pounds versus pounds for the placebo plus ms group oh , and the effect size for weight gain was higher than the effect size for treatment at any of the weeks i m willing to bet that the drug company program from which the infamous graph showing remission rates came from did not mention that the between group differences in weight were greater than the differences in manic symptoms of course , the study discussed in this post is old news there is only so much money to be made by using risperidone or any other antipsychotic for three weeks at a time the real cash is to be made in maintaining patients on medication for as long as possible , which is of course why there is an increasing amount of attention being paid to studying the long term use of atypical antipsychotics for mania that , however , is a topic for another day
