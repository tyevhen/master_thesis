being a lowlife asshole is actually kinda cool a common end of year tactic for many bloggers is to do a post about the weirdest search phrases that brought people to their site during the previous months since i'm all about the spirit of giving after all , it is christmas , here 's my strange list short black midgets thanks , gary coleman rasta sweater vest when greed was good and we were all superstars wife gangbang homemade must be something about pornography those cult members in san diego with the kool aid and the sneakers i got nothing get a life , please jizz fest now we 're talking but the top winners if you can call them that for are all variations of i hate being alive here 's some examples from the vast sea of deeply troubled human misery i hate being alive i fucking hate being alive being alive is hard god i hate being alive being alive is difficult god damn i hate being alive have a good life i hate being alive i dislike being alive i dont like being alive i feel like being alive is too difficult i resent being alive i seriously hate being alive i think i just hate being alive oh god i hate being alive reasons to hate being alive shut up and eat your spinach you asshole even though i ca n't really know someone 's inner experience while they 're googling hting bieng alive , i think it 's safe to say they 've never heard of spell checking and that their search is motivated by deep emotional suffering after all , who searches for reasons to hate life just for kicks ? that 's why we have youtube a poster on yahoo ! answers had this response to the question , why do people hate themselves and their life ? if life has been predominately kind to you , you are blessed and perhaps cannot relate to what some people face from the time they wake till the time they go to bed again knowing you should be happy is like saying why do n't all people eat spinach do n't they know it is healthy and they should love it ? well , if it makes them puke every time they eat it , they ca n't snap themselves into liking it the life that has been presented to them is not necessarily as palatable as the one presented to you well said it 's easy to judge until you 've walked in someone 's shoes , which takes all the fun out of passing judgement i think my post about my own feelings of hating my life , myself , and our shitty world touched a nerve for people who also feel lost in the wilderness i currently hold a top ranking position in google for the term i hate being alive , which was purely accidental but this and other related terms account for of all search engine traffic to this blog in the last months behind the required facade of doing fine are some deeply troubled people who are anything but fine running a blog that ranks well for hating life is a dubious achievement at best , and i'm not proud of it what do you think i am , cynical or something ? lowlife and lovin' it karen carr discusses the concept of cheerful nihilism in her book , the banalization of nihilism cheerful nihilism is characterized by an easy going acceptance of meaninglessness and narcissistic moral arrogance this shallow world view has now been popularized by everyone from eminem to toby keith or as bill maher calls him , cletus mcfucknuts another good example of this empty angst is edgy canadian rock export theory of a deadman their platinum selling hit hate my life is predigested stadium rock for the white trash nascar crowd it seems to say , your life may suck , but it 's nothing a huge drunken kegger wo n't fix call me old fashioned , but when you say i hate my life , you should be talking about something a little deeper than your annoyance at panhandlers or your wife 's taste for expensive lingerie oh , and it would also help me take you more seriously if your music did n't suck talking about their newest hit lowlife , theory of a deadman singer tyler connolly says , i thought it 'd be cool to write a fun anthem about being a lowlife it 's okay to drive an old piece of shit car , get arrested and be a dirtball our fans are n't wearing suits and ties they do n't have diamond necklaces they 're regular people who like to party and sing rock 'n' roll music the song speaks to them yes , basically reveling in being a piece of shit along with hardcore gangsta rap , this is what pop culture now passes off as an existential crisis i 'll take suicidal ideation over this disturbing banal shallowness any day
