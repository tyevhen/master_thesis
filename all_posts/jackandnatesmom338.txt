yesterday at ot , jack 's therapist miss sam called me back to the therapy area unlike other places , when mom gets called back at ot , it 's pretty much always a good thing so my little boy , who used to cry if his swing at the park was slightly off center , was doing this talk about your progress ! ! ! ! not only tolerating this crazy movement , but enjoying it and his trunk strength is so much better way to go buddy !
