posted by clinkshrink i lost a great officer last week and i'm sad correctional officer x was assigned to work in the psychiatric infirmary he had been there for years and he was good at it co correctional officer x was build like a sumo wrestler , only bigger he had a soothing , mellow , story telling voice like garrison keillor i swear he could have hypnotized a rabid dog with that voice whenever any situation came up on the unit that looked like it could have gotten out of control , he was there if any of my patients got loud during rounds , he 'd poke his head in you ok in there , doc ? when he moved down the unit it was like watching an ocean swell move toward a tropical beach but more than his size , his demeanor set the tone for the milieu he approached patients in a way that made them feel safe he was the ideal physician recruiter whenever i brought applicants through the unit i 'd introduce them to x in case you 're nervous about working here , i 'd tell them do n't you worry , x would say you come work here , i got your back he was a big pardon the pun reason why we never needed to use physical restraints and now he 's gone he got promoted to sargeant and moved to a different tier gotcha ! but i'm still sad not his real name duh
