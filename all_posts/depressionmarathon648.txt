i'm not sure what to write about today , as there is nothing special going on right now although it has been pouring , and i mean pouring , rain all day i'm sure there is major flooding going on all around the area i do n't think i 've ever seen it rain this hard for this long we were almost flooded out of our office at work today twice the rain over powered the outdoor drains and water came pouring into the basement , which is where our office is located it was a mess speaking of work , it 's been very busy lately we 've been admitting patients left and right it 's okay for now , but if it keeps up , it 's going to get overwhelming i'm still having moments of low confidence there , but that 's getting better we 've got some medically complicated patients right now , so i'm having to call on a lot of skills i have n't used in awhile it 's probably good for me in the end , it will hopefully make me more confident rather than less i ran painfree yesterday it was a short run , but i was still glad it was painfree i 've got miles scheduled for tomorrow morning when it stops raining , it 's supposed to get unbearably hot , so i plan to start at dawn i hope i can do the painfree , too other than that , life continues moving forward my mood remains good i saw my md yesterday , and we 're slowly decreasing some of my meds a few of my meds were increased when i was in the hospital a couple months ago i 'd like to get back to pre hospital levels , so that 's where we 're heading very slowly i'm grateful to be well i'm grateful to be working and running i'm grateful
