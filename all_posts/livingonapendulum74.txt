a registered plan is an investment product offered through various financial institutions which are covered by basic federal government legislation usually the purpose of a registered plan is to put money away for a future aim registered plans can be tax sheltered the interest is taxed only at time of withdrawal or tax deferred the money you put into the plan is only taxed at time of withdrawal what kinds of registered plans exist in canada ?

start early it does n't have to be much , to a month you 'd be amazed how little amounts can add up quickly just think about the last time you went shopping in a dollar store everything there is a dollar or two yet somehow , you get to the cash and it costs you fifty to sixty dollars the same goes for putting money aside furthermore , the longer the money is in a registered plan the better chance it has to grow also if you put a little in early , on a regular basis , the less you will have to find at the last minute to meet your goals shop around many people think that registered plans are a government thing and they are all the same in fact , they are legislated by government but nevertheless a financial product that can differ from one financial institution to another if you were buying a car or a computer , will you buy the first one you saw in the first place you went to ? no ? of course you wo n't because you 're buying something that 's hopefully going to last a few years and cause you the least amount of hassles for those years so why are you treating a registered plan that you will be paying into for the next , , years any differently ? do your own research financial advisers can be a useful tool to introduce you to the concepts but quite honestly they do n't always know what they are talking about or doing and their mistakes can wind up costing you big time there are some good ones out there for sure but you will never know if yours happens to be a good one of you have no idea what he she is talking about read everything before you sign if you do n't understand something get answers before you sign anything i ca n't stress this enough i have heard very often nobody told me this when it was very specifically mentioned in the document they signed and agreed to after you sign , it might not hurt to re read contracts every once in a while to ensure you are respecting the various clauses not respecting some clauses could very well nullify your plan or investment , causing you to loose it all do n't be afraid to ask questions ! the more you know , the better you can choose the product that is right for you i have provided a few sample questions below once i have opened a registered plan , will i have to pay any fees ? if so , what are they for and how much will i have to pay ? do i have to put a minimum amount of money into a registered plan ? do i have to make regular payments ? what happens if i ca n't make regular payments ? what are my investment choices ? what are the benefits of each choice ? can the value of my investment go down ? can i withdraw money if i need it ? are there any fees or penalties for withdrawing money early ? can i transfer the registered plan to another person , or to another registered plan provider ? what is the cost to transfer ? what will happen to my savings in the registered plan if my aim does n't happen ? kid does not go to school , disability goes away what happens if i close my registered plan early ? does the registered plan provider offer any government incentives that are available ? what happens in the event of the death of the plan holder ? is there a contact person at the financial institution that i can speak to if i have any further questions ? ask for monthly statements and read them make sure that everything is ok and there are no problems this is especially important if you are requesting any government incentives such as those offered through the education and disability plans be involved in your investment , do n't assume things will take care of themselves follow your intuition i know , what kind of advice is that ? we often forgo our intuition or instinct because we ca n't justify it with facts sometimes our subconscious mind caught some detail that your conscious mind did n't and your intuition is really trying to warn you if you feel unsure or uncomfortable it is not the right product , plan , advisor or institution for you that is all the advice i have to give today for more information and advice for canadians visit the following website financial consumer agency of canada registered plans what would be your advice ?
