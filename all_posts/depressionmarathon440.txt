i just returned from seeing my psychiatrist she had the results of my recent blood tests , which were all normal , as i expected they would be , except for my ferritin level serum ferritin level is a measure of the iron stores in your blood ferritin is the body 's major iron storage protein my ferritin level was low according to one of many online sources , dr david martin , phd , department of cardiopulmonary science at georgia state university , and physiology chair in charge of testing elite distance runners for usa track and field , believes that ferritin reflects the iron stores that can be utilized to make enzymes for oxidative energy production , and therefore has a direct impact on running performance that makes perfect sense to me , and it certainly reflects my performance over the past month i'm relieved i have a fixable explanation for my month long bout with fatigue , lethargy , and terrible running my doctor ordered an iron supplement , which i will begin taking today it looks like it may take awhile to get my iron levels restored , however most of my research indicates it can take anywhere from to months to fully recover but many runners also report symptom improvement in as little as one month i hope i'm one of those runners if not , i may have to rethink running grandma 's marathon in june right now my plan is to keep all of my options open and wait and see what happens in the meantime , i 'll attempt to continue training , take time off when needed , and be kinder and gentler to myself when things do n't go as i wish they would
