another story came out of the apa conference that dinah wanted me to blog about i was in a cab going to pick up dinah for dinner the cab driver found out i was a psychiatrist so he told me about his life changing experience with therapy at one time he was having an incredible problem with his life he was using cocaine , could n't keep a job and his relationships were going down the tubes therapy helped him quit cocaine and change all that which was good , since he was the driver of my cab i really wanted him not to be high or in distress this kind of turn around story is n't unusual for me parolees will often come back and tell me about things they 've done in free society that they 're proud of the unusual part of this story is the fact that he made all of these changes after a single one hour session ok , that got my attention what was it about this therapist ? ? what happened in the session ? ? i had to ask all the questions the cab driver told me that it was n't so much what the therapist said , but rather who she was she was a kindly , older woman who was sincere and compassionate she told him he needed to start taking care of himself , eat better , get enough sleep , etc etc and that worked geez , i was impressed it changed his life the last remaining habit he wanted to fix was his smoking he wanted to go back and see his therapist again , but she had retired he was sorry he could n't go back , and so was i that 's my cab driver story wait , says dinah who added the pic and subtitle you told it in a more dramatic fashion at the time he was running miles a day now there was a religious spiritual component , something profound about the experience and about the therapist oy we 'll never make a novelist of you , clink
