black days engulfed me right after that last post there was no real trigger is there ever ? i just suddenly found myself back at the bottom if this is mild depression i ca n't imagine what those with right proper depression go through money is part of it and it might have been what started down the slide but i really ca n't blame my middle class poverty i think it was probably more of where i put my focus rather than the actual cause money 's been tight now for , well , over a year but i 've been up and down plenty in that time but it 's always good to have an excuse for the negative thoughts , is n't it ? gives one the idea that if it were n't for this one thing everything would be roses besides , what better thing than money to focus on ? it is the measuring stick of our culture , is n't it ? if i'm going to be depressed and plop on a healthy dollop of low self esteem then there 's hardly a better way to justify those feelings than to concentrate on the thing about which society agrees with me i have no money and colossal debt therefore i am a mean little man the amazing thing about my depression and many others' i'm sure is that it creeps up on me so subtlety , so stealthy that i do n't even know it 's there i ca n't say when for sure that it started , just that for the last week and a half it 's had me under its control but at the time i simply believed that i was worthless and deserved nothing depression did n't occur to me the tip off came yesterday i had two night terror dreams two nights ago twice in the pre dawn hours of the morning i woke up shouting and in a panic both times i managed to go back to sleep and then i slept very late into the morning i had no reason to i'm no more or less rested these days than usual i just could n't stop sleeping then once i 'd finally rousted myself and was thinking about my chores for the day i thought , 'would n't it just be easier to put a gun in my mouth ? ' i thought about where i could do it that would a cause the least amount of mess and b cause my wife the least amount of shock then i realized that i was ticking through the symptoms of depression the big d was back so , i took a st john 's wort capsule at lunch but forgot to at dinner that 's because i fell asleep again at p and slept right up until my wife came home at i was too groggy and distracted by the fact that i 'd missed making dinner for us to remember my pill got it in this morning though and , as much as i can , plan to three times a day from here on it 's so hard but at the same time so comically predictable i 'll get to that herbal week i promised soon but for now i need to climb out of this hole
