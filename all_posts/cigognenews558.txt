we can only heal where we are wounded if the wounds are preverbal , then that is what must be addressed such as reliving strangling on the umbilical cord and being stuck in the birth canal although it may seem odd to the reader , in order to liberate the body it must writhe , shake , and roll , perhaps , to the early lack of oxygen , or love traumas that will then free us from their lifelong effects we need to get down into our bodies we must again undergo an almost seizure like response to the birth trauma , which then will liberate seizure like sexual orgasmic response to see a reliving of oxygen deprivation at birth or other early trauma , a reliving that can go on for hours a day for months , is to realize the amount of compressed force that must be diverted elsewhere it makes the development of sexual problems less of a mystery it explains why people become obsessed with sex , or twist sex into something deviated the spread of the energy of the pain on the first line can go in several directions first , to vital functions , the heart and lungs , and also to sex the pain can seep into sexual thoughts and be channeled into sexual rituals it makes the ritual an urgent undertaking the obsession is the end product of the pain , now transformed as it wends its way upward through the limbic system to the cortical thought processes when we deal only with that transformation , we are on the wrong track , or at least on a very narrow track as the old saying goes , to get on the wrong train means that every stop one makes is the wrong one we must take care to board the right train that will take us to our destination the tracks are nerve tracks with a specific destination it is a strange track system leading backwards to early memories before chugging forward in time then it allows us to return to the frontal cortex and current life sex is the vehicle in the search for relief it can finally discharge the energy of suffering over and over again it is a lifetime affair since the imprint is a lifetime affair sexual ritual provides relief on the second line limbic system , and the first brainstem it drives the person to spank or beat his partner while ejaculating or exhibiting himself while masturbating and it never ceases why is showing oneself naked sexually exciting ? it is not intrinsic to the act , except for the inherent meaning it has to the person we must think of it this way what would happen if he showed himself naked as a child , without the masturbation ? the parents would have seen him and responded to him instead of ignoring him this is the dynamic in so many of our exhibitionist patients of course there are other complicating factors , but the central motivation is often as simple as that the excitement of being seen and responded to even with shock is what excites he is excited by his need and the hope of fulfillment and relief the compulsivity of a ritual may be given its impelling strength by the pain at birth , which is a measurable event for an exhibitionist , look at me , momma , can become showing the penis to female strangers so that they will look at him and pay attention to him and of course , react emotionally he is getting what he needed as a child , symbolically , not what he needs as an adult so long as we treat it as an adult problem we are on the wrong track it is a condensed symbolic act reflecting a lifetime of early experiences we take the symbolic act out , showing the penis , in group therapy , and turn it back into the need look at me , momma ! grown men can t suck on their mother s breast , so they suck on their partner s the excitement is the same for the baby and the adult who never had enough as an infant the excitement for the adult is the baby need , except that it takes a sexual turn the need to suck never leaves it is very true in my homosexual patients i mention elsewhere that one man called his partner s ejaculation into his mouth , mother milk
