i want to apologize for being mia the last couple months , but i think i have a pretty good reason for it my little girl was born on july th and my life has been turned topsy turvy upside down ever since i am sorry i have n't been replying to emails like i usually do or posting i think that now things are starting to settle down as i start to get the hang of being a parent and hopefully i can get back into the blogging swing of things for those that are interested she was lbs even and inches long i was really worried before she came how my anxiety would be after the birth when my hormones were all out of it honestly the very day she was born i remember feeling extremely anxious about eating the hospital food , especially with all the guests around but i made it through without any panic attacks and i have n't had too many issues since then i guess nursing probably helps my appetite a new anxiety has snuck into my life anytime i need to leave the house with her i get this twinge of nervousness like something bad will happen if we go i have no clue why it bothers me but it does i have tried to ignore it and i go out anyway because i know its important to not give into the fear its been easier the more i do it , but the first few times were kinda nerve racking i will sit in the back seat with her if i am not alone , but if i am driving i am worried she will spit up and choke on it and i wo n't know or i will be unprepared to handle some eating pooping crying catastrophe wherever we are off to i am sure this is somewhat normal , right ? i am also anxious when other people are holding her i just worry for some reason even though there is no reason to any other new parents experience the same thing ? so now i am waiting for a sense of normalcy to return to my life i start work next week and that is going to introduce a whole new set of problems to worry about ! i am going to attempt to work from home and take care of her at the same time so my plate will be pretty full so again , i apologize for not being around , and i will try to get to everyone 's unanswered questions and emails in the very near future i hope everyone is doing well !
