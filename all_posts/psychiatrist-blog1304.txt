a while back , one of our commenters took issue with the fact that i referred to a patient 's complaint it got me thinking about the way doctors word things , sometimes in ways that may sound pejorative so the standard format of medical notes opens with the chief complaint if the patient comes in saying things are great , the medical note begins , patient has no complaints often the patient 's exact words are quoted to a physician , this is n't whining , it does n't have a pejorative edge the patient 's problem is what we are taught to focus on , though a complete medical evaluation includes a review of systems that 's the term where patients are asked , in a systematic way , about symptoms that may be indicative of a health problem apart from those pertaining to the chief complaint in describing patient symptoms , doctors also will sometimes use the statement patient denies symptoms it 's sometimes felt that this implies the physician does n't believe the patient patient denies hallucinations is a different statement than no hallucinations and then , of course , there are the subtleties of sorting out how people interpret our rather unusual questions in psychiatry we ask if people hear voices , and when i started doing this i was surprised at how many people say yes i soon realized that it 's not at all unusual for people to occasionally hear the voice of a dead relative calling their name this is , i believe , a cultural phenomena , and in the absence of other voices or symptoms of psychosis , it 's not necessarily a psychiatric symptom or a marker of psychopathology and we ask people if they ever have the sense that the tv is talking to directly to them a symptom we call ideas of reference from the media people sometimes think i'm asking if something said on tv feels like something they can identify with strongly , which is a different phenomena one that 's not a psychiatric symptom when what i literally mean is is someone on the tv speaking specifically and only to you ? and assessing paranoia in a city with a mind boggling crime rate is a task of it 's own the questions have to get pretty specific , and if you 're not a little worried , well , that 's a little odd
