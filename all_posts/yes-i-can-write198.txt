the last time i was in gasp , i was years old it was winter , and everything was covered in a thick layer of snow i wrote a while ago about my memories of gasp and now , with the death of my great grandmother at age this past winter , we 're going to gasp for her funeral from this tourist site , le rocher perc , by jean pierre huard we wanted to stay in her old house , which is now passing on to my great uncle , but sadly , he is , to be frank , an ass , and came up with an excuse for us not being allowed to stay in the old house i feel a bit of sadness at that , since there are many childhood memories from that old farmhouse my sister and i loved the layout of that house , so different from modern ones , and we loved playing in it ! but my mother , who has so , so many more memories attached to it feels the loss of it more accutely what i want to do is hike on the land there , even if we ca n't go into the house it 's on a lot with acres upon acres of forest , stretching right up to the top of a mountain ! there are deer and moose , and bear and wolves on that land we 've been searching for hotels , trying to find ones that open early enough it seems many of them open for the season a few days after we 're due to arrive , and just trying to figure all of the logistics out there 's been a rather melancholy and stressed feeling in our house the last couple of days we leave in a week from today and i have this horrible feeling that this is the last time for a very long time that i'm going to be in gasp i hope this feeling is n't accurate even though it 's been so many years , i love that place , that land , deeply i want to stay longer than just a few days when we head up there , even though we could only really extend things a couple more days anyway , since we have commitments back home i just keep thinking of the place , though the sights , smells , sounds these photos were taken by my mother when she went to gasp with my grandmother in i wish i had any photos i 've taken there , but at age , i was n't into photography at all ! the only images i have are the blurry ones in my head despite the reason we 're heading up there , i'm really looking foward to this trip i hope we can stay as long as possible i 'll have my camera with me , and i'm greatly looking forward to having tons of photos of this beautiful place now if we can only find a place to stay , and get through the funeral and memorial service , as well as whatever family drama often comes along with such things sighs peace , idzie
