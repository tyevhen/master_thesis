well file this one under , you 're not going to believe this or , you 've got to be kidding me ! i am in the hospital no , not that hospital i am on a medical floor of my local hospital the pulled muscle i wrote about in my last post developed into something much bigger and not better a couple of nights ago just after midnight sunday morning , i awoke from sleeping due to a small coughing fit since the coughing hurt my back , in the area of the pulled muscle , i tried to brace myself unfortunately , when i coughed just a few seconds later i felt immediate and tremendous pain in my left low back the pain was so intense i collapsed on my bed and cried out in agony i laid there barely breathing for several minutes as my back seared with pain since i live alone , i got scared i was in so much pain i was n't sure i would be able to get out of bed and retrieve my phone in the next room eventually , with herculean effort , i did get out of bed i grabbed my phone , an ice pack and aleve , but i barely made it back to my bed i was nauseous and sweating and lightheaded that 's when i got really scared i almost passed out no matter what i did or how i positioned myself , the pain was unrelenting i hated to do it , but i began dialing friends the first three did not answer finally my friend , joan , wearily said hello long story short , she brought me to the emergency room where i stood , sat and laid down in agony for hours while they tried one pain med after another multiple doses of valium , toradol , tylenol , and oxycodone were useless i could n't move without getting nauseous and lightheaded when doses of fentanyl , the med of last resort , did n't help , they had to admit me to the hospital so i 've been here for almost hours , and things have not improved much i'm being medicated around the clock , and that has at least allowed me to uncomfortably lie in bed i 've slept a few hours here and there , but changing positions is excruciating , and walking is nearly impossible i took my first steps with a walker about an hour ago i made it feet that was discouraging to say the least i'm currently awaiting an mri , but that likely wo n't be done until tomorrow afternoon apparently it 's a very popular machine the docs are thinking i may have injured my l disc i actually kind of hope they 're right , because at least we 'd then have a plan , an epidural injection of corticosteroid to stifle the inflammation until then i 'll be stuck here in my hospital bed getting more and more restless i'm so discouraged obviously this means running a marathon in days and jumping out of an airplane with my niece and nephew days from now are out of the question after all that training and planning and i was so looking forward to getting back to my regular work schedule now that i'm finished with tms treatments , but no , instead i'm sitting here earning nothing again who gets severely injured coughing in bed ? ? unbelievable i'm so disappointed prayers appreciated
