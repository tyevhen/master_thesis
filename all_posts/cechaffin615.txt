day iv withdrawal depression and loss look much the same along life 's hedgerow still , differ as hawthorn from holly , as grape from pear loss is a coin tossed down a well until you hear the plunk of water and weep in depression you never hear the coin drop nicotine , like benzedrine , has antidepressant properties deprived , the mind shudders like an old engine who will pull this train ? i think i can , i think i can , desiring this man 's art and that man 's scope the sea has jaws and a gray green coat what hangs from the jaws is pulverized to pebbles until the shingle rattles before an otter floating in caramel kelp this disconnection , stoppage , hesitation , grappling for numbers , addresses , details , sans nicotine i mourn the vanished power of the chemical reign ! v their fault my parents smoked , it was not unpleasant it was present at christmas with the holly wreath in the brown couch with the little nubs and legs of wrought iron from which my mother read hiawatha to us and smoked my mother smoked when i was a fetus bad , bad mother my mother withheld her nipples from me mean , mean mother she tried but failed to nurse my older brother weak , weak mother at birth i knew there was something even better i was born for cigarettes
