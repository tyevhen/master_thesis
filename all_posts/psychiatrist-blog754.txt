yes no psychotherapy more often than not helps people recover from or manage mental illness more often than not helps people to better understand themselves and negotiate their lives encourages a detrimental , self centered perspective more often than not makes people feel or behave worse than they did before they entered treatment is for people who do n't have friends to talk to is more often than not inferior to medication as a treatment for mental disorders is more often than not superior to medication as a treatment for mental disorders does nothing i have no significant opinion about psychotherapy other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than have you ever been in psychotherapy ? yes no psychiatric medications more often than not help people recover from , or cope with , their difficulties more often than not cause problems that are worse than the ones they treat have saved lives and helped people to function better are a quick fix for people who do n't have the inner strength to deal with adversity treat illnesses that can strike anyone are the creation of a greedy pharmaceutical industry that has deceived the public i have no opinion about psychiatric medications other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than have you ever taken psychiatric medication ? yes no sometimes , patients are seen for brief visits by a psychiatrist for management of their medications and if they need psychotherapy , they see a social worker , psychologist , nurse therapist , or counselor so called split treatment what do you think of this practice ? brief visits with a psychiatrist for medication management typically work well psychiatrists should spend more time than this with their patients to manage medications when possible , psychiatrists should provide both psychotherapy and medication management to their patients patients should not see psychiatrists at all medications should be managed by other professionals such as primary care physicians , nurse practitioners , or specially trained psychologists i have no significant opinion on this topic other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than electronic health records ehrs or emrs should not contain any records of psychiatric illnesses and treatments including medications even though that means my primary care doc or er doc would n't know about my meds or condition unless i tell them should have separate and higher protections for mental illness than for other health problems should exist for psychiatry exactly as all other medical records do , with the same protections as for other health condition , because adding special protections increases stigma against mental illness should allow patients to control which information they wish to be shared and with whom for all medical specialties facilitate better communication and improve psychiatric care negatively affect communication and detract from psychiatric care i have no significant opinion about electronic health records in psychiatry other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than direct to consumer dtc advertising commercials magazine ads of medications decreases the stigma associated with taking psychiatric medications and is therefore good for psychiatry scares prospective patients too much with the lists of side effects provides incomplete medical information and the suggestion that patients should demand specific treatments without individual consideration of the patient and their problems provides useful information to patients and increases awareness about treatment options should be allowed to continue should be no longer be allowed i have no opinion about direct to consumer advertising other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than psychiatric blogs by mental health professionals more often than not are useful sources of information more often than not are biased and unhelpful are entertaining or interesting to me i have no opinion on psychiatry blogs by mental health professionals other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than blogs about psychiatry in general including those by patients and those who may be disenchanted with psychiatry have provided encouragement for me to get treatment or to recommend treatment to others discouraged me from getting treatment or recommending psychiatric treatment to others had no influence on my attitudes towards psychiatric treatment had a positive influence on how i view psychiatry had a negative influence on how i view psychiatry i have no opinion on psychiatry blogs in general other people may select more than one checkbox , so percentages may add up to more than do you feel this survey is balanced and fair ? pretty much in the middle not really comment box for additional comments or suggestions you 're missing the large portion of the population who does n't read blogs like this my close friend has very different attitudes toward psychiatry they are wierd , controlling , just want to push meds , etc and she may be more the typical person you surely did n't think this was a balanced or fair survey did you ? was that part of your plan ? you have to find a way for members of the same family spouse parent who are on the same insurance policy not to see each other 's medication psychiatric treatment records lawyers take the name of a medication and then create an attack on the person for number of daily responses
