hello ! well , today marks the start of weeks for me and i'm officially into the second trimester it feels so nice to be able to say those words ! i have no belly or bump yet to show i know i have a while before that will happen when i wake up , i look like i always have just a thicker torso now and by the end of the day , i get so bloated i look months pregnant i choose to see it as a preview of what 's to come and not that i'm just a gassy fluid filled mess what is cool is that when i lay flat on my back i can feel my uterus bumping up out of my abdomen i run my hand over it and it 's nice to think wow , our baby is in there ! i ca n't wait to have some sort of bump as a visual cue that yes , i'm pregnant no , it 's not a figment of my imagination yes , it is real it will be nice to feel kicking and flutters of movement because up to now there are still no signs that soothe me and say everything is ok in there i have to rely on ultrasounds and dopplers for that although , the fact i'm asleep almost or feeling mostly like i will vomit at any second should be a good enough cue i'm still having those symptoms and no , they have n't lifted yet in fact , i'm having a hard time finding anything that i want to eat these days everything just sounds gross to me do n't worry mom , i'm eating it 's just not fun like it used to be that 's ok , though , i know it wo n't be forever and the fact that i feel so sickly just reminds me of the good things to come save you might also like weeks days months reflecting linkwithin
