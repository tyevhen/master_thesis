op ed contributor andrew solomon s words are in quotes and italics followed by my thoughts i would have liked to post all of his piece , but i don t think the nyt would approve copyright issues , so i ll try to be selective depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide , according to the world health organization it costs more in treatment and lost productivity than anything but heart disease so far , so good despite medical advances in the last years that have greatly improved our ability to help those who suffer from depression , we lack an effective system for administering care i wonder which medical advances he is speaking of maybe ssri s ? or effexor ? or cymbalta ? in any case , there is no evidence that these new treatments have brought more than perhaps a minimal advantage over treatments which existed prior to see here and here only a very small percentage of depressives who seek help receive appropriate treatment for their condition research often stalls short of being translated into useful medicine depressives continue to be stigmatized , which makes their lives even more difficult and lonely um , i think that if mr solomon is so concerned about people with depression avoiding stigmatization , he may want to stop referring to them as depressives , as the term indicates that he is defining people with a label , and a rather negative one at that i can assure you that nobody who is dealing with depression wants to be called a depressive these problems are similar to those cancer patients once faced , and the best way to address them might be similar as well we need a network of depression centers , much like the cancer centers established in the s snip following this model , the national institute of mental health should coordinate and subsidize a national network of depression centers , ideally based at research universities with good hospitals and departments devoted to the subject snip among the thousands of depressed people i have met with , the majority have sought treatment but feel that they are not getting good care many of them have been prescribed antidepressants by family doctors who lack training in psychiatry and have conducted only cursory interviews before rendering their diagnoses antidepressants vary in their chemistry and effects and human brains vary as much as human minds to treat the most complicated organ in the body appropriately demands considerable expertise apparently mr solomon has never heard of psychotherapy in case he s wondering , it has a pretty good track record with depressives , better than the meds he seems to be touting snip full disclosure my father is the chief executive of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures antidepressants well , that clears things up a bit on my end snip before the cancer centers came around , cancer was as taboo as depression is now but as antibiotics and vaccines for other illnesses lengthened life expectancy , cancer became more pervasive and less shameful depression , too , is becoming more widespread and more frequently diagnosed depression and bipolar illness will affect some percent of americans during their lives , and yet the stigma endures people often come up to me after lectures to whisper about their affliction , as though everyone else in the room weren t grappling with precisely the same thing it is neither wise nor feasible for a large proportion of the population to be trying to keep a secret a national network that helped to medicalize depression in the public imagination would reduce sufferers shame the very waiting rooms of depression centers would provide incontrovertible proof of the ubiquity of the illness and ease the isolation of sufferers within the centers , patients would find themselves the focus of an elite community of insight and support yeah , we should medicalize it ! call it a disease ! i can see it now someone is going to say just like a person with diabetes needs insulin , depressives need serotonin oh , wait , that s been done it s played there is clearly no reliable biological marker for depression , but selling depression as a disease sure sells those pills just ask mr solomon s father , the drug company executive forest labs ! as it is established that these mental illnesses are not character defects , but instead can be characterized in terms of brain symptoms , the false distinctions between them and cancer or heart disease will become impossible to sustain we ve made stellar progress in treating mental illness since the prozac revolution but there is a catastrophic divide between research and practice we must come up with a seamless way to support scientific progress and to administer the treatments we have , in order ultimately to alleviate as much suffering as possible indeed , if we are going to fix the gap between science and practice , i d suggest how about less polypharmacy doling out a bunch of meds simultaneously , which has a very meager evidence base , and how about psychotherapy first and maybe meds if psychotherapy does not work mr solomon is clearly far out of touch with the evidence base , yet he writes books and is featured in the new york times that makes me feel like a depressive full text of his writing here , but it will not be available free online for long his book has received rave reviews , though i ve not read it , and i want to be clear that my comments only apply to his writing in the nyt today one more thing prozac revolution did mr solomon read listening to prozac one too many times ?
