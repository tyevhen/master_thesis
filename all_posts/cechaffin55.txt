i ought not to have been surprised , but today i tried to observe my own thought for a minute at a time which is harder than you think , as self observation so easily changes one 's train of thought and was horrified at how egocentric my thoughts were , as if i were still dreaming of being a rock star , or worse , as if i were a pre adolescent wishing to be batman this revelation inspired the sonnet below inferiority i thought to monitor my thought today , to watch my thinking from another space as if i had a mountain hideaway from which to look down on my hiding place i was aghast at how i fantasized myself in hero s garb persistently guru , jazz musician i super sized my ego while observing distantly what could i do ? the false self must be fed with tales of heroic intervention i d like to say , off with its fucking head ! but head in hand , it begs for more attention why must a man so amplify his worth ? self aggrandizement rises from a dearth meanwhile a change in my medication made on march continues to improve my mood i'm still rather fragile but the hollow in my chest has been filled again and i feel human , as if the spirit had been returned to my body here 's a poem from my book , unexpected light , that expresses the joy of recovering from a depression tonic i will love myself today here are some fuzzy slippers and a lollipop , a warm hug and a wet kiss let me tuck this old familiar blanket around my shoulders and read this poem before i nap whatever i do today , i ll approve if i spill milk , i ll clap if i button my shirt wrong it s a new style if i wet my pants it was on purpose my , how well i walk ! how well i speak ! it s so good to be good to myself where have i been all these sad , long years ? published in tryst for safety 's sake i'm going to rate myself at kilorat today over and out , ce
