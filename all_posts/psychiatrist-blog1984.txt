it 's am now , and i just awoke suddenly , heart pounding , frightened , unable to go back to sleep i just had a dream kinda weird dream , but ending in one of those sit bolt upright awake kind of deals might as well tell the story , since i ca n't go back to sleep so i'm sitting at my desk , leaning back in my chair , talking with a social worker about the client she just evaluated we are sitting in a small front office room , big enough for two desks and a small waiting area i mean small waiting area there are of those cheap , plastic with metal legs type of chairs the only light comes from two fluorescent , overhead fixtures , one missing it 's lens , both with only half the bulbs working , in addition to that coming from the frosted , display type , storefront windows on either side of our front door , which has a inch , metal bell on it the walls are old , cheap paneling , some with faded bits of yellow tape where signs used to hang two of the dropped ceiling tiles in a corner are stained with old water damage , the top of the paneling there buckling slightly there 's a few signs on the wall and a calendar the kind that that comes from the local car dealer turned to september , with a red convertible impala on it it 's the same calendar page i saw yesterday morning when i picked up the rental car at my car dealer while my chevy malibu was getting serviced the sunroof wo n't close i remember it because it looked a lot like my old convertible chevy malibu that i drove throughout college and medical school my first car that was a good car it was never in the shop , and i had no trouble closing the roof interesting the paneling in the dream office was the same as in the car rental office , as were the waiting room chairs well , that 's how dreams go and i'm sure it 's dinah 's mention of her writing class that has got me in this writing mood the door bell jingles and in walks a little girl can i help you ? i ask do you make home visits ? , she asks , in a surprisingly mature and succinct way we can what do you need help with ? i'm working in a small , community mental health clinic cmhc , set up just off main street in a storefront office that probably used to be a bakery or something my mom 's needs help with her depression i just live two blocks away she turns and goes out the door , standing there , waiting patiently this is just odd she does n't sound frightened or upset i tell the social worker that since there are no scheduled patients for me , i 'll go check it out i grab my jacket and my id badge and go outside , in the cool , fall air the girl starts walking , and i follow her i see that the office is in a past its prime , small town in fact , it is very much like the cmhc that dinah and i used to work in , some years ago so i follow the little girl , blond hair , probably or , dressed in a just started first grade kinda dress it 's like in the afternoon and sunny she stays ahead of me , very determined and sure of herself we walk silently she 's clearly on a mission we walk up to this block of small , one floor houses , all with front porches and mature trees in the front there 's a metal , chain link gate , but it 's open we walk up the three concrete steps , which are off kilter from tree roots pushing them up we go up the steps to the front porch and she takes out a key from her pocket and opens the door now i'm expecting this place to be a mess i have this image of a mother , laying in bed all day , with little susie six year old taking care of the house the little girl excuses herself while i stand awkwardly in the foyer it 's a nice , little home , not at all a mess i hear some murmuring , then the little girl comes back and motions me to follow her i take a deep breath and enter the small living room , where mother is sitting , dressed nicely , on a sofa chair i'm thinking , she does n't look depressed what is all this about ? i introduce myself as a psychiatrist who works with the county mental health department , and that her daughter came to us and asked for some help as i'm talking , i notice that the woman makes no eye contact with me , instead staring at her daughter the whole time , with this odd fake smile and a look that seems to silently be saying to her daughter what the hell did you do this for but i ca n't look upset about it or else something bad will happen as i'm talking , i become aware of a man dressed in a checkered , polyester suit , standing about three feet to my left , leaning against the wall , listening to me talk i'm also vaguely aware of two other , younger children so she told you i'm , did she ? he blurts out , more to himself than to me i'm talking for another minute or two and i'm getting the vibe that father is getting upset , from the looks on the mother 's face the little girl just sits there , staring straight ahead , attentive but silent , as if she 's waiting for things to fall into place all of a sudden , the father starts talking to me in a very calm , disarming voice , then suddenly changes his demeanor to intense anger and rage , precedes his action with a why , you little , then leans in towards me and violently spits in my face bold upright heart pounding i'm awake in my living room , where i 'd fallen asleep and i'm still trying to decide if it was a dream or do i need to do something i quickly realize that it was a dream , but just ca n't get back to sleep i think that i would have rushed out of the house , then called , charging the father with assault , followed by a call to child protective services the whole thing was just weird might as well get up and make some coffee
