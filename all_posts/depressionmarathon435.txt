i could fill this first paragraph with a stream of obscenities so profane it would curl your toenails i am so angry ! why ? why does someone feel the need to blow people up ? why mar a beautiful , peaceful , celebratory event like the boston marathon ? does it fill an ego with pride to permanently alter the lives of others ? to blow off the limbs of innocent spectators ? what sense does that make ? to kill an year old child ? a child whose only sin was watching a race , perhaps even watching a parent , participate in one of running 's greatest events ? why ? i first saw the horrendous footage from boston as i was working with a patient in his apartment it was all i could do to remain focused the pictures literally took my breath away i almost threw up while i'm not in boston this year , i have many friends who ran today my mind immediately went to them fortunately , facebook recently confirmed they are all okay the bomb at the finish line blew at someone researched this that 's a fairly average finishing time , thus insuring maximum impact boylston street , which is the last half mile of the race , is also likely packed with more spectators in closer proximity to each other than anywhere else on the course i 've been on that street i 've run across that finish line in fact , last year i believe i crossed that finish line around that could have been me in the middle of those horrifying pictures i'm safe it appears my friends and their families are safe for that , i'm grateful there are at least two families who will never see their loved one again multiple spectators , whose limbs were literally torn off by the blast , will never have the same life again a beautiful , historical , celebration was turned into a grizzly slaughterhouse why ? what is the point ? senseless absolutely senseless
