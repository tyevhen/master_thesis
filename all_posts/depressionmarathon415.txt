i'm at least a day late in this update as i stated in my last post , i 've been busy living life on life 's terms this week i'm getting a lot of stuff done , but when it came time to sit down and write last evening , i just could n't do it i tried to figure out my new smart phone instead i would have been much more successful if i had stuck to blogging i might be the last person on the planet to get a smart phone it 's a samsung galaxy , and i found out this morning i neglected to learn how to answer it ! my parents , whose call i missed , got a big kick out of that one ! they are and years old , and they both have iphones ! you may think i am wise with technology , after all i am a blogger , but nothing could be further from the truth ! i am a complete dope with this new phone , and i really dislike the entire learning process i have a feeling it 's going to take me awhile ! i also missed a call from d still do n't know how to answer the damn thing ! no worries , i'm laughing , too the other reason i did n't write last night is because i am again feeling bad about having little to say i think most people expect a bit more than news about how dumb i am with my new smart phone when they come to my blog i am not so arrogant to think people are interested in the mundane minutia of my life , but mundane minutia is all i 've got right now of course , mundane is better than drama there is no drama my life is moving along smoothly i stick to my daily routines i go to work i enjoy my running i take my meds i see my doctor i do n't drink i attend meetings i do n't get too high or too low it may look boring from the outside , but it seems to be working for me i'm living well with depression i guess that 's something to write about now , back to that damn smart phone !
