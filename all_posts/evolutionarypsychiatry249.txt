i had forgotten that the good dr su sent me a link to a dietary trial of ketogenic diets in kids with autism a few months ago he reminded me of this himself when he quoted some comments i made in a recent blog post , but then paleo guy extraordinaire earned bonus margarita mixes for his machine by reminding me yet again and sending me a link to a complimentary paper that is an excellent review of ketosis in general i will get back to posting on sleep it 's just the continuing sleep deprivation i 've been experiencing makes the reading of the sleep textbook a bit too painful however , i'm committed to restoring good sleep hygiene habits and no more twitter at am in addition , each little beastie now has an led nightlight play toy thingie that switches off after minutes they get huggable freedom from fear of the dark , and we all get blessed nighttime blackness win win we 'll just ignore the shutting down of the melatonin with the minutes of led glow it 's better than leaving the hall light on all night right dr su 's paper it is a study of kids from crete with autism who were placed on a ketogenic diet for months in they went on a john radcliffe version of a ketogenic diet , consisting of medium chain triglyceride oil , fresh cream , saturated fat oops ! overshooting the usda guidelines by a bit , carbohydrates , and protein along with vitamin and mineral supplements the kids were placed on the diet in week intervals , followed by weeks of anything goes , so on and off the kids' urine was tested with ketostix and their serum checked for beta hydroxybutyrate a ketone to measure the amount of ketosis after months , the diets were discontinued , and the kids were evaluated monthly for another months at the beginning of the study , of the kids met criteria for mild autism , the rest were more severe interestingly enough the premise of the study was to presumably improve mitochondrial efficiency in the brain via ketosis using ketone bodies as fuel rather than glucose years later a small study did in fact confirm that kids with autism often have problems with mitochondrial efficiency kids tolerated the diet beyond the initial weeks , and of those , more discontinued the diet due to lack of improvement during the first few cycles of the remaining kids , two boys improved enough in symptoms to be taken out of the special school and placed in mainstream education overall the ketogenic kids presented with improvements in their social behavior and interactions , speech , cooperation , stereotypy , and hyperactivity , which contributed significantly to their improvement in learning the kids who did not stay on the diet were the most severely affected by autism , and the ones who had the best response were ones most mildly affected another interesting fact from the study is that the kids maintained their improvements through the two week washout periods and in the months after the study was over none of the kids had any complications such as poor weight gain or selenium deficiency seen in other trials of ketogenic diets in kids with epilepsy overall using the original sample size of , of the kids benefited significantly from the diet the researchers also have a nice explanatory paragraph about the biochemistry of ketosis and how it favors the relaxing inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba over the excitatory , and in excess , neurotoxic glutamate the increase of ketone bodies maintains the synaptosomal content of aminobutyric acid gaba at a higher level , a phenomenon that may contribute to the beneficial effect of a ketogenic diet in children with epilepsy and perhaps children with autistic behavior other researchers , in an attempt to clarify the manner in which ketone bodies increase the synaptosomal content of gaba , showed that the metabolism of ketone bodies to acetyl coenyzme a results in a decrease of the pool of brain oxaloacetate , which is consumed in the citrate synthetase reaction as less oxaloacetate is available for the aspartate aminotransferase reaction , thereby lowering the rate of glutamate transamination , more glutamate becomes accessible to the glutamate decarboxylase pathway , thus favoring the synthesis of gaba could n't have said it better myself ! well , this was n't a large study or a blinded study and there was no control , but for some kids , the improvement was exceptional , and ketosis did n't have to be strictly maintained my personal preference is not to live in ketosis , but rather to dip in on occasion via or hour fasting and some very low carb breakfasts after overnight fasts this study seems to suggest that dipping into ketosis can have benefit for brain energetics , though the kids went through a larger scale dip than i ever have and , once again , dietary therapies prove to be exceedingly beneficial for some , but wo n't do much of anything for others it would be important for any parent of an autistic child to know that ahead of time before pinning one 's hope on a ketogenic diet on the other hand , autism is currently incurable , and a ketogenic diet seems like a nice weapon to have in the arsenal against this disease put in the links and fixed some of those bizarre sentence structures i should n't be allowed to blog when sleep deprived edited to add links to the rest of my posts on autism i cover gluten free diets , inflammation , mitochondria , vitamin d , theories about the pathology diet and autism diet and autism autism and vitamin d autism inflammation speculation brain efficiency , pediatric edition autism and interpregnancy interval
