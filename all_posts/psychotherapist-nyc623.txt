often , when clients begin psychotherapy , they discover that there are many aspects of themselves that they are unaware of , especially if they 've never been in therapy before one of the main goals of psychotherapy is for the unconscious to become conscious for these clients making the unconscious conscious is a common phrase in psychotherapy , but what does it mean ? psychotherapy making the unconscious conscious a couple of examples , which are fictionalized scenarios , might help to shed some light john when john began psychotherapy for the first time , when he was in his late s , he was adamant that he never got angry towards anyone or anything his attitude was that it did n't make sense to get angry , so he never felt this he came to therapy because he was having panic attacks one of the first things that his therapist observed about john was that he was very tense he had deep frown marks between his eyes , and the muscles in his face and throughout his body were tight he had frequent gastrointestinal problems , asthma , insomnia , and joint pain , none of which his specialists were able to regulate with medication even though john said he never got angry , he looked angry most of the time and , it was apparent to his therapist and most people who knew him that he had been angry for many years , but he was n't aware of it he was defended against it , on an unconscious level , because he felt it was bad to be angry over time , as john developed trust in his therapist , he became more open to exploring his anger as he worked through his anger , most of his physical symptoms , which were psychophysiological in origin , disappeared it was apparent that , because his anger was so unconscious , he carried it in his body until the unconscious in this case , his anger became conscious mary mary 's parents were emotionally neglectful when she was growing up they provided her with a home , food clothing and basic necessities , but they were emotionallly unavailable to her she began therapy in her early s , because she was feeling depressed her initial attitude in therapy , which was unconscious , was that , my therapist should make me better she had no awareness that her attitude stemmed from a childhood of emotional neglect and the inner child part of her wanted the therapist to be a mother to her when this did n't occur , mary became enraged she almost left therapy several times because she could n't tolerate that her therapist could n't make her better she refused to do any of the work and she all but stamped her foot to demand that her therapist do the therapy work for her fortunately , even though it was difficult for her , she was able to tolerate being in therapy long enough to discover her unconscious wish to have the therapist mother her as if she were a baby after doing inner child work with her therapist , with assistance from her therapist , she learned to nurture her inner child and her attitude changed to one of a mature woman if she had not stuck it out in therapy , the unconscious would not have become conscious for her , and she probably would n't have changed making the unconscious conscious is one aspect of therapy , but it 's an important one it 's not always easy to face , but change is often not easy until we 're willing to discover and explore our unconscious attitudes , meaningful transformation remains elusive i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
