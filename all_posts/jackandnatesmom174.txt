dear dr oz , i hate you right now i have been interested in doing a cleanse for awhile i feel sluggish , i have been dieting for months and working out and losing nothing and not like fake dieting , really dieting and really running nothing on friday i set my mind to it and looked for what seemed like a pretty natural cleanse that was n't too too long here is what i came up with http www doctoroz com videos dr ozs day detox cleanse one sheet only days right ? smoothies ca n't be that bad and honestly , it has n't been that being said , i am on day right now i have chewed nothing in almost days i have slept more than usual , i drink water like a fish i cheat though and use lime instead of lemon in my water gasp , and sometimes i even add a little stevia just so i feel like i'm drinking something i like the baths , those are nice but there are some other issues let me just say flax seed , gritty also , no amount of pineapple can make the lunch smootie more tolerable with stalks of celery , a cup of kale and a cucumber the dinner smoothie would actually be pretty good except for the freaking cayenne pepper sigh sadly i am looking forward to my nasty green smoothie today i am that hungry right now and this is after i had to take it upstairs to drink it on saturday my husband was not doing a very good job of keeping a straight face while i tried to chug that crap i needed privacy for that oh , and john , thanks bunches for barbecuing all weekend long ! not the burgers last night smelled awful , as did the barbecued chicken on saturday night just a little bitter , lol breakfast smoothie good stuff in fact , i may continue that one for breakfast from now on good way to get spinach in and flax seed i plan to start the day diet once i finish this , which i have had great success with in the past and frankly now it will feel like a feast hopefully this helps my metabolism , because i am officially over this whole cleanse thing but i will soldier on i have n't tortured myself for this long only to quit
