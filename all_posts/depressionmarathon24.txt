i am officially finished with my ketamine clinical trial i had my seventh and final infusion on thursday i'm extremely pleased to report the ketamine worked i feel almost back to normal i'm working , exercising , smiling , laughing , and have some energy again i'm so relieved to be past another severe depression episode this makes me two for two in alternative depression treatments this spring successful treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation led to resolution of one of the worst , if not the worst , depression relapses i 've ever experienced now i 've had success with ketamine , too i'm really lucky to have had access to both of these cutting edge treatments and is n't it too bad they are n't readily available to more people suffering with severe depression hopefully , my participation in this ketamine trial will lead to more widespread use there may be some movement for me on the running front as well over the last week , i ran a couple of times on the alter g gravity eliminating treadmill at of my body weight eliminating of my body weight allowed me to run for minutes at a time with fairly decent form despite continued leg weakness and foot drop that was kind of exciting not one to settle , or practice patience , i took it one step further tonight i ran a few minutes at a time outside it was n't terribly pretty , but i just had to try once again my stride is significantly altered secondary to the foot drop , and it was n't easy i do think i'm getting a little stronger that 's hopeful unfortunately there is still an awful long way to go if i'm ever to run again as i used to run i'm trying to stay hopeful , nonetheless that 's all i 've got today carry on , my friends
