as discussed for damp heat , in phlegm heat , the primary aspect is the phlegm rather than the heat it is phlegm that is hot rather than the heat having phlegm in a similar way as we said for damp heat , a better name would be hot phlegm rather than phlegm heat this has important implications in treatment as this should be aimed at resolving phlegm primarily and clearing heat secondarily interestingly , the chinese character for phlegm is based on the radical for disease and that for fire twice this would seem to imply that phlegm derives from heat indeed , in many cases it does but we should remember that phlegm is also frequently combined with cold aetiology emotional stress emotional stress in the beginning stages leads to qi deficiency or qi stagnation and sometimes both phlegm is a pathological accumulation of fluids which itself derives either from qi deficiency or qi stagnation or both as it is qi that transforms , transports and excretes fluids therefore both qi deficiency or qi stagnation in time may lead to the accumulation of fluids and to phlegm however , please note that there is no emotion that would be lead to phlegm directly , e g we could not say anger leads to phlegm each emotion would cause a derangement of qi first li ding says phlegm is due to the accumulation of qi deriving from the seven emotions however , there are quotations from chinese doctors who say that emotional stress leads to phlegm for example , chen wu says the seven emotions cause chaos and lead to phlegm li yong cui says shock , fear , worry and pensiveness lead to phlegm most emotions initially cause qi stagnation and it is important to stress that many organs , not just the liver , may suffer from qi stagnation indeed , in the mental emotional field , the heart and lungs frequently suffer from qi stagnation from worry , sadness and grief a modern chinese book says when emotions cause stagnation of liver qi this impairs the spleen transformation which leads to phlegm or emotional stress may lead to qi stagnation which may turn into fire this condenses the body fluids and leads to phlegm figure illustrates the derangement of qi from emotional stress figure derangement of qi from emotional stress diet diet is of course an important aetiological factor leading to phlegm the excessive consumption of greasy foods , sugar , sweets and dairy foods leads to phlegm overeating itself is also a cause of phlegm in the particular case of phlegm heat , this is often due to the excessive consumption of greasy foods together with that of alcohol excessive physical work excessive physical work weakens the spleen and this leads to phlegm dampness long term retention of dampness easily leads to phlegm pathology phlegm is always due to a pathology of the transformation , movement and excretion of fluids this involves a dysfunction of many organs , e g lungs , spleen , stomach , kidneys , liver , bladder , intestines and triple burner figure illustrates the dysfunction of the fluids metabolism leading to phlegm figure dysfunction of the fluids metabolism leading to phlegm types of phlegm heat there are many types of phlegm as this can combine with cold , dampness , heat or wind when diagnosing phlegm heat , i make a basic distinction between phlegm heat on a physical or mental emotional level of course , this may seem a complete contradiction of the fundamental characteristic of chinese medicine , i e the unity of body and mind however , with this distinction , i mean cases of actual phlegm sputum in the lungs following invasions of wind as opposed to those of non actual phlegm but of phlegm obstructing the shen the two are very different situations with different aetiology , pathology and treatment on a physical level , phlegm heat affects primarily the lungs but also the stomach and liver on a mental emotional level , phlegm heat affects the heart and liver phlegm heat on a physical level always presents with profuse expectoration of sputum and often cough phlegm heat on a mental emotional level does not necessarily present with the expectoration of actual sputum the main symptoms of phlegm in the latter case would be a feeling of oppression of the chest , a swollen tongue and a slippery pulse however , in cases of mental emotional phlegm heat , there may also be the occasional expectoration of scanty sputum this may also be just the expectoration of some sputum just once in the morning of course , such a distinction between physical and mental emotional conditions should not be taken too rigidly as phlegm heat on a physical level may of course affect the shen however , this distinction is important for the choice of herbal treatment phlegm heat on a physical level phlegm heat on a physical level may be acute or chronic acute phlegm heat in acute cases , phlegm heat is the consequence of an invasion of external wind that has penetrated into the interior and changed into heat the dysfunction of the stomach and spleen caused by the pathogenic factors contributes to the formation of phlegm this combines with heat to form phlegm heat which settles in the lungs this is the most common consequence of an invasion of external wind this causes the cough with expectoration of yellow sputum that comes after the beginning stages of a cold or influenza this is a very common consequence of invasions of wind and , in the context of the levels , it corresponds to the qi level the formula for the acute form of phlegm heat in the lungs is qing qi hua tan tang clearing qi and resolving phlegm decoction the points i use for phlegm heat in the lungs are lu lieque , lu chize , ren tiantu , lu zhongfu , bl feishu , st fenglong chronic phlegm heat chronic phlegm heat in the lungs is usually the consequence of a residual phlegm heat in the lungs following an invasion or repeated invasions of external wind this happens when the external pathogenic factor penetrates into the interior to form phlegm heat , the patient appears to get better but there is a residual phlegm heat in the lungs this is more likely to occur if the patient takes antibiotics often there are no symptoms of the phlegm heat except on the tongue the front third of the tongue lung area will be swollen and slightly red this area may also have red points which indicates that the heat is pronounced swollen and red front third red front third with red points the formula i use for chronic phlegm heat in the lungs is wen dan tang warming the gall bladder decoction with the addition of gua lou fructus trichosanthis and sang bai pi cortex mori with acupuncture , i use lu chize , lu lieque , ren shanzhong , bl feishu , p neiguan , st fenglong phlegm heat on a mental emotional level phlegm heat has a deep effect on the shen because heat agitates it and phlegm obstructs it agitation of the shen causes anxiety and insomnia while obstruction of the shen causes mental confusion , some obsessive behaviour and occasionally a slight manic behaviour when to an extreme degree , phlegm heat in the heart may cause severe mental illness e g bipolar disease or schizophrenia on a physical level , this shen disturbance is felt in the chest with a feeling of oppression of the chest other symptoms include sighing and perhaps the occasional expectoration of scanty sputum for this pattern , i use the same formula as above i e wen dan tang warming the gall bladder decoction with the addition of yuan zhi radix polygalae , shi chang pu rhizoma acori tatarinowii and gua lou
