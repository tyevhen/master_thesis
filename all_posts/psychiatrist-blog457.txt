i am basically an optimist i think i feel hopeful about most things , and i have this funny faith that people are basically good when people come to see me and they are severely depressed , i think they are going to get better mostly , they are kind enough to humor me and they do get better the statistics seem to suggest that ssri 's work of the time , and while that does seem to be true for the first go around , i 've found that if i fiddle with the medicines , augment , switch , augment , tweak , that many more than of people get better if someone is doing well , and suddenly feels down , i encourage them to return soon , talk about it a bit , and do n't rush to changing the medicines at the first sign of the meds are n't working and i'm a little down often but not always , people get better without increasing or changing medications clearly , though , my practice is not the stuff of double blind placebo controlled studies i tell people they will get better , i look for the good in them , and i encourage people to look for their strengths and try to get the good parts of who they are to work for them some people would say this is wrong i should n't tell people they are going to get better how could i know that ? experience , and i may be offering false hope i may be and i 've had at least one patient tell me that i try to normalize problematic behaviors most patients , however , seem to feel encouraged by my optimism , and boosted by the good things i see in them ah , remember my post from long ago what i like about you another psychiatrist i know says he thinks you have to be an optimist in order to be a good psychiatrist really ? i do n't know about that i'm kind of optimistic that pessimists can also be good psychiatrists what do you think ? ah , comment moderation is on for the time being because some of our commenters have been shaking my generally positive faith in humanity and i find myself feeling a bit pessimistic about blogging as always , it 's not the message , it 's the delivery please do listen to podcast !
