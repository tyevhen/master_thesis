today i spent seven hours preparing a new poetry manuscript for a publisher i was to meet at a talk tonight to cherry pick your work for a california theme he 's a regional publisher , re format each poem , revise a little as you go i can never resist , format a manuscript , research acknowledgments , put in a full bio , and be happy with it normally this takes me weeks , even months they say luck is where preparation meets opportunity i worked hard to prepare for the opportunity , and got to pitch both my from california book of poems and my book length collection of stories about growing up in the s in suburban la to a real publisher who would read them malcom seemed surprised and pleased i do not expect him to publish me , and i'm not saying this to defend myself against disappointment i really do n't expect him to be the one , but i reorganized my art around his publishing interests , which i think is smart and fair to art besides , the poems are good ! i 'll paste one in below i 've been given a new nickname by a mendo brother , ravensbear because i'm of the raven clan , as in the tlingit indians , and i'm also a large and slightly immovable omniverous object like a bear in my travel i 've also been initiated into the crow nation black birds and yo , i do n't know why wherever i go i see ravens they are my spirit guides sometimes it seems as if i can talk to them i'm a fair mimic i just appeared on the cover and back cover of the sigurd journal , a print journal you have to order , as well as in another print journal , hawk and whipporwill , whose website mentions my poem but does n't provide a copy online , you have to order i 've been accepted as featured poet for quill and parchment in september , will be in an anthology with some famous dead poets in crazed by the sun , due out in july , and i 've had poems accepted by a capella zoo , shakespeare 's monkeys , blue fifth review , and autumn sky i 'll post what links i have later when everything is up it is nice to be published it makes me feel good , like i'm wanted everybody wants to be wanted , but many writers are social retards who have to have their work wanted to feel wanted themselves i know i have people in my life that love me for myself and that 's enough , more than enough , a luxury on earth to get some recognition for your work as well is frosting on the cake , truly my life 's work is to be a good man i saw my first river otter today in a small pond outside the restaurant where malcom margolin spoke to us about his heyday press great guy and raconteur , writer , publisher , editor , having survived berkeley in the s and sustained a publishing business through it i thought that impressive he was also , obviously , a happy man you can create your own universe around you as a life for me it happend in publishing his press has some fascinating books , as in the history of the black utopia village , allenstown , founded in central california in , or a japanese artist 's drawing of the mountains from an internment camp classy stuff he talked about beauty a lot , and how the superfluity of beauty made him happy , how he , as a publisher , got to dip his cup in the beauty of literature laid at his doorstep thin and bald with glasses and a great beard , very ginsbergian in appearance , he still seemed a new york transplant i did wonder about his mustache i'm always suspicious that men with mustaches hanging way over their teeth must have bad teeth else good tasting hair here i am , talking bad teeth kathleen recently went through an abscess formation in her gum after a root canal no , i do n't want to go there all in a day 's work poem below kilobunny , ce this poem is set in la in poems for california pawn my head is beaten like a sunflower , bowed and haggard , brown petals hanging like loose , carnivorous teeth , my face a pale mosaic of shell ends it was n't the sun that did this , i tell myself , whose radiation feeds each mouth , root , and field , whose random electromagnetic signals form a proper background noise as in a waterfall it must be satellites and cell phones leaving these trails in my cloud chamber does anything stop neutrinos ? at some basal level like the sodium potassium pump , is n't my brain affected ? schizophrenics believe monolithic transmitters speak to receivers in their heads , but i never gave their stories credence before i feel bombarded , beaten down by the sun like a sagging sunflower awaiting the arrival of birds to pick my cortex clean the brain floats in water like the great turtle on which the world was built , but bone is not casing enough to shield me from the swarm of signals who can prove to me that i am not controlled by secret hieroglyphics carved on the tiniest neuron like a microchip ?
