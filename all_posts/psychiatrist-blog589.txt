ooooh , let me tell you i love vacation i really love vacation i'm back it 's cold here , and i spent the day unpacking and doing laundry , and getting ready to start my week i returned calls , went in to the office and checked my mail , emailed , postal mailed , and watched the ducks win the rose bowl sad , because even though we shrink rappers like ducks , i have my own personal badger out in pasadena cheering for wisconsin , and it 's a sad football day for him , i'm sure roy did a great job of holding down the blog please give him a hand clink was off on another one of her adventures for some reason , vacation is not fun for her if there is n't the possibility that she 'll fall thousands of feet , get eaten by some form of wildlife , or have her life depend on properly functioning equipment while she gurgles beneath the sea she 's the only person i know where i had a fantastic time is followed by an injury report roy 's happy new year duck was taken from the havre de grace annual new year 's duck drop from the aegis it was a glorious night for ringing in a new year temperatures , unusually inviting for a new year 's eve in harford county , hovered around wind was non existent and many people had gathered around the havre de grace middle school grounds for the annual duck drop and fireworks to welcome another new year in other stories around the web , if you 're a distracted duck , you might have notice that it 's hard to find ritalin or adderall perhaps another example of dea limits allowing big pharma to be being overly ducky about reducing supply of the cheaper , generic medications from the the new york times , do check out a d h d drug shortage has patients scrambling and if you 're a duck contemplating filing for social security disability , do read dr steve 's post on thought broadcast about the curious psychology of disability with comments on that post , i'm going to swim away from the temptation to comment myself and finally , for those ducks who want to know the latest on electronic medical records , check out shrink rap news over on cpn for notes from samhsa 's ehr summit if that does n't make you want to be served up with orange sauce , then nothing will so i love vacation , but i did miss all the shrink rappin ' happy new year to everyone ! from clink i do n't have a duck in this race , so i thought folks might enjoy a seahorse instead he 's black with white stripes and seems to be perched on top of the green moray eel 's head yes , the eel was that close no significant injuries this time a slight jellyfish sting and lots of no see 'ums , that 's it
