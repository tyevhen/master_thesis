as you know from recent posts , my depression has sucked the life out of me lately specifically , my thoughts have been disorganized , obsessive , destructive , and confused i 've lost time apparently meaning i 've forgotten or just not registered some of the more difficult moments over the past couple days i 've semi functioned , but something had to be done about my brain ! my psychiatrist and i decided today to try a prn of a med that had previously been helpful when my thinking had become so troublesome i took a tiny dose mid morning , and it definitely made an impact i could n't get out of bed the rest of the day ! ! it knocked me out cold for over six hours ! i slept , and slept , and slept i attempted to get up twice , but it was futile , so i slept some more i do feel better my brain feels a bit more like my own i guess that was one way to get it to quiet down knock it out ! ! so much for any plans i had for today but , like i said , i do feel better let 's hope tomorrow continues more of the same , but maybe with less sleep
