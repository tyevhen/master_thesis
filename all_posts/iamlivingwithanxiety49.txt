at this time of year , many most ? americans resolve to have a more active lifestyle we usually focus on the physical aspects of exercise , such as weight loss , reduced blood pressure , presumed better looks , and so on but dr low teaches that moving our muscles has another important benefit reducing our angry and fearful temper in this case i'm not talking about moving one 's muscles to overcome a fear , such as having the will to board an airplane if you fear flying i'm talking about the useful benefits of exercise in improving our mental health i do n't enjoy exercising , though i had a gym membership once , but i felt very uncomfortable there , intimidated by all of the fit and trim people now that i'm in recovery , i would have taken a different attitude toward that experience , but in general i do n't enjoy peddling on a bike for minutes or lifting weights repetitiously i do enjoy being active , though , whether that is working in the yard or strolling through a park when i move my muscles i can feel tension , anger , and fear drain away , and i need to practice being more active to improve my mental health so my new year 's resolution is to be more active in to achieve this goal , i hope to take more walks daily if possible i'm not going to scold myself if i do n't feel i'm doing enough , as it 's average to be enthuisastic about new year 's resolutions but then have that attitude fade over time but if i lower my standards , my performance will rise , as dr low suggests and as i'm walking in the bitter winter cold i can endorse myself all the way for making my mental health a business
