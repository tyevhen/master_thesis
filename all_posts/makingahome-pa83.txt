ms singer and i have been busy lately here 's what we 've been up to this pillow i got this idea to add a crocheted doily from fine linen private blog so i ca n't link to it i had this soft burlap like fabric in my stash and it was just enough to make this pillow i stitched on the doily after i had the pillow completed lastly , i added this vintage button i think i 'd like to make more of these pillows to give as gifts i 'll have to keep my eye out for more crocheted doilies at the thrift stores with the scraps , i made these multipurpose c mas tree ornaments gift card holders i can use these to give gift cards in and the receivers can then hang them on their tree a perfect way to use up fabric scraps ! i also made this longer pillow out of red ticking fabric and some coarse burlap i had i think i 'll stencil a word onto the face of the burlap i just have n't decided which word i want to use yet ric rac trim i frayed the edges of the burlap for a more rustic look i 've come to the conclusion that i 'd sew a lot more often if my sewing machine was sitting out somewhere all the time it 's been gracing my kitchen table for the last couple of days , and i 've been so inspired to use it when it 's staring me in the face
