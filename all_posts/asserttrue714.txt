yesterday , to surprisingly little fanfare , google started fulfilling invites to its new google voice service , which was announced back in march this is essentially the culmination of google 's grandcentral acquisition of , but have no doubt , it 's not the end of the story it 's the beginning of one it 's hard to sound bite gvox ostensibly , it 's a way to sign up for a single vanity phone number that lets you do voicemail and sms text retrieval using voip from any device according to google google voice improves the way you use your phone you can get transcripts of your voicemail and archive and search all of the sms text messages you send and receive you can also use the service to make low priced international calls and easily access goog directory assistance if that sounds boring , it 's because it is but i think it may be a handful of frost scraped off the tip of a big icy thing floating in the ocean if all gvox did were to offer superior service to verizon 's visual voicemail , it would be a significant advance but there 's the potential for more much more even before the grandcentral acquisition , google had big plans in the voip and mobile domains you have to look no farther than united states patent application to get a hint of what i mean but use your imagination if your cell phone becomes a gateway to android cloud apps , you 've essentially got the power to retool your phone with a virtualized os , and obtain access to web apps galore in fact , with a little sleight of hand , gvox can give the appearance of completely reskinning your phone and offering a whole new menu system want to store your address book in the gvox cloud ? done get auto complete as you enter phone numbers ? do google white pages lookups ? do reverse phone lookups ? record a podcast and store it in the cloud ? upload a cell phone video to youtube in a single speed dial click ? you get the idea let your imagination ahem roam one thing i wish gvox would do that i do n't think it does yet is full many to many mappings of phone numbers right now you just get a one to many mapping of a vanity number to all your other numbers , which is handy enough because it means people can always reach you with just a single phone number , but i think it would be cool especially if you 're a marketer to have the ability to map many phone number aliases to a single target number and get advanced analytics for the resultant traffic who called from which number ? which ad or blog placement or campaign was the number associated with ? etc etc we 'll probably get all that and more as i say , right now , on the surface , google voice does n't sound all that exciting but under the surface , there 's a whole new world waiting the internet is your new dial tone
