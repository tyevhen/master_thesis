my beloved cat gus died today at the age of it should n't have been a surprise , but it seems that death so often catches us somewhat by surprise gus had been frail this past year , losing weight and strength his weight loss accelerated by april and i began to worry about leaving him for a long planned trip to hawaii to visit my dear friend jeanne who has been ill a vet at a nearby clinic was reassuring his lab work is fine , she said his kidneys are in great shape he does n't have diabetes he 's just old oh , it 's possible that he could have intestinal cancer , but it 's very costly to diagnose and would be hard to treat successfully at his age try some of this special food and see how he does i'm sure it will be fine to leave him so we left , with our neighbor kelly , who has a small pet sitting business , minding our cats her emails were upbeat , but concerned gus was eating enthusiastically , but was still losing weight i asked her about gastrointestinal problems yes but manageable she fought hard to keep him healthy , to keep him alive , while we were gone with massages and hand feeding and cuddling and daily encouragement and we were thrilled when he met us at the door when we returned late last wednesday but his appearance was a shock his weight loss had gone into overdrive and his fur hung like an oversized coat on a body defined by prominent bones he was ravenously hungry but his system could no longer process food he had projectile diarrhea as the week went on , he stopped grooming himself and , quite uncharacteristically , was smelly and unkempt a lifelong model of calm with an even temper and loving nature , he was suddenly cranky and whined constantly his weight had plummeted from pounds last year to a fraction over five pounds but he still purred whenever i touched him , still melted into my arms when i picked him up , still took my hand in his paws and rubbed it all over his face things he has done since we adopted him and his brother timmy as seven week old kittens back in he was still in so many ways himself when would we know to let go ? gus r and timmy cuddle up to bob in loving brothers timmy and gus in loving companions hammie and gus gus , hammie , maggie and sweet pea shockingly thin gus in june he would brighten , then decline in an endless loop over the next few days but i could see a steadier decline yesterday , watching him struggle to walk and to sit and to lie down , tottering on uncertain limbs and then there was last night while gus usually preferred to start his nights on the living room couch , i looked over to the corner of the bedroom last night as i was turning in and saw him curled up in the little bed he had had since kittenhood and i said a quiet prayer that he would pass away quietly and peacefully in that little bed gus settling in for his last night june , but at a m , i was suddenly awakened by the sound of very loud purring beside me i could hear it through sleep and the ear plugs i often wear if bob is snoring i was astonished to see gus standing beside me , purring and rubbing his face against mine then he settled on my chest , still purring , his paws embracing me every time i would drift off to sleep , he would rub or touch my face , seeming to beg stay with me i had a sense that he was saying a very personal , very loving goodbye with the last of his strength as the night went on , there was another round of dashes to the cat box with explosive diarrhea , crying , wincing with pain when i touched his stomach whimpering , he cuddled close and i knew it was time bob called the veterinary clinic before dawn and we set off with gus several hours later , choking back the pain behind our ordinary conversation , reassuring gus who lay moaning in his carrier i longed for our former vet in california from whom we had adopted gus and timmy , someone who knew him and would understand the magnitude of this loss that loomed before us but at this seemingly impersonal clinic , they did understand , creating a peaceful , supportive , caring environment , letting us have time to express our love to gus before and after his sedation and the ultimate heart stopping injection and to linger afterwards to caress him and to cry over this wonderful animal companion who had meant so much to us over the years he was the only cat we had who had known every one of our other cats in our year adventure in sharing our lives with a series of unique and loving cats gus also truly raised our current generation maggie , , sweet pea , , and hammie , from kittenhood he was the cat who always purred , loved to be held and was invariably sweet and caring in the worst of times as we stood there today , stroking and holding gus as his life ebbed away , we talked wistfully of the possibility of an afterlife , of a rainbow bridge where we might despite all of our religious doubts meet again with our beloved gus , with timmy and freddie and marina we imagined how happy he would be to see his littermate timmy , dead seven years and one month to the day we hoped we dreamed and we said goodbye godspeed , sweet gus may you discard your elderly , ill body like an old coat and soar into a new life of unending love and adventure i hope , bob said , stroking his still warm body i hope if there is such a thing as reincarnation , that gus will have another life as the highest order being possible he paused and thought about it maybe this was the highest order , he said maybe cats and dogs are closer to perfection than we are i ca n't help but think that may be so at least in gus' case he was perfect perfectly loving , perfectly wonderful , perfectly gus we 'll love and miss him forever
