i 've been feeling a bit restless , irritable and discontent lately no particular reason just me being me me focusing too much on me , as my sponsor so nicely observed thanks , k so on my run today , i practiced something i learned long ago but do n't do often enough in dbt it 's referred to as mindfulness it 's a meditative technique which , when i practice it , helps me focus on something other than my own restlessness like i said , today i did it on my run running meditation is probably the only way i 'll ever succeed at meditating meditation does n't sit well with me , because i rarely have the patience to sit and practice it sitting quietly in an attempt to meditate makes me more anxious ! i 've long since given up trying , even though it 's supposed to be an integral part of my recovery program maybe someday i 'll grow into it while running a hard workout today , however , i realized i was actually practicing a form of meditation mindfulness my training schedule called for a speed workout specifically , i was to run reps of hard followed by minute recovery within my mile run one minute and thirty seconds of hard running doesn t seem like a lot on paper , but you d be amazed how long lasts when you re running hard , especially on reps , , and ten to keep my mind off my increasingly heavy legs , burning lungs , and racing heart rate , i counted my steps yup simple as that i counted my steps but again , it only sounds simple with distracting traffic , pedestrians , the urge to look continually at my watch , my fast pace i e counting very fast , and heavy legs , burning lungs , and racing heart counting from got a bit more complicated was i on or ? i found i really had to focus on the numbers , at times even visualizing them , or i quickly lost track of where i was a few times , i found myself stuck on the same number repeatedly or jumping from to instead of it was challenging it was mindful it kept me from focusing on my effort read pain ! and helped me through a tough run it helped me get out of myself , and i felt very satisfied once done maybe i m not as hopeless as i thought maybe meditation isn t such a far flung idea for me maybe meditation can be something other than sitting on a pillow chanting , ooohhhmmmm maybe
