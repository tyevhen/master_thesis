well i went to the wedding today that i have been stressing over ever since i got the invite at first i did n't know if i would even go but after all of you commented about how i should go , i knew i had to i did n't want to let all of you down i was really really scared and i knew it would be hard but i also knew i would regret it if i did n't go while i was getting ready i was listening to a song , addicted by kelly clarkson in the song she says i know i let you have all the power and that really hit me i thought , for all the worrying and thought that i am putting into what could happen , i am really giving up my power and giving it to everyone i am worrying about i also thought about the quote from eleanor roosevelt , no one can make you feel inferior without your consent so i went with that in mind along with a few reassuring positive statements to help me feel a little more confident another thing when i am nervous about some event , i always want to buy a new outfit to wear to it because wearing something new just makes me feel more confident for some reason i think its a girl thing so i was really wanting a killer outfit but honestly , i knew it was n't a good time for such a splurge and so i decided instead i would try really hard to be comfortable in my own skin this meant wearing something i already had in my closet that does n't mean that i did n't spend all morning curling my hair and getting ready when i got there i was immediately greeted by the groom 's sister who is a dear friend of mine from high school as well it was soooo good to see her ! she and her parents were genuinely thrilled to see me too ! it was very sweet i saw and reconnected with a handful of people that really meant a lot to me growing up the ex boyfriend that i was sure would be there and i had spent so much time worrying over the inevitable confrontation was n't even there the only one there from his family was a little brother whom i have always felt hated me and his new wife i was n't invited to that wedding go figure it was awkward at first and i said hello and just ignored them the rest of the time i was decorating the groom 's car when this little brother and his wife came out to talk with me and catch up and even though it was awkward when i first saw him and my thoughts were racing about him judging me , at this moment , i did n't care at all we caught up and i felt genuinely happy to be me , happy to be where i was , and not caring a bit what he thought about it i left feeling very proud of myself and happy that i did n't give in to the fear because the rewards of those i got to see and hug and smile with really made it all worth it so thank you for motivating me to go ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like be assertive ? anxiety of jury selection should be a reality tv show success exists and i'm on top of the world a year later same scenario , different outcome linkwithin
