x factor season has crept up on us once again and the only thing i can think about whilst watching the thousands of hopefuls sing their hearts out , in search for their minutes of fame or five years of fame if you 're one direction , is how absolutely incredible cheryl fernandez versini cole looks ! her makeup has been looking stunning recently but the one look that really caught my eye was the smokey bronze cut crease look she was sporting on saturday night i decided to attempt a slightly more toned down version of her makeup but if you wanted the full on cheryl look some falsies and some black shadow will do the trick ! the most stand out part of cheryl 's look was her very defined cut crease i created this by applying brown eyeliner use black for a stronger , smokier look right on the crease of my eye and blending to create a soft but very prominent and defined crease i applied a soft brown transition colour above this , working towards my brow bone , and smoking out the outer corners of my eye with a deep , rich brown eyeshadow i then applied a mix of mac 's woodwinked and naked lunch on my lids and smoked out some brown liner on my lower lash line and water line again , you could use black for a more dramatic look next it was liquid liner , mascara and a cream coloured shadow on my brow bone to highlight et voila ! eyes are complete ! ! to finish off my face i contoured my cheekbones , bronzed up my skin and added a pink lipstick with slight orange undertones and there we go , my take on the signature cheryl smokey eye ! now i understand if my above ramblings were hard to follow , so i added in some pictures below showing step by step how to complete the look ! i hope you enjoyed this quick little demo and do let me know if you try this out for yourself ! related posts things i 've learned in years suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration
