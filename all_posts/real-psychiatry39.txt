i do n't know how many people are aware of it but a crisis of alcohol use was declared about a week ago by marc schuckit , md dr schuckit is one of the top psychiatric experts in alcohol use disorders and i have been reading his work for the past years his commentary was based on an article in that same issue of jama psychiatry on the epidemiology of alcohol use in the united states in the st century most of the researchers listed as authors of this paper are affiliated with the epidemiology and biometry branch of the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa they are analyzing data collected in the national epidemiological survey on alcohol and related conditions nesarc and nesarc iii during two different time points n , and n , typical response rates were noted for both the initial selections and the individual response rates for the face to face interviews both surveys were designed to be nationally representative samples adjusted to account for sampling error and non response i interpret that to mean that the percentages listed in the following table to represent population wide numbers based on these samples respondents were paid for participation the specific sampling strategies were listed in the paper the structured interview was the alcohol use disorder and associated disabilities interview schedule dsm iv version audadis iv in nesarc and audadis v in nesarc iii the definitions of high risk drinking are noted in the table dsm iv diagnoses of alcohol abuse or dependence were given according to the suggested criteria match various measures of reliability and validity of the structured interview are referenced as being fair to high all of the demographic variables noted in the test subjects are noted in the article as well as some discussion of how subgroups varied for example very large increases were noted in practically all subgroups for month dsm iv aud diagnoses with subjects in the years and older increased by metric nesarc nesarc iii percentage increase month alcohol use month high risk drinking month dsm iv aud diagnosis month dsm iv aud among month alcohol users month dsm iv aud among month high risk drinkers the trend according to this study is only in the upward direction the authors speculate about socioeconomic etiologies unemployment , discrimination , income disparities , stigma of alcoholism and increased permissiveness in what is acceptable drinking for women subgroup analysis shows these groups had the highest increases in alcohol use the authors also point out that there are primary and secondary effects in these groups that can significantly increase the known morbidity and mortality associated with drinking such as more significant alcohol related illnesses in women for the same dose of alcohol due to decreased metabolic clearance and increased likelihood of adverse drug effects due to polypharmacy in both women and the elderly they also point out that alcohol related problems seem to have gone under the radar with higher visibility of less commonly used intoxicants like cannabis and hallucinogens i would add that permissiveness of intoxicant use in general is a cultural phenomenon and it probably not too surprising that the widespread legalization and hype about cannabis would be associated with increased alcohol consumption there are certainly many people with the belief that alcohol alleviates chronic pain , insomnia , anxiety , and depression as well as cannabis the popular notion that alcohol is a healthy beverage that provides protection against heart attacks and stroke is undoubtedly another factor few people realize that the maximum number of drinks per day for men and women and respectively was based on the fact that above that level the risks for cardiovascular disease and cancer increase significantly the new study also has some implications for other large scale estimates of alcohol use and the associated morbidity and mortality as an example , the world health organization came out with a large study in that reported on data from and comparison with the nesarc data shows that month alcohol use who v nesarc iii is fairly close at v comparison of month high risk drinking uses different measures for who , high risk drinking is defined as at least grams of alcohol in a single day in any day period for nesarc iii , the definition is or more standard drinks on any day for women and or more standard drinks on any day for men in the us , a standard drink is considered g of pure alcohol that results in of american drinkers being classified as heavy episodic drinkers and classified as month high risk drinkers from a diagnostic standpoint , who estimates that the prevalence of month alcohol use disorders is and nesarc iii gives and estimate of it is likely that different methodologies explain the marked difference in prevalence estimate for alcohol use disorders the who estimate was based on icd alcohol use disorders as well as disorders representing harmful use of alcohol the nesarc iii estimate was lay interviewers using a standard interview format to provide as dsm iv diagnosis that means that the who estimate for alcohol use disorders based on the nesarc iii data would be higher than the estimate a further note on the heavy episodic or high risk drinking in treatment centers it is very common for people seeking admission to be drinking in excess of those rates on a daily basis a closely related phenomenon to high risk drinking is binge drinking the cdc uses the same volume definition for high risk drinking but states that it occurs in an unspecified short period of time to elevate blood alcohol content above g dl according to their reviews the average binge drinker consumes drinks per episode the main risk is alcohol poisoning six people a day die of alcohol poisoning in the us , most of them are white men between the ages of and binge drinking carries with it all of the related risks of acute intoxication in his commentary , dr schuckit reviews his concerns about the potential implications of alcohol use increases in both women and the elderly he points out that elderly patients almost always have co morbid medical illnesses that will be exacerbated by drinking he discussed an intervention that his group did with college freshmen as minute internet based videos the course was designed to help them recognize their vulnerability to heavy drinking the intervention was effective at both and months he concludes by focusing in on the threats to research funding in this area specifically with the proposed cuts to the national institutes of health budget he suggests that supporting politicians who recognize the importance of research , identifying health crisis , and addressing them i think there is a lot of room to be a lot more proactive in our society apart from the cultural myths that i already mentioned , a dangerous one is i am not an alcoholic and therefore i do n't have any problems with alcohol the above research and others point out that it is possible to be a high risk drinker and not have a month diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder psychiatrists see variations of this pattern over the course of their careers they may be called on to assess the teenager in the icu after they had an episode of acute alcohol poisoning after voluntarily drinking too much they may be called on to assess people who were violent or victimized when they drank too much they may have to do specialized assessments on professionals who engaged in high risk drinking for some reason and ended up placing their credentials and licensure at risk it is time to realize that there is much more to alcohol use than being an alcoholic or technically having a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder even one episode of high risk drinking may end or permanently alter a persons life education on alcohol use is needed to dispel these popular myths and
