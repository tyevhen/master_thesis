i attended an industry event last night it was great fun i got to spend time talking to people who actually do what i spend my professional time just writing about i met members of the industry that i had n't yet and spent time with people whom i truly admire for their craft the drive home was very happy as i reflected on the night i 'd had a great time , made new friends , and learned a little more about my industry i thought about the different articles i could write , the magazines i could sell them to , what i could blog about , etc then this morning i woke up and started to work on a blog post that 's when the social anxiety monster started whispering in my ear he reminded me of a less than intelligent question that i asked he pointed out how fat i must have looked next to some of the prettier people at the event and he plainly stated that i clearly embarrassed myself and should never show my face around any of these people ever again if i let my typical pattern continue i 'll have myself convinced that the night was a total disaster for me within a few days by next weekend i should be in full on depression mode even if i'm conscious of the process , can i stop it ?
