i wrote a short story related to depression years ago and it remains unpublished , likely in part because of its , word length but i was thinking what if i serialized it here , say no more than words day ? would people read it ? i'm going to give it a try feedback welcomed especially let me know if this is asking too much of my readers positively bud martha wove her gray corolla through the traffic under the overcast los angeles sky she punched her radio buttons like a keyboard operator , deftly avoiding commercials without looking down from the road the talking heads on kfi hotly debated school vouchers not that she cared about school vouchers , but the emotional pitch of the hosts could make the most trivial concern seem consequential , and that was the game pretend to care about something , adopt an opinion like an only child , then defend it tooth and claw the more outrageous the opinion , the more incensed the caller , the higher the ratings emotions sold soap when the next commercial break was introduced by the fading musical signature she was too tired to continue her manipulations , so she listened distractedly home equity loans can give you financial freedom cosmetic surgery for the discriminating we take credit cards , etc then are you presently suffering from , or do you know someone who suffers from depression ?

sheesh ! over the last year her husband had devolved from an active if not cheerful computer consultant to a sedentary blob whose chief challenge was to rise out of bed and assay a chair he no longer golfed he spoke in monosyllables and only rarely watched tv if she did n't feed him he would n't eat he did n't drive anymore mostly he sat staring at a wall as if it might reveal , in its utter blankness , something even less present than himself he 'd been to therapists and psychiatrists , had tried five different antidepressants , had even undergone electroconvulsive therapy , but nothing could wake him from his stupor something had transformed the man she loved into a blackening potato and she did n't know what else to do beyond gentle refrigeration she memorized the phone number of the radio offer the disembodied but engaging voices returned to their insincere arguments over nothing arriving home , she hung her stethoscope on the hat rack and put her id badge in the outgoing mail tray , pausing to look in the entry mirror her hair was nut brown , though casually invaded here and there by white threads , and pulled back in a bun the pouches under her green eyes had taken on more freight than she remembered and her cheeks were fuller her straight , no nonsense nose called attention to their insidious plumping and likewise emphasized the beginnings of a double chin her lips were full , her teeth small and even she eyed her nurse 's uniform too tight and bulging in places not designed for bulges but altogether , at forty five , she was n't bad looking in her soiled whites she approached her silent husband , whose half closed eyes seemed positively reptilian , cold blooded , as he reclined in an easy chair though a year younger than she , he looked much older his sparse gray hair was combed straight back over his crown it looked as if he hadn t washed it in a week extended by frontal balding , his high forehead gave the impression of a large brained alien from an old science fiction movie , the hairless kind with big eyes rectangular black eyebrows arched upwards in something beyond grief permanent puzzlement , perhaps ? his red rimmed eyes were dull , as if their deep brown had stopped reflecting light and the folds in his skin from weight loss made his cheeks resemble the sagging skin of an elephant he sat in the striped boxers and gray t shirt he 'd worn to bed three days' growth of beard clung to his immobile jaw like a fungus hi bud , martha said with forced enthusiasm , kissing him on his rough cheek hi , honey , bud replied mechanically without returning the kiss bud ? yes , dear i heard about a special trial for depression on the radio today if i make an appointment would you be willing to go ? sure we 're having pork chops tonight with fresh applesauce uh huh it 's your favorite oh she turned away and strode to the bedroom to shed her uniform for some light sweats , then returned to the airy kitchen to prepare a meal only she would enjoy , as bud 's anhedonia included food she had tried explaining to her friends what it was like to live with a depressive it was as if she dwelt on land and he was underwater , like a fish , and she could n't share his world anymore than he could share hers with a few of the drugs he had almost threatened to become amphibian , venturing out for dinner or a movie before he inevitably devolved , losing all interest in the shore these failed glimmers of near recovery were hardest to take depression was too tame a word for his condition disensoulment might work better zombification , perhaps or vegetosis , which turned humans into vegetables she put the green beans on to steam somewhere she had read of a roman punishment for murderers , where the criminal had the body of the victim tied to his back until he died as well from exhaustion sometimes she felt that way it was getting harder and harder for her to carry bud bud stared out the window the birdsong from the maples irritated him each note was like a pinprick the spot on the carpet made him sad as did the cobwebs in the ceiling corners , but he felt helpless to do anything about them they were too , too much he had tried to tell martha what it was like inside the black hole , where attempts at contact with the universe were pointless , only worsening the inexorable gravity of self absorption with a self long since absorbed but she could n't understand , she was too grounded in reality she even clipped coupons this seemed particularly miraculous to bud planning ahead for anything was beyond his imagination , would require hope he barely existed did he ? in the present the future was unreal where did she get such strength ? bud , time for dinner ok he began with his right arm if he believed he could lift it off the armrest , he could left arm good lean forward to the edge of the chair good deep breath hands on thighs i can stand , i can stand slowly he rose , feeling momentarily dizzy passing out would be a blessing robotically he circumambulated the coffee table and made it to the kitchen , where he collapsed , exhausted , at the dinette the smell of the food sickened him but one of his last remaining pretenses was to force feed himself and compliment her cooking let 's pray , dear , shall we ? bud nodded passively martha grabbed his hand father we thank you for this meal and for this day , and i pray you will help my dear husband and that we wo n't lose hope amen
