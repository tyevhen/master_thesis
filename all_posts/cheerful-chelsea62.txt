my life has been completely transformed recently , my usually quiet days spent mostly in isolation have come to end there are many aspects of my life that have changed dramatically in the past year last february i had a major breakdown due to living in isolation for so long , feeling incredibly lonely and as a result of the lack of results from being on a variety of different drugs for depression and anxiety as you know i ended up leaving university in the summer and i have n't looked back since the university lifestyle was n't healthy for me , it was incredibly stressful and i ended up missing out on the positive aspects of university life i e spending time with the incredible people i met a year on i never expected to be engaged at the age of , living with my fiance and his family , living away from my family for a reason other than being at university and being fortunate enough to have such supportive parents and future in laws robbie and i have obviously already committed to each other through getting engaged , but we also decided to get our first pet , little ruben , a hamster he is incredible cute and has the softest fur ever him being a nocturnal animal made him the perfect companion for my topsy turvy sleeping pattern , he 's also pretty low maintenance and up for hugs ! we got him in september and now he has a bigger but younger brother introducing toby the puggle , our week old puppy now before anyone worries ruben is definitely not being neglected since we 've had our new arrival , we still meet up in the early a m toby has completely transformed my daily routine , i'm now up at am to take him outside in whatever the weather we had his first encounter with peeing in the snow , freezing for all involved we 're attempting to get him into a good routine for eating and sleeping as well as socialising him through introducing him to different people and experiences each day i'm pretty sure we 're on the same level , its as if i'm a toddler again waking up early , running around for play time , getting grumpy because i'm hungry due to being awake for so long i usually average meal a day and then crashing after running on fumes for so long and need a nap when toby does remember , when your puppy sleeps , you sleep kind of like a mother newborn baby relationship ? he is incredibly cute and it 's a struggle to not be won over with his puppy dog eyes and adorable wrinkly face , but we must remain stern when he is trying to bite our socks whilst we are wearing them ! everything is brand new and exciting to him so he is bound to have a few accidents , plus he is doing all this whilst teething , so every new experience or person might get chewed on a bit as fantastic as having a puppy is , dogs are for life and require a lot of patience , attention and stamina whilst they are young ! after our first full day together and him peeing almost every minute , i did end up slumping to the floor and crying it all became too much for me , i was exhausted , dizzy from staring down at him for so long , my thighs were screaming at me from all the squatting down to praise him and the running around we had done in the garden i 'd done so much research prior to looking for him , i felt prepared but i knew it was n't going to be straight forward as i sat on the floor trying to hide the tears robbie came over to me and rested his hands on my shoulders , and then toby came trotting over and snuggled down in my lap it was enough to make me smile and i realised it was all going to be worth it check out toby 's instagram page here for updates ! ruben has more highlights and contours than a kardashian ! we have had a few slip ups such as the awful moment when his collar was too big for him , and attempting to make it more snug whilst encouraging him to pee outside in the rain after just getting back from collecting him i was distraught , worrying that the experience was so bad that he would n't take well to being toilet trained outside after all that of course i was worrying about nothing , he is doing incredibly well and its only his fourth day with us there will be more hurdles to come but it is all so exciting , hopefully when we introduce him to ruben they wo n't bite one another and we hope toby will realise ruben is not to be chased when in his exercise ball ! its going to take some time for me to adjust too , mentally and physically , my body aches all over and i could do with a sob right now but hopefully this too shall pass
