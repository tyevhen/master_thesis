i discovered i'm being plagiarized by a site called alaska psychiatry journal they take my feed and republish it as their own , submitted by admin and filed under the category depression marathon they also list depression marathon in their sidebar as a category with no link to my site and i'm not the only one they are plagiarizing multiple sites in the same way to say i'm angry is a gross understatement i'm incensed ! i'm frustrated ! i'm incredulous ! there is no contact information for the site administrator anywhere on their site , but someone suggested e mailing webmaster alaskapsychiatryjournal net , which i did i asked them politely to cease and desist , but so far no word from them nor change in their plagiarism i 've also contacted their web host , ix web hosting , and asked them to intervene they are looking into it i do n't know what else to do since this post , laughingly , will also be plagiarized by the site , i guess i 'll ask again right here please , alaska psychiatry journal , stop plagiarizing my original material ! i put my heart and soul into this blog these are my words , my thoughts , and my feelings while it is nice to be recognized by other sites , to have you present my words , thoughts and feelings as your own is an incredible personal violation please , stop if anyone out there knows of another way for me to address this thievery , please let me know thanks , and thanks for letting me vent
