men in suits the men in suits decide which war is good while desert grunts hear shrapnel whizzing by the men in suits never give up their blood it doesn t matter how hard we withstood snipers and bombs , watching our comrades die the men in suits decide which war is good i d kill the policy makers if i could i d trade them tooth for tooth and eye for eye ! the men in suits never give up their blood democracy cannot be understood by ancient islam culture blown sky high the men in suits decide which war is good mostly the war produces widowhood though our commander still clings to his lie the men in suits never give up their blood there is no love , there is no personhood when men are ground up for bad policy the men in suits decide which war is good the men in suits never give up their blood i was plain wrong when i claimed a week of euthymia good mood yesterday in reviewing my blog it was only four days it felt like a week because i felt like myself again unfortunately , today i feel on thin ice and i m anxious i got up yesterday and wrote my sonnet and blogged , which is my daily mental toilette later i felt restless i couldn t concentrate on the book i am supposed to review , or on learning the hieroglyphics of html finally at pm i jumped in the van and drove south about forty miles on winding highway to the garcia river three years ago in october i had netted a steelhead and a salmon at a deep part of the river , and i thought perhaps there would be some fish pooling around now i didn t get a bite , which is not unusual for the unluckiest fisherman in the world i wear a hat that proclaims , fish control my brain i have since learned that that control means that i am constantly directed away from fish if i m there , they are not but the feeling of restlessness and irritability persisted as i fished the landscape was overcast with occasional sprinkles the bracken of summer had decayed into the color of straw the leaves of the blackberry bushes had begun to turn red , imitating the dreaded poison oak , but i know the difference in the shape of the leaves i saw a raven fight off a white tailed kite over a territory dispute near the bluff above placid cows grazed high on the steep embankment along the river , and i thought it a miracle that they did not fall off for an unscheduled swim i saw a beautiful red tailed hawk i was entirely alone in this somewhat forbidding landscape , and not surprisingly , following my irritability , an angry irritability , melancholy descended was it for not catching fish ? was it my memory of fishing there three years ago that reminded me of all that had transpired between , our whole sojourn in that unmentionable country south of the border ? in any case i felt like crying but controlled myself when i came home kathleen immediately spotted my change in mood i can hide nothing from her this morning i woke up anxious i held on to kathleen as if she were a large stuffed animal for comfort eventually kenyon stirred and i had to walk the old boy , as in his dotage he can easily get lost and confused he stops sometimes , stands still , and exhibits the thousand yard stare i remember when he was young and frisky now i am a helpless participant in managing his decline the point is , my mood is still fragile i could dive down from here the self critical thoughts have returned i m no good , i ve never done anything in my life , yada yada but i noticed another aspect of my illness , namely jealousy i m jealous of the success of other poets and musicians i feel somehow it s not fair , that i m good enough to be recognized but even as i think this i castigate myself for my narcissism , since those with greater recognition , in general , have also striven harder to attain what they have other than a whole wad of publications on the net and a lesser wad in print , i remain a third tier poet , one of thousands who have not distinguished themselves from the herd it is sad that the world of poetry works much like hollywood , but them s the cards , deal with it i m not submitting to anyone right now , a deficiency i need to correct but sometimes it seems purely hopeless to try i think my poetry is retro and the moment of its potential recognition has passed me by can i accept that without bitterness ? jealousy is the essence of narcissism and i am ashamed of it but i must admit it i resent those with greater success , especially when i think their verse is inferior i try to tell myself that they earned it , but i can t help believing they had lucky breaks take wanda coleman , for instance what s she doing in the second tier of poets ? she is obvious and bombastic , though a good performer or take charles bukowski , from whom garrison keillor chose multiple entries in his anthology of poetry i could go on , but naming names is always dangerous you risk expulsion from the potential circle of venerable elders i suppose my greatest achievement in poetry was when dorianne laux solicited me for an issue of the alaska quarterly review and i had as much space as billy collins to be solicited for a top flight journal is a thrill at i ve pretty much let my music and songwriting slide i ve let medical practice slide , though not by direct choice look i m being honest the bible advises that we pray for our enemies , for which a competitor in the small world of poetry might qualify , especially if i think their verse inferior to mine in my worst moments i m so jealous i want to appeal to some objective cosmic judge for a decision after all these years , from adolescence on , why have i not been able to master these feelings of injury ? those who succeed are not injuring me , only helping themselves why do i , in my worst moments , resent them ? the answer is simple i think i m their equal or better , and that it just isn t fair what a ridiculous concept , that life and art should be fair in my case it stems in part , no doubt , from being a middle child , a same sex second child quickly followed by my sister only mos later why did my older brother get more liberties ? how come i couldn t be his equal ? it never dawned on me that it was just a difference in age that allowed him greater privileges but i took his privileges as somehow diminishing mine this is a problem i go through on the edges of depression i wish i knew a cure i do remember one epiphany when i practiced in palm springs at that time a mercedes was the commonest car in the upscale desert one day when driving i realized why others had mercedes and i didn t they had earned their cars i was not gypped their cars did not diminish me they had earned their luxury enough said or not enough my narcissism , which crops up when my mood is bent , embraces the ridiculous idea that the success of others , particularly others i think less talented , somehow takes away from me this is plain silly but it is one of the slippery slopes into depression again , as i must condemn myself for my narcissism , afterwards paralyzed by my perceived failure perhaps the only antidote for this is to simply accept that i have these feelings , justified or not , and that i need to keep working in the hopes of being recognized someday don t look behind , someone might be gaining on you but i am open to comment or commiseration regarding this psychological thorn , and i trust , among artists , that i am not the only one to suffer from it at kilorat , with anxiety , ce
