it 's been a rough week around here i was already sliding a bit when i got the news monday about my job that sent me into an immediate tailspin which shook my faith in recovery for three days , i was so low i barely moved accomplishing anything was a monumental feat it 's been one of those root rattling depressive episodes , and i 've been feeling totally unhinged feeling low , unhinged , crazy i hate it these episodes rudely remind me of my illness i have a chronic condition of mind and body , and it can be debilitating it has been debilitating and i hate the reminder but today is a new day , and so far , i feel a tiny bit better yet i do n't know what to expect yesterday began better , too , but eventually the darkness enveloped me again it was tough despite the darkness , at least yesterday i was able to push through a bit in the morning , my psychiatrist and i set a goal of accomplishing just two things during the day i went one better and accomplished three it may seem bizarre , but one of the things i accomplished was getting out for a run it was a priority i barely got off the sofa on wednesday i needed to get out , and i needed to get puck out , too so we made it yes , it took the life out of me temporarily , but ultimately i think it helped it was a major accomplishment that accomplishment set up the next before i crashed after my run , i made some phone calls there were two promising job opportunities out there i called about both i sent resumes to both i'm interviewing for one of the opportunities next week and will likely interview for the other job before the end of the month i'm not sure i could have accomplished making those connections if i had n't gone for my run i'm grateful i was able to get out the door i'm praying today for energy despite feeling so low i have accomplishments yet to achieve i have two patients , possibly three , to see i'm hoping for two i 'd like to get on my bike for a short , indoor ride my legs are sore from yesterday 's effort and i 'll call my sponsor to check in that 's what i'm hoping for today it 's good for me to have a plan i 've always been motivated by goals but i'm also aware my body , my brain , my illness may not allow for all i 'd like to achieve i 'll try to be okay with that , too but please , god , grant me a reprieve from feeling so low i 've got more plans to make and more goals to achieve i hope
