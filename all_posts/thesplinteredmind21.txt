pm today , i was wiped out by the events of yesterday i slept into the afternoon played with miitomo discussed politics on facebook basically , i let myself spin somedays , i need time off from wrestling with my adhd , depression , or ticking all day long i need to let myself just be me , distractions and all that does n't mean i wave insouciantly in the direction of responsibility , and blow it a kiss i made bank transfers i made dinner i made sure to bring my daughter to her chinese medicine doctor to have her remedy tweaked we needed to compensate for her temper outbursts and increased seizures if i'm exhausted trying to keep up with her rollercoaster , i ca n't imagine how burned out she 's getting with all that chaos inside her head so i took the day off however , once my daughter was in bed for the night , i began to feel the itch to write am i'm still digging myself out of the hole i created with my shoddy research notes the other day however , i finally began to move forward again only words to show for all that effort , but there were facts to verify and entire passages to be rewritten this part of the book is so much slower than the earlier bits i need to be careful i need to reverify my findings and avoid errors it 's all so fiddly and time consuming yet , i'm pressing forward in fact , i just finished step four of eight in section iv , so i'm over the halfway mark i now know i 'll easily cross , words , which was my original goal i had already written a few thousand words on the book before i began this project this project is showing me that my idea of writing a small book project one chapter at a time as blog posts is going to be something that i can truly do i 've never begun any of these blog books , as i call them , because i did n't have faith i could finish them after beginning so publicly this project , however , has given me confidence my plan is to post the first draft of each chapter as a blog post i 've taken the idea from dean wesley smith he designs the book cover , states the concept , then begins writing the blog as a series later , he polishes them up and sells them as inexpensive ebooks , leaving the first drafts up as advertisement for the completed book if people do n't want to pay , they can read his first drafts for free , but his series are so useful that his readership gladly supports him knowing him , however , he does n't do much in the way of rewriting , but he does put some spit shine on it i can do the same first , though , i need to see this project through to the end totals day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words day no words project word count total words
