i stayed up until am because when i tried to go to bed , i found two spiders on my blanket and i thought maybe there were more and maybe the entire blanket was full of spiders , so i put my blanket out in the hall and then waited for boyfriend to wake up and go to work so i could use his sleeping bag which i arbitrarily decided was spider proof it seemed perfectly logical at the time anyway , i woke up at ten and i thought it was at least noon , but no it was ten and then i was like shit i only got four hours of sleep for no reason and that 's why i'm posting some of my drawings that i found on my computer instead of a real blog post
