lately i 've been experimenting with google webfonts , which is a terrific way to get started with webfont technology the fonts are free and using them is a snap scroll down for a few sample fonts once you pick out the fonts you want to use , just insert a line like the following in the head section of your template note that this is all one line ignore the wrapping link href 'http fonts googleapis com css ? family arbutus slab belgrano tinos , italic ovo arapey italic , alegreya italic , , ledger adamina andada' rel 'stylesheet' type 'text css' right after that line , insert some style classes as follows style ovo font family ovo , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black arbutus font family arbutus slab , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black tinos font family tinos , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black arapey font family arapey , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black alegreya font family alegreya , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black ledger font family ledger , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black adamina font family adamina , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black andada font family andada , arial , serif font weight font size pt font color black style note that you can put any name you want after the dot for example , instead of ovo you could name the class fancy or whatever or ovopt , but for maximum browser compatibility , do n't start the class name with a number for instance , do n't use ptovo save your template , and you 're ready to use the fonts how ? one way is to enclose a section of text in a span that invokes the class you want , like this span class ovo text goes here blah blah blah span google provides hundreds of free fonts again , see google webfonts for details , and many of them are outstanding the serif fonts are less numerous and less varied than the sans serif fonts google provides , and there are no convincing typewriter fonts which is a serious omission , imho , but you 'll find no shortage of headline fonts check the character sets carefully , in any case , because many of the fonts provide only a basic latin alphanumeric character set for an even greater variety of fonts , be sure to check out adobe 's typekit site here are some of my personal favorites from the google collection ovo nicole fally 's ovo was inspired by a set of hand lettered caps seen in a s lettering guide a medium contrast serif font , ovo has a noticeable yet agreeable linearity , with crisp features that provide good though not excellent legibility at a variety of sizes this sample is pt and shows that the font itself is natively smaller than most fonts ovo 's serifs and crossbars are slanted and adhere to a single common angle this makes for a distinctive font but can become intrusive in long passages of text ovo is thus arguably better used for short and medium length spans of text belgrano belgrano is a slab serif type , initially designed for printed newspapers but now adapted for use on the web it features coarse terminals and larger counterforms that allow it to work well in smaller sizes this sample is pt letters of the alphabet that are closed but rounded 'o' , 'b' , 'p' , etc tend to circumscribe slightly more white space in belgrano than in fonts like alegreya , giving a more open feel to long runs of text tinos tinos was designed by steve matteson as a refreshingly stylish alternative to times new roman it is metrically compatible with times new roman giving about the same number of words per page , for example , even though it looks more condensed tinos offers good onscreen readability characteristics and comes with a superbly crafted italic version in larger sizes , it quickly loses its condensed feel arapey eduardo tunni 's first sketches of this typeface were made during a vacation in arapey , a small town in the north of uruguay , hence its name while the font is reminiscent of bodoni , the soft lines and finishes give the text a smooth , distinguished feeling the font tends to look best at pt or larger sizes this sample is pt alegreya alegreya was chosen as one of fonts of the decade at the atypi letter competition in september it was also selected in the nd bienal iberoamericana de dise o competition held in madrid in originally intended for literature , alegreya is more angular than arapey and conveys a subtle variegation that facilitates the reading of long texts the italic version shows just as much care and attention to detail as the roman version there is also a small caps sister family the font is natively somewhat small this is a pt sample adamina an excellent general purpose serif font for long form text projects , adamina was specifically designed for readability at small sizes as a result , the x height is increased and complex features of the kind that contribute to contrast are kept more controlled one sided flaring and asymmetrical serifs provide a pleasant reading experience the font never feels intrusive this is an pt sample with letter spacing increased by em and word spacing set to em because otherwise it can look a bit tight , especially at small point sizes ledger much of ledger 's charm , as with garamond , comes from its relatively heavy downstroke thickness compared to the almost frail stroke thickness at the tops of curved letters like 'o' and 'p' that and the font 's slightly more open character make ledger a good alternative to garamond family fonts in larger sizes though not smaller sizes the letter forms feature a large x height , good stroke contrast , and elegant wedge like serifs and terminals , yielding a distinguished looking font , again in the spirit of garamond except with somewhat better screen readability andada designed by carolina giovagnoli for huerta tipogr fica , andada shares many of adamina 's most agreeable features but , by virtue of being a slab serif design , lacks the more refined flourishes in ascenders and descenders , for example of adamina perhaps precisely because of the less adorned design , many readers will prefer andada over adamina or garamond like fonts for long passages of text note if you found this post useful , please tweet it and or share the link with a friend thanks !
