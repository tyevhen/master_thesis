the dictionary defines fragile as easily broken or damaged , frail , or weak i have always said that my guardian angel works overtime when it comes to protecting me occasionally , especially when it is cold , i can feel a little fragile it can also happen on those days where i am feeling weaker than normal when these days do come along , i have to be extra mindful of my actions if i do not remain focused , i can lose my balance in a flash and go down fortunately , for my guardian angel and my wife , i do not have too many days like this normally these type days occur in the winter after i have been out in the cold for some time my extremities just do not want to work the way they are supposed to and i cannot trust my legs to keep me upright as mentioned , it does not have to be wintertime however , for me to feel a fragile it just takes the overworking of my muscles i e , by standing or walking too long or not being focused on what i am doing to create an accident years ago , i remember one of those days my wife had a stained glass fireplace screen several dragonflies that she loved walking out of my office , i stubbed my toe on the corner of the raised fireplace stoop as i was going down , i twisted and tried to catch myself the only thing i succeeded in doing was grabbing the fireplace screen i landed on top of it smashing it into hundreds of pieces except for a few minor cuts i was unhurt , but i would have gladly sacrificed myself taken one for the team if the fireplace screen had not been destroyed my wife took the loss better than i did because i knew it was a one of a kind piece that could not be replaced a couple of summers ago , i had another one of those days a whew , that was close moment i was just standing up from my recliner and turned to look at something before i had gained my balance as i fell backwards , i tried reaching out to grab the fireplace mantel in front of me my upper torso was too far forward as i went down and i whacked my head on the side table when these moments happen , it always seems like everything slows down and every action and reaction is exaggerated as i try to recover fortunately , i did not do any serious damage my brother would comment , there could n't be any damage because he only hit his head my wife heard me falling and came a running she saw that a water glass had spilled and the glasses that i was wearing were now on the floor , but i was just sitting on the edge of the chair , shaking my head , as if nothing had happened once again , the results could have been much worse if it were not for my guardian angel on fragile days , i do not have anything more to worry about than a normal day other than sudden changes in direction , uneven walking surfaces , steps , curbs , slippery surfaces , loss of focus when walking , etc i think you get the idea no wonder my guardian angel is prematurely gray please feel free to comment by taking a moment to share your thoughts you add much to these articles the articles then become more than just something i said or believe in addition , by adding a comment , you might just be helping the next reader by sharing your opinion , experience , or a helpful tip you can comment by clicking on comments below or by sending me an email i look forward to hearing from you
