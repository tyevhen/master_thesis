i used to pass out quite a lot , always extremely embarising at school about aged or so we were watching a video about the innerintestines my mum always told me i was not to watch these incase it made me pass out wise in her day , in heinsite this probably made me worse anyway i passed out in front of the whole class and apparently fitted a few weeks later in the same class , same teacher , a boy came to swap a video the teacher said to the boy in front of the whole class not to make a fuss as someone might pass out the whole class laughed at me o i did not know very nice people back then ! ! people are much nicer these days i am well clear of that village , that school and those people i handed a peice of course work in for my msc in the lecture everyone was talking about something that was really obvious and i had not done it i had another panic attack i fainted in front of the class luckily my fellow students were a lot nicer than the people at school and genuinely concerned i lt the room and threw up several times in the corridor i lied and said i was feeling rough from a virus i got a tiny cut working in a bakery for my school work experiance , aged it was a thin scatch that did not fully break the skin but i fainted i went home after i fainted much to the bosses annoyance the remainder of the time i was there i was not allowed to use a sharp knife and as one of my duties was slicing baguettes and spreading garlic butter my colleagues made a big deal that i was not to touch the sharp knives and they had to do it for me my sa was extremely bad at this time and i did not speak to any of the other staff for the three weeks i was there i still get angry that i went to my gp and the school knew but i was never offered counselling or any help i was in the early 's though finally passing out and throwing up due to panic all over the optician medical people always made me worse i have not passed out for about seven years now and lead a pretty normal sa free life i sometimes feel a bit sorry for myself about how life treated me for the first years of my life o but no way am i going back to that dark place
