just in time for my easter dinner of slim jims and mickey ds kidding ! i ate grassfed steak and potatoes with spices and kerrygold in honor of walter willett comes this downer of a news article link between fast food and depression confirmed that science daily piece is based upon a study newly published in public health nutrition , fast food and commercial baked goods consumption and the risk of depression now public health nutrition sounds like one of those buttoned up nutrition journals filled with good intentions and soy , so let 's see what the quality of the work is , shall we ? all right , so this is a revisit of the sun study i'm pretty sure i have some sun study stuff around here somewhere , oh , here basically it is an epidemiological visit to sunny spain , where nearly university graduates were followed for about years , answering questions about diet and subsequent health and guess what ? if you fill your plate with empty industrial fast food calories weirdly , they call fast food sausages , pizza , and hamburgers in this study , which certainly can be fast food , but also not so fast and commercial baked goods including muffins , doughnuts , croissants , and other commercial baked goods okay though i 've probably eaten more homemade muffins than commercial ones , ca n't ever remembering making my own doughnuts or croissants , so they 've got me there so all the folks did not have diagnosed depression at baseline , and over the years , several hundred began taking antidepressants or were diagnosed with clinical depression by their doctors and , three guesses as to how diet correlated with the diagnoses ? ? ? ? that 's right , a linear , dose dependent correlation between the amount of fast food at baseline and depression the fast food and commercial baked goods eaters were more likely to be young , and more likely to not eat other , more delectable foods , such as olive oil , fish , nuts , and vegetables cough mediterranean diet cough the fast food shovelers were also more likely to smoke and to work more than hours a week not recommended ! if you recall , all those studies listing relative risk of whatever such as every statin study ever written are all hiding something in general you end up with headlines such as a increase of death death death but in actuality the risk of death goes from to which is hardly exciting i had to edit this next part after jonathon 's comment because i carelessly reported the numbers incorrectly the first time around i have several excuses having to do with poor time management and sleep deprivation , but no good excuses because i am not typically so careless anyway , the percentage of change of the magnitude of the association varied as we went farther and farther from the original dietary measurement , discounting all the folks who had been diagnosed in the months prior to the last measurement of depression these variations were from or so to or so for commercial baked goods the absolute numbers were people diagnosed with depression , or about this number is low compared to the general population , but many folks were excluded from the sample due to already having a diagnosis of depression prior to the study , which skewed this sample toward healthier folks with later onset of depression symptoms the hazard ratios are n't that impressive , but the trend is linear and significant for the fast food consumption the discussion is also interesting the authors suggest that those who eat more fast food and baked goods have a higher trans fat consumption likely true , and therefore poorer glucose control and poor glucose control staggered they mention trans fats and not saturated fats here ! ! do these folks actually read the nutrition literature ? then , even more surprisingly , the authors have a cogent discussion of how high glycemic carbohydrates found in abundance in commercial baked goods will increase plasma tryptophan and increase serotonin uptake into the brain and thus decrease depressive symptoms blah blah blah but these effects seem to have been studied only short term , and that long term , inflammation and pro inflammatory cytokines are more associated with fast food style diets and these are more likely to be important to longer term depression phew , i was beginning to think these researchers were way too sensible when they went into a discussion of how high fat , ketogenic diets can disrupt cognition pray tell me how likely it is a fast food diet is highly ketogenic ? and , let 's not pull punches on the major weakness of this study diets were only assessed at baseline , and follow up occurred up to years later that 's a lot of unknown eating to account for i also thought the previous study of trans fats was n't that helpful because it seemed that college graduates in spain did n't have that much variation in how they ate meaning hardly anyone ate that much vegetable oil , and trans fats were mostly from dairy , as opposed to an american sample , where trans fats can make up a scary percentage of calories still , correlations being what they are , if you are the sort of person to be quaffing from the drive thru , you are also apparently far more likely to be the sort of person to be diagnosed with a clinical depression confounders galore , but there you have it now , back to my slim jims
