yesterday i was scheduled to run miles as mentioned in my previous post , in addition to my recent poor mood i have n't been feeling physically well since tuesday what started as a sore throat and body aches had moved into my chest by friday still , without the body aches and sore throat , i felt better overall , and decided to give my run a shot unfortunately , the day did not begin well my mood friday night into saturday morning was awful i was heavy and sad i had decided to run with my friend and the local running group , so i had to drive to the meeting point as i sat in my car waiting for the run to start , i could hardly move i was heavy and sad i felt hopeless depression had me gripped tightly in its fist somehow i got my feet to move and began the run , but within the first mile i began having trouble this time it was my chest more than my mood dragging me down i had used my asthma inhalers prior to running , but i was still wheezing and working way too hard for the pace i was running i needed to slow my pace , which i did , and i watched as the majority of the group people ran ahead and out of sight metaphorically , that sight was a perfect match for my mood heavy , sad , and alone i almost turned around at mile three , but a water stop rejuvenated me a bit i knew , however , i was not going to finish the entire distance i could have taken an mile route , but i pushed past that turn and forced myself to complete , which was a mistake i ended up walking much of the last mile i was supremely frustrated with my body 's limitations and i was wasted , mentally and physically i pushed too hard for my current condition by the time i arrived home , took a shower , and attempted to lie down , i could n't stop coughing and my coughs were deep and painful i was wheezing and gurgling my lungs were heavy and full of gunk my temperature was high i tried to rest , but after just a few minutes it became obvious i needed some medical attention i drove to the emergency room a few miles away i think the doctor was pretty impressed with how horrid my lungs sounded he quickly got me going on a nebulizer treatment that helped it took care of the gurgling , but i was still wheezing the doctor was a little surprised my chest x ray looked okay , but he thought i was probably developing something worse and started me on a short course days of prednisone and antibiotics i got home and took the prescribed prednisone shortly thereafter i was able to breathe better and also able to rest it seemed to help almost immediately today , i'm feeling much better besides cleaning my house and walking jet , i 've allowed myself to rest i 've got enough fluids in me to run a couple of marathons ! and while i'm still coughing , it 's a little less painful and a little more productive some of you are probably wondering what the hell i was thinking when i began my run well , here 's the thing my mood has been so poor , i knew running would improve it at least a bit also , i thought running might actually help loosen up my chest i 've had previous experiences where that has been the case hindsight being , i should n't have pushed past the mile turn even miles likely would have been too far four to six miles was probably a better goal deciding to run miles with a group was probably the worst decision i made , as it spurred me to push on , despite how poorly i felt , for fear of what others might think the good news is i'm feeling better even mentally , i'm a little less low today i 'll wait until tomorrow to make a decision about my next run i'm going to try to be patient and take as much time as my body needs lessons learned
