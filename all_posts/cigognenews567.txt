below is quote from a well known neuropsychiatrist on the giffords shooting it is in scientific american , jan , www scientificamerican com article cfm ? id anger management self control what has neuroscience uncovered about the capacity of the person who shot giffords , the person responsible for the virginia tech massacre in , and many others yet still a small percentage of people to behave so violently ? dr iacoboni what happens in these individuals is that their cognitive control mechanisms are deranged mind you , these individuals are not out of control , enraged people they just use their cognitive control mechanisms in the service of a disturbed goal there are probably a multitude of factors at play here the subject is exposed to influences that lead him or her to violent acts including , unfortunately , not only the violent political rhetoric but also the media coverage of similar acts , as we are doing here a variety of issues , especially mental health problems that lead to social isolation , lead the subject to a mental state that alters his or her ability to exercise cognitive control in a healthy manner the cognitive control capacities of the subject get somewhat redirected we do n't quite understand how toward goals and activities that are violent in a very specific way not the violent outburst of somebody who has lost it in a bar , punching people right and left the violence is channeled in a very specific plan , with a very specific target generally fed by the media through some sort of rhetoric , political or otherwise with very specific tools , in the giffords case , a millimeter glock let me get this straight his cognitive control apparatus was deranged ? you know when shrinks put your everyday language into psychologese and call it science , beware what does that mean ? he is not out of control he just has a warped goal ? and that goal is ? he has no goals he is awash in his past and it occupies all of his cognitive apparatus and he is not out of control ? i would like to know what is the teaching and learning in psychiatry and psychology is faulty , to say the least this is a man who has lost all control and i might add to what i have already written that the prefrontal developing cortex can be seriously impaired during womb life when oxygen levels are seriously depleted , or at birth when massive anesthesia to the mother shuts down so much of the baby and damages his frontal cortical area so that control is already weakened at birth the child then has to be watched all of the time or he hits and hurts others or gets into constant trouble then the person gets older and takes drugs such as hash , pot and lsd and further damages the cortical control areas don t minimize the role of pot in all this years of using it can lead to paranoid psychosis it is not a matter that the shooter can not use cortical control he has no choice because at long last there isn t any what are the signs that a person is disturbed enough to take action ? dr iacoboni the signs are quite visible , although difficult to interpret without a context and unfortunately they unfold very quickly , and people can rarely witness them before the action is taken the action itself is a sign , a desperate form of communication from a disturbed individual unfortunately , nobody was chatting with the guy when he left his final messages on internet before getting into action but i bet that if somebody was communicating with him before the act and saw those signs and read those messages on myspace or whichever social network he was using , that person could have done something , could have engaged him in a sort of conversation that might have redirected his deranged plans indeed , by connecting with the subject , that person might have redirected some of the activity of mirror neurons toward a truly empathic behavior , rather than in the service of the deranged imitative violence leading to action you know that to think a good conversation can change a madman is ridiculous i treated psychotics with the veteran s administration and at the brentwood mental hospital and in my own practice we can see it developing and can pretty well predict what will happen the problem is that here many people saw it coming , but the laws stop us from doing anything you cannot jail someone on maybe he will act out in the future i have been told many times , wait until he acts and then we will move in i don t know the way out of this dilemma i would like to hear from others i do know that what happens early on is that trauma during womblife has a devastating impact that damages the gating system and depletes the important inhibitory hormones and neurotransmitters the person no longer has all the marbles he needs to function because he is ill , he is more and more isolated and more in pain with no outlets and no one to talk to oh yes , they say , he was always quiet and stayed to himself but , they add , he was always sweet sweet until the early rage breaks through and it breaks through because he was so sweet for so long could not let out even a bit here and there it stacked up and exploded he needs all the chemicals that he should manufacture but no longer can those medications that the brain produces but stopped when its inner pharmacy was damaged so very early on i think that schools can help when they see signs of out of control behavior in children bring it out to the authorities and use feelings for discussion and for talking about out of control and what it means inside to all of us children will get it we should not just punish kids but use the lessons of out of control feelings to really educate so that kids can get a handle on themselves we cannot rely on parents for this because too often they are responsible for the problem the punishment , indifference , lack of love , etc they do not see and cannot afford to see teachers and other students can and we need to train psychologists and specialists in the primal orientation so that kids learn about themselves that is the most important lesson anyone can get out of school a good handle of ourselves we need to learn about the inner world , not just the geography of the outer one
