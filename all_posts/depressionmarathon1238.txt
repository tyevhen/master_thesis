i'm staring at my christmas cactus , which is drooping its shriveled segmented leaves over the side of its pot , and thinking , yup , that 's exactly how i feel dude unfortunately , a glass of ho wo n't bring me back to life trust me , i 've tried that already i do n't know what 's going on i am sleepy tired as i told my doc today , if i do n't get things done before pm , it is unlikely they will get done at all after pm , it takes every ounce of energy just to stay awake ! and i'm not just tired i'm nonfunctional ! nothing works my body is tired my brain is tired i ca n't think i ca n't make decisions i do n't want to eat anything except chocolate and ice cream i do n't care about anything very dangerous for me ! like goals or commitments everything is just too much work ! it sucks ! it 's like an acute attack of depression weird we thought the fatigue was my usual menstrual cycle crap , but if that was the cause , it would have lifted by now my psychiatrist cut back one of my meds , although i 've been on it for a year so it 's also unlikely the cause i feel low on fuel , but it is very unlikely i am anemic i 've frequently been checked during episodes like this in the past , and my hemoglobin has never even been close to low plus , i take a multi vitamin , eat pretty well , and have been increasing my protein intake to accommodate for the increased running tonight , i had a steak i 'll have another tomorrow red meat iron has always helped boost me when i 've been fatigued from training in the past , but even steak has n't been a reliable cure this time the fatigue just wo n't let go since it wo n't let go , i am once again forced to accept the unacceptable i have no choice but to acquiesce to this debilitated state , but i do n't like it i do n't like it at all i used to fight , but what good would that do ? puttin' up my dukes would only squander more precious energy in the end , i 'd still be flat on my back pissin' and moanin' , and i 'd have accomplished even less instead , i'm trying to accept i'm trying to do when i can , and stop when i ca n't do any more i'm nowhere near perfect at this acceptance thing , but unfortunately i 've been getting extra practice time recently maybe i should have titled this post battling acceptance
