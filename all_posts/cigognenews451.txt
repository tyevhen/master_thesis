i watched sixty minutes last night as andy rooney said goodbye to tv in his goodbye speech he noted that he became a writer because a teacher once said to him , you know you can really write keep it up that was it one sentence that set him a life pursuit and i thought how little it takes to help kids find a direction in life just a few words when the child is seven or eight , a few words of encouragement is all she needs to pursue a talent and how rare is that encouragement why is that ? maybe parents cannot see their child for who she is maybe they are so into their own need for encouragement that they cannot see that need in others and it doesn t even have to be direct encouragement so many of us remember the name of a kind teacher decades later , and remembered that her kindness got us to study and learn not the readin , writin , and rithmatic admonishments of our leaders it is kindness that gets us motivated and always will be i still remember the names of my grammar school teachers who talked to me with warmth and caring mrs lopez taught me spanish and mr summers taught me typing i still am good at that many decades later and i remember my teacher , mrs kirk , who took me to the zoo when i was in kindergarten at age she recognized that i had a mentally ill mother , something i did not know , and wanted to be kind and caring i only realized years later that she selected only me to go to the zoo so how come after all this time i remember their names and not any of the others ? and how come i learned what they taught ? they fulfilled a deep need , a need in all of us , that i was not aware of and they were human and acted like humans , not just like teachers isn t that a lesson in all of our endeavors ? what works is humaneness , a little caring and a little encouragement it is not strictness and a driving teacher or boss the good people make you want to learn because in that learning is love or how it gets translated and what amazes me is how little it takes just a few words over many years can make a difference it says , you are good keep it up instead , because it is lacking , the child grows up acting out the need by driving herself so that others will say , you know you re good and then she comes to us as a patient to cry out , say i m good ! why ? because all the new encouragement still makes her feel empty and dissatisfied and current praise won t be enough because of the critical period that is the time when needs must be fulfilled encouragement at age seven is important , and when it isn t there it will help slightly to get it later on it will never stop the act out if you cannot get it when you need it needs must be fulfilled on a timetable and only then then the love is locked in and keeps us safe and content for life when fulfillment is not there we are locked into trying to get it forevermore and tough love ain t it you can scare kids into behaving but that is not the same as loving them and having them really want to behave isn t that true of all of us ?
