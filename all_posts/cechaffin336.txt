yes , that 's my baby , sarah , gussied up for her senior prom she was actually born after my first wife and i separated , but she spent nearly every weekend of her life with me until i moved to mexico , when she was already a teenager and not much interested in wasting her weekend with papa she 's the only daughter i did n't obtain custody of my other daughters , rachel and keturah , are and , respectively when a father says his daughters are beautiful he is of course suspect but i 've never had to say of any of them , she has a good personality or , she has a sweet face that day may come , but i doubt it they are a handsome lot and will always be beautiful to me but unlike some , i have objective proof as well ! because sarah is seriously interested in pursuing an acting career , she is committed to staying in the la area for the foreseeable future she 's the only daughter who has n't yet been up here to visit me in the redwoods but i 'll be down there for her graduation in june meanwhile i have n't heard if she was prom queen she was nominated all our lives she and i have had this routine who do you think you are , queen of the prom ? to which she responds , and you 're chopped liver ! i think i actually got to show her chopped liver at a deli once she was thoroughly disgusted , although gastronomically she is the least challenged of my picky eating progeny what i'm most proud of is not sarah 's looks but her humility despite her getting nearly all the starring roles she 's ever auditioned for in community theater and high school , both musicals and dramas , she does n't act like a diva she is truly concerned about others and has a natural compassion she is also charismatic and always draws a circle of friends around her and , thanks be to god , she 's my one daughter who seems to have been spared any trace of the bipolar gene i 've written three poems about her but i wo n't upstage her today by posting one and , of course , as she was the baby we have the fewest baby pictures of her about which she has naturally complained she 's pretty grown up for and will be seeking her own apartment after graduation she already has a job here 's to you , baby ! love , papa chopped liver
