the shrink rappers have been quiet for a few days it 's hard to know what to say i 've called clink , told her she has to post , i'm sure she 'll have some thoughts soon my oldest is thinking about colleges , here stands a reminder that safety , both ours and our children 's , is a just an illusion for everyone , my heart wraps around the unthinkable grief and sadness mostly it 's too painful to even watch for more than a few minutes the new york times ran a piece today about mass murders and mental illness , it did n't say much of substance cho was angry , maybe he had a personality disorder they speculate on which one , avoidant , paranoid , perhaps he was depressed or psychotic certainly , he was angry , and the article starts by saying he had a hole in his soul i do n't know what that means , but it sounds like as good a way to explain the inexplicable as any sometimes , people tell us things about their mental life that suggests a diagnosis , at least an explanation the depressed person who commits suicide out of guilt , pain , and hopelessness the person who kills someone because voices tell them the victim is going to kill them , as distorted as it is , we get that in this person 's mind , it is self defense i watched a few minutes of the video cho seung hui was filled with rage , he felt victimized , in the little i 've seen , he did n't say why somehow , he believed his actions made him a martyr and he deemed this an act done for his children ? somehow , in his mind , it made sense he 'd been hospitalized once briefly a few years ago , perhaps he had a diagnosis , as somehow we 'd all like something an explanation , someway of grabbing on to this and believing we might catch and prevent acts that linger between severe untreated mental illness and pure evil whatever it means , cho seung hui most certainly had a hole in his soul
