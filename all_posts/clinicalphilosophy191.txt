i 've just been roused from my non blogging slumbers by a post from the author 'n' of the ruminations on madness blog which is helpfully critical of some of my own previous contributions what follows is an attempt at a defense of what i wrote before in 'talking teapots' i considered some dis analogies between psychosis and imaginative make believe n aptly summarises some of my views and then quotes me as follows , and continues the pre reflective cogs which bind the mind to reality are disengaged , and it idles , spins in fancy this is nothing like anything i have ever experienced indeed it sounds a hell of a lot more amusing and enjoyable than anything i have ever experienced ! instead , precisely the difficulty of operating within a psychotic space is , for me , the fact that so many choices must be made , that i must constantly navigate between consensus reality and its epistemological strictures and like it or not , gipps another reality that i am at every moment forced to make choices about which path to follow and , indeed , how to construct , spatialize , and thematize that path constructing a delusion is , in my mind anyway , an extremely even acrobatically creative and also terrifying endeavor i would agree that spinning in fancy is not a good description of the operations of the delusional mind in point of fact i think i was using this phrase to describe the mind imaginatively engaged with a fairytale and i continued 'in psychosis there is not this element of playfulness ' but n 's point is mainly about the relation of choice to delusion formation , and i had suggested that there is no role for choice in the entering into of delusional modes of thought depending on what we count as volitional , this claim of mine is surely wrong we can readily recall patients who seem to 'choose' their delusions , with convenient contents , at convenient times , for particular emotional purposes , etc but we can also recall many who seem simply lost in , and lost to , modes of experience which are not reality oriented what i want to suggest , as a compromise , is that the delusional subject cannot simply choose to engage in delusional thought any more than the sane subject and the psychotic subject in non delusional times choose to engage with many mundane matters our sane existence is characterised by being in the world which is to say that we do not approach our environments from the point of view of a disengaged hypothesis former , but rather are always already engaged in and through our interactions with a pre understanding of the meanings of our situations if however psychosis leads to or , better , is itself understood as the partial loss of being in the world , then the subject is indeed now forced to confront his or her environment as a radical chooser thought thought which is no longer utterly pre inflected through that tacit world engagement constitutive of sanity must be called on to arbitrate between a thousand possibilities , choices must be made the cognitive load must often be overwhelming constructing a delusional system to make sense of the chaos of noise which results when the situations around us no longer call to us with their familiar cries would , i imagine , seem to be pretty much a survival necessity n and i clearly disagree about the helpfulness of describing the delusional subject as occupying 'another reality' this is a huge question which can hardly be settled here what i would be concerned to combat is any of what hamilton , following squires , calls the 'lost tribe romantic' view of schizophrenia this view has it that the interpretative task of the person who wishes to understand the experience of the psychotic subject and that task may very well be one for that subject him or her self , as well as for their clinical interlocutors is akin to that of the anthropologist encountering an exotic tribe on such a view , the task is to suspend one 's everyday understanding and enter into a different reality , with different rules , structures of meaning , forms of experience , etc a cheap way to spell out this view would be to deploy some kind of degraded kantian scheme content dualism and imagine that the person with psychosis is thematising the content of their experience with a different scheme of conceptual categories , and that entering into that world requires us to learn such categories i say 'degraded' because kant would presumably have thought that the very categories challenged by psychosis time , space , etc were constitutive of any possible experience whatsoever this strikes me as unpromising basically because such dualism is so philosophically unpromising , but also because i think that kant was right about the necessary ingredients of bona fide , paradigm case , genuine articles of experience sure , let us acknowledge the profundity of the psychotic break by acknowledging the breakdown in such structures let us willingly abandon the normalising attempts of the cbt pundit for just this reason see n 's nice post on this issue here let us acknowledge too what might metaphorically be called the attempts at world making of the subject suffering such a break but none of this means attributing any ontological parity between psychotic and everyday experience , nor acknowledging that psychotic experience reveals another world n continues next , sanity is synonymous with meaning ? delusional realities are only metaphors ? i think i have an even harder time wrapping my head around this one metaphors are not meaningful ? and sanity is , what , consensual reality ? and consensual reality is what precisely ? are mystical experiences part of consensual reality ? buddhist satori ? dreams ? where does consensual reality begin and end ? so , er , yes metaphors are meaningful we have a meaningful metaphor when we talk of 'delusional realities' but this does not mean that the delusional person 's delusional claims have either a metaphorical or a literal meaning they are not metaphors although the claims often 'behave' like metaphors basically , i believe they are not metaphors because a the appearance reality distinction has collapsed , and because b the subject does not treat them as metaphors the meaning attaches to the classification , not to what is classified and to talk of 'consensual reality' is , i believe , misleading , since it seems to reduce the question of what is real to the question of what a certain group of people say is real what seems wrong about that , to my mind , is not that it contradicts some fancy metaphysical doctrine of realism that i set out to believe in not my style , being a hopelessly wittgensteinian kind of chap to be sure , we need to look to our diverse language games to be able to appreciate the different kinds of reality enjoyed by economic crashes , motor cars , algebraic solutions , mood swings , etc the kind of thing which would mark the distinction between a genuine versus a false motor car or solution or mood swing is quite different and this is a semantic , and not an epistemological , point what seems wrong with it is that it risks a conflation of the idea that what we say think do determines what is real with the idea that what we say think do determines what is called 'real' here or there contrast conventionalism with wittgensteinianism about logical necessity the conventionalist says that the statement is true because of how we go on in our mathematical language games the wittgensteinian says that the statement is how we go on in our mathematical language games the former invites us towards constructionist formulations of the character of meaningful experience invites us towards the idea that we are all engaged in world making exercises and following from that we can readily imagine that different groups of people are engaged in different world making exercises and just around the corner from that is the relativistically minded subject 's outrage along 'how dare they tell me us what is and is not real ! ' lines the latter platitude encourages little other than philosophical quietism so , to return my wandering mind to what n actually wrote ! , no i would n't want to start talking about 'consensual reality' since it implies a relativism or constructionism about reality that i do n't relate to i think there are different 'criteria' as the wittgensteinian unpromisingly puts it as to what is to count as real , actual or true as opposed to unreal , fake , illusory , wrong in diverse language games , and there are of course such diverse language games regarding medium sized dry objects as well as dreams , numbers , mystical experiences , miracles , scents , fashion items , wishes , stamps , etc one of the philosophical sins i'm trying to wean myself of is that of talking about some putative super object called 'reality' which is the putative object of all these diverse language games i confess i still commit this sin all too often though n next writes finally , i have a hard time understanding why it matters whether a given delusional statement is correct or not when is anything ever absolutely and definitively correct ? i m also very unsure as to what gipps means by a rule of representation , though i take it to mean that there would need to be but why ? some kind of external criteria that could be applied to delusions , or rather to individual s delusions qua explanations of an anomalous experience if we were to want to make some kind of evaluative judgment of them now , since the delusional experience is , certainly , deeply idiosyncratic and personal , i don t see how this could happen but isn t the same true for much of normal human experience ? do we have rules of representation for the veracity of any given emotional or affective response , for example ? for dreams ? day dreams ? hopes ? desires ? this i think involves a perfectly understandable misunderstanding of my intent , and i would agree with much of what n writes my concern was with whether we can say that a delusional subject 's expressions of their inner experiences are or are not correct for example , when someone says that someone is having an experience of or , prodromally perhaps , as of thoughts being taken out of their head , or inserted , can we say that they have given a correct description of their experience ? i do not believe that we can , but i certainly do n't think this knocks any spots off the delusional subject , since yes this is equally true of any avowal of subjective experience what i wrote in 'talking teapots' was that it seemed to be that there was no such thing as the delusional subject being correct or incorrect in their descriptions of their own experience why this matters ? well , it was all part of my critique of the adequacy of 'romantic' and 'psychiatric' approaches in psychopathology which either think that the meaning of delusional utterances can be recovered through interpretation , or think they can be seen to be meaningless because they can be shown to fail to describe something properly i think that both approaches try to say too much , and fail to 'sit with' the delusional experiences themselves i turn now to n 's comments on the nd of my ridiculously titled 'aporiae of apophany' pieces n worries that i am considering thought disordered thought to be thought which qua thought starts to unravel or that i am considering delusions to be beliefs which begin to be damaged as beliefs i plead unrepentently guilty to both charges next n worries that i'm not proposing some kind of equal but different status for delusions , but , whether he means to or not , seems to be devaluing how , after all , can a meaningless experience have value ? them well , i 'd agree with the not equal but different status bit i do n't think for example that delusional beliefs are , say , just different ways of understanding 'the world' , that the delusional subject is just occupying a different 'framework' , etc but i'm not so sure about the devaluing bit i guess it depends on the context of the valuation what i'm reminded by is what wittgenstein said about the nonsense that metaphysicians unwittingly proclaimed , that the production of what is in fact nonsense can be very important , and that we should pay attention to it just because delusions are , i believe , not meaningful in the final analysis , does not mean that they are not revelatory and important , nor that it is fruitless for patient and clinician alike to engage with them a delusion may be meaningless but may reveal something of my state of mind , for example or it may have fragments of meaning that can be worked with and , through the gradual re establishing of the relational terrain of meaning , be developed in meaningful directions perhaps , however , on this last point , what i ought to own here , as something i would maintain about the values and meanings of lives not exclusively my own , is my belief that such meaning and value arises in the midst of our relationships with others , work , craft , our humbling private or relational attempts at supercession of our own narcissism , etc not all relationships are meaningful , by any means , but i do consider all meaning to be 'relational' and i do consider solipsism and narcissism 'narcissism' in the psychoanalytical sense to be the death of meaning to harbour merely the ghost of living meaning n goes on to find a putative self contradiction in what i say about there both being no such experience of having thoughts removed from one 's mind , and yet urge that precisely this is the content of the delusional subject 's thought er , when it is i do n't think this is quite such a mad thing to say , though they are having an impossible experience which is individuated through what they are inclined to say about it by an 'impossible experience' i do not mean to say that they do not have an experience which is best described as of having thoughts removed from one 's mind , only to note that there is no such thing as having thoughts removed from one 's mind , and nothing that that is like secondary sense is , i believe , the way to make sense of such contents of thought or experience also , it is not , as n suggests , that i am sceptical of verifying the accuracy of the delusional subject 's claims about their inner experience rather i am sceptical that it even makes sense to talk of doing this verification does n't seem to have a meaningful place in the inner and this i believe is an 'ontological' rather than an 'epistemological' truth further , i'm certainly not claiming this is true of all delusions , only making a point about delusions of 'inner sense' inner passivity experiences etc should we n 's final point resist attempts at explanation or understanding of delusions ? i believe that we should not resist attempts to explain them for example , to understand their origination as for attempts to comprehend them i e understand their meaning , rather than discover their causes , i would want to say the following we would do well to try and understand what it is that delusions may betray about the subject 's mind for example , their themes may symbolically in the psychoanalytical , somewhat associationist , sense of 'symbolise' represent a significant emotional theme or they may 'emblematise' as the phenomenologists have it an ontological sense of self dissolution which , e g , either gets projected onto the world or which get reduced to a merely empirical posit about something within the world being destroyed but just as importantly , i want to urge that we pay attention to the way in which we may 'over understand' delusions , in our haste to make psychotic thought more comfortable , in our desire to avoid sitting with terrifying affects of self and meaning dissolution how we doctors , patients may accordingly 'romanticise' what are either actually forms of world disintegration or 'psychic retreat' like modes of world evasion
