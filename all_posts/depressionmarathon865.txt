i 've received a few comments recently thanking me for focusing my blog on recovery not just illness i really appreciate those comments , as i focused on getting better for a reason there is so much to complain about when dealing with mental illness terrible stigma , inequitable insurance coverage , discrimination at work , misunderstanding of family and friends , lack of support , financial hardship , loneliness the list goes on but to write a blog filled with complaints was never my goal education , yes support , yes inspiration , yes a blog filled with complaint ? definitely not that 's not to say i have n't complained here i certainly have but as my therapist pointed out a few weeks ago , i think the blog has benefited you because you write from a position of health that was a great observation this blog has benefited me more than i ever thought possible after all , i thought i was writing to benefit all of you but her observation of writing from a position of health was revealing i guess doing so was sort of an unconscious decision i had made so her comment was really nice to hear as i said , when i began this thing i set goals of supporting the afflicted , educating others , and reducing stigma complaining about how horrible my life was would not , in my opinion , have accomplished those goals besides that , it would have been terribly boring to read ! i 'd like people to leave this space enlightened , interested , and wanting to return i 'd like those of us with mental illness to feel supported and understood i 'd like runners athletes to see another side of their friends and competitors as with my life , i hope this blog is about living with , rather than suffering from , mental illness i'm glad some of you appreciate that thanks
