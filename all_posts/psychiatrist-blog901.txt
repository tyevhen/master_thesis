i'm not a big toy person i do n't think i did n't stand on line for an iphone , i do n't have a kindle i actually read these old paper things called books , and i do n't greet strangers with , wanna see my apps ? roy and clink like toys more than i do but yesterday i was reading the new york times magazine online because my hard copy never came , but thank you to the judge who brought me hers and i came across this article on the livescribe pen oh , my i want one but for what ? it would have been great when i was a student i was an excellent note taker , but to have been able to re listen to lectures on specific parts of my notes that would have been really helpful now ? i take notes during the initial interview with patients , and sometimes i reference those notes , but i ca n't say i ever have any desire to replay the whole interview , or that there are times when this would help with clinical care face it , cool toy , but i do n't really need it so i started thinking about how a livescribe might be useful in psychiatry and this is what i came up with it could help in psychotherapy supervision residents take process notes on sessions , but it would be cool to have them selectively play parts of the session oh , why not just record the sessions and play the whole thing ? oh , that would work , too , except that it never works it 's rare that a resident comes in with an audible audio recording of an entire session despite all the technology , the residents come with the same little cassette recorders that i used and never worked year ago just an idea what do you think ? and will roy get one ? ? ?
