a few days ago king kong i mean , paige decided it was time to start spreading messy joy wherever she goes she clears every shelf she comes to dumps every basket flings every book it 's like a horror movie i also call her my little godzilla through the day , i am constantly picking up the same spewed crap over and over but then she just stays right with me and re flings it all immediately after cleaning you walk in the room and you ca n't see the floor no floor just where the toy monster decided to vomit little wooden shape pieces , plastic shape pieces , stacking cups , and other various piece y things then , a corner or three where the toy monster pooped a pile of books books everywhere the girl loves to enjoy books , but i did n't think she 'd want to tile the floor with them they act like little banana peels making us slip and slide all over more vomit of stuffed animals , figures , and other random doodads add a lovely sprinkle she does n't have tons of toys , but she does have ones that happen to have a ton of pieces shape sorters , stacking rings , blocks , books , stacking cups , magnetic letters and the like whyyyyy ? ? ? ? ? ? ? i was exhausted this morning after another clean fest gone awry another godzilla attack i swear , my eye started to twitch after tripping for the millionth time in days i decided to go through all her stuff and thin it out , to put it mildly i asked chris to bring a huge plastic bin of stuff and bags of books to the basement all to cycle in the future once she 's tired of what she has out now there should be a hell of a lot less mess to clean now and should be easier for p to choose what she wants to play with her huge wicker laundry basket of books is gone now , there are only maybe to choose from i filled little grocery bags with books and will rotate a bag per week so the books stay fresh back in the day when people used to tell me about their toddlers and how they would run through a room and dump out everything in sight onto the floors creating general chaos i figured it was because they just let them do whatever and did n't really care about the mess i just figured that one day i would be diligent about teaching my little one how to pick up her things smug bitch that i was well , now i have my own kid and the reality of the whole thing has shown its ugly head paige had never cared to make messes she just sort of went from one activity to the next would generally only take what she wanted from the shelves one thing at a time i thought i had gotten lucky and dodged a bullet ha ha ha ! ! ! ! i also quickly learned that she is simply too young to explain about putting her toys away i'm sure she understands maybe percent of what i say and , yes , she has selective hearing too i had always assumed that if they walked , they could listen to you is n't that hilarious ? i was so stoooooooopid i will slowly start working with her on learning how to put things away everything seems to have a specific home now , so that should help make it easier but i know it will be a long time before she will be doing it it takes a lot of repetition and time again i ca n't believe i used to be so smug and dumb about it chalk it up to another parenting lesson learned sigh save you might also like before and now playroom a beginning couch potato linkwithin
