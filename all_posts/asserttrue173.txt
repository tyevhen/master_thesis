back in the late s , when i worked for the mother earth news , all anyone talked about was how the planet was running out of oil it seemed obvious from paul ehrlich 's the population bomb , a bestseller then that an exploding world population would quickly outstrip even opec 's capacity to produce oil from finite reserves that 's all turned out to be nonsense we 're awash in oil now , and likely will be for the forseeable future why so much oil all of a sudden ? short answer cheap money post meltdown fueled a trillion dollar frackathon , and shale seemed like a good idea when oil was a barrel and by the way , do n't think that fracking is simply about natural gas it 's also oil years of capex expansion by domestic producers , ridiculous frenetic pursuit of frackable muck , hideous investment in deep water rigs , and more , have combined to bring unprecedented amounts of crude online , with the result that current u s inventories excluding the strategic petroleum reserve have reached an year high , at million barrels for the week ended february and very soon , there 'll be no place left to store the stuff at least , on the ground , in north america because total storage capacity in the u s is only million barrels cushing , oklahoma is already full and east coast tank farms are at coastal china is said to be full up as well it does n't help , of course , that exxon had a major refinery explode in torrance on february contrary to rumor , the explosion had nothing to do with a planned labor action it had everything to do with the plant being in turnaround to switch to summer grade auto fuel production when an electrostatic precipitator flashed over the refinery will be offline at least six months , reducing u s oil drawdown by million barrels a month there are another refineries in the u s , but most are already at full capacity february and march are big maintenance months for refineries , with many switching over to summer fuel production this takes even more refining capacity offline , short term crude inventories will continue to build all of which is leading to a serious environmental hazard , because with no place on dry land to store excess oil , much of the world 's crude oil oversupply will end up on the ocean , in vlccs and ulccs very and ultra large crude carriers , otherwise known as supertankers combine this with increasingly uncertain weather due to global climate change , and you have the potential for a disaster here or there a vlcc supertanker in , after the oil sell off , million barrels of oil ended up on tankers , in ships that can hold from half a million vlcc to million ulcc barrels of crude each merril lynch bank of america predicts the volume of oil stored on tankers could rise to million barrels by the end of the second quarter that 's conservative , in my view it could easily be twice that total capacity is hard to know while there are at least , tankers of , long tons dwt or greater worldwide , there are probably fewer than supertankers and only a handful of ulccs , total , in the world total floating capacity is probably in the million barrel range relatively few of the largest ships are more than years old , but one can well imagine that with oil storage costs skyrocketing , many mid size and smaller ships of uncertain vintage will be brought out of mothballs , because the money to be made storing oil on ships is irresistible day rates for vlccs , a year ago , averaged k to k day rates sailed through the k mark in january , however , and will probably go well north of k , for any ships that have n't already been booked , before is over many oil companies are locking in one year rates to keep prices well below these levels until the recent decline in oil prices , storage costs were a nominal cents a barrel per month for dry land or and change for sea storage , but those rates are now history skyrocketing storage costs can be expected to drive an ever steepening contango in the oil futures market , with distant months becoming dear many refiners try to maintain a hedge of near vs dear months , so ironically , pump prices may not necessarily come down for motorists any time soon , even if oil crashes through spot , which some are predicting how to play the contango ?

because of the copper to gold ratio as the u s energy information administration explains copper has uses in infrastructure and manufacturing and its price is closely tied to expectations of future economic growth gold , on the other hand , tends to increase during times of market volatility and uncertainty when the copper to gold ratio rises falls , it indicates that expectations for economic growth are increasing decreasing from july to february , the copper to gold ratio fell by , while the price of brent crude oil fell by in that time the lower copper to gold ratio implies that demand side concerns were partially responsible for the recent decline in oil prices the larger decline in crude oil prices relative to the copper to gold ratio indicates that excess supply in crude oil markets has also contributed to lower oil prices we ca n't stupidly blame the arabs that would be jingoistic , silly , and wrong the u s imports only million barrels of oil per month from opec countries not all of which are arabic , of course by contrast , we import million barrels a month from canada if we 're going to point fingers at foreigners , we need to be fingering canadians , not arabs but let 's not be fingering canadians , if you do n't mind let 's just , you know , be friends i 've made some improvements to my twitter timeline scraping code and can now thank even more people for retweeting me the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might still not be complete , but it 's more complete than it would have been with my old code please follow the folks shown below they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links if you enjoyed this post , wo n't you pass the link along on social media ?
