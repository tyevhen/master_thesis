the owner of the facility in which i work really threw me a curve today he asked , more like demanded , that i change my schedule you 're probably thinking , no big deal , but it is to me i was hired to work monday , wednesday , and friday since working my way off disability several years ago , this is the schedule i have worked and there is a reason for it working two days in a row wipes me out i know , i know , that sounds silly how can someone who runs marathons get wiped out just working back to back days ? i do n't know exactly , but that 's the way it 's been since i returned to work while living with this illness prior to depression , i worked full time in fact , i worked hour days ! i 'd like to work more these days as well but every time i try , and every time i work back to back days , i get wiped out when i'm wiped out , it takes another day to recover , which means my running suffers as well and i think i 've recently demonstrated how important running is to maintaining my mood so ultimately , working two days in a row , on a regular basis , has not proved to be good for my mental health doing anything that risks my mental health scares me to death , and that 's why i told the owner , no no i would not trade my wednesday for a tuesday or thursday , as he wished in fact , when he insisted , i told him , if that was the case , i would have to leave he backed off a bit , but not before laying a huge guilt trip on me he demanded to know why i would n't switch i told him , in a very politically correct manner , it was none of his business it was a very tense conversation the reality is my life is arranged around my monday , wednesday , friday schedule not only does it keep me from working back to back days , it is my way of life , and it has been for years most significantly , my running schedule is arranged around my work schedule my doctor appointments , therapist appointments and every other regularly scheduled appointment i have is arranged around it it 's familiar , and it works i realize all of these things are changeable i'm wondering now if i'm being too rigid why ca n't i just do as he asked uh , demanded maybe it would be okay and maybe it would n't i do n't know i guess his guilt trip is working a bit but i'm also now actively looking for a new place to work
