sorry i 've been away for a few days i did n't go anywhere i 've just been getting back into life i 've been working more and more i worked sunday , monday , today , and i'm scheduled to work tomorrow i'm still a little overwhelmed at work thankfully , we 've been a little slow lately that 's helped i 've been getting back into my running as well it 's been very hard the long layoff after knee surgery combined with a one month hospitalization left me back at square one physically it 's been really tough getting going again i ran an interval workout yesterday , and i seriously thought i might die from the effort ! the sluggishness of the depression has yet to leave , and it is most evident when i'm running i know it will improve i just have to continue putting in the effort i have to continue putting in the effort around my home as well the little things are going undone it 's still easier to come home and fall asleep , and that 's often what happens before i allowed myself to nap today , i got one load of laundry done it 's not a lot , but at least it 's something i'm going to continue focusing on just getting one thing done at a time eventually , the little things will get done i saw my psychiatrist today it was nice to make it through an entire appointment without sobbing uncontrollably it 's nice to be feeling a bit better as i told her , things still are n't perfect , but i feel less hopelessness than i did even last week one foot in front of the other , that 's my focus today thank you all for joining me on the journey
