grateful that 's my primary feeling today i woke up yesterday feeling a little under the weather sore throat , sinus pressure but nothing terrible after a wonderful am aa meeting , i headed to my gym the weather outside was truly frightful with rain , slush , and muck , so i ran miles on the treadmill it was actually a nice run i maintained a good pace and did n't get too bored that 's atypical for me and the treadmill ! after running , i lifted weights for minutes i figured the weight lifting metabolism boost would serve me well later in the afternoon ! i think i had pieces of pie over the course of the day i'm not sure any amount of weight lifting helps with that ! shortly after returning from the gym , i headed over to my friends' house i helped bill and cindy prepare for the small gathering five or six sober friends arrived later in the afternoon with food galore ! we had a beautiful turkey dinner , listened to music , played cards , and laughed a lot ! here are the men attacking the turkey ! puck got to come , too puck , puppy and bailey bill and cindy 's dogs laid on the floor all day munching on their christmas gifts bill gave them each a huge butcher shop bone with meat still attached ! i 've never seen puck so content for so long after hours of attacking that bone , he fell fast asleep on their sofa i'm sure puck was very grateful , too , as he does n't typically get bones like that , nor is he allowed to lie on the furniture at home it was a really , really nice day by the time i got home , i was totally exhausted and went straight to bed ! i'm so grateful i had friends with whom to share the holiday christmas can be very difficult for many people , but i 've noticed it is especially difficult for people with mental illness or those in recovery who are detached from families like many , i 've had holidays where i 've simply hung on and gotten through it thankfully , i did n't need to just hang on this year my hope is that all of you had a restful , peaceful , and joyful day happy holidays !
