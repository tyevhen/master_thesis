david healy has a very interesting little site within his main site discussing the academic stalking behavior of some of his colleagues it is worth reading here it gets into issues with james coyne , who has been healy 's most outspoken critic , and it sets an excellent defense regarding the serious questions about healy 's reputation that coyne has raised in my reading of both coyne 's criticisms and healy 's defense , i find healy does an excellent job to quote from healy , the general theme of this page is to describe how one of the consequences of taking a stand on an academic issue that has commercial implications seems to be ongoing academic harassment or stalking and you wonder why i remain anonymous ! anyone with an interest in antidepressants and the commercial influence on their study should give it a read
