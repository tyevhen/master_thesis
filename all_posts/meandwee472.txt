hi friends ! just a quick update to let you know that nothing new is happening i'm sorry i 've been mia i always hate that in pregnancy blogs i read when no updates come and it 's getting close you 'd think i 'd follow my own peeves and update more ! i'm weeks and days along and still uncomfortable as ever ! nature is taking it 's course and i'm just excited for things to move along i 've dropped and my stomach is sticking out like a torpedo i could add a propeller to my belly button and it would look like the front of a small plane my next non stress test is thursday and hopefully i 'll get to see a doctor who can tell me something about what 's going on i do n't know her position or if she 's too big or average i'm not sure on what her estimated weight is i just feel like i'm flailing around now with no information nobody has even touched my belly to measure it or feel around for several weeks so , i'm ready for some sort of clue as to what 's happening in there ! i 'll be sure to update you once i find out something of note and just fyi , when i do go into labor , i plan on sharing everything here as soon as possible this is a shared journey and i certainly wo n't leave you out ! i 've appreciated all of your comments and support and my blog family deserves to be a part of the celebration too i wo n't leave you in the dark ! i 'll be back soon with a proper post and a photo of the torpedo i mean , belly save you might also like just an update an update weeks and days linkwithin
