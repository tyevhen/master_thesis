this excellent graph from calculated risk shows the decline and recovery in jobs as a percentage of the work force , over the last eleven u s recessions from on click on graph for a larger view it 's a scary graph , in that it shows the current recession clearly being the worst , for both the amount and duration of unemployment , in post war history on the other hand , it does seem to show that unemployment has leveled off and is turning the corner ever so slowly if past trends are any indication , we 're now in for twenty some months of employment gains still , it does n't feel like the recession is ending but i guess at the very bottom , it never does
