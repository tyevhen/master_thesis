we did well my brothers and i finished a very respectable th out of relay teams at our triathlon yesterday we finished rd in our division , which was won by the overall winners we finished the mile swim , mile bike , and mile run in a combined i finished my extremely rough bumpy bike ride in i wanted to average miles per hour , and despite the horrible road surface , i did , so i was happy in fact , i think we were all pretty happy with our individual efforts as well as our group time and , better yet , it was really fun ! like i said in my last post , it had been a long time since we 'd done anything together one of my brothers thought it was the first time we 'd done anything sporting together since my dad used to hold backyard mini olympics when we were young kids he may have been right i think we 've all got the bug to do it again , better i e we may actually train , next year my entire weekend went well i think my mood has rebounded my whole family , including my older brother and his family from nevada , were unexpectedly at my youngest brother 's home for the after tri barbeque yesterday again , it 's very rare that we are all together , and even more rare that i tolerate it as well as i did that 's why i know my mood must be better it was nice to tolerate , and even enjoy , their company for the day i'm now busy trying to figure out what to focus on next i'm not feeling particularly motivated i'm not in shape mentally or physically to do any racing right now , which is tough , because this month is full of local races but i do n't want to end up in the black hole again , so i guess i need to pick something out in the future and get busy i 'll get right on that after my nap enjoy your week everyone !
