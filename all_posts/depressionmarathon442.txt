when last you heard from me , i was in the midst of taking a scheduled running day off fatigue and a series of crappy runs had gotten the best of me that was tuesday the unplanned rest did seem to make a difference during my weight training class wednesday evening my legs handled the workout just fine i was pleased thursday dawned optimistically i got some chores done around my house before meeting with my social worker at am after eating a light lunch , i laid down to take a brief nap before my scheduled run , five half mile repeats , which i expected to complete later that afternoon i was ready and looking forward to getting back on the road unfortunately , my nap never ended i simply could not shake the sleep from my head i tried i got up , more than once , but it took hours of sleeping to finally stay awake for more than a few minutes i still thought i could run , despite wasting the whole afternoon on my sofa , but it was not to be as soon as i ate a little bit , it was back to the sofa for me i slept again , this time for a couple of hours i awoke just in time to get ready for bed , and despite sleeping away half the day , i slept all night i guess i needed the rest , i thought , and i let it go at that friday was a scheduled rest day , so i took it that meant today 's run was my only run in the last days that 's a long break in a marathon training schedule , but i accepted it apparently , it was meant to be that being said , i was anxious to run today unfortunately , i had another tougher than it should have been run what a disappointment ! today 's villain was fatigue plus gi distress it took more than hours to run miles , a distance which should have taken less than two hours fortunately , it was n't all bad around miles i began to feel a bit stronger that lasted for a little over two miles just before mile , the fatigue descended once again , and i trudged home all in all , i think the rest did help i feel encouraged that i had at least a few miles of less fatigue and stronger legs of course , i wish it would have lasted longer , but it did n't while struggling through the miles , i decided to contact my doctor and ask her to order some blood work i 'll e mail her today something feels out of whack i 've been through periods of fatigue many times , but i'm usually able to resolve it with the interventions i 've already put in place multivitamin , rest , improved diet i wonder if i'm anemic i hope so ! at least then this would make sense , and i would know what i needed to do to fix it ! until i get some new or different information or something changes , i'm working on accepting where i'm at , doing what i can to stay close to my training schedule , and trying to get as much rest as i can sooner or later , something has got to make a difference i'm going to count on that
