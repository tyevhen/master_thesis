or working towards the mnp see posts below warning plot spoiler so i went to see reign over me with the connected judge and my connected now year old daughter i think carrie recommended it some time ago in a comment on an old post it was my second attempt this weekend to see the namesake , the first go around i ended up at the hoax with my husband so reign over me was a shrink blogger 's jackpot here 's the drift alan johnson don cheadle is a dentist , he lives in manhattan with the perfect wife , the perfect life and two lovely daughters his job and family define him , he longs for friendship , maybe even adventure , his life is perfect but sterile in a boundary violating maneuver bordering on stalking , he lurks outside a psychiatrist 's office to bombard her with questions about a friend as she leaves her office he ca n't hear that he should schedule an appointment , and the poor beautiful dr angela oakhurst liv tyler gets question after question enter scooter riding , unkempt , can we pleeese give him a haircut , dr charlie fineman , alan 's long lost college roommate and dental school pal charlie is a walking talking post traumatic mess from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in which his wife , beautiful young daughters , and poodle ? spider , died in on one of the planes by day , he compulsively and repetitively remodels the kitchen an apology , we later learn , to his wife who 's final conversation with him was about the kitchen , by night he plays video games on a giant screen , goes to mel brooks flicks , collects vinyl from the 's and 's he remembers nothing from before , has written off his in laws , given up dentistry , does n't recognize roommate allan who reminds him how he used to sleep naked oh , good , another penis on the blog hold on , there 's more the two re connect , their relationship becomes meaningful for both of them , their needs almost palpable charlie , however , has this little quirk that when someone mentions his past , he gets violent oops alan , however , is kind enough to overlook a few big outbursts , even one where charlie grabs him by the neck , slams his diplomas to the wall and alan decides that charlie needs help and he 's going to be the one to get it for him so alan has this other little sub plot problem a gorgeous patient , donna remar saffron burrows offers him a blow job see , i told you , more penises , he tosses her from the office and she 's sent off with orders to get a new dentist only jilted , she then sues him for sexual harassment , ridiculous , but how does one prove what goes on behind closed doors ? office partners just are n't happy eventually , he agrees to see her and she apologizes , explains she was mistreated by her ex , drops the lawsuit , turns out to be a patient of the lovely angela , and will eventually be cast as the will be girlfriend of the traumatized and violent charlie the former dentist okay , so alan wants to get help for charlie , who wants no one and nothing that will touch on past memories in a record store , they bump into the nerdy nigel who invites them to join them for lunch charlie quickly sniffs out the deception and yells over lunch you 're a shrink , you even order salad like a shrink a man close to my heart , nigel responds , how does a shrink order salad next , alan introduces charlie to angela , who charlie agrees to continue seeing , in part because she has great breasts , something he does n't hesitate to tell her he talks for a few minutes then ends each session abruptly finally , angela confronts him with the fact that he needs to tell his story to someone or there 's no point coming he leaves , and tells his tragedy to alan in the waiting room as angela listens it 's one of those tear jerking breakthrough moments that one hopes will lead to a cure , or even the end of the movie but charlie goes home , loads a gun , ends up pointing it at a police officer this , my real life judge friend tells me , is called suicide by cop , ends up tackled and spending days in a psych unit , where angela and alan lobby for his release , and angela insists what he needs is outpatient care which she can provide and ohmygosh nobody mentions that her last great intervention just days before nearly got the patient , or a cop , killed charlie goes free , there is another hearing a few days later in which the judge donald sutherland decides that his in laws can dictate if he needs further inpatient commitment for up to a year , warning them harshly , think about whether your little girl would want her husband to go to a place like this give me a break so charlie moves out of the apartment with the now gorgeous kitchen , angela the shrink and donna the sexually harassing patient bring him root beer and pizza , everyone lives happily ever after so ptsd adam sandler style , with lots to think about , and while dr angela is actually pretty good at times , there are all the boundary blasting usual shrink things we 've come to know and love in the movies
