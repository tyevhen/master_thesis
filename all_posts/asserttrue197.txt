i'm celebrating , but as usual , i do n't know whether i should allow myself to this is my th post on blogger com aka blogspot at this url , or so says blogger 's dashboard but in truth , i 've taken down certain obsolete blogs , and some of the are unpublished drafts , so you wo n't actually find posts live thus , i do n't know whether it 's legit to celebrate posts as this blog enters its tenth year , the blogger analytics dashboard says i 've gotten , , total views , most of them coming in the last years the all time traffic graph looks like this but note , it goes back only to i do n't know that i should totally believe those numbers google analytics ga numbers are lower than blogger com analytics numbers , which i'm pretty sure means blogger com counts bots , malware , and miscellaneous programmatic visits , whereas ga does n't for ga to work , a piece of javascript needs to execute in a browser somewhere there 's no browser somewhere in the case of a bot crawl certain posts of mine seem to be honeypots that attract bots what if over half my visits are from bots ? do i still celebrate the traffic numbers ? do i get an seo prize ? or am i just gifted at writing pages that bots love ? traffic was so high last year , i took some steps to discourage bot traffic i put up some page redirections and took down some posts that were apparently acting as bot honeypots that 's why the traffic graph takes a sharp dip starting around a year ago even so , ongoing legit traffic looks to be stabilizing at a little over , visitors a day all by way of saying , i do n't know that there 's anything to celebrate , really but hey , i can still fog a mirror let 's celebrate that way to go , me ! i have two books coming out in a week let 's celebrate that , for sure my lovely wife , who had a psychotic break and was in the hospital last week , is home , finally , and the new meds are kinda sorta doing the job she 's lucid , for a change most of the time i 'll definitely celebrate that i 'll be doing more bigthink com pieces soon traffic at my other blog author zone com is up i 'll soon be launching a support site for the two books that are coming out stay tuned for details twitter has been good to me i have , legit followers and my account has n't yet been hacked that 's good news , right ? i have two grown kids who 've both landed in really good jobs , in this difficult economy my son is an auditor at bowtie cinemas headquarters ridgefield , ct and my daughter works for a successful startup that acts as a matchmaker for pharma companies looking to hook up with clinical research orgs , in boston so really , there 's plenty to celebrate and i guess that 's one thing you have to tell yourself constantly there are things to celebrate in your life you ca n't just look at the down side all the time give yourself permission to look at the bright side once in a while it 's there it really is you just have to glance at it now and then please visit author zone com when you have a chance thanks !
