i have a long list of things i would like to learn , my very own bucket list if you like i would love to learn how to take wonderful photographs , to be able to speak italian , to paint a picture the list goes on thanks to my resolution challenge i can now tick one thing off my list knitting ! yes , at the sprightly age of i have finally picked up a pair of needles and clickety clacked away to my hearts content do n't ask me why i wanted to learn to knit my grandma was a seamstress and could run up a three piece suit in next to no time , my mum followed in her footsteps and then expanded her creativity to cake decorating and card making , i do n't remember either of them knitting ! maybe i used to knit in a previous life ? whatever the reason , i had this burning desire to learn and as luck would have it , my very wonderful friend sarah , happens to be the best knitter in the wild west oops , the west midlands armed with her bag of wool and a selection of needles , sarah very patiently began my first lesson i used short mm needles and chose a gorgeous blue wool flecked with red and pink sarah cast on for me as she wanted me to get a feel for the stitch before teaching me anything as complicated as casting on or off starting slowly i manoeuvred the needle up the back of the stitch , wound the wool around and looped it back through , sarah watched as i carefully started another stitch she was full of praise as i managed to complete my first row i was exhausted ! i have watched sarah knit before and she goes so fast my eyes begin to blur after a while , she knits and she natters and she watches the telly , pets the cat and instructs the household on what jobs need doing and never drops a stitch i watch in awe as she creates beautiful jumpers and cardigans once i got the hang of it sarah let me knit a few rows as she made a cuppa , i was concentrating so hard i gave myself a headache this was n't turning out to be the relaxing past time i thought it would be roll of the shoulders , crack of the neck , sip the hot tea and back to it like a production line after several rows my yoda inspected my work i had somehow managed to add a few extra stitches and my work of art was veering off at an angle , sarah expertly got me back on track and away i went again it took me some time to knit a handful of rows but the more i did , the more i began to enjoy myself as one of my favourite quotes says , 'allow yourself to be a beginner , no one starts at the top ' my first lesson was complete and sarah left me with the needles and the ball of wool so i could keep practising as it so happened i fell ill a few days later and took great comfort in sitting up in bed with my knitting ! my resolution challenge has opened up so many opportunities for me this year and i have been able to do so many of the things i had only ever dreamt of i receive so much feedback on facebook and twitter about the activities on my blog and i am so proud of that quite a few people have told me some of the things they wish they had done or learnt , all i can say is do it ! today now ! do n't keep putting it off , if you fancy learning to knit then have a go , if you want to crochet do it learn something new and i guarantee you will feel like a million dollars and reduce all that stress and tension that plagues our daily lives i am very proud to say i have continued with my knitting and can now unveil my creation even sarah has n't seen the finished piece but i know she will be as pleased as i am wait for it , wait for it here it is my baby 's blanket ! i ca n't wait for my next lesson ! what have you always wanted to learn but kept putting off ? let me know if you have just started on a course or class that you had always dreamt of doing , i 'd love to hear your stories
