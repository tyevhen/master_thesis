comparing hypnotic age regression and primal reliving how does hypnotic age regression differ from a primal reliving experience ? one crucial difference is that the person in a primal remains conscious he experiences the intense emotion simultaneously with its cognitive and contextual connections there is no dissociation of emotion from intellect the person re experiencing a traumatic event feels the original emotions intensely , and at the same time knows what he is feeling he is all there he surrenders knowingly to himself rather than to another furthermore , he is able to connect his past experiences with his present feelings and so make sense out of both in hypnotic age regression , the full benefit of reliving cannot be gained because consciousness has been reduced by virtue of the hypnotic state it is a case of trying to have it both ways of reliving without conscious impact , of releasing pain without feeling it our research has shown that without participation of all levels of consciousness , there is little therapeutic value in going back to one 's past indeed we need full consciousness for profound change full consciousness means the conscious regression to a lower state of brain organization it means being conscious on a heretofore unconscious level the third level of consciousness is the level that is knocked out in hypnosis and that was knocked out in neurosis when the primal event originally occurred what this means is that hypnotic age regression utilizes the same disengagements of consciousness that were involved in the repression of the trauma in the first place the second important difference between hypnotic age regression and primal reliving has to do with intense emotional response as soon as the hypnotic patient gets into an intense emotional state which we call the pre primal phase , the hypnotherapist usually intervenes with one technique or another to control , reduce , or circumscribe it the assumption is that the patient might become dangerously anxious and hysterical erickson 's admonition to his trembling and perspiring subject to shove it down again is an excellent example in hypnotherapy , a feeling is seldom experienced in its entirety , and therefore cannot be entirely resolved for the hypnotic subject to feel all the agony of a childhood means to be having a primal , and for that you need full consciousness or a consciousness fully connected to lower levels to get well unconsciously is an oxymoron unconsciousness is the problem one of the key differences between my approach and hypnotherapy is that primal therapy is a natural , evolutionary one , in which the unconscious arises almost in linear , stratified form from the most recent and most benign of pains to the most remote and the most dolorous of pains it is the nature of pain to make itself conscious , to achieve homeostasis the system is self regulating and permits into consciousness that which can be integrated and accepted by consciousness this is not the case with hypnosis , where it is the hypnotist who decides where and how to probe and how deep to go this , i believe , among other problems , is a basic distrust of the human body and its miracles it is an authoritarian approach , a manipulative one in which the patient is maneuvered hither and thither almost beyond his will , within the whims or preconceptions of the hypnotist there is a basic lack of respect , a lack of understanding of the necessity for self determination rather , the hypnotist , like the parents beforehand , manipulates the child again the child need inside the patient , who is already manipulated and maneuvered away from his real self for some reason therapists think they have to do something to a patient perhaps it is a reflection of a technological society , in which individuals are considered as units which have to be repaired , adjusted or fixed in some way conclusions before summarizing my conclusions about the nature of hypnosis and the value of hypnotherapy , let us look back at the positions of some of the early students of hypnosis it seems to me that we have arrived at conclusions which these pioneers either reached or were reaching almost one hundred years ago charcot saw a similarity between hypnosis and hysteria , as each seems to demonstrate the characteristics of the other he spoke of pathological suggestibility as the necessary ingredient in hypnosis as opposed to the normal suggestibility of the waking state bernheim believed hypnotizability to be independent of neuropathology and hysteria , describing suggestibility as a trait shared by all human beings , with hypnosis being almost entirely ideogenic freud at one time or another shared the views of his various contemporaries and used hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion to treat hysteria and other afflictions however , he ultimately favored a psycho physiological explanation of hypnotic phenomena because and this may be his most important legacy of this period he felt that psychological and physiological processes ran parallel to each other in a dependent concomitant relationship in other words , freud supported a mind body duality and initially aimed towards a psychotherapy which allowed for it for instance , he felt that bernheim 's ideogenic account of hypnosis veered too much toward a psychology without physiology in the end he saw suggestion and auto suggestion as taking advantage of the physiological capacity linking conscious mental states with purely physiological processes i can find something in the arguments of almost all these theorists and practitioners to draw into a synthesis with the primal understanding of hypnosis in perceiving similarities between hypnosis and hysteria , charcot and freud were , i feel , beginning to recognize the interdependency of hypnosis and neurosis charcot certainly appreciated that there was something abnormal about the suggestibility needed to succumb to hypnosis what i am not sure of is whether he understood that so called pathological suggestibility differs from normal suggestibility only in the matter of degree as we saw in the case of modern theorists like barber , hilgard and erickson , neurotic suggestibility is so prevalent that it generally escapes distinction as being neurotic this , i think , may well account for bernheim 's position of an inherent suggestibility in all human beings , rather than just in neurotics freud 's contributions lay as much in his reasons for rejecting hypnosis as in his initial espousal of it although results were often quite dramatic , they were induced for a short time only and depended mainly upon the personal relationship between doctor and patient in a footnote to a discussion on sexual aberration , freud states that the blind obedience evinced by the hypnotized subject to the hypnotist causes me to think that the nature of hypnosis is to be found in the unconscious fixation of the libido on the person of the hypnotizer if we substitute primal need for libido , i could n't agree more freud also came to realize that unconscious material could be arrived at without resorting to hypnosis that if you confronted the resistances of the patient , the conscious mind could discover for itself the contents of the unconscious
