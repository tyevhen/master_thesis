pictures , their clothes , their keepsakes and all the memories that this home holds for you and yet , they 're not there on an emotional level , it just does n't add up sometimes , adult children have to clear out their parents' home before they 're psychological ready to do it there might be pressing financial , legal or family issues that compel them to clear out the home soon after their last parent dies generally , it 's better to undertake this task with a supportive and understanding friend or relative rather than someone whose attitude is , let 's just get this over with and who lacks tact and sensitivity about what this process means for you while you 're grieving before you even start , it can feel overwhelming , especially if your parents accumulated and had difficulty

parents died within a year of each other her mother died as a result of undiagnosed cancer , and her father died several months later of a heart attack while her father was alive , he continued to live in the same house where beth and her older brother grew up her father took her mother 's death hard , and beth and her brother , john , worried about him even though he knew how to cook for himself and he was still physically capable of taking care of himself , he hardly ate and he was beginning to hoard mail , newspapers and other things that were getting in his way beth visited him once a week , cooked nutritious meals for him that he could heat up , cleaned the house and generally took care of things but when she came back the following week , she noticed that he barely touched the food and he began to accumulate mail and papers again although she felt exasperated , she tried to be gentle with her father because she knew he was suffering emotionally when she went to her parents' bedroom , she noticed that he was keeping things on the bed that belonged to her mother scarfs , a blouse , a pair of gloves when she asked her father about it , he told her that it comforted him to have these things around him and he felt less lonely with them around him see my article comfort objects from infancy through adulthood two months after her mother died , beth broached the topic with her father about going through the mother 's clothes and giving things away , but her father would n't hear of it he was n't ready to let go of the mother 's possessions he talked about how close he felt to beth 's mother when he went into her closet and smelled her perfume on her clothes , and he was n't ready to give that up beth suggested that he could decide what to keep and what to give away she said that maybe he wanted to keep a few items of her clothing until he was ready to let go , but he refused to budge soon after that , beth moved in with her father because she feared for his health and well being she also knew that he was very lonely with beth there , her father started eating more and they often watched tv together her father also began showing interest in doing gardening again , which beth thought was a good sign then , one morning , when she went to her father 's room to wake him up for breakfast , she was unable to wake him up she immediately called within an hour , the doctors in the emergency room pronounced him dead they thought he probably had a heart attack in his sleep both beth and her brother were shocked and grief stricken their father seemed to be doing well , especially compared to how he had been when their mother first died a week after the funeral john called beth and said he wanted to go through their parents' possessions as soon as possible , let 's get it over with beth knew she was n't ready to clear out their parents' house it was too soon for her , and she told john this john agreed to wait a few more weeks , but when beth went to visit her parents' home a week later , she found john going through her parents' things and she felt enraged she could n't believe he did n't keep his word she also felt like john was violating a sacred space john was stunned by beth 's reaction from his perspective , he was only getting a start on the process while beth readied herself to join in he thought he was doing beth a favor he did n't see it as any kind of violation beth looked at the piles of things that john made of her parents' things what to keep , what to throw out and what to donate john assured her that he was n't planning on getting rid of anything before she had a chance to look at everything beth knew that john loved her parents very much and , in his own way , he thought he was being helpful but she also knew that john tended to be uncomfortable with his own emotions , and clearing out their parents' home was a way to do it quickly with the least amount of emotion for him as they were standing there confronting one another , beth had the sense that her parents would come into the room at any moment and say to john , what on earth are you doing ! ? ! those are our things put them back beth was taken off guard as to how strong this feeling was and she wondered if she was losing her mind of course , she knew her parents were dead , but her sense of their presence was very alive after they talked it over , john put everything back in its place , and they agreed to meet in a month to go through their parents' possessions when a month had gone by , beth still did n't feel ready emotionally to go through her parents' possessions her grief was still fresh and , on an emotional level , she could hardly believe that she no longer had parents but she wanted to keep her word to john so , at the appointed time , she met him at their parents' home john 's idea was that they would go through all their possessions in two days , but after a few hours , beth was exhausted and she had to go to sleep when they resumed the process the next day , they agreed to go through the things that had least sentimental value first old mail , newspapers and other similar things with that behind them , they started going through their parents' clothes , which was much more difficult , especially for beth as they were going through their mother 's clothes , beth remembered how her father cherished them and would n't let go of them she had this nagging feeling that her father would suddenly come into the room and be upset with them although she knew , of course , that he was dead the process was much slower than john would have liked he would have liked to plow through their parents' possessions to make decisions about them , but the process made beth so sad that she could n't spend a lot of time doing it by the end of the week , beth contacted a psychotherapist because she was feeling worse than the day her father died grief the emotional pain of clearing out your parents' home after they die beth learned from her therapist that everyone grieves differently , and she was having a normal reaction to losing both of her parents she also told beth that , even if it seemed that john was avoiding dealing with his grief at this point , he might feel it much more acutely later on gradually , beth and john went through their parents' possessions as hard as it was for beth , she was able to throw out things that they decided not to keep , give away or sell beth took pictures of the inside and the outside of the house before they sold the furniture they kept all these pictures and the pictures that their parents had taken over the years , and beth made two albums one for john and one for her with the furniture gone , the house seemed empty beth walked through the house and felt like the ghosts of her parents were hovering around beth wondered would they approve or would they be angry ? but she also knew that her parents had each gone through the same process when their parents died within a month of putting the house on the market , the house sold to a young couple with children beth felt immense sadness that the house was no longer part of the family , but she also hoped that the new family would make happy memories of their own throughout this process of letting go , beth kept her weekly therapy appointments these appointments helped her to go through the mourning process as her therapist told her , her brother experienced his grief most acutely soon after the house was sold he would often call beth to talk about their parents and how difficult it was not to have them around any more a year later , when beth drove by the house , she noticed that the new family had removed the porch and the house was painted a different color although this was painful for beth to see , she knew that she would always have the good memories of her childhood home conclusion aside from being a practical matter , clearing out your parents' home
