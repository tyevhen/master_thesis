philip dawdy at furious seasons noted that the fda has officially approved the existence of child bipolar disorder prior to it being included in the dsm , and with considerable controversy in the professional community , the fda jumps on board nice thanks to philip for chasing down the fda 's official view a few questions for consideration by the fda and others that i mentioned a few months ago does child bipolar really exist in substantial quantity ? does treatment help kids with this disorder ? why would a leading expert in child bipolar disorder say that up to of children who are bipolar become suicidal without citing any supporting evidence ? joe biederman must be proud the fda will now help him and his posse save countless lives through the administration of treatments like , say , seroquel for child bipolar that lack any sort of substantive evidence base but who cares even without professional consensus or any sort of official word from the fda , the treatment of child bipolar has already flown the coop in a big way realistically , i suppose that the fda 's view is irrelevant drug marketers and key opinion leaders wield more influence than anyone at fda when it comes to how physicians view psychiatric diagnoses kol syndrome on a related note , perhaps the fda or the dsm v committee can approve kol syndrome as a disorder that would be key opinion leader syndrome for case examples , please see here , here , here , here , here , and here the prevalence of kol syndrome seems to be increasing and seems related to the widespread adoption of irrational prescribing as well as information laundering symptoms include providing false education to physicians as a service to your corporate clients calling one or more of one 's own articles commercial pieces of crap , then recanting hiding blatant conflicts of interest writing misleading review articles that falsely tout the efficacy of one or more drugs , magically converting results that show a product is a dud into results showing that a product is safe and effective making a boatload of money through ties to various drug or medical device companies , then claiming that such corporate ties have absolutely no influence on your professional judgment as an author , calling a study 's results positive , then calling these same results negative a few years later without noticing the contradiction giving tasty sound bites in press releases about the wonders of various medications in one 's capacity as an independent scientist back to kiddie bipolar do some adolescents have bipolar disorder ? sure five year olds ? that 's where i start getting suspicious also see an excellent post from john grohol at psych central on youth bipolar and some of the logical problems regarding how its treatment is advocated and furious seasons also notes that the fda database raises questions about two of the drugs touted as safe and effective for kiddie bipolar
