as planned , i had the big depression conversation with d this past weekend in fact , i got it out of the way within a few hours of arriving we were sitting together on the couch when i came out with it and you know what ? it did n't seem to be a big deal he seemed to take it in stride the talk itself was relatively short mostly i talked , and he listened i was expecting a lot of questions , but he only asked one which i remember he wanted to know if i took medication that 's all i wish he had asked a few more questions , actually answering questions would have allowed me to expand on the information i gave him instead he got just the basic outline of my story , nothing more i told him i 've had depression since november , i told him i took medication i told him i had been hospitalized for it i told him fatigue was a lingering symptom and the primary reason i no longer worked full time i explained that i 'd been relatively stable for quite awhile , and i even told him about this blog unfortunately , i did n't have the opportunity to tell him many details i did n't tell him about the number of hospitalizations i did n't tell him about the suicide attempts i did n't explain other treatments i 've had , like ect i did n't tell him about disability and i did n't explain what depression had taken from my life i felt like i left a lot out perhaps what i told him was enough information for him for now perhaps that 's why he did n't quiz me he sat quietly , asked his one question , and that was about it i had to be okay with that he 's a contemplative guy , and perhaps that 's what he needed to do contemplate depression came up in normal conversation a few more times throughout the weekend , but that was it i wanted to say more , but i decided to let it go i figure it 's out there now perhaps he will have more questions for me in the future if not , i guess more of the story will slowly come out the good news is he did n't treat me any differently the rest of the weekend everything continued forward without a glitch in fact , everything went great ! our relationship seems to be growing stronger with every moment spent together it 's nice i'm happy and i'm so relieved the depression conversation is now behind me
