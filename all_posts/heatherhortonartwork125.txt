we know what we are , yet know not what we may be william shakespeare i have been seeking a balance between small and large paintings recently i enjoy painting small , intimate pieces from time to time i am more comfortable within the confines of a smaller area to cover with paint self portrait , renewed , oil on board , x , falls into the latter category so while there are larger canvases on my easel as of late in preparation for my solo exhibition in november at abbozzo gallery in oakville , ontario , i periodically revisit the self portrait small , like a whispered story passed between good friends , i find solace in these studies we know ourselves better than anyone else through our perception we experience the world though our judgement may cloud from time to time , ultimately we must examine the depths of our being and figure out a way to relate in this world that is so often filled with doubt , mayhem and difficult choices if we employ a tack of regular , periodic self reflection we can truly cherish the beautiful nuances of our daily interactions appreciate them acutely , genuinely as the calendar year changes over imminently i have great feelings about what will transpire in i have at least two exciting projects that have begun in earnest and making them a reality is my prime directive for this coming year it is with joy that i come to the easel most days , it is with a sense of accomplishment that i put down the brush when fatigue sets in do you approach your daily tasks with joy or with doubt ? if you are dragging your feet metaphorically or literally , what can you to do change that pattern ? i see now more than ever that fear within us of the unknown , the fear of failure or inadequacy it can paralyze us and stifle us into continued self imprisonment fear can prevent you from living your life as fully as possible it will , but only if you let it do not compartmentalize your mind but think outside of it , see what you are capable of you might surprise yourself from a technical standpoint this painting was a joy to work on i love wood panel in particular i enjoy the texture and the grain of the wood i use about three coats of gesso with minimal sanding between coats perhaps it is impatience but i love getting to the piece as soon as possible reds are difficult to paint i have talked about this challenge in other blogs but i shall reiterate here how fickle reds are they cannot be tamed like other colours can the addition of white ruins any hope of achieving the desired hue leave it alone unless you want toothache pink no , i have to be patient with mixing reds i use alizaron crimson and cadmium red medium but these pigments are merely the start all other colours can come into play to achieve what specific tone you are after it is a bit of a metaphor for life is n't it ? be patient , approach your tasks with joy , and enjoy the results of your labor on one side note , if you are on the social networking juggernaut also known as facebook , i have a fan page set up simply search for heather horton artwork and you will see the page then click become a fan and you are done thanks and have a wonderful day ! art is not a handicraft , it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced leo tolstoy
