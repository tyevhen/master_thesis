pets have always been a soother for the soul and if you have been following me on social media recently , you will know that i have gotten some pet rats rj and remmy i did have a pet rat before around ten years ago , at a time when life was tough it was one of the main things that got me through i do n't know how or why , she just did with my love of pet rats still strong and all other animals , but i ca n't get a dog just yet ! i thought it was time to get some more many people are horrified of the thought , but in reality domesticated rats are clean , loving and intelligent and make great pets i feel they also do wonders for my mental health because it provides a purpose to look after something else other than myself and are just generally therapeutic it sounds weird because they ca n't talk and yet they seem to provide some peace in the mind with this , here are some introductory pictures do you have pets or animals that help you ? amy xx
