this is what the american psychiatric and american psychological associations have decided in railing against the idea of conversion therapy where therapists try to convert homosexuals back to normal the problem is that neither knows what normal is suppose we show that one year after starting therapy homosexuals have a normal level of cortisol stress hormone or that their blood pressure normalizes then we begin to have an idea of what normal is and if there has been a deviation if after we do all kinds of research biochemically and find a normalization of key factors such as natural killer cells and other cells we begin to see what is a deviation or not so no , homosexuality is not a normal part of sexuality not because i say so out of some prejudice , but because science leads me there and if we give into pressure and agree that it is not a deviation , as the american psychological association voted on some years ago , we do harm to those homosexuals who cannot understand the way they are imagine voting on sexuality as if it were a political issue to be for or against next we will vote on psychosis to see if it is a real deviation if we ignore deep lying causes we will never find out if we ignore brain and biochemical research we will also never find out we need to delve deep into the system to discover ultimate causes if we never truly define normalcy , how can we decide what is not normal ? so if homosexuality is normal it cannot ever be treated and changed ? i have found that not to be true a few of my homosexual patients do change after many many months of therapy and very deep probing into the brain and the unconscious and we never assume anything about it , only that after perhaps of in depth feeling there is an automatic change in some patients we never decide a priori that it is a malady that must be treated , but we also do not decide without evidence that it is normal , either there is so little science in psychotherapy today and the science that does exist , especially in brain science , never seems to make it into our practice even for those who do the brain research they cannot make the atavistic leap into the realm of psychotherapy into deeply hidden secrets of the unconscious why grace nonsense such as conversion with the sobriquet therapy ? this is only done by those beknighted souls who think that homosexuality is evil and must be driven out of the human system prejudice always seems to supersede facts and science it is easier , simplistic and doesn t take much thought if patients could be helped back into their remote history we would see the pain involved into homosexuality , and then we could add to it copious research extant that indicates that it may well begin with trauma in the womb and at birth if we don t look there how can we ever find out ah i know replace it all with prejudice , or in the case of the scientific societies guess and bit and then take a liberal position that it is not bad after all but normal we have just overlooked our decades of therapeutic experience and several hundred research studies why ? because we want to be loved and not be prejudiced , which is what it does make us we don t want to hurt anyone s feelings is that science espoused by august scientific societies ? or is the search for love and praise for being so democratic sometimes science is fascist it doesn t care about our feelings and where their findings lead it cares about truth so it should say that sometimes psychotherapy for homosexuality might be good and that it might be a deviation , after all keep an open mind , and above all never vote on matters of science that is truly ridiculous
