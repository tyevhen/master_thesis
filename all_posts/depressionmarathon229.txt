i ran miles yesterday morning , less than hours after running , half mile repeats at a very fast pace wednesday afternoon , so i treated myself to a little splurge for lunch we have a new restaurant in town , and i 've discovered they make the best , juiciest burgers around and the sweet potato fries made it all very healthy , right ? actually , i sometimes feel the need to eat red meat when i'm training hard that was the case yesterday women do need more iron when training hard , and i do n't get a lot of iron from other sources plus , i love a good steak or hamburger every once in awhile and this one was quite delicious tomorrow i'm scheduled to run miles my miler last sunday was quite challenging , so i'm a little apprehensive right now i find i need to mentally prepare for my long runs in much the same way as i prepare for races i even lay out my clothing the night before , just as i do for races , so nothing gets in my way before a long run i have few worries and no excuses that way tomorrow morning i 'll only have to worry about getting out the door and it 's supposed to be beautiful , so that should n't be a problem jet will join me for most of my miles tomorrow he ran all last week and then bounced around the yard afterward as if he 'd been laying around all morning ! he 's a trooper i love spending the time with him he 's so cute he actually looks like he 's smiling the whole time we run if he makes it all miles tomorrow , which he will if it 's cool enough , perhaps he 'll be the next one to enjoy a little splurge
