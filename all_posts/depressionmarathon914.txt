i'm having one of those totally useless days although i'm sure my therapist could re frame it into some sort of positive , to me this day has so far been totally useless i have a short list of things to do , including running a speed workout , but i 've yet to get out of my pajamas i'm tired , i guess , although i ca n't imagine why when my alarm went off this morning , i was in a deep sleep i barely remember shutting it off puck got me out of bed an hour later , and i had my usual breakfast and coffee i do n't think i actually woke up though within another hour i was back in bed sound asleep weird i remember awakening a few times after that , but never longer than to just roll over and continue my slumber i did n't get out of bed until ! i ca n't remember the last time i slept an entire morning away ! college maybe ? yikes ! once up , i figured i 'd certainly feel ready and useful that has n't happened either still in my pj 's still tired still useless i'm hoping to come around soon , as i 'd really like to get something done i 'd really like to run , or swim , or bike , or even go for a walk ! of course , that will require getting my leaden butt out of this chair whew ! lead is really , really heavy
