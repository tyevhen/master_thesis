i have mentioned in earlier articles that huntington s disease share a common genetic defect it was first reported several years ago a pubmed article links acommonality between hd , kd and sca three neurodegenerative diseases , huntington 's disease hd , kennedy 's disease hereditary spinobulbar muscular atrophy , sbma , and type spinocerebellar ataxia sca have been found to share a common genetic defect an unstable region of repeated cag trinucleotides this morning i read a bbc news report about a potential breakthrough in the treatment and possible cure of huntington s disease this appears to be another positive step forward in search of an eventual treatment or cure for kennedy s disease huntington s breakthrough may stop disease james gallagher , health and science correspondent , reports the unstoppable death of brain cells in huntington 's leaves patients in permanent decline , affecting their movement , behaviour , memory and ability to think clearly huntington 's generally affects people in their prime in their s and s patients die around to years after symptoms start about , people in the uk have huntington 's and a further , will develop it when they are older huntington 's is caused by an error in a section of dna called the huntingtin gene normally this contains the instructions for making a protein , called huntingtin , which is vital for brain development but a genetic error corrupts the protein and turns it into a killer of brain cells the treatment is designed to silence the gene on the trial , patients had the drug injected into the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord the procedure was carried out at the leonard wolfson experimental neurology centre at the national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery in london doctors did not know what would happen one fear was the injections could have caused fatal meningitis but the first in human trial showed the drug was safe , well tolerated by patients and crucially reduced the levels of huntingtin in the brain
