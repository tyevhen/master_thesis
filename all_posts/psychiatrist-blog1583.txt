so we live in baltimore , but my family roots for the red sox it 's a by marriage sort of thing fortunately , the orioles do n't make this very hard in theory , i'm all into it i like being aligned with a cause something more fun than all the medical policy stuff i get to be indignant over i bought a red sox flag and hung it on the house i sort of know what 's going on , i know the names of the players , sometimes even their numbers , i know who dice k , youk , and big papi are i know what it means i think to say it 's manny being manny i know most of the rules and how the game is played , which is much more than i can say for football , even though that 's the other non stop event in my house i like the idea but as a true sports fan , i just do n't cut it the guys in my house can recite every play , every at bat , every caught and almost caught ball i can sit in front of the tv staring at it , get bored and faze out then i suddenly realize there are two men on base and i never noticed them getting there pitchers duel are the worst i do tend to remember grand slams , and i usually know who won when i met clinkshrink , she was a twins fan now , she never talks baseball and roy , as a sports guy , he 's a failure so what 's this got to do with psychiatry ?
