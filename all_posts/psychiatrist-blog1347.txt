thanks for the lively discussion in the post below if you missed it , click here so gerbil tells us she never refers patients to therapists she does n't know personally this got me thinking how much responsibility does a referring doctor bear for the treatment of his patient by another doctor , one he 's referred the patient to ? okay , so in this wide world of psychiatry , when a patient asks me for a referral gay straight republican dog owner , whatever , i often give names of psychiatrists i know personally whom i trust in this realm , i'm pro gerbil if someone wants a referral for someone in their insurance network , i tell them to call the insurance company i have no idea who is in what networks and sometimes i can even give people the name of a good primary care doctor one i know and think highly of if they go , and if the doc does wrong by them , how much am i held responsible for this ? most readers seem to feel it 's not cool to out a gay doc , but am i obligated to tell a patient that someone i'm referring him to has been the subject of a malpractice suit ? or malpractice suits ? or that decades ago he 's been sanctioned by a professional board or banned from a hospital ? or that i happen to know he 's cheated on his wife ? if i do n't just happen to know it via the grapevine or whatever , am i obligated to research the past of another physician before i give out a name ? am i more obligated to do the googling than the patient is ? so you say why would i refer anyone to someone with an unseemly background ? and actually , i would n't if i knew the doctor had these issues and if there were other choices but what if one lives in a small town and the patient needs a specialist , and there is only one such specialist oh , say a retinal surgeon or a hand specialist or a cosmetic surgeon who specializes in name your body part and that specialist is known to be competent despite his unsavory past i know , i know therapists are different chime in
