happy mother 's day ! my own mother is so special , sweet , loving , friendly , kind , and caring i try to model those traits after her i love you so much mom ! ! being a mother is such a sacred and special vocation i feel so blessed and grateful every day to have these kids of mine i call on those feelings when i'm most annoyed with something my kids might be doing whether they are being messy , loud , fighting , naughty , etc lol ! remembering my blessings has saved me from many a time when i wanted to scream or lose my temper they are wonderful beautiful children that god has entrusted me with i know that i am doing my best and i should be proud of that even on my worst days when i feel like the biggest failure and drag of a mom every day is a different challenge and different set of tools are used to navigate and get through the day with love and success i like that when it seems like being a stay at home mom might be mundane it is truly the opposite there is always a different problem to solve , a different joy to witness , a different plan to forge i love being a mom and today i remember how lucky i am i love you noah and paige save
