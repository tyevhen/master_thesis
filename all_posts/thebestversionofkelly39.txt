those of you who regularly read my blog will know i suffer with anxiety two years ago , through therapy i also realised i had spent many years living with a fear of judgement that left me missing out on many aspects of life with the help of my therapist and by facing my anxiety head on i have made so much progress in overcoming this fear of judgement today i did something i never believed i could do and proved to myself i am tackling that fear successfully my therapist would be so proud of me ! if you read my latest diary installment you will know that last week i was contacted by bbc radio leicester and asked to appear on a show i couldn t quite believe it ! my first instinct was to say no way my head ran through all these thoughts they surely must think i m something i m not ? i m not good enough to be on the radio no one will be interested in what i have to say i ll be too nervous and out of my depth i ll freeze or say something stupid or inappropriate or controversial then my sister pointed out that i must say yes as saying no would go against everything my blog stands for i couldn t argue with that nor with my friend who said they wouldn t have asked me if they didn t think i d be suitable and good enough today was the show it was the afternoon show presented by johnathan lampon and i featured on the slot named table talk i had to select three articles from the papers over the past few days that had caught my attention things that were light hearted and entertaining that me , jonathan and the day s other guest could discuss i found my three and was ready to go i was full of nerves though i felt sick all day about it yesterday and had to take a sleeping pill last night as i knew otherwise i would be worrying about it all night ! i arrived at the studio at for the o clock show i met the other guest in for the table talk slot , aminata kamara i was so pleased to see her as i had heard her on the show last week and knew we could easily chat about the same things the producer of the show didn t call us in until almost ten past one and we were thrown straight into it so i was glad i had the time with aminata beforehand as she explained to me what to expect and helped calm my nerves she is lovely she works for the charity twenty twenty , see their website here so , we were quickly introduced to jonathan and then we were on ! jonathan is also lovely and funny and very easy to talk to so as soon as we started i forgot where i was and enjoyed chatting i may be anxious but i m rarely short of something to say i just don t usually have a microphone in front of me ! i had to remember not to interrupt the others ! if you take a listen , you ll hear me regularly laughing throughout it really was fun and i was so incredibly proud of myself for doing it best of all , they want me to go back for future shows to do table talk again and to go in to talk about my blog i started this blog to help me face my problems and get more out of life barely three months in and it s already doing just that today was a wonderful opportunity and i m excited to see what comes next thank you for reading kelly x suggested posts tackling my anxiety and fear of judgement unhealthy anxiety coping mechanisms fashion fears
