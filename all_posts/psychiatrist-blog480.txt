my last post , psychotherapy the down side has lots of interesting comments as usual , what our readers have to say is the most interesting part i asked both dr ron pies and dr lou breger to write guest posts about the topic dr pies put his in the comment section , so i'm reprinting it here i asked him because he 's written a book about how to choose the right psychotherapist , so i figured he would enjoy the discussion stay tuned for dr breger 's guest post later this week dr pies writes dinah has invited me to comment on this interesting discussion , and i'm pleased to do so ! i have found the discussion informative and sophisticated , and actually have little to add , except for a few important distinctions namely , it 's helpful to distinguish bad therapists from bad therapy , from inappropriate or mismatched psychotherapy i will focus on the last category historically , we have two fairly extreme examples of mismatched or inappropriate therapy the composer , george gershwin , complained of chronic headaches these were misdiagnosed as a psychosomatic problem , and treated with psychotherapy he turned out to have a brain tumor ! the take home here is to be sure that so called psychiatric problems have been properly evaluated for an underlying or contributing medical or neurological cause the other historical example comes from the treatment of borderline personality disorder leaving aside the many controversies regarding this diagnosis per se , the syndrome it is probably due to a variety of causes was first identified in patients who fell apart on the couch that is , they had very bad reactions to classic psychoanalysis the deeper the analyst probed , the more regressed the patients became it is now generally acknowledged that while psychodynamically oriented therapies may be adapted for use in patients with borderline pd , classic psychoanalysis is usually contraindicated or very risky most psychiatrists would also argue that psychoanalysis per se is inappropriate for patients with schizophrenia in which , however , cognitive behavioral therapy may sometimes be a helpful adjunct to medication other examples of mismatched treatment include use of classic psychoanalysis alone for treatment of substance abuse which rarely responds to psychoanalysis alone and may actually worsen use of psychoanalysis for most cases of male sexual dysfunction which are often due to physical factors or performance anxiety , and can be treated in a matter of weeks with more appropriate behavioral techniques i do not mean to pan classic psychoanalysis ! when used for the right type of patient with the right type of problem , i believe it may be helpful , although solid controlled studies are lacking and are very , very tricky to design , since blindng is nearly impossible ! cognitive behavioral therapy cbt may also be mismatched with the wrong type of patient for example , cbt alone is unlikely to control severe bipolar disorder though it may be a good adjunctive treatmentor be very successful with some personality disorders e g , antisocial pd finally , there is premature or unnecessary psychotherapy after , it was found that those exposed to the trauma actually did worse than controls when they were given a form of crisis de briefing treatment maybe because it was provided by therapists unskilled in working with traumatized patients it is easy to make things worse in traumatized patients , by over stimulating the traumatic recollections without the proper psychological safety nets finally , as some readers have wisely noted , nearly every useful medical psychological treatment can have unintended or negative consequences , if given to the wrong person for the wrong reason including aspirin and over the counter antihistamines ! in general , there is abundant evidence that all the major forms of psychotherapy are of benefit for the common conditions we treat e g , most depressive and anxiety disorders but correct diagnosis matching of treatment , and a good fit with an empathic therapist are critical predictors of success with good wishes to dinah and readers , ronald pies md for more about ron 's and links to his many books , check out his amazon page here
