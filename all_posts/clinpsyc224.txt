over at drug wonks is a recent post by robert goldberg that would be funny if it were n't so insulting i have previously discussed how drug wonks appears to be a part of the drug industry pr machine the latest is at least the second swipe that the drug wonks have taken at carlat it would appear that carlat is guilty of guilt by association according to goldberg 's reasoning carlat was previously guilty of the heinous sin of criticizing the drug industry carlat has linked to the ahrp in his list of sites labeled great pharma information this induced a rant from goldberg in which he called the folks at ahrp whack jobs i have likewise linked the ahrp on my blogroll , so i suppose i am equally guilty goldberg is also hot under the collar about carlat linking to prescription access litigation those greedy lawyers linked to pal are just suing drugmakers to line their own pockets , or at least that 's the goldberg argument the problem is that it has taken litigation to unearth the infamous zyprexa documents , which have suggested strongly that lilly 's marketing of zyprexa was waaaaaaay out of line , , are the lawyers set to make out like bandits in these lawsuits ? sure but how else are corporations to be held accountable for pushing drugs for inappropriate uses or masking side effects of their products ? and more from goldberg let carlat ally himself with anti science extremists and tort lawyers in the wake of the ssri suicide debacle i will put my trust in the so called pharma academic complex any day oh , goldberg is apparently in the ssri 's are never linked to suicidality camp ? not sure , but it looks that way he may want to refresh his knowledge on such matters here or here oh , but i guess that actually looking at the data from clinical trials and noting that it indicates ssris are related to a greater incidence of suicidal acts than placebo makes me a whack job that 's for y'all to decide , i suppose
