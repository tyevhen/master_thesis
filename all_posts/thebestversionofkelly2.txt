goals is a bit of a buzz word right now isn t it honestly , i have never sat down before and thought up a list of goals for myself i ve made resolutions of course and failed , of course i have even jotted down lists of things i want to do or achieve sounds like goals , right ? yet i had such little devotion to them that i always wrote them in pencil at the back of a notebook , so no one would find them , and i wouldn t be accountable so then of course i never achieved any of them ! i also was all too often embarrassed of my goals , dreams , ideas and aspirations i wanted them hidden at the back of the book as i thought anyone finding them may laugh at me for thinking i could achieve those things , or for even thinking i was good enough to aspire to anything at all it was my fear of judgement at its worst if you read my last post , you will know that in i started to face up to that fear and won so , this year on january st i sat down with a pen and wrote my goal list at the front of my lovely new notebook now i am going to share that list on the internet and i am nervous to do so but also proud of myself for finding the confidence until last year i had always worked and for years if i wasn t at work then i had a child with me life was full , busy and structured i didn t feel the need for goals yet now i find myself in a position where i can afford not to work for a while and both my children are at school and it s all too easy to waste time and that leaves me feeling unfulfilled last year i set goals of a sort , but they were too vague and open , for example , do more exercise without them being specific and achievable i feel doomed to fail so this year i am correcting that i was simply going to list my goals below , but i have far too much chat to leave it at that , so i will treat you to a little explanation of each walk for at least minutes each day i am able for now , this is my only exercise goal i didn t want to be too ambitious initially and set myself up to fail trust me even this is a vast improvement on my current regime i will walk at as fast a pace as i can , and the minutes is a minimum when i say , i am able i mean health wise i won t let harsh weather stop me finish bookkeeping course at the start of last year , i started a bookkeeping course i had two years to complete two levels i m not even half way through the first level , oops to complete the rest in a year is very doable though publish blog posts on the best version of kelly last year i managed and want to better that start a family review blog yes , i want to start a second blog one on which to review things the kids love such as the toys i can tie it in with the kids youtube channel , banana eyebrow find it here and subscribe please ! i like this type of post , but they don t fit with the ethos of this blog publish at least one video a fortnight on banana eyebrow pretty self explanatory this one may be ambitious but one a month just isn t enough of an aim lose pounds yes , i want to lose and weight and no it isn t about vanity the past two years i have been far less active than normal and as a result have put on weight this means currently barely any clothes fit me and as i can t afford to replace my wardrobe i have to lose weight ! practise mindfulness i have been going to mindfulness classes once or twice a month for about six months now , yet i am bad at remembering to practice the meditations between classes my aim initially is to complete a meditation once a week during january and build that up to daily by june face my driving fears i have always been an anxious driver , yet i had fought to overcome that and was managing to drive from leicester to both derby and nottingham until my accident this summer now i can barely drive into leicester but i fought this once and i will again i have listed five places all within leicestershire that i used to confidently drive to and the aim is to get to that stage with each of them again finish the year proud of how healthily i ate ok this one isn t at all specific and is hard to measure however i am still unsure the direction this needs to take only i will know in my heart if i tried my best whilst retaining a level of moderation try fake tan i bet you weren t expecting this one ! i am pale , especially my legs i don t tan i remember once after a fortnight in turkey several people on my last day were still assuming i had just arrived i hate my legs as a result and rarely show them three times now over the past few years i have bought a bottle of fake tan but never had the confidence to use it i know that sounds mad but that was the level of my fear of judgement i didn t want to stand out , so i have always avoided anything fake , tan , eye lashes , nails etc feel ok about showing my legs in the summer see number , no more explanation needed ! enjoy turning i have been dreading my big birthday coming up in august this year , but i have decided to embrace it , enjoy it , celebrate it and hopefully make my forties my best and most confident decade yet social media i want to reach the following follower numbers twitter , instagram , facebook , this will be by far the most challenging oh no , that is it and i am so superstitious , i can t have thirteen goals ! ! i didn t number them in my notebook ! ok so read at least one book a month in addition to all this i will keep up the photography challenge i set myself last january , read about it here i have stuck to it , for all but my theatre review for which photos were provided i really know nothing about photography , cameras or editing i also do not possess the artistic eye or patience needed to lay out photos so overall , i am pleased with my results they are far from perfect , but i am proud of my photos the ones used in this post with my hand in , i set them up in minutes in bad light and was holding the camera with my left hand so all in all i don t think they came out too bad ! wow i will be busy this year ! i will post goal updates i think quarterly someone remind me thank you for reading kelly x
