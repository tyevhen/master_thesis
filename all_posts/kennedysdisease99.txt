about twenty years ago , my wife and i visited vancouver , bc we loved the city there was so much to do that it was difficult to figure out what we were going to take time to see of course , stanley park was a favorite with the bike trails , zoo , and aquarium we also enjoyed queen elizabeth park with its observatories , trails , and gardens while at qe park , we saw about thirty to forty chinese men , women and children practicing tai chi just watching them perform fascinated me the participants were perfectly coordinated in their movement several of the participants were elderly , but their movements were still very precise after watching them , i commented to my wife that i have to try that when we returned home , i purchased a vhs tape on beginner 's tai chi whether i was home or traveling on business , i took time every day to practice after a few weeks , i noticed an improvement in my strength and coordination about six months or so later , i purchased an intermediate tai chi video for a few years , i did very well and enjoyed the improved strength , balance and energy eventually , however , i noticed that i could not hold the postures for as long and my one legged movements and turns were becoming more difficult to perform as my strength continued to wane , the free slowing movements became more difficult and not as fluid then about ten years ago , my boss , knowing of my health issue , mentioned that he was seeing a qigong master a medical doctor in china in los angeles because of a health issue he asked if i would be interested in meeting him i did not really know a lot about qigong , except what i had read and heard about in my tai chi instruction , but i was game i could write several thousand words on my visit because it was a unique experience , but in the interest of brevity , i will just say it was fascinating after just an hour 's visit , i felt lighter , stronger and more full of energy than i had felt in some time when i returned home , my wife could not believe how easily i walked up the stairs to our bedroom the sensations strength and energy lasted for several days , but after about a week , i noticed that things were returning to normal bummer i realized that i could not afford to travel across the country several times a year to see this master , so i went online and to try to find someone closer that could perform the same service meanwhile , my sister in law was traveling and mentioned my experiences to a business friend he told her about a qigong master in michigan that had helped him moving ahead in the story i eventually went to michigan and spent a week living in the master 's home learning the techniques of qigong as with tai chi , i practiced qigong daily and found them beneficial i went back once a year for refresher courses and to learn more advanced techniques at the kda conference in , i gave a presentation on qigong unfortunately , as my kennedy 's disease progressed , it became more difficult to travel and , even worse , more difficult to perform the postures i still practice a portion of the routines today , but i have not been as disciplined as i would like to be i would recommend tai chi and qigong to anyone both programs are excellent disciplines that are very helpful in improving the mind , body and spirit tai chi is very helpful in helping to maintain the muscles used for balance qigong , however , can be practiced standing , sitting , or even in the prone position , once you have the techniques down please feel free to comment by taking a moment to share your thoughts you add much to these articles the articles then become more than just something i said or believe in addition , by adding a comment , you might just be helping the next reader by sharing your opinion , experience , or a helpful tip you can comment by clicking on comments below or by sending me an email i look forward to hearing from you
