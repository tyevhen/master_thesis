today i write with a heavy heart one of my high school classmates had a heart attack last week he was on a treadmill in his employer 's fitness center when he collapsed heroic efforts from two coworkers restarted his heart before he was transported to the hospital unfortunately , what seemed like a hopeful outcome early turned into a grim reality later tough decisions had to be made and yesterday , shortly after he was removed from life support , john passed away peacefully though my heart is heavy , i am grateful john 's family made the decision to donate his organs i think that 's exactly what he would have wanted i watched the journey of john 's final days from afar via caring bridge and facebook it was sad and heart wrenching although i had n't seen him since college , john was one of my group of high school friends he was a nice , kindhearted teenager and apparently , he grew up to be a nice , hard working , kindhearted guy his caring bridge site was lovingly updated by his girlfriend , who he planned to marry , and with whom he was about to build a home to house their blended family she wrote about it all , as she struggled to comprehend this traumatic event his girlfriend 's post detailing their future plans was especially poignant i frequently write about living in the moment it 's something i believe in strongly i'm not perfect at it , but it 's always the goal john 's girlfriend ended her future plans post with an admonishment to all do it today , she said , as you never know what tomorrow will bring amen as i ran miles with jet yesterday , john was in my thoughts almost every step the shock , trauma and grief expressed by those close to him was all too familiar those feelings i 've been there thirty four years ago , my year old stepsister i was went for a bike ride after dinner within hours my father and stepmother were in the very same hospital as john , faced with the very same decisions john 's family had to make in a freak accident , my stepsister was hit by a large truck she was in nearly perfect condition , except for her head she died , after being removed from life support , the next day all of her organs and countless tissues were donated john 's funeral service will be this friday , january th my stepsister , pam , had she survived , would be turning years old this friday , january th so many similarities to john 's story the shock and grief of sudden loss , the decision to remove life support , the organ donation , and finally the timing of his funeral on her birthday , have me in a very reflective mood joyful moments , long forgotten , have come roaring back i am remembering both pam and john today i am reflecting on how my life changed direction after i dealt somewhat poorly with pam 's sudden death from his girlfriend 's writing , it is clear her life will dramatically turn as a result of john 's death so many plans unrealized , yet life moves on i remember how strange that felt in the moment as my life moves on , in honor of both pam and john , today i recommit to continue living right now i know life offers no guarantees i need to remember to say it now , do it now , and be what i want to be now
