depression is a terrible thing , but a sputtering depression is new to me usually i rise out of the slough of despond all at once , spread my wings beneath the sun to dry , and take off but this depression , which i date back to april fool s day how appropriate , has been sputtering i get out of it , my record being ten days , even have a day or two of kilobunnies but i descend again manic depressions are the hardest of all depressions to treat i m on six medications if i were still living in long beach i would have opted for outpatient electroconvulsive therapy by now but without medical insurance , and here in the boonies , it is not a possibility many mystics talk about the dark night of the soul no doubt those more spiritual than i have come through darkness to a new understanding of light , but my experience with depression since the age of has taught me that it is a serious illness which must be treated aggressively , and that each time i suffer a depression it seems another part of my soul has been taken the great insights i get from depression sound like this you re worthless how could you be on disability you should be practicing medicine you re a leech on society your poetry is of no account you will never be recognized your life is a total waste why are you even alive you stink up reality with your narcissistic pre occupation how can anyone say they love you it is all a lie you are a living lie you call yourself a christian but you don t go to church and you drank too much last nigh besides you waste time watching tv you have no plan for retirement you live hand to mouth you re pitiful why does god even allow you to stain the earth ? except it s much worse than that that s what antipsychotics are all meant to treat , the psychotic inner babble of the depressive , a faucet that cannot be turned off without help i m not saying i haven t had to have treatment for acute manias in the past i have yet for most manic depressives the ratio of depression to mania is at least three to one and manias are almost always followed by severe depressions if left untreated my crying jags began while visiting my daughter and grandson over the weekend , and per usual they came in the late morning and late afternoon weeping while depressed does calm the system temporarily , but i find it actually increases depression since there is nothing real to cry about , thus crying reinforces the black mood instead of ventilating it having said all this , territory most of you have traveled with me if you have followed my blog , i refuse to give in to depression in any ultimate sense , the subject of today s sonnet mastering melancholy you are the demon that i know so well , so intimately even my wife can t know i d tell her if she could she knows your spell and how you turn a living man to wood mere wood is better than your torturings , the way you saw me always against the grain for the most friction in your butcherings leaving a raw vacuum of pain there s no negotiation , nothing to mend my resin bleeds for no one i am lost , lost in the darkness of your great pretend a terrible joke it is , and at such cost but you won t master me i master you by doing nothing more than getting through at kilorats , ce
