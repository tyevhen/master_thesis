mary connolly breiner r and me i was talking recently with a neighbor who told me i do n't like or trust women the people i preferred to work with and my closest friends are men i felt sorry for her some of my dearest friends are men , too but girlfriends women friends are more numerous and especially treasured our girlfriends are there in each phase of our life , to share joy and tears and growing , and some of them stay in our hearts forever i think of childhood friends like pat hill , mary laing and sue blum with whom i played and dreamed growing up and who remain dear to this day i think of high school and college friends like eileen loubet adams , suse harper yates , jeanne nishida yagi , ruth woodling , lorri scace , cheryl rennix and georgia watson with whom i shared and share growing experiences and new discoveries there have been work friends so many wonderful women , including just about everyone i knew at 'teen magazine there were the friends from acting barbara ferrell , mura kievman , joyce johnson , barbara brownell and robyn gerrard who commiserated and celebrated all our disappointments and triumphs during those memorable years and who are still close to my heart and then there are the new friends of my young old age here at sun city anthem phyllis skurda , kim tuomi , louise putrick , pat cosentino , judith anderson , mary gooday and linda kennedy to share this latest passage as a family of friends and then there are some new and treasured women friends in the blogging community who bring a wonderful new sense of connection but most of all , i think of mary connolly breiner , whom i met when she joined the staff of 'teen magazine , and who has been so special throughout the forty years of our friendship in some ways , mary and i grew up worlds apart she was the youngest daughter of a famous novelist and screenwriter and grew up on the beach in star studded malibu colony i grew up in decidedly more modest circumstances but mary and i shared some essential experiences alcohol had an impact on both our families and we found solace in faith at one point , i had dreamed of becoming a nun mary actually was a nun for ten years her first job post convent was at 'teen we all tip toed around her for a week or so until her wicked , edgy sense of humor became apparent and she was , in an instant , one of the group we both dreamed of becoming psychotherapists , but mary , quite wisely , acted on her dream years before i did she attended graduate school every weekend for several years while working at 'teen i watched in awe , unwilling to give up weekend fun to create a new career opportunity besides , writing was my present and future but the dream stayed alive and , years later , i enrolled in graduate school at night while working full time mary , by that time a seasoned and successful psychotherapist , was there every step of the way with encouragement and guidance we supported each other through love relationships that did n't work out and also those that did we stayed close at our weddings and ever after she was by my side the day i married bob in and i was equally present and thrilled when she married john in he was and is the love of her life they met while working at a major corporation he as an executive in the international division , she as a therapist in eap john was catholic , a widower and had three wonderful children matt and liz in college and little katie , , who was born less than a year before her mother had died of cancer mary embraced her instant family with joy even when a corporate merger early in their marriage cost them their jobs and turned their world upside down , mary and john never wavered in their love for each other and when he sustained a severe head injury in an accident several years ago , mary was filled with gratitude that she did n't lose him and she eventually retired from her private practice to care for john and to enjoy the pleasure of his company full time through the years , i 've often thought that our friendship is n't a typical girlfriends' relationship we 've never been shopping together or cried through a chick flick together we have never lived close to each other and so have n't been in and out of each other 's houses on a daily basis our friendship is n't based on doing as much as being we will sit down together in person or on the phone and tell each other what 's really happening , what we 're truly feeling , memories that linger and dreams that beckon we laugh a lot and we 're not ashamed to share our less virtuous thoughts and feelings she knows all my faults and likes me anyway i do n't think she has any faults , but if she did , i 'd still like her , too her love and acceptance feels unconditional and i know i 'd love her no matter what in those ways , i suspect that we are typical girlfriends listen , girlfriends share feelings girlfriends know when you want to vent and will be there for you without rushing in with a solution girlfriends have the patience to listen to all the details of each other 's lives and to remember girlfriends are there for you in good times and the devastating times of life mary appeared , as if by magic , at my parents' funerals and at aunt molly 's graveside service at the latter , i faltered and broke into tears as i tried to read emerson 's definition of success while aunt molly 's urn was lowered into the grave suddenly , there was a supportive arm around me and a voice joined with mine in reading the conclusion to know that one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded i knew it was mary even before she spoke and thought how much those words applied to her as well as to aunt molly girlfriends are n't afraid to be vulnerable and to say i love you ! one of the few negatives of leaving los angeles for arizona last year was moving miles away from dear friends especially mary , whose husband needs her and is n't strong enough to make the trip over to visit when i visited her on her birthday this year , we hugged and cried and said i love you ! over and over and , since my birthday was only a week before , she had a gift for me , too two wood carved girlfriends holding each other close that 's what we do with our girlfriends we hold each other close through all the changes and challenges , storms and sunshine of our lives even when miles apart
