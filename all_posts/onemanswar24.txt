today was a really good day i don t know why exactly , but it was never mind the troublesome fact that having one good day is blog worthy that probably means i have a long way to go in fully recovering from a crash and burn episode of severe depression last summer yet that s a blog for another day let s get back to today it was a whistle in the shower , think funny things , eat chocolate and enjoy life kind of day seriously since i reverse engineered a bad day in an earlier blog , let s walk back through today and see if we can identify what made it a good one the fact that i didn t have to go to work today surely is a factor , but i promise you i have just as many bad days on the weekends as i do during the work week sometimes more but in the interest of full disclosure , i was off today work , that is i ate a healthy breakfast i learned in a partial hospitalization program that good nutrition is key in battling depression this morning , i had a wheat waffle covered in peanut butter no syrup ! i went for a brisk walk i m a runner at heart but can t bring myself to run hard again just yet i ve lost my edge , lost that eye of the tiger with this soul sapping illness but instead of lying on my ass today , i got it moving i made two personal phone calls that i needed to make while walking , one to my mom and one to my brother i did not drink alcohol last night back when i was a heavy drinker , the next day or two okay , three were often brutal my anxiety would go through the roof my depression would worsen that was almost a guarantee i took some time for myself i went and got a massage i ve blogged about the benefits of massage before it really helps me if you are screaming through the keyboard that you can t afford a massage right now or don t have the time for it , fine the point is i did something for me and me only that s pretty rare for me but it s critical in recovery today wasn t perfect but what day ever is , even for normal folks ? don t get me wrong i am not trying to simplify a complicated illness some days are brutal for those suffering from depression no matter what we do truth is , today was a good day because of choices i made today , yesterday , and the day before that and probably even the month before that i ve been taking my meds and making my appointments with my therapist , for example i want to thank you for taking the time to read this blog i write to cope and , hopefully , connect with others who suffer if you had a bad day , take heart keep fighting it will get better
