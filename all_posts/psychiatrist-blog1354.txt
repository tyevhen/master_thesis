i 've decided to start a series of thought provoking i hope scenarios these are n't real patients , they 're just food for thought please chime in so how much should one psychiatrist say to his patient about another psychiatrist ? here 's the specifics a patient wants a referral for her friend the friend is having difficulties related to his sexual orientation and the patient asks for the name of a gay therapist to give to her friend she 's only asking for a name , nothing about insurance or the specifics of any mental illness is it okay for the psychiatrist to give her the name and phone number of a gay psychotherapist to give to her friend ? what are the assumptions that are being made here and is this a reasonable thing to do ?
