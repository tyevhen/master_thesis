my friend colin made a fantastic animation based on one of my old posts i'm pretty sure colin would be totally pumped to get some recognition for his hard work , so if you 're feeling helpful , you can go over to newgrounds and rate the video and or leave a comment if you 're confused about how to rate things on newgrounds , go here i have provided a handy screenshot with a giant yellow arrow and some helpful instructions in other news , i recently moved to bend , oregon because it is quite possibly the best place on earth and just breathing the air here is like huffing joy and celebration the bad news is that i 've been busy using my shriveled , little t rex arms in a mismatched battle with heavy boxes and furniture perhaps the exhaustion and feelings of physical inadequacy involved in the move caused me to be slightly more vulnerable than usual , but a few days ago , i wrote this post which i promptly buried below my other posts because it is shameful and it could possibly be interpreted in a way that would make me look like an alcoholic anyway , i'm working on a new post and , despite signs to the contrary , i'm not beginning an agonizing retreat into a life of substance abuse and failure in fact , just this morning , i ate fruit , drew a picture of my dog and then later waved pleasantly at a person passing by on the street is that something that a despondent , irreversibly damaged drunk would do ? kapow totally logical and irrefutable rebuttal to your possible doubts
