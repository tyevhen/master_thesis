if people knew that taking antidepressants for two years or more doubles their risk of diabetes , would they continue to take them ? that 's what i wondered when i saw the paper by andersohn et al in am j psychiatry called long term use of antidepressants for depressive disorders and the risk of diabetes mellitus it 's an eye opening study , drawing on data from the u k 's patient database the numbers are solid and the results hard to argue with even after controlling for body mass index bmi , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , smoking , age , and other factors , the authors of the study found that long term use of antidepressants of any kind tricyclic , maoi , ssri was associated with an almost two fold greater risk of diabetes this is a shocking result , because it indicates that antidepressants add significantly to the burden of disease in the u s , where million people take antidepressants of them for two years or longer , it could mean an extra million cases of diabetes from the time period to the period , antidepressant usage in the u s rose , according to the centers for disease control this corresponds with an almost quadrupling of diabetes cases in the same time frame before you start thinking that maybe depression in and of itself is predisposing to weight gain and diabetes which it is , go read the andersohn paper the authors already thought of such things and controlled for them in their study control populations they found that even after controlling for the usual risk factors , recent long term months or more antidepressant usage increased the risk of diabetes by consult the paper for a list of the antidepressants included in the analysis and the individual risk ratios for each the andersohn study was motivated by an earlier finding that continuous antidepressant use over an average study duration of years was associated with an fold increased risk of diabetes ci in the placebo arm and fold increase in risk ci in the lifestyle intervention arm of the study reported in diabetes care mar the andersohn study confirms the previous finding independent confirmation of the foregoing results can be found in a cross sectional study of patients in finland mika kivim ki et al , writing in diabetes care , december , , reported finding a two fold increased risk of type diabetes in patients who had taken or more defined daily doses about six months' worth of antidepressant medication stratification by antidepressant type found no significant difference for tricyclics versus ssris interestingly , diabetes risk was higher for patients who had taken or more daily doses versus those who 'd taken to daily doses , indicating a kind of dose response relationship the longer you 're on meds , the more likely you 'll get diabetes the graph depicted further above from cdc 's diabetes report card shows pretty clearly that if there 's one thing america does n't need right now , it 's more cases of diabetes diabetes is already out of control in the u s in many counties all of those shown in dark red below , diabetes already afflicts more than of the population we already know that high body mass index , out of band blood lipids , inactivity , and age are important risk factors for diabetes but we now know a major new risk factor antidepressants as richard r rubin writes in us endocrinology , applying current estimates of the number of people in the us who have prediabetes million with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose , and estimates of the prevalence of antidepressant use among adults in the us at least , it would seem that almost six million people in the us have pre diabetes and are taking antidepressants this is a fairly large number of people , and if future research confirms that antidepressants are an independent risk factor for type diabetes , efforts to minimize the potentially negative effects of these agents on glycemic control should be pursued
