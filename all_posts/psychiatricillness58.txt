this is my th post wow ! i never thought this blog would last more than minutes , i definitely did n't intend to keep it going this long ! writing to my blog does make me feel better tho' my day has been crap again , my mood is falling and i keep crying i have also been daignosed with irritable bowel syndrome which just adds to the overall discomfort i came home sick again today as my stomach felt like it was going to explode ' ! i keep crying for no real reason too and this morning at work i was feeling very paranoid i had to do a short presentation and i lost my nerve ' i also felt very self concious i cry when people look at me and i cry when people are nice to me , and i cry when people ignore me ! poor people ! !
