little house in the big woods by laura ingalls wilder this is the first story of larua as a year old in a log cabin in the woods of wisconsin i 've never read any of these books before , and honestly i ca n't even say whether i ever watched the tv show so i did n't know quite what to expect whatever i expected , this was n't it this book is written with a slice of life narrative with no plot and very little dialog it was kind of a passive story or perhaps a string of memories anecdotes that are connected in approximate chronological order not that i'm saying i disliked it it was really cute and a really quick read i'm definitely going to continue with the rest of them i'm also not entirely sure why this is considered a christmas book yes , christmas was included in the time line , but it was about an entire year living in the little log cabin in the woods i think the cutest part of the book was when laura and her mother went out to milk the cow at night and mistook a bear for the cow laura 's corn cob doll was also pretty adorable i think it 's interesting how many people care about whether this story was truly factual i mean , of course it 's not fully factual apparently laura was younger when she lived on the prairie than when she lived in the woods in wisconsin , but she switched the timeline around i'm sure some of the memories she mentions are also not fully factual , but that 's how family anecdotes are they change with time and audience this is n't an autobiography , this is a string of anecdotes for children
