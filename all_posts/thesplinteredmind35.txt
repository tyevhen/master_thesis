i'm depressed today , so i will be listening to christmas music mixed with dance music to lift my spirits videos that i watched last night still haunt me i especially have n't recovered from watching an avant garde biopic of karen carpenter done with grime , war footage , and barbie dolls i may never be free from its hateful snark thanks , irc guy , for the recommendation if i had only left it alone i could have walked away , shaking my head , but unscarred however , i then looked up karen carpenter collapsed on stage and watched final performances of hers where she looked like a poster child for third world hunger while smiling singing i saw interviews with her in complete denial then she was suddenly dead because of complications from anorexia nervosa yeah , the irc guy 's getting coal this year from me that artsy documentary was horrible , but i also did n't need this distraction i was freshly sixteen at the time , so i do n't recall how i felt about karen 's death in more than simply feeling sad at her passing i did n't dig most of my parent 's music , but i had fond memories of the carpenters they represented christmas to me karen carpenter may have been the first celebrity that i was aware had died , but not the first celebrity death that affected me that was reserved for jim henson years later however , seeing a beautiful , amazingly talented person slowly waste away had a profound effect on me last night she accomplished so much by the age of thirty two honestly , though , this book that i'm writing is what is truly getting me down i'm behind on freelance assignments , money is tight , and i am trying to finish this book by my birthday on tuesday it 's been a hard book to write because of the subject matter i know , writing about dealing with suicide and understanding how to give love support to the suicidal is not necessarily a cheery topic even after spending a year and a half working on it in my spare time , you would think that i had a grip on the subject , but today i discovered a reader of mine had recently tried to take her life and was hospitalized i 've never stepped that deeply into suicide , personally , though i came very close i was so taken by surprise that i floundered for a moment finding things to say to her karen carpenter 's death touched me more deeply as an adult in his s than as a teen , so i was already a bit down when i came across my reader 's email i hope that my words were comforting and not empty , or worse , burdensome have i been triggered ? no , i'm not suicidal myself , but i can feel depression 's grip tightly on my heart this afternoon one thing i will do is to edit my christmas smart playlist to exclude the carpenters for the time being sorry , karen your voice will bring pain to me today i still have four chapters to go and need my strength here 's that experimental film by todd haynes if you 're interested to know what i'm talking about i do n't know how long the link will be active i would n't watch a lot of it the disrespectful , snarky treatment of karen 's life , and the terrible smearing done to her family made me turn it off this is a biopic only twenty somethings in college would produce those are the heady , euphoric years when we think we know it all , before we start to notice that we do n't know much at all in the meantime , i am plunking away on my keyboard , getting closer to being finished one word at a time wish me luck
