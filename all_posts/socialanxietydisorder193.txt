two years ago i started taking psych drugs , almost overnight i lost energy , became short of breath , and put on weight lots of weight i went from very active to very sick in a short period of time i m off them now , but still occasionally short of breath etc anyone elae get that with psych drugs ? answer i don t take those types of drugs however , i believe you should get checked out by your doctor sometimes medications can cause long term effects even after you get off of them it can also be another medical condition that i think you should really get checked out infact , any time you have anything wrong with your breathing you should , especially if you smoke or work in conditions where the air has substance in it that could effect your lungs you could have a touch of asthma , or food allergy , anxiety attacks , etc only your doctor can be able to run the appropriate tests to find out the cause and treat you accordingly question medical doctors , do you agree ? article in jama said psych drugs for kids is mainly a cash cow ? i was reading an article in a jama at work that was left by a doctor it said that most psych drugs are given to kids who don t need them and are only perscribed to make the drug companies money what do you say ? answer doctors dont care if the drugs companies make money they only care if they make money prescribing meds doesnt make doctors that much money question are psych drugs just a scam by the pharmacutical industry ? every psych drug i took , has ended up in court for being marketed for things that it cannot treat yet my psychiatrists keeps prescribing me this garbage that does nothing but make me worse answer yes it is a money scam very few of the drugs actually work , and don t cause extended health problems some are good , don t get me wrong but mostly it s all about moneyyy
