when i was in the th grade , my mom bought me a bracelet from the local christian book store i was always so nervous going in that fragile shop i was especially concerned when i had to chase after my two year old tasmanian brother as he whipped through the displays like a tornado on one particular day , after the errands were done and my brother was caged back in his car seat , i let out a deep sigh of relief nothing was broken today from the driver s seat , my mom reached around and pulled out a little white box with a pearly white ribbon and handed it to me i was going to give this to you for your birthday , mom said , but i can t wait go ahead and open it now mom is never one to keep secrets inside the box , in my th grade opinion , was a really cool bracelet engraved in the metal read the encouraging words , perseverance i can do all things through christ who strengthens me phil i was immediately struck by those words as i read them since that day , has become my permanent mantra many years later , during the summer olympics before my sophomore year of high school , i spiritually connected with an american diver , laura wilkinson during an interview , she told the cameras of her devotion to st therese , the little flower , and of her favorite bible verse , philippians i followed her events more closely than any of the other athletes she was not expected to go far , but she persevered i cried when she cried as she sang the national anthem with the gold medal around her neck many year after that , the bracelet is long gone , but the words are forever etched in my mind in my darkest of times , i would repeat over and over until peace was restored and calm filled my mind in those times , i did not care about the doing all things part of the sentence i was more relieved by the words christ and strength at that time , i want to do just one thing live on my road of recovery , jesus used that verse and helped me grow in stronger and stronger i know for a fact that i would not be here today if it had not been for the strength of christ this past october , i achieved a huge personal goal i completed a full marathon in the months leading up to race day , i fought physical , mental , and emotional difficulties besides the grueling workout regimen , i worked through a foot injury and a knee injury for me , my physical injuries were symbolic of my mental and emotion injuries that no one could see i was going through some intense internal suffering and i didn t know how to work past it by preserving and working through my marathon training , i was also able to persevere and work through some of my mental sufferings the day of the marathon finally arrived , and like most participants , i had pre race anxiety i was dealing with it okay until about five minutes before they fired the canon all of a sudden , i had a full blown panic attack what the hell was i thinking ? what am i doing ? there is no way i am going be able to run this race ! i willingly agreed to run miles ? not going to happen ! my head started to spin with all kinds of doubts my body started shaking uncontrollably i started hyperventilating people around me looked over with concern i got light headed and began to get tunnel vision i thought for sure i would pass out i covered my ears , closed my eyes , bowed my head , and begged god for mercy please god please god i looked up standing right in front of me was a person wearing a t shirt with the following words , i can do all things through christ who strengthens me ! immediately , a sense of calm rushed over my whole being a warm breeze surrounded me and filled my lungs with courage a huge smile spread across my whole face i was ready to run i knew i could do it because christ was going to give me the strength and he did i finished the race christ still gives me strength and he will continue to give me strength until the end of my days here on earth pray with me now , i can do all things through christ who strengthens me phil amen
