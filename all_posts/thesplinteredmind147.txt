the protective scroll wheel covering came off my ipod mini a few weeks ago and it revealed an odd defect on the select button a perfectly round divot at the top of the button warped the buttons shape and prevented it from being flush the unit worked fine aside from occassional calendar issues , so i did n't think the functionality was ruined , but it did bother me so i contacted apple they wanted to charge me for tech support since my unit was outside of the free days , so i hurriedly explained my need and that led me to their website where i filled out a form i must have selected the wrong section though because there were no options to select a problem with my ipod just it 's peripherals i selected what i thought was a peripheral that would be the same size as my ipod the remote i explained the problem in detail and mentioned that this was not a remote issue i then submitted the request hours later a box arrived that was the perfect size for my ipod mini but inside was a brand new shiny remote there was no return packaging for my broken remote i called my local apple retailer and asked what i should do since a my problem had n't been fixed and b i had n't paid for the remote my concern was that apple would charge me if i called them again the paperwork did say they would bill me , however , if the issue was n't covered by my warranty but they have n't billed me yet the guy at the apple store told me to keep it so i 'll wait for the bill , but i suspect it is n't coming so weird defect yielded positive results who says nothing good ever happens to me ? oh , i do at any rate , i filled out the forms again and this time received a return box for the ipod off it goes today am i at the beginning of an upswing ? or are the forces of the universe gathering in preparation for the big smack down ? who knows how this will turn out ? hopefully , the worst that will happen is that i 'll go through withdrawal while my ipod is away you might also like apple glitches causing adhd disruption , no apple watch love add you 've just got to laugh bad luck learning to laugh in the face of irritation bad luck universe , me linkwithin
