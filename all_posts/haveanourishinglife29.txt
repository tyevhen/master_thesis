nursing makes you really hungry really really hungry i think i have a bigger appetite now than when i was training for my marathon being able to eat a lot can be fun if you let it however , if you struggle with an eating disorder , being uncontrollably , perpetually hungry can be terrifying since having a baby , some eating disorder thoughts have crept back into my life i was anticipating having minor setbacks because of post pregnancy body image issues i also knew it would be difficult to control negative feelings with not being able to use my coping skill because of the responsibility of taking care of a baby for the most part , though , i 've been ok the other night i was really down because i ate a huge dinner i was beating myself up and having a hard time moving on i was upset , tearful , discouraged i felt ugly , worthless , defeated all too familiar feelings , making things worse craig reminded me of an important fact he said , you ate food , mary it 's not like you drank a gallon of poison you body will use it as energy and food for dominic food is not poison eating food does not make me a bad person and repeat until it sinks in
