i know that most of you base your entire lives around when i will and will not be posting , so i figured i ought to warn you that boyfriend and i are in the process of relocating this means that i will not have the internet for a few days i'm going cold turkey i 'll be back to my regular posting schedule in less than a week probably even sooner , but i do n't want to give you false hope in the event that something goes awry if you absolutely cannot live without reading something new on my blog who knows ? , i have prepared a little secret surprise for you to enjoy during my absence but you have to find it canadiandoubles , do n't you dare tell anyone about how to get there ! let them find it by themselves or you could just read and post tons of comments on my older posts to surprise me when i get back you have no idea how thrilled i would be if that happened either way , i have not forsaken you i am just going out into the world to have experiences that i can later write about i mean , you ca n't move to a new city without finding at least something to write about that sounded foreboding i hope i did n't just jinx myself
