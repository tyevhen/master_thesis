tracy mcgrady , a seven time nba all star , just experienced his fifth first round loss in the nba playoffs , although the rockets took it to seven games before the series he said , this is on me it s on me to lead my team to victory overall he played well , but utah had a better team , especially as their big men were more mobile than yao ming as in ming vase , an over hyped player whose offensive limitations and defensive liabilities are rarely mentioned for fear of reducing the nba 's worldwide revenue when the series was over , wiping a tear from his eye , mcgrady admitted his failure and responsibility , even though during the series he was his team s most effective player in his view he could have played better , thus accepted the blame for the loss there 's a manly approach to responsibility and failure , even if a bit harsh in the chronicles of narnia c s lewis writes that a king should be the first in battle and the last to retreat we read about such men in history , like william the conqueror and admiral nelson they are hard to imagine in this day and age imagine if george bush , the decider , like tracy mcgrady , said i decided to go to war with iraq it was one of my early policy aims and only steeled my resolve to do it yes , i had advisers who favored it , but i did n't have to take their advice i take responsibility for our failure there , and i'm going to do everything i can to get our troops back home we ve lost and it s on me time to move on shocking , i know one of the great things about sports , for all the criticism of salaries and steroids , is that athletes can tell the truth about things like responsibility and disappointment like mcgrady , they can even speak in the first person for bush it s mainly we when speaking about the war , and not the magisterial we of the queen but the we that implies a country united in a dumbass war spin , spin , spin bush rails against our enemies , the violent fanatics , but what is he ? his invasion of iraq has resulted in more violence than if we had not invaded here i say we because congress and the american people initially supported the war , though we now know , recently confirmed by the former head of the cia , that intelligence was manipulated for political purposes although it is painfully obvious that the iraqis are worse off than under saddam , bush remains a true believer i do n't think he 's mad i do n't think he 's evil i do n't think he 's merely misguided i think he actually believes in what he 's doing this qualifies him as a fanatic , because one definition of a fanatic is someone who continues to believe and act upon his beliefs when all the facts point to the contrary how have suicide bombers in any way advanced the palestinian cause ? how has the invasion of iraq made the world safer ? bush still believes that democracy is the best defense against terrorism , and in this he is likely right the problem is , you ca n't impose democracy on a primitive , feudal , theocratic society such a society must first go through a dictatorship that can guarantee order while promoting modernization before democracy can even be considered this is what ataturk did for turkey and deng xiaoping did for china for bush and his advisers to be ignorant of this necessary transition seems unfathomable to me the recent death of david halberstam reminds us of the irony of his book , the best and the brightest , which exposed a cadre of extremely intelligent , accomplished men whose hubris a failure to grasp both history and the limits of american power steered us into the as yet still greater quagmire of viet nam something against which even de gaulle , no friend of america , warned kennedy not to stick his shoe in unlike tracy mcgrady , bush doesn t think he s lost the playoffs yet as president all he has to do is use his executive powers to extend the series since he is convinced his principles must be right , reality can t concern him right makes might is a silly approach to foreign policy unless the leader of the free world tries to make a sunday school lesson out of it then comedy becomes tragedy , more troops are scheduled to be sent to iraq does this mean the first troop surge failed ? no , the series has just been extended
