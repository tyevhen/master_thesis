hi friends ! chris brought home this shirt for paige knowing that i would particularly like it since it 's the kind of shirt i 'd wear since it 's winter i added a long sleeved onesie underneath when i first saw her in it i was reminded of my nana when she was alive , she was an avid bowler yep ! for many years she was competitive she was even , for a time , director of the massachusetts women 's bowling association i'm not much of a bowler but , i'm good at in on the wii ! i say that with a kidding tone it 's funny how the simplest of things can remind you of the big things save you might also like happy paige before and now little moments linkwithin
