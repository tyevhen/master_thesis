over the past few weeks , i ve shared my positive thinking series we ve looked at how not to feel alone , learning to believe in yourself , and taking things one step at a time last week we talked about how to have a good day , and you can read that post here today i want to talk about failure an odd topic to discuss on a motivational site , however , failing is part of life , and it s how we deal with this aspect that shapes how we cope with future events and situations many of us shy away from even saying the word failure if you are a parent then failing is a taboo subject , even sports day has changed to accommodate all the physical needs of a child to ensure no one fails i could argue that a bit of healthy competition is good for the soul , but i think that s a whole post on its own ! so what do i mean when i say failure ? when i got divorced , i felt like a failure my parents have been married forever , as were my grandparents and aunts and uncles i was the one who had tainted this pristine record it didn t matter at the time that i was leaving a violent relationship , in my head i d failed it took me many years to realise what i had learned from this experience yes , i have a failed marriage under my belt , but i gained so much more you could say , i learned how to fail well ! when i took away any judgement , i was able to look at my particular situation with total clarity without failure , i wouldn t have progressed from the dark days of my married life to the utterly incredible life i ve made for myself now i embrace my failings , and i use the lessons to evolve think about a situation where you felt like you failed maybe it was a project you took part in but didn t finish , or a weight loss regime you abandoned at the sight of a cream cake it s time to understand that we do stumble , we do fail , but this doesn t stop us from getting back on track with more knowledge and understanding the more we fail , the better we become at dealing with our emotions , and situations allow yourself a moment to sulk ! we are only human after all , and after something has gone wrong , it s only natural to feel sorry for yourself the trick is to keep all moping to a minimum and then pick yourself back up and try again in november , i am taking part in my third nanowrimo contest , this is a writing competition where i have to write a , word novel during the days of november over , people take part worldwide , but only around cross the finish line those writers who don t finish may feel upset or angry , they may be frustrated because they didn t manage to write every day and fell behind ? but , they will all sign up again the following year and give it another go when they return they will have learnt a valuable lesson , this may be to plot out the story they wish to write , or allocate an hour a day dedicated to their nano task they didn t fail they built knowledge that will help them in the future stop thinking about failure as the f word , and start to embrace the stumbles in your life sit back and think , what lesson do i need to learn from this ? don t beat yourself up over a setback successful people see this as an opportunity accept any failure with a smile and determination to come back bigger and better than before
