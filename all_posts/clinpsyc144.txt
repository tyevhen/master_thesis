a letter to the editor in the journal neuropsychopharmacology has slapped the arise rd study , which examined risperdal as a treatment for depression i have written about this study on several occasions the letter to the editor notes many of the same concerns that i have discussed on my site , including the study reported data that was previously published , a violation of journal policy and a claim regarding the drug 's efficacy was withdrawn because the statistics were done incorrectly in addition , the letter by bernard carroll notes that data regarding weight gain are not reported in full , a troubling omission given that risperidone was apparently related to more weight gain than placebo this borderline significant to statistically significant difference depending on what analysis is used was reported in a prior iteration of the study , but not in the final version as published in the journal please see several prior posts regarding this study , , , , it 's a doozy mark rapaport , the lead author of the study , in his reply to carroll 's letter , wrote the following the paper repeatedly states in abstract , methods and in discussion that continuation of risperidone augmentation therapy was not more beneficial than placebo , and hence the working hypothesis was disproven i would like to thank the reviewers and the editors of neuropsychopharmacology for having the courage to allow us to publish this negative finding a couple things first , does it really take all that much courage to publish a negative finding ? should a nobel prize or a bronze star be awarded ? there should be little honor attached to paraphrase chris rock why should you get mega credit for doing things you 're supposed to do ? oooh , you published a negative finding what do you want , a cookie ? you 're supposed to publish a negative finding you low expectation' havin' independent scientist the fact that somebody thinks props should be doled out because a negative finding was published shows how sad sack the system has become to top it off , the study , as originally published , hardly painted its findings as negative , as can be seen in my aforementioned links to the study yes , there were a couple of small caveats about efficacy in the paper , but take a look at a snippet from the press release that accompanied the study in the first large scale study of its kind , researchers at cedars sinai found that people suffering from resistant major depressive disorder who don t respond to standard antidepressants can benefit when the drug therapy is augmented by a broad spectrum psychotropic agent , even when treated for a brief period of time does that sound like a negative finding to you ? if i am following this correctly , it went something like this the study supports the efficacy of risperdal for depression until a number of problems are found with the study , at which point the lead author indicates that they never said the findings were positive i'm a little confused i hope to never again write about this study , as i feel like the proverbial dead horse beating has begun oh , and happy new year i expect to be writing about similar stories throughout the year because while the names may change , the storyline remains the same
