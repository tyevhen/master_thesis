i had my right achilles tendon surgery yesterday i'm back in my boot , non weight bearing for the next few days , and then partial weight bearing with my crutches for rest of the week i'm hoping to return to work next week , still in my boot , but without the crutches i 'll be in the boot for weeks of course , i'm hoping for two rather than four the surgery itself was quite simple i was a little anxious , but after they numbed up my ankle i did n't feel a thing i'm feeling very fortunate , as i 've had no pain since the procedure i have nothing to complain about today , if i can get through the pending blizzard descending upon us , i have my orthodontist appointment to get my bottom braces and thursday the real pain will begin , as i will have oral surgery to remove my ankylosed right canine tooth it 's a jam packed week , but i'm hopeful it is the start of better health times to come
