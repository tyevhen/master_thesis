queen of hearts ? the blog title is a direct reference to the ice queen whom i 'll be referring to in this post so this is a story all about how my life got twist turned upside down , and i 'd like to take a minute to just sit right here and tell you all about how i became the well , not the prince of a town called belair damn not my original writing unfortunately ! that just seemed like the perfect way to ease into this blog post my life definitely got turned upside down , and most days i'm still hanging from the earth like a bat i 've written a fair bit about how it feels to be depressed , but i have n't written about when i first started experiencing symptoms of depression and what caused them people become depressed for a variety of reasons , be it an extension of grief , a consequence of unemployment or postpartum depression it took me a long time to realise that i was depressed i was slightly too young to comprehend what i was feeling and the reasons behind it by the age of sixteen i had turned into a self conscious wreck i had become isolated at the worst time , i was sad and tearful without reason and i sought comfort in the form of food food became my worst enemy , at that point i gained two stone in the space of a month or so , which left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable in my skin and also caused rapid growth in a certain ahem area perhaps i was paranoid and already on the brink of anxiety attacks , but i felt eyes on me all day long at school , i felt stares burning into me , criticising the weight gain and sudden bustiness i only felt some relief when i finally got home from school the reason behind these sudden changes and insecurities was because of bullying at the time i would n't have called it bullying , it was n't the bullying i had known to fear and report to teachers i was n't beaten , or cornered in classrooms and playgrounds it was manipulative psychological and emotional bullying whenever i have recapped those events i feel like i'm referencing a scene from mean girls or any typical teen girl bitchy drama a rumour was started so that the bully could keep someone at their side , close friends i 'd known for years through hard times had been turned against me , and it almost came to a choosing of sides standpoint despite telling the bully that the whole situation was ridiculous and that we should get on for the sake of our friends , this made no difference , they were happy with the way things were , those words stung me like a bitter winter 's night she spat out that retort in a way that made it clear that there was no room for me in that group anymore i made a choice , i walked away it was the year of gcses and no one needed that kind of crap going on i isolated myself for what i thought was for the sake of my friends' sanity i never thought that those events and the fallout would plague my life for so long on my stronger days i refuse to allow that person the satisfaction of affecting me some days i wish the worst on them other days i 'd hear how bullies usually have problems of their own and so i should almost feel sorry for them it 's a difficult inner turmoil my mental health issues are n't the sole product of those former school days , but they certainly tore a sizeable chunk from me , they took a toll on my physical health and appearance , it planted doubts in my mind of whether i'm a good or likeable person , i questioned if i was the one with the problem and it rattled me to the core causing extreme social anxiety i was fortunate enough to have other friends to help me through those days , not that they knew how much i needed them at the time i am still so grateful to them and they are responsible for many good memories during any otherwise dark time i 've been asked if i would have made a different choice back then now that i know how much damage my original choice made the reality is that i ca n't regret any of the choices i 've made , they have shaped the person i am today if i had remained where i was things may have become a lot worse for me , i might have failed my gcses and continued in a downward spiral fuelled by food i also would n't be able to empathise with others who have been on the receiving end of bullying or those who also have the same illnesses i ca n't say i'm grateful for those things and events for shaping the person before you but i can say that i have no regrets
