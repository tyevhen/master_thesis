it 's always dangerous to post a first draft of a poem , but in these months of writing in form , everything has been a first draft besides , i think two days of dweebler 's shenanigans are driving readers away he is an intellectual low brow and delights in mocking my work in any case , here 's a poem i wrote very quickly this morning the passing i used to pay attention to the flickering moth circling the yellow light and the dust swirling in a rain of particles at night , on the porch i used to watch fog creep up the valley , swept up in its graceful blanketing of the fir green hillsides and the river it entirely obscured it is not sehnsucht that i seek , not the pull of regret in the gut like having been in love and having your love fail it is more that i don t pay attention there is no poetry left in me , no magic words to roll around my tongue until they connect with my feet and we are one i don t play the guitar much , either my soft fingers recoil from the wires that sing i listen to the radio a bit elegaic , i think , but few of my friends continued to play the guitar into their fifties i have but as this poem demonstrates , i lack magic in my life yet part of that is surely due to the onset of benefits from my new antidepressant , cymbalta it has really quieted my brain i'm able to read again maybe someday i 'll be up for reading poetry again there is magic there , but it takes some work all for today , ce
