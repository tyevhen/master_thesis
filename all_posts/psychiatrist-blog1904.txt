posted by dinah , not roy do n't forget to listen to the my three shrinks podcast ! see link below do ssri 's cause people to become suicidal ? the question feels old i remember when these medications first came out and there were questions about whether the medications made people violent , seems that years later we still have the same questions it seems like this is something we should know it 's been a while now , two decades in fact it 's easy if everyone who takes a medication gets an unusual symptom , harder if only a few people who take a medication have an adverse reaction , and harder still if the symptom caused by the medication is the same as the symptom caused by the disease the medicine treats ! in , the fda mandated that all the newer anti depressants carry a black box warning stating that they may cause suicidal ideation in children and adolescents the research is convincing that a small percentage of children to percent who were not having ideas about suicide before they started medications , had them after they started , generally in the first weeks of treatment no child in any study died of suicide , though this is such a rare event that it gets difficult to look at prospectively sorry , no links here , i 've just heard a bunch of talks most recently meaning last week i heard mark riddle , the chairman of child psychiatry at johns hopkins hospital talk about treating adolescent suicide attempters he noted that in any given year , percent of adolescents have a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment think about this , it 's a general population number in a high school of kids , will have a suicide attempt requiring medical intervention , many more will have suicide gestures and not get help completed suicides ? to per , a rare event , but given that kiddy death is pretty rare , a significant cause of childhood mortality this coming week , the fda will hear testimony about whether the black box warning should also include adults see http www fda gov ohrms dockets ac briefing b index htm and press the link for the brief if you 'd like to read all pages in a pdf file what will a black box warning mean ? in my psychiatric practice , i do n't think it will mean anything many of my patients feel helped by these medications it may make some patients with depression less willing to try medicines , and more importantly , it may make some primary care docs afraid to prescribe them i have to wonder why some symptoms get the dreaded black box warning and other 's do n't and why the designation has become so heated another post for another day so last week , the archive of general psychiatry published this amazing study on a followup of over , patients in finland it included all patients admitted to finnish hospitals for suicide attempts over a year period excluding those with psychosis and followed their future behaviors noting whether or not they took medications and which medications they took i tried to follow the charts and the data , but it was too confusing and too overwhelming please , if anyone out there could follow these statistics , please help me i was left to just read the results and the conclusions and some of the thinking about it all this study , however , is terrific in that in includes everyone in the country who attempted suicide , and they tracked whether the patients filled their prescriptions , so they had a fairly good idea of whether the patients were actually taking them and the findings ? people taking ssri 's snri 's eg effexor had a markedly higher rate of serious suicide attempts now this could be because the people given or taking the medications were sicker there 's not necessarily a cause and effect here furthermore people taking ssri 's snri 's had a markedly lower rate of both completed suicide and death from cardiovascular disease hey , did n't roy talk about this on our podcast ? ? ? some of the numbers surprised me in their avg year follow up of , , there were deaths could it be that nearly of their suicidal patients died ? were suicides the average age of their population was just under the protective factor for cardiovascular mortality was huge reduction in deaths other interesting facts paroxetine paxil was associated with a high mortality among the age group with deaths suicide , drowning , unintentional injuries venlafaxine was the only medicine associated with increased risk of suicide and fluoxetine prozac was the only one associated with decreased risk of suicide and i did n't see bupropion wellbutrin mentioned anywhere at all in the article the strongest predictor of completed suicide was number of past attempts
