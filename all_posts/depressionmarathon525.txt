it 's hot ! we 've had back to back degree days , in minnesota ! , and the weatherman is predicting a third day in a row tomorrow that 's bad news for me i'm scheduled to run miles tomorrow i 've gotten up before sunrise the past days to bike and run regardless , i still had to cut my run a bit short yesterday morning , as i eventually wilted in the sauna like conditions the air is dangerously thick and hot it 's really quite unbelievable to this northern girl so , tomorrow looks like another early morning i do n't know that i 'll actually run miles i'm toying with the idea of biking and running , as biking seems more tolerable in the heat i'm definitely leaving my options open we 'll see what the morning brings i saw my doctor yesterday unfortunately , i had to report that my thinking has been a bit off this week sometimes , when i'm not doing well , i have really horrible thoughts often they involve puck being maimed and or dying in some horrendous way sometimes , the thoughts are more about me they are almost always violent and scary and they 've been cropping up here and there lately of course , my doctor wanted to increase one of my meds , but that particular med gives me a hand tremor , so i politely refused she accepted that i want to wait and see if the thoughts will subside on their own , as they occasionally do i agreed to increase the med if they do n't i'm going to give it another week hopefully , this is just a minor uptick in one of my symptoms it 's annoying , but i do n't want to make too much or too little of it hopefully , it is not a sign of an impending dip in my mood i'm going to have faith that it is n't i 'll keep on keeping on hopefully , sticking to my healthy routine will be enough to stop the thoughts in their tracks maybe i 'll sweat them out ! i 've got the perfect weather in which to accomplish that !
