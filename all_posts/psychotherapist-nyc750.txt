as a nyc psychotherapist , i often work with artistic clients who are trying to overcome creative blocks writers , actors , composers , and artists often struggle with blocks in their creative endeavors the tendency is usually to struggle and try to push yourself through this phase sometimes this works for some people but , often , it backfires because the more you push yourself , the more frustrated you become and the more frustrated you become with your creative block , the more likely you 'll become self critical the more self critical you are , the less likely you 'll be able to overcome your creative block overcome creative blocks we often associate creativity with artists and writers , but we 're all creative beings no matter what we do we use our creativity everyday to problem solve or come up with ideas in our personal lives and at work the odyssey the odyssey i just finished rereading the odyssey homer when i read it the first time as a teen , i did n't appreciate it nearly as well as i did this time around aside from the fact that my current reading of it was from a much better translation fagle , as an adult who has had much more life experience than the teen i was when i read it the first time , i appreciate so much more odysseus' spirit to survive , his wily nature , and the wonderfully creative solutions he comes up with whenever he encounters life and death situations his creative nature saved his life as well as the lives of his loved ones when we 're blocked , for whatever reason , it 's hard for us to think out of the box we 're too stuck to explore and discover new ways to look at a situation or a problem , and we might not know what 's keeping us stuck maybe it 's an unwillingness to look at a situation from a different perspective maybe we 're in a rut and ca n't see beyond the immediate circumstances often , we do n't know why we 're creatively block clinical hypnosis , also known as hypnotherapy , can be very helpful in overcoming creative blocks hypnosis helps us to access our creativity on an unconscious level and the best part is that we do n't even need to know the reason why our creativity is blocked for hypnosis to work if you 're experiencing a creative block that you 've been unable to overcome on your own , you could benefit from seeing a licensed mental health professional who is trained in clinical hypnosis to find out more about hypnosis , you can go to the professional hypnosis website for the american society of clinical hypnosis www asch net i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr therapist , and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at photo credit alicepopkorn via photopin cc photo credit lady erin via photopin cc
