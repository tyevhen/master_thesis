as it says in the title , i 've left therapy for those of you who are regular readers , you 'll know that i 've had three different types of therapy including cbt , hypnotherapy and general counselling both private and on the nhs i spent many months battling to get therapy , but it has been the best thing that i have done especially cbt it has helped a lot and i advise anyone considering it , to at least put your name down as we all need a helping hand once in a while i must admit it is a very strange position to be in after almost two years of speaking and challenges , it has been decided that i am well enough to leave i suppose i'm both happy and sad happy because of the improvements i thought i would never make , but i suppose i'm nervous that i do n't have the support anymore i have learnt a lot and i have improved a lot and for that i am grateful of course , i still have bad days and days in which i need help , but that 's normal in recovery all of people that have helped me through my therapy , have been amazing and i am very grateful for that remember , if at first you do n't get on with your chosen therapist , there are many others out there that you may feel comfortable talking to i know that it 's hard , but unfortunately the main way to improve is through talking i know many people have reservations about talking to a stranger and believe me in the height of my anxiety , i was petrified but , as time moved on the easier it became i knew i had to talk to someone , whether i wanted to or not i wish you all the best on your recoveries and remember , talking to someone is one of the best things you can do especially a professional ! please , please do n't feel ashamed either there is nothing to be ashamed about , you are just trying to get better just a quick note before i end this post unfortunately there 'll be no post on sunday as i will be preparing for my german exam wish me luck , eh ! best wishes , amy xx
