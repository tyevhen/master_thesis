there are so many misconceptions regarding spinal bulbar muscular atrophy , aka kennedy 's disease at least a couple of times a month i receive emails asking about who can be passed the gene or if my father has the disease , or can i be a carrier , or if i am a carrier , does this mean my children will also have the defective gene because of all the different , but similar questions asked , i feel the need for genetic counseling is almost as important as seeing a neurologist recently i was asked what would be the odds of having both a husband and wife with the defective gene when i responded that it is possible , but highly unlikely , the person asked another question about how the rule of passing along a defective gene is determined i pulled the following from the kennedy 's disease association web site to use as a starting point are you wondering if your children are or will be affected by this disease ? since the defective gene is in the x chromosome , if the mother is the only carrier of the defective gene there is a chance of passing the affected gene on to male children in which they would develop symptoms in adulthood the chance of passing the defective gene on to female children is also in which case they would be carriers of the gene , but usually do not ever develop any severe symptoms if the father is the only carrier of the defective gene , your chances of passing the defective gene to a male child are however , it is certain that you would pass this gene on to your female child , and she will be a carrier the rule is not a perfect one out of every two rule since there is no internal monitor within the genes that keeps track of whether a defective or normal x chromosome was used when an egg was fertilized , researchers and counselors use averages in determining percentages out of a hundred cases reported , for example , you could have one case where every child is passed the defective gene in another case , perhaps only one child is passed the gene as you average out the number over cases , however , it nears another example using coins might explain it better a coin comes up either heads or tails when flipped chance if you have people flipping a coin not every person flipping the coin will have a heads one time and a tails the next some might have three heads come up in a row before a tail conversely , another might have four or five tails come up before a heads however , when you average out all of the heads and tails that come up for the people , it should be close to for each using my family , for example , where my mother was a carrier three out of seven boys have the defect out of three girls , none has the defective gene for our family , three defective x chromosomes and seven normal x chromosomes were passed to the ten children and , as many times as i heard that all the males in someone 's family have the defective chromosome , i also heard as many stories that only one male has it in poker terms , it could be called the luck of the draw was it adam or eve ? reference another question that i am often asked i do not think anyone knows what actually caused the first defect in the gene and when or where it happened it is very difficult to trace the lineage of the disorder since for many years kennedy 's disease had been misdiagnosed it was not until the s that dr william r kennedy first named the disease and , all the way to the s it was still commonly misdiagnosed most often as als once a simple dna blood test was discovered , early detection and correct diagnosis has improved substantially many qualified genetic counselors are familiar with kennedy 's disease if you feel there is kennedy 's disease in your family , i would recommend talking with a counselor they can help answer your questions regarding how the defective gene is passed through a family they are also there to discuss the benefits and possible ramifications of having children tested the national institute of health nih , for example , has genetic counselors on their staff that are fully versed in kennedy 's disease use these services to help you better understand kennedy 's disease and the impact it might have on your family
