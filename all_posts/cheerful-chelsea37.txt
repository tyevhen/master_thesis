monty python reference , anyone ? this week i am faced with a 'very british problem' some of us are lucky enough to escape symptoms of britishness which include wanting to avoid a fuss despite being inconvenienced , having someone 'accidentally' join what they thought was the end of the line and inwardly feeling frustrated by this but not expressing said frustrations , and embarking upon a lift sharing scheme which only leaves you wondering why you 're still paying just as much for petrol as most of you will know i have had my fair share of doctors throughout my mental health care unfortunately i 've had a few that have either left me feeling baffled by their 'advice' or have caused full on breakdowns due to their incompetence or inability to treat me with sensitivity since moving to surrey i have been seeing one doctor , i have referred to them in previous posts as doctor patient relationships go , this one has been about as turbulent as my mood swings they have been incredibly patient with my slow progress and understanding about my need to avoid counselling and cbt for now due to very bad experiences in the past when speaking of my living situation and approach to treating depression they call it a very unique approach , one which could easily be disturbed and all come toppling down on me at any moment of course what a depressed person needs to hear is their worst fears confirmed seriously not true , that i could be left without a fiance and his mother whom i 've confided in and become friends with , and the progress i 've made would cease patients of any kind should n't have to fear going to see their gp , the process is worrying enough if you are going to talk about serious conditions and queries unfortunately we ca n't always pick and choose who we get to see i am fortunate to be registered with a surgery that always have appointments available to see someone quite quickly however , the last thing i need is to be getting anxious over is seeing someone about my social anxiety and depression ! i'm faced with the problem of getting so anxious about seeing this doctor because in the past their behaviour towards me has left me crying for hours and spending days in bed recovering from an appointment with them it would be very easy for me to write a letter to the surgery to state my reasons for needing to be allocated a different doctor they have caused a lot of upset and have behaved inappropriately towards me this includes a recent appointment in which we spoke of us moving house and the doctor saying i am a piece of old furniture they are taking along with them , but who knows whether it will suit the new house or be kicked to the curb delightful , uplifting chat my 'very british problem' , is that this doctor happens to be head of the surgery , and so will see any letter i write if i wish to change doctors despite all of the inappropriate and upsetting comments , i believe that i have made a certain amount of progress this year and that it is still very hard for me to go over the details of my illness and past experiences with anyone new , whether that be a doctor , counsellor or psychiatrist although i know that there are some great doctors out there i'm not sure that i want to find a new one only to realise that once again they are n't the one for me i think that it would benefit me , and potentially others more if i write a letter directly to this docroe to state what i believe they have done wrong so far , that i feel discomfort whenever i have to go see them and that my anxiety over going to the doctors often escalates to a point whereby i have to cancel appointments and go without treatment for months if i address the problems directly perhaps they will adjust their approach , perhaps they have been treating all of their mental health patients in this way and my letter could improve care for others too it would be very easy and oh so very british of me to simply give them one more chance because they may have been having a bad day when they saw me last and every time they have seen me for the past year i say that something needs to change perhaps next time i have an appointment i will have something to be truly anxious about , facing them after they have received my letter !
