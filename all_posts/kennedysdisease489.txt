good news on the research front mda s quest magazine just published an update on igf maria pennuto , a previous recipient of a kda research grant and mda funding , provided the following update to reporter amy madsen i have written about igf in several previous posts because of its potential we hope to hear more promising news at the upcoming kda conference and educational symposium the second week of october in new orleans summary mice with a disease resembling spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma that were treated with an insulin like growth factor based compound had better motor function , slower weight loss , improved muscle health and increased survival time recent studies have shown that igf works in sbma by reducing toxicity caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor ar gene it also helps promote muscle and nerve growth the new findings suggest that igf potentially may be effective in ameliorating the disease mice with a disease resembling spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , or kennedy s disease that were treated with a compound based on insulin like growth factor igf had better motor function , slower weight loss , healthier muscles and longer survival time than mice that received an inactive substance , an mda supported research team has reported the research team also found that sbma mice that overproduce a muscle specific form of igf have a milder disease course than mice that produce less of the protein the new findings suggest that igf potentially may be effective in ameliorating the disease via at least two mechanisms directly reducing toxicity caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor ar gene by changing the way the androgen receptor protein behaves and generally promoting and regulating skeletal muscle growth , and improving survival of muscle controlling nerve cells called motor neurons the research team reported its findings online aug , , in molecular medicine to read the full report , see igf administration ameliorates disease manifestations in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy mda supported maria pennuto at the italian institute of technology in genoa , italy findings show igf compounds hold therapeutic potential the researchers treated sbma mice with a compound called mecasermin rinfabate brand name iplex , which is a combination of igf and igf binding protein the binding protein helps igf last longer in the body male mice were randomly assigned to receive abdominal injections of the igf based compound at a daily dose of milligrams per kilogram of body weight , or an inactive substance to mimic the typical clinical setting in which a diagnosis of sbma occurs after symptoms appear the researchers began injections when the mice were weeks old , after disease onset , and continued through weeks the researchers evaluated body weight , motor function and survival in the mice they found that , when compared to the placebo treated mice , those treated with igf had less body weight loss significantly improved grip strength and longer survival time by an average of approximately three weeks in addition , the researchers found that the igf treated mice had markedly reduced muscle shrinkage atrophy and degeneration the study results provide a basis for further study of igf based compounds as potential therapies for people with sbma
