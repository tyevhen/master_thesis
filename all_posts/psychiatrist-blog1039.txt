it 's my first night of vacation ! i saw my last patient today and then started pulling the pictures off the walls in anticipation of my move i ran over to see the new place , and it still needs insulation it 's on the floor , paint , and carpet and doorknobs might be nice so we 're expecting quite the snowstorm here i 'll let you know how it goes tomorrow , but the current forecast is for up to inches it did n't take me long to float from the weather to the health section of the new york times , and here 's an article by leslie alderman about generics versus name brands are generics as good as name brands ? i do n't have any studies , i'm purely running on anecdotes , but this is my thinking usually when i was resident , i learned that of the time and this is n't science , i do n't think , i believe it 's someone else 's anecdote generic nortryptiline does n't work when name brand pamelor does so i 've always asked patients to start with pamelor i do n't use it much anymore because who wants to spend weeks on a medication trial and have someone not respond only to realize they were in that small group of patients who are sensitive to the brand other meds i 've had a handful of people complain about generic prozac fluoxetine it 's not as effective for them , or they have more side effects alderman 's article talks about wellbutrin xl and i did n't even realize that the xl form now has a generic sometimes people want the name brand so what do i do when a patient specifically requests the name brand ? i give it to them if they are right , then they are right and if they simply believe that they wo n't respond to the generic , because there are people who say generics do n't work on me , well , then there 's power to such beliefs , and i just want my patients to get better what do you think ?
