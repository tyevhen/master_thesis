time goes by in the blink of an eye truth be told , i'm exhausted and worn but it 's all for a worthy cause we moved ! as the most spontaneous thing either of us has ever done , we put an offer on a really cool house after seeing it at an open house when we were n't even really in the market they accepted our offer contingent on our current home getting a paid offer within days drama unfolded as we prepared our house to sell staged it and had photos taken all within hours we put it on the market on the th of july and it sold within days zoom ! it was bittersweet to say goodbye to our first home together we bought it and got married and we brought our beautiful children home there from the hospital we had so many happy times and so many heartbreaks but we are moving in to a wonderful new space that feels like home it 's much bigger , has great personality , and has so many nooks that make me happy we are only minutes away from our old house but it feels like we are far out in the country we are surrounded by wonderful old farms , mature woods , and all manner of nature i have a renewed esteem for my new england homeland ! it 's a new chapter and i'm excited to share it here save
