the conference a hundred poets came into a room armed with their folders , pens , and microphones the mediator had a rosy bloom of optimism , fearing no millstones be hung about his neck like deep atlantic wrecks until he would make way for the well knowns chief among them was sir randall wright whose poetry was known to be obtuse it s not obtuse , he said , it s quite forthright i need a smarter audience for my muse not realizing he was dumber than a tree to claim ignorant readers as excuse behind him , breathing hard , in a beret mcdonald pleaded his preeminence i speak the lingo of the world today wright belongs to the past , i ve evidence despite his leaden ear and prose cut like veneer with bad line breaks , pretending relevance the unfledged followed , rushed the podium with papers flying , wrangling for a word with the poor mediator , whose odium replaced his prior sanguinity with a turd he closed the frenzied show but first let egos know , your fabled art is grotesque and absurd now all the poets united against the man who fled out back to catch his limousine they rocked the car , screamed epithets , and ran to the arts council , calling him obscene he had to laugh out loud at the rabid , blithering crowd that populated the faux poetry scene i thought that since my mood had improved somewhat , i would not attempt anything serious this morning there are , as satirized in today 's poem , still two major divisions of poets in english since the s beatniks and academics i know of all the other schools , but it really boils down to kenneth koch vs richard wilbur , maya angelou vs rita dove , performance poetry vs written poetry i suppose my verse leans more towards the academic , as i am poles apart from that great poet of the common people , charles bukowski here 's a link to my essay on him charles bukowski and the nadir of american poetry i'm sorry to puke on the buke but live , paper bag in hand concealing a cheap bottle of wine , he was quite the entertainer his childhood is painful to read about , as is most of his adulthood but pity ought not to influence artistic judgment i'm still wondering about goals until i reach the goal of not being depressed , it 's hard to think of other goals when i come out of a depression it 's a simplifying experience life is good as long as i'm not depressed i can endure anything , assay anything , survive anything just pray that that anything does not include depression what matters most is not being depressed let 's hope i continue to improve all for today the unknown poet
