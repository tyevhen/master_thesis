hey , i'm back ! looks like when i do n't blog new stuff , the archives get more reads , though , which is good they ought to be useful for something , anyway lots of action on the evolutionary psychiatry front behind the scenes , some of it still super secret and all very exciting ahs is coming up and with it reunions with a bunch of my best evo med loving buddies , along with some new folks from far and wide i 've also been invited to talk to some more of my colleagues about the notion of evolutionary psychiatry and what it means i 'll let you know when i have that figured out heard this song again never could get enough of it song beneath the song by maria taylor just when i thought i was bored to death with observational studies , a new one free full text ! came along , tweeted first by the lovely denise minger , and also sent along to me by none other than the primal blueprint himself , mark sisson vegetarian diet and mental disorders results from a representative community survey it 's a german study , and for a large population based retrospective observational design , it 's actually fairly thorough and sensible and if you are a vegetarian , it certainly does n't say that vegetarianism causes mental health problems but in every single study except for two done in the past , vegetarianism has been linked with higher rates of depression , anxiety , and particularly eating disorders bingeing , restricting , and purging behaviors but to be perfectly honest , all those studies were pretty crappy small , using special populations , and often based on just a few answers to general survey questions i 've reviewed a few of them my favorite has to be the one where they calculated arachidonic acid ingested to the hundredth of a gram based on data from a food frequency questionnaire hahah ! i do n't think it is a coincidence that the two positive studies were done by the same group of researchers the interesting thing about the general trend that vegetarians are n't quite as mentally healthy as omnivores in observational studies is that vegetarians tend to do better in other measures of health they are better educated , as a population they are generally younger , less likely to smoke or drink , more likely to exercise , and they tend to care about ethics and the quality of their food however , vegetarians are also more likely to be female which is more likely to be associated with anxiety , depression , and eating disorders by a long shot so this new study has some things to recommend it for one thing , the mental health diagnoses were determined not by answers to typical questionnaires , but by a full clinical interview using psychologists or physicians , lasting an average of minutes each pretty impressive , considering there were over , participants in the population based study in addition , the researchers matched omnivores to vegetarians based on age , education , sex , and whether they were urban or rural and crunched those numbers as well , so we got a good sample that took out some of the major confounders that dogged the previous studies finally , this cohort was a purposeful random sampling of the german adult population excluding people over , however , rather than the seventh day adventists or adolescents and college students sampled in previous studies and when the researchers went down the line of depressive disorders , anxiety disorders , somatoform disorders things like body dysmorphic disorder , health anxiety and hypochondriasis , and eating disorders , the mostly vegetarian were more likely to be afflicted , and the strict vegetarian even more likely the full blown eating disorder diagnoses were rare enough , however , that the researchers did n't compute the odds ratios , as they felt the dataset was not robust enough to be fair compared to the general population , the vegetarians were more likely to have mental disorders , and compared to the sex and education and population and age matched controls , the risk of mental disorders in vegetarians really shot up , with odds ratios hovering around , some as high as ors around is when you ought to start taking notice when the data was taken apart from another direction , it was found that participants in the study with depressive , anxiety , somatoform , and anxiety disorders consumed less meat than people without a mental disorder the amount of vegetables , fruits , fish , and fast food did not have a consistent pattern separating those with and without mental disorders except fish consumption was linked with reduced anxiety hmmm in fact , unlike the australian study , those with mental disorders in this german population were less likely to consume fast food than the mentally healthy population temporally , the adoption of a vegetarian diet , on average , tended to follow the mental health diagnosis , suggesting that the vegetarian diet was not in fact causal a retrospective study is n't the most robust way to determine this issue , but i would tend to believe this timing to be true , particularly for anxiety disorders , which often begin before the age of the main exception to the temporal findings in this study were the eating disorders , which tended to start right around the same time as adoption of a vegetarian diet as i 've reported before , several of my eating disordered patients have told me they adopted vegetarianism so they would have an excuse to restrict food and not have to eat in public so what is going on ? in germany , are the neurotic perfectionists who are more likely to be choosey about food and thus select vegetarianism and eschew fast food also more vulnerable to depression and anxiety ? sure , could be or maybe those with mental troubles try to avoid what is thought to be bad food meat and fast food it is also possible that the nutrient deficiencies common in vegetarian diets the most robustly studied being long chain omega fatty acids and b , though i think zinc and creatine and even too low a cholesterol could also be issues could accelerate or worsen pre existing mental conditions a large study comparing choosey , neurotic , perfectionistic omnivores ahem with strict vegetarians would be interesting , i think the german word for meat excludes poultry
