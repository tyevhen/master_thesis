just to let you know i am still here i'm feeling a lot better now and back in remission i was depressed from the end of november until about april it was the first significant episode since i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder looking back i guess going togermany for the day and looking after my mother while working full time was probably a little eccentric i'm back on loads of medication and sleeping far too much i'm definitely a lot more settled tho' and i have stopped crying on my way home from work ! it 's not much of a choice to sleep to hours a night or be suicidal every other day ! i guess sleeping is the best option tho' but , i am just sleeping my life away and there is so much i want to do i'm still much better off than before diagnosis , one episode in years compared to in about years is not bad going life goes on and i feel a little stronger and a little more stable after each episode , i feel older and wiser and less disturbed by other peoples opinions of me depression is like an education which people who have not been there can never comprehend i am spending a lot of time reflecting on whether i want to remain single indefinitely or whether i want to find a nice understanding and caring man who i can smother with love o i do not seem to be short of offers but no one has tugged my heart strings in just the right way
