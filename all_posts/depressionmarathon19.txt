it was november , , when i first noticed i was feeling a little off before i knew it i was suffering with low energy , fatigue , irritability , and difficulty motivating things that mattered did n't matter as much anymore i was sad , and empty , and low there was no reason for my feelings my life , after all , was quite good i was in a long term relationship we were doing well , each with a full time , financially secure job we had just purchased a new home and had two cars and two motorcycles in the garage we enjoyed traveling , running , and socializing with friends and i was happily training my new puppy life was good why did n't i feel good ? well , as we all now know , november , , was the beginning of this odyssey with depression i recognized it quickly , as i had had depression as a teenager , but i remember feeling incredulous and confused i had been fine for so many years ! first i tried to rationalize it away life was so good there was no reason to feel bad when that did n't work i tried to wish it away please god , no , no , no ! and when that did n't work , i sought help it sounds so cliche , but these last years truly have been a journey i spent many of the early years angry and resentful after all , this illness cost me my spouse , my job , my financial security , my house , and my friends despite treatment , my life as i knew it no longer existed i further lost myself by drinking to excess and quickly became an alcoholic that did n't help almost years ago , i got sober that did help slowly i changed i created a new life i still had horrible depression , but maybe i began to accept it more and fight it less my attitude shifted i worked my recovery program and found a spiritual life i had n't known or trusted before i finally became a more active participant in my own healthcare i'm so fortunate to have been referred , early on , to the psychiatrist i still see today i do n't think i 'd have survived without her over the years i 've also been connected with many other skilled , compassionate , treatment professionals , including a wonderful social worker , who assisted me with everything for at least years , and the nurses of my local mental health inpatient unit , who are simply amazing i 've participated in multiple mental health treatment programs , volunteered as a speaker for my local nami organization , and done my best to be open and honest about living with depression it has n't been easy i do n't think living with any chronic condition is mine is not a journey i 'd wish on anyone else , and i would n't volunteer to do it all over again however , i truly believe i am a better person today due to my experience with depression and alcoholism i feel humble and grateful today those are two fulfilling emotions i never comprehended before i am a kinder , gentler , more compassionate person i feel good about that for whatever reason , i move through this world today with an ease i never had prior to life with depression perhaps my expectations are less life , and the people in it , owe me nothing i understand that today i am responsible to myself and those around me , i am responsible to be the best me i can be i work hard for what i have , physically , spiritually , and materially and i'm totally okay with that i pray everyday to be relieved of depression life certainly would be simpler without it but would it be better ? i do n't know i think it might be , but i'm not sure i would be hang in there , my friends
