from the new york times the fda has questions about a lilly document from february in which the company found that patients taking zyprexa in clinical trials were three and a half times as likely to develop high blood sugar as those who did not take the drug that document was not submitted to the agency but a few months later , lilly provided data to the fda that showed almost no difference in blood sugar between patients who took zyprexa and those who did not but worry not , lilly is claiming the above was just an honest mistake kind of a large mistake , eh ? after the data were analyzed accurately , then zyprexa did not appear nearly as risky of course , we can be sure lilly is being honest , just like when they said that they never marketed zyprexa as a treatment for dementia or the time they said that zyprexa does not cause diabetes or maybe when lilly decided to sell zyprexa as a safe , gentle psychotropic i think you get the point it is indeed possible that lilly is being truthful , but i personally doubt it on a side note , good to see that alex berenson is back to writing about zyprexa
