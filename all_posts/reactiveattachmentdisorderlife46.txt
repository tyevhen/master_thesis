as i go from place to place during my day i am amazed at the number of children in our society who have been damaged by the adults in their world i went and helped out at one of the schools today and was told by another adult about the grandchildren he is raising and how difficult their behaviors are i went for a massage and was told about the nephew who is struggling with his behaviors so much in kindergarten i saw the very young pregnant teen sitting in the chair before me our society is not cherishing its children i wish we did n't need attachment therapists i'm excited at the idea of becoming one and working with moms and kids like myself and my kids , but know also that the need only comes because of trauma so what can we do pray encourage young mom 's and get involved i am hoping when i am done to find a way to be involved with young moms in education about attaching with their babies it is difficult because we cannot change the world and yet i am reminded of the child on the beach with all the starfish washed to shore he stands and throws them back one by one an adult comes up and says there are so many what difference can that make ? the child replies it makes a difference to that one
