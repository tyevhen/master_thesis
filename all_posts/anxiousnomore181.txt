photo by benrybobenry i had a very unusual dream last night i dreamt that i was getting ready to go to college and i was organizing my new dorm like living space i was ok with the idea of everything and i felt confident in my ability to handle the situation of going to school and taking college courses here s why that is so interesting i don t really tell people this , but i am scared to death of going to college , and therefore have never set foot in a college classroom why ? i have no idea i know this is an excuse , but deep down inside i grew up with the attitude that i would never go to college because it was too expensive and i would have to pay for it myself now i think it seems too overwhelming for some reason so it was interesting to me to feel so okay about taking this on like it was no big deal when i woke up it made me start to wonder about if it really would be something i could do if i treated just like that , no big deal i want to get my husband through college first , but i do know i want a degree in case i have to support my family someday don t get me wrong i think i have done extremely well for myself for not going to college the career that i am in has really been good to me and i have accomplished so much more than i ever thought i would i wonder if the dream was spurred by what i saw in one of the schools i went to in california it was a school of mostly hispanic children above the door in one of the classrooms was a poster that said i will go to college ! the teacher had every child reach up and hit the sign and say the words out loud before they could leave for the day i thought that was really cool like i said i grew up thinking , if i wanna go to college i better start saving my pennies now ! i wonder how my attitude would have been if i had some encouragement like that in my life growing up but i know it is ultimately my responsibility to do it so i hope you don t misread what i am saying as a way to blame someone else for my issues merely just thinking out loud whatever the case may be , it was really cool to dream about something so positive instead of running around afraid all night long it makes me think that maybe its something i should n't be so afraid of , that i really can handle it , and that is a turn for the better if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like rejecting rejection the power of nightmares feelings of rejection lingering safety first ? linkwithin
