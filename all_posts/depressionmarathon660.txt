sorry for the delay in writing i was busy relaxing with my parents i just arrived home after my week away my parents and i did a lot of fishing , without much success , but it was still nice to be out on the lakes with the loons , ducks , and eagles all of which had babies in fact , last night we thought we were going to see a baby eagle test its wings for the first time the little one kept scooting to the edge of the nest while spreading his wings out wide , but he never took off the eagle parents sat together on a branch above the nest watching intently it was very cool i was glad to be out there to observe it now for some exciting news i had a date ! i met a man on the bike trail yesterday i was in the trail parking lot getting my bike ready to ride when i was approached the guy was interested in my bike and asked me some questions about it well , we got to talking , and talking , and talking and pretty soon he asked me out ! d owns a lake home in that area hours from here but lives in milwaukee hours from here i went over to his lake home this morning , and we went kayaking after a couple of beautiful hours on the lake , we sat and chatted over coffee it seemed like we could have talked forever no awkward pauses or anything and he was a really nice guy ! we talked again about an hour ago while we drove to our respective homes he and i have lots in common he 's a runner , biker , triathlete , golfer , and outdoors enthusiast we had a lot to talk about it was nice distance is always an issue in a relationship , but right now i'm hopeful we can get to know each other better in the very near future i 'll let you know how that goes now it 's time to settle back into my own nest i'm only going to be home for two days before i leave for grandma 's marathon on thursday , and i 've got a lot to do !
