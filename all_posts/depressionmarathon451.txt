i was sitting in my meeting this morning when somebody said something which sent my thoughts to my mood i thought about how busy i was at work this week , with out of longer than scheduled days filled with patients and i feel fine i thought about my work schedule i'm now working an extra day per week , which i was very concerned about when i began doing that in november , and i'm handling it well i thought about puck 's death , and the acquisition of jet , both of which significantly changed my home life and routine and i'm surviving i thought about missing weeks of running , losing a year 's worth of fitness and having to start all over , yet i'm not falling apart i thought about decreasing my contacts with my treatment team , a change i instituted a couple of months ago , and my mood remains stable and good as i sat there distracted by these thoughts , i marveled at the current state of affairs i feel fine i'm handling work well i'm surviving big changes i'm not falling apart my mood remains stable and good could all of this be true ? really ? my mind wandered backwards to where i 've been versus where i am today i remembered drinking and drinking and drinking , and the suicide attempts , and the loss of friends , and the isolation , and the debilitating darkness within i thought about getting sober and how scary that process had been i recalled the terror of returning to work after an almost seven year absence not only did i lack confidence in my stale skills , i was unsure if the timing was right i was very anxious about coming off disability i thought about financial insecurity and the food shelf i contemplated hospitals , and meds , and ect and finally i saw myself sitting in that chair today somehow i climbed out of all that of course , i do n't know that i'm done i expect i'm not i know the illness still lurks but i allowed myself to think , just for a moment , about never sinking so low again would n't that be wonderful and strange ? but i quickly arrested that train of thought i ca n't set myself up for disappointment magnifying future pain , if or when that pain descends upon me again i brought myself back to the present , the gift of today , and i felt gratitude wash through me the reality of my recent history is i have more good days than bad my meds seem to work hospitalizations are extreme circumstances rather than routine events i 've learned to live with focus on today , and today only , in order to keep relapse away i'm managing i'm functional i'm contributing and i'm happy who would 've thought ?
