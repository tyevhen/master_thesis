when i was and i wanted to kill a guy the guy was the boss of my friend s boyfriend if i had killed the guy i would have been found not guilty reason of temporary insanity the boyfriend of my friend was narrowly able to stop me too bad i did not kill him my friend and the boyfriend both lived with me there were of us plus two kids living in the same house co op style we all worked as security guards and since guards don t make a lot of money and work all shifts we figure that living together would improve our quality of life considerably especially me as i had to support two kids at that point it was and i had recently given birth to my son my son was less than months old at the time i do not remember his age exactly there was definitely still snow outside my son ate every hours , which means he did not sleep more than consecutive hour at a time that means i did not sleep more than hour at a time during the night i had tried and tried to get him to eat every four hours but did not succeed he had a healthy appetite and was hungry ! i also had to take care of my beautiful year old daughter so she did not sleep at all during the day i also had other things to do around the house , errands and so forth so i got very little sleep , if not at all for days on end my mental state was therefore more fragile than usual as mentioned earlier , i had housemates one evening a housemate was sick the boyfriend he called his work to say he could not go in the next morning as i recall , in order to book off work , we normally needed to provide a certain notice to give the supervisor time to find a replacement you also all know that sometimes , illness strikes fairly quickly injuries strike faster , it is not always possible to call so many hours ahead of time also , sick time was unpaid in his case he had not called within the recommended amount of time hours i think i believe he got food poisoning it was something fairly fast anyway when his supervisor arrived at work that morning around am and got the message , he decided to call the housemate to give him shit he called not at am to tell him he needed to come in for a meeting if a supervisor wants to give an employee a dressing down , they need to bring them in during paid time to do it , not whenever they feel like it this guy , this supervisor , he disregards any of that and calls his employee at in the morning to give him shit about booking off since i had the phone beside my bed and my friend and her boyfriend both slept like a log , good thing considering the baby it is i who got the call i had just fallen asleep after being awake for nearly hours straight and being overly exhausted due to general lack of sleep he asked to speak to my housemate , i told him no that he was sick and asleep and he could call back after i have to admit i may not have been excruciatingly polite , but i was also not very awake the supervisor then ordered me to put my housemate on the phone which i refused i should mention a few things here the four of us worked for the same company , two of which had this particular supervisor i did not work for that supervisor nor did a th party the girlfriend did work for this supervisor but she was on extended sick leave as she was pregnant and having a rough time of it i was on maternity leave the fourth worked night shift and was at work also , both the girlfriend and i were shop steward oops ! when i may refused , i may have mentioned that he was breaking the law for calling at an ungodly hour for non emergency reasons the supervisor then started blasting me ! oh that did it to make matters worse , the call had woken up my son i lost it in a big way i was overwhelmed by an urgent desire to kill him ! dressed in my pajamas , i grabbed the car keys , told the housemates that had woken up my screaming perhaps ? to watch the kids i had something i needed to do of course they wanted to know where i was going , and when i told them , the girlfriend wanted to come and help me , while the boyfriend did everything he could to stop me all i wanted to do was kill the asshole ! eventually he was able to calm me down at a reasonable hour , once our manager was in the office , i called to speak to the manager the supervisor s boss to complain about the call in the middle of the night at first the manager was taking the supervisor s side saying as there were several guards at our address it was acceptable to call at any time day or night then when explained that two of us were not working and that the call was a disciplinary call , which our collective agreement said had to be done during office hours on business premises , that this particular call should not have been done the way it was at the very least the supervisor could have called during regular hours to politely call and ask for a medical certificate or something of the kind which the housemate had and not assume that everyone in the house should naturally be awake eventually the supervisor was disciplined for the incident , but the measure did not sate me i should at the very least have beaten the shit out of him all things considered i would have been let off easy
