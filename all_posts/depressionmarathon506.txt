there is a ray of light peeking into my soul with the help of my psychiatrist , i made it through the long labor day weekend with the support of my social worker , i returned to work on wednesday , and although i did n't think i 'd be able to handle it , i did i spent last evening with friends and noticed a bit of my humor coming back today i struggled but completed my mile tempo run , actually made it to the grocery store and purchased my groceries , and again spent the evening with friends my mood has lightened my anger at this damn illness has softened and tonight i'm feeling just a little bit better i'm putting one foot in front of the other , and for the first time in a couple of weeks , i actually feel like i'm getting somewhere i'm so grateful for that
