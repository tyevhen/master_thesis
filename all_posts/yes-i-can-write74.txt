as mentioned in my year in review post , i 've been working on a personal website , a site where i can gather together all my projects , blogs , and main interests , making it easier for people to find my stuff as well as making my online presence feel more organized and cohesive after some difficulties with the more technical aspects i am not exactly good at computer related technical anything , i finally got everything sorted out , and my site went live last week ! check it out idziedesmarais com there are some features missing if you do n't pay a monthly fee to upgrade , but weebly still impressed me with the available free features , ease of use , and slick look i actually enjoyed putting the site together for the most part , instead of struggling as would usually be the case this new site also gave me the opportunity to start a personal blog , as a place for all the writing i do that does n't seem to fit on any of my other blogs , either because of its more personal nature , the subject matter , or that it 's just too half thought out i especially felt a need for such a blog since i'm pushing myself in this new year to write a lot more , and so far i'm written more in a month than i did in six months last year ! the new blog is sunflowers brambles , and some things i have been or will be writing about there is anxiety , life learning , feminism , and radical domesticity i'm excited about finally having my own site , and if you decide to take a look at it , feedback is much appreciated ! you might also like insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging new bio , updated about me page the value in writing for an audience , not a grade this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and linkwithin
