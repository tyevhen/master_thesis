it seems selfish to write about myself on christmas eve , but as we all know , the self is inescapable for instance , ask yourself when another opens your gift , do you hope it brings them joy , or are you more focused on whether they will like it or not , whether you made a good selection ? naturally these things are not mutually exclusive and what about the guilt you may feel when someone spends more on you than you did on them ? as a cook you may wonder if the gravy is too thin as a woman you may compare festive outfits and decide yours was too bland all this is normal , and expected , and part of our psychology some may blame our preoccupation with the self on some theoretical fall i think we have too much time for our heads for most of history men have worked like dogs with increased leisure comes increased introspection , and many may not like what they find then others , the positive and irrepressible , use their leisure time for active pleasures fishing boats and golf clubs and the like i'm often in a quandary when asked about a christmas list most of my wishes are non material here 's my list complete remission from depression i recognize my list is selfish , i just hope it 's not too long i wish for all those i 've met here good health in the new year without health , everything else becomes hard to enjoy so often we take good health for granted in fact , we tend to take everything for granted too many blessings become entitlements in our minds we only notice what changes , though many of us want everything to stay the same we fear change , because each gain becomes a new potential loss the answer is to try to stay in the moment and keep going and do what good you can i have organizing and cleaning to do today i'm prevented from serious writing because i do n't have my computer the keyboard on kathleen 's , which she has let me borrow , just wo n't conform to my fingers properly besides , i'm at a bit of an impasse i want to work on promoting my work instead of creating more yet all these books of advice on publishing contain one contradiction you must believe in your book , put your whole heart into it you must direct your book towards a specific target market does n't two have to influence one ? but if one is your dream , two may become your nightmare and after publication is finally achieved , promotion must go on until you 're thoroughly sick of your work as one writer put it i feel like an employee of my former self my mind is rather blank today i chose a poem from my archives for what reason i do n't know , below , previously published in ygdrasil and tintern abbey let 's hope our selves can get out of ourselves this season to my manic self i see you in the sky , a runaway balloon bent on another try to penetrate the moon your flight inflates my mind like i was born to rule , so i rise above mankind mortal and immortal fool to trail your cheshire grin into the stratosphere where i am born again as jesus or king lear the problem is collapse you always do deflate and leave me holding maps to places i was great so am i the puppeteer ? i thought it was always you ! you with your confident leer , jeweled cane and retinue , you , ready to hog the stage and bask in cheap applause to camouflage your rage against the cosmic laws but when the show is over it s me that they arrest while you go undercover inside my empty chest so which one holds the strings ? i don t know who i am but i wouldn t have crowned me king if they were in my hand kilorats and a merry christmas ! c e chaffin
