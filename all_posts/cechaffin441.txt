the things i love the things i love define me , more or less i love the simpsons and pistachios i love to watch my one true love undress her living sculpture summons my caress i love her curve of hip , her irish nose the things i love define me , more or less i love basketball , wine to excess i love the violet hour at day s close i love to watch my one true love undress i love my daughters , proud of their success i love my grandson in his dirty clothes the things i love define me , more or less and i love poetry , though i confess i find much of it nowadays otiose i love to watch my one true love undress under melancholy s fierce duress i grip these things more tightly than a noose the things i love define me , more or less i love to watch my one true love undress i don t know if today s poem qualifies as poetry , as it is deficient in tropes , but even if only verse , it is authentic and that s what good poetry must have not truth per se but authenticity the reader must feel convinced of the poet s experience , or narrative , in his very bones otherwise it s just another bad television show as you might deduce from today s subject , my mood is improving since my antipsychotic was doubled three nights ago antipsychotics help re set the brain , much like ect they put the brain at rest they help my focus when i m ill , so that i can attend to one thing without the overwhelming anxiety of everything else the depressive often feels responsible for everyone and everything , feeling guilty that he can t set it all right this is a christ like narcissism , as this presumes one should be good enough to take on everyone else s sin it s part of the illness then there is the irony that most depressives , while depressed , can do very little , nevertheless have crushing expectations of doing more than is humanly possible this is why acceptance of one s depression is paramount in enduring the illness , because depression is like a tar baby the more you fight against it , the deeper you re sucked in i have an appointment with a new psychiatrist today i hope he s more knowledgeable than my last at kilorats and rising shh ! , craig erick
