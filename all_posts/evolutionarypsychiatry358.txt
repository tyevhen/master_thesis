i 'll get back to zinc tomorrow but today i heard this piano solo on xm radio right click to open in a new tab if you want to listen and read , and it got me to thinking the song is traumerei , by schumann , one of the most famous piano solos ever written the pianist in the youtube video is horowitz , playing an encore to his last concert in moscow , thus the emotional reaction of the audience and pianist himself robert schumann had at least two suicide attempts during his life , and his last two years were spent in a mental asylum he also had hugely productive periods , including the year of song in , when he composed pieces these facts and his documented auditory hallucinations of angelic and demonic voices have led some to speculate that he suffered from bipolar disorder it seems equally likely that he had tertiary syphilis and mercury poisoning from the treatment for syphilis leading to the disintegration and psychosis those last several years he was only when he died , and his last compositions showed him to have some experimental , evolutionary ideas of music , though they were unappreciated at the time if we 'd discovered the mold derived penicillin a surefire treatment for syphilis years earlier , who knows what more he would have accomplished evolutionary medicine and lifestyle is not really about going back sometimes this is misunderstood i ca n't write about schumann without touching upon franz schubert he was an austrian composer , also from the romantic period , who also died young age of syphilis it 's important to know that when he wrote this piece right click , he knew that his own death was imminent we do n't see too much of death in our modern , western world we 're protected from the feedlots and chicken roosts and for some it is possible to fantasize about a world where we do n't even kill animals to stay alive our own typical deaths happen in a drugged haze , or attached to a thousand machines in the icu such a death is expensive and horrific in medical school and residency , no matter what the specialty , you see this first hand all the time and you grow acclimated and inured to your own future possibilities if not some accident , bad luck , or foolishness , you get to pick heart disease or cancer it is hard , unless you have a sudden infarction and arrhythmia , to die quickly or painlessly of course we hide our deaths from the masses now staffan lindeberg described the natural deaths of the kitavans after a long , healthy , hale life , somewhere between age or even beyond , the elderly will become fatigued for a few days , and pass quietly away to me that does n't sound too bad sure beats hospice or an icu there are some paleo folks who are looking beyond being flourishing omnivores toward optimal human health this is where some of the most heated arguments about low carb vs paleo carb vs low calorie living break out and there is a bit of theoretical evidence that low carb , low protein may be optimal for longevity i'm not going to wait for the year randomized controlled trial and i do like lots of vegetables , fruit , and even potatoes or rice from time to time variety , as they say , is the spice of life i 'll settle for being merely human , and i 'll take my penicillin and vaccines , should the need arise
