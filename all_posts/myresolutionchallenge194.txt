yes , i'm going for the big one first , the challenge of all challenges , the resolution that is top of of people 's list weight loss ! i am very fortunate to be ft inches in height and therefore can hide my muffin top and saggy bits under long tunics and baggy jumpers , many people tell me i do n't need to lose weight when the truth is i ca n't hide it any more my jeans do n't fit , i have had to invest in larger work trousers to accommodate my expanding waistline , i have four boobs instead of two as my bra is too tight and i hate to admit it but i have back fat ! ! ! my 'resolution' for january is to start a healthy eating programme and begin to correct my terrible diet , hopefully to lose a few pounds along the way and to feel less lethargic and more energetic what am i going to do first ? well that one 's easy , i have joined weight watchers my first meeting is on wednesday nd january when i will strip down to my bra and pants clothes weigh ! ! and step upon the scales ! january is only days long i'm not going to think beyond that and take it a month at time it takes days to break a habit so i'm hoping by january st i will be able to look a bag of crisps in the eye and say quite confidently not today thank you
