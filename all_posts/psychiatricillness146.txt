happy to the extent it interfers with life very happy and a good mood quite satisfied and content feeling nothing a bit low very low , not doing anything thoughts that i do n'twant to continue with life i have been keeping a mood diary for a couple of months the major problem with it is that whenever i start to get a bit happy i ca n't keep still or keep a thought in my head filling in the spreadsheet is impossible to remember when i do remember i tend to dismiss it quite quickly as a waste of time thing think i do n't need it anymore i do notice the highs if they are followed by a low , i then look back to when i had an organised thought and put that date in as normal mood i would like my mood to be between and at all times !
