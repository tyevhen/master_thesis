this whole search for terrorist collaborators thing is getting a little ridiculous tapping into millions of domestic phone calls and probably blogs and emails and ims in the name of terrorism ? that 's legal ? so , here 's my nightmare scenario if this is legal , the next step is to force functional mris on people to determine what they know about terrorism , of course the technology is there functional mri fmri measures minute changes in blood flow in the brain , comparing areas to see which ones have more blood flow , and thus are more active it seems that one must use specific brain areas to make stuff up this technology is being used for good purposes eg , controlling chronic pain , but could certainly be applied to darker motives talkleft asked would the court view an involuntary brain scan as a nonintrusive gathering of information rather than a search governed by the fourth amendment ? would the court view brain scans as forcing an involuntary disclosure of thoughts prohibited by the fifth amendment 's requirement that individuals not be made to testify against their will ? fmri is not invasive in the classical sense no needles no tubes sorta like going through an airport scanner , but lying down you can even keep your shoes on so what 's to stop them from using this technology on gitmo detainees or on us ? the chronic pain link above is interesting , btw it makes me wonder if real time fmri scanning can be used to learn how to better control obsessive thoughts or auditory hallucinations or anxiety
