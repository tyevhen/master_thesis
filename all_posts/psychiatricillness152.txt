with automatic negative thoughts i have become used to recognising the negative thought patterns overtaking and learnt to distract myself with the happy thoughts and my mind racing i find it far more difficult to distract myself what everi do seems to be at super high speed and slowing down these thoughts are impossible i have not had a lasting depression fo a long time but the highs are still bothering me everything goes well for a while and then i realise i have not been doing any of the basic chores in life i have no clean clothes , rubbish piled high and realise i have been eating out everyday for a week because i have not been shopping it gets to the extent that i head off to the supermarket , decide to eat out on the way and then go to the supermarket and buy far too much butno a single square meal this can happen a for days at the time
