i have a white board calendar that i update each month appointments , birthdays , holidays , to do lists , bills due , trash out on thursday evenings , etc for today , i did not write in mother 's day not that i forgot about it , i just did n't want to this year , i have not felt like i 've done a good job at all i do n't want to be acknowledged for all the things i am not proud of ca n't we skim past this hallmark holiday just this once ? before becoming a mom , i would have admitted that i was a somewhat virtuous person , kind , thoughtful , and patience , with no temper yet , in these past few years , i 've discovered that i'm severely lacking in virtue i have very little patience and a lot of anger when i have n't had a lot of sleep i am also way more selfish than i would have thought being a mom has pushed me way past my breaking point and just when i think i have spent it all , i am asked to give a little more like in the horse and his boy , part of the narnia series by c s lewis , when the horse and his boy are being chased by a lion the horse thought he was running his fastest , until the lion gained on him and he found he had more speed to give we do n't realize what we are capable of until faced with adversity we are our biggest obstacles and we become complacent in times of peace and happiness we grow greater and stronger when confronted with trials looking back , i will admit that i am amazed at what i have done but it is not an amazement of myself i am in awe of how much god has helped me overcome myself kicking and screaming , he has had to drag me through this year i did not want to do it i still do n't want to i want to sleep for three days straight yet , i am eternally grateful that he pulled me along , despite my protests i know he loves me because he could have just left me for the vultures now that i realize that i am being carried on the shoulders of christ , like a sheep and a shepherd , i am comforted i do n't want to do it without god 's help anymore carry me through the rest of my life , lord if my suffering goes away , will i still remember you , lord ? do n't take away my suffering if it means i will not be united to you i'm sure i wo n't be happy every day about sacrificing but , at least for today , i am thankful
