it 's and i'm sat in my therapists chair in the doctor 's old room , barely holding myself together , writing a list of the things that make me anxious from least to the most with only just being able to leave the house , the first on my list was catching a bus , going all the way through to getting a job , driving alone , asking for something , going school and travelling alone amongst many others sitting down and writing the list made me realise how little i was capable of how i could hardly walk out the door or even answer the phone in my own house i knew i would have a long road ahead of me , but i was willing to do whatever it took to turn my life around it 's now and i have done it i 've made it i 've overcome everything on my hierarchy from all those years ago i was then and i'm now i 've changed and come a long long way through medication , various counselling and therapy sessions , panic attacks , and very dark days i am finally here and its quite emotional to write about it i do still struggle with anxiety and depression and some tasks i still do find difficult but , i 've overcome the main areas of my illness it has n't been easy and it has n't always been happy , but with time and perseverance you can do it there have been times of hopelessness and times when i thought i would n't make it out alive , but i have and you can too now , it 's about continuing to build on my confidence and areas i struggle with and hopefully one day i will be at a place where mental illness is almost non existence in my daily life best wishes , amy xx
