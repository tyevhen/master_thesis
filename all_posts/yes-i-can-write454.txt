so , after looking forward to this for four months , i leave for not back to school camp on tuesday that 's the freakin' day after tomorrow ! aghhhhhhg ! i know there 's not much left to do , but i ca n't help feeling that i'm going to forget vitally important items , that there must be something i have n't thought of of course , i'm also extremely exited , meeting all of those amazing people , doing cool new things i know i 'll be ready , that things will go okay , but i still ca n't help swinging between wildly exited and crazily worried that 's just me i guess i 've never been good with happy mediums ! i still have n't managed to get my new camera 's software installed damn screwy computer , but i 'll try again in a little while , and hopefully get the pictures currently on my memory card onto the computer so i 've get tons of space for pictures at camp ! now off to do a few last minute things mark clothes with my name , make sure everything fits in my bag , wash the dog who got into something extremely stinky yuck , mop the floor so that it does not transfer all of the dirt onto the clean dog sigh one of the first shots i took with my new camera loaded onto my computer by putting the memory card in my old camera did n't quite turn out as planned , but i still like it for some reason you might also like not back to school camp packing packing packing and wet dogs ahhhgh ! a month of cool people places gone tomorrow linkwithin
