after reading this post entitled the role of parental instruction over at unschooling ruminations , i was thinking about the word teaching , and trying to figure out if there really is anything wrong with it , or if as an unschooler i just have an unfair prejudice against it i know that i certainly get a bad feeling when i hear it but i 've come to the conclusion that no , it is n't just an unfair bias i really do feel the two words have distinct meanings , and i choose not to use the word teaching because i do n't like the meaning it conveys this is how i see the two words teaching teaching puts the emphasis on the external the person or thing doing the teaching teaching implies something being done to you , instead of being something that you do as if learning is something done to you you 're taught it implies a certain passivity in the learning process you sit and take in what is being taught , instead of going out there and learning it learning learning , however , puts the emphasis squarely where it belongs imo , in the hands of the one doing the learning what learning is , as far as i'm concerned , is what you make of the world around you not just what experiences you take in , but how you interpret them thus learning is the process of interpreting and making sense of the world around you it implies an active process you are the one doing the learning i'm sure there 's tons more that could be added , but this is the brief version of why you wo n't hear me using the word teaching if i can help it ! peace , idzie you might also like some more thoughts on teaching and learning learning advice from a learning life why not leave education to the experts ? unschooling for adults linkwithin
