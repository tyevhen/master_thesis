passion we hear the word constantly parents and teachers want children to find their passion , adults are encouraged to find theirs as if everyone has just one in the first place , and every new interest found is met with excitement maybe they ll be good at it people think they can monetize it , start a blog about it , get good enough to compete , even ! each interest or skill , then , is thought of as a means to an end they might go somewhere with this one , an adult thinks with pleasure , as they look fondly on their child s new coding hobby you could start a business ! someone exclaims with excitement to their friend upon trying their cupcakes for the first time but , maybe that s not what everyone wants at least not some of the time probably not most of the time maybe not ever because i m here to share an important piece of knowledge i ve learned , and it is a very simple one it s okay to half ass things it s fine to not be good at something and even more importantly , it s fine to not want to be good at something ! sometimes we can just be , without striving for anything greater than that here s the thing we don t have the time to be good at everything , which means we re going to prioritize some things over others those world class musicians , olympic athletes , and top notch actors ? that s all they do for years every day is spent practicing , honing their craft , striving for greatness for most of us , that s just not what we want we re more generalist than that and even when it comes to the things we do want to invest a lot of our time and energy into , we only have so much of that time and energy , so we have to prioritize what we love and want the most as my sister recently said , writing and ninjutsu are part of who i am , but playing ukulele is just something i do or as i believe she put it , you can t full ass everything ! things can still be fun , enjoyable , and exciting even if they re just hobbies , and not something we want to get serious about my sister loves being able to play ukulele well enough to strum along while she sings it s something she gets joy out of she just does n't happen to want to get better for the sake of being better she s fine with the place the ukulele holds in her life right now this is true for all of us , and isn t something to be ashamed of why do we think we need to be serious about everything ? why can t we do something just because it s fun ? people s misplaced expectations cause pressure , and pressure frequently makes things not fun say you re a young adult who just picked up a gardening hobby really you re just dabbling so far , dipping your toes in , seeing if you like it but every time someone asks you what you re up to , and you mention gardening , suddenly it becomes something big your mother wants you to sign up for a permaculture course you can start a landscaping business ! your neighbor suggests with enthusiasm do you know the city has a best garden award ? i bet you could win it if you worked hard ! your uncle says with a smile everyone has big ideas for your gardening greatness , but really , you re new at this , and you re already starting to think that you ll be happy if the extent of your gardening is just growing half a dozen tomato plants or maybe not even that , because you re getting so tired of people turning what was a fun hobby into something you just don t want it to be outside pressure that has not been agreed to frequently makes people feel uncomfortable , and is far more likely to lessen motivation and interest than to increase it yes , sometimes hobbies or interests will turn into great passions , or paid work , or great renown but it s not our job to decide what will or won t become a big part of someone else s life not if they re a child , a teenager , or an adult and yes , sometimes people need encouragement if something s hard , someone might give up due to lack of confidence a belief that , even though they really want to pursue something seriously , they re just not good enough i don t mean to say that people and children especially don t sometimes need encouragement , offers of classes or special interest groups , and suggestions of ways they can take their interests in new directions , or to a higher level consider this merely as a reminder to tread carefully , and make sure we re helping others be they children or friends achieve their own goals , not superimposing our goals or expectations onto them in conclusion ? having a real passion for something is great but so is just having fun ! and what s even better ? being the ones who get to decide where are own interests are going to take us or not
