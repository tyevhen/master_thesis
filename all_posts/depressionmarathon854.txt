it 's funny looking at my triathlon training schedule for the week , i'm not overwhelmed this morning in fact , i'm thinking , oh , this is n't so bad that 's when i started chuckling my classmates and i are scheduled for nine hours of training this week two weeks ago , we had our first nine hour training week , and i was overwhelmed last week i trained for ten hours , and i was overwhelmed now i'm scheduled for nine hours again , and i'm relieved it 's all a matter of perspective , is n't it ? interestingly , i 've found the same with depression depression 's pain is also subject to my perspective at the top of a downhill slide , i tolerate less pain less well than i do once i'm climbing back up if i'm used to feeling well , a little discomfort can feel overwhelming and scary yet that same level of discomfort may feel joyous and relieving if it occurs after a long period of hopelessness and pain once again , i find my athletic experiences uniquely correlate with my mental illness that 's interesting i wonder if that correlation helps me deal with training , helps me deal with depression , or both ? i think it 's probably both sometimes when i'm running through a tough spot , as i was during the richmond marathon in november , i think surviving depression helps me persevere knowing i 've survived through hopelessness and pain in life has helped me put one foot in front of the other when running at the same time , although i probably call on it less often , i think persevering through tough runs has reminded me to persevere through hopeless moments of depression it seems silly , but it 's true i think we have to use whatever we can to get us through i use training to get me through life , and i use life to get me through training i wonder what do you use to get you through your tough days ?
