soon after i moved back up to aberdeen around a month ago , to my dismay i discovered i had left my foundation back home ! in a state of sheer panic i jumped on the bus to asda and picked up the cheapest one i could find in the makeup aisle i ended up purchasing rimmel 's stay matte foundation , which had just been released at the time i am a massive massive fan of their stay matte powder , which is ultimately what pushed me to choose this foundation i have never been a fan of matte foundations , i much prefer a more luminous finish , and this foundation has reminded me why i vowed never to buy a matte finish foundation again ! the first issue i had was the formula was so thick as you can probably see from the swatch above , it is an incredibly heavy , mousse like texture , which instantly cakes when applied to the skin it is also really hard to blend , and clings to dry patches on the face i tried many different primers and moisturisers on my skin before applying the foundation but unfortunately , nothing seemed to help smooth it out however , in saying that , this product did have a few good points it definitely evens out the skin tone and conceals redness and it also has amazing staying power this is the first foundation i 've come across that pretty much lasts all day ! i mean , if you 're a fan of thick , full coverage foundation , you will most likely love this product , it 's rimmel 's answer to dream matte mousse as for me , i am just glad to have my beloved ysl touch eclat foundation back where it belongs ! if you 've tried this product , let me know how you got on , perhaps it 's just my skin type that disagrees with the formula ? who knows , maybe it 's your holy grail foundation ! related posts i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue things i 've learned in years suz
