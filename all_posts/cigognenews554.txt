so i saw a video lecture by robert sapolsky the neurobiologist at stanford university about depression whenever anyone gets outside their field to lecture i get worried even when i discuss neurology you are far better off listening to someone like sapolsky so what does the bearded doctor say ? that depression is like diabetes and is a biologic disease well all diseases are biologic in the end since they effect the physiologic system the question is , is it biologic in origin ? if you don t see what i see every day then yes you can make that mistake but if you see patients going back in time to preverbal days to relive origins of depression then you know it is not a biologic disease in origin that confusion between origins and results making the results the cause is a very common mistake in psychology and neurology i promise not to discuss neurology anymore if neurologists will lay off psychology just because a professor has a doctorate in finance doesn t mean he can lecture in psychology we are all smart in little ways so what are the hallmarks of depression ? a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness no energy everything is a great effort a big dark hole that one cannot crawl out of everything is in slow motion , labored movements and shallow breathing what s the point of it all ? an emotional numbness no joy in anything no able to talk or express oneself nothing to live for extreme fatigue nothing to live for cannot concentrate wish to die lack of sexual interest total despair i could go on but you all fill in the blanks is all that caused by our biology ? watch out for cause and effect now the catch all that is also what one feels during the trauma of birth and indeed when patients relive these events they lessen their depression all that the depressives feel had their precise beginnings during womblife and at birth why ? what can a fetus do when the mother smokes continuously ? what can the poor guy do when the mother takes painkillers and tranquilizers every few hours he is helpless and hopeless there is nothing he can do no escape death is near as the little system goes into alarm mode that may be later translated into wanting to die because it is the only way to stop the pain it is a big dark hole that he cannot climb out of he cannot talk or scream or show his pain no one to listen , no one to hear no one cares of course there is extreme fatigue think of the effort it takes to get born when the newborn is drugged out of his mind there are labored movements as he can barely move at all and on and on you can read the janov solution for the long version of this discussion but there is a cause and if you have no idea about the imprint , even though all new information supports it and if you have no idea about how early those imprints are laid down , then of course you will confuse cause and effect and lecture about how depression is a biologic disease just like diabetes sapolsky s idea in a strange way , it is not so far off the mark because diabetes too is biologic but it may well be that early experience sets off this disease , as well you see that once you believe that , then there are only physiologic therapies such as drugs that you believe in you eschew psychologic explanations and therapy worse , you no longer look for causes because , you see , you already know it is biologic dr drew of television fame for treatment of addiction calls all this a brain disease of course , there are brain effects but what is the cause ? life experience , for the most part but if you never see those experiences , hidden as they are during womblife and birth , then you have no choice but to believe it is all brain disease but when my patients relive birth and then we see fingerprints coming up on both legs immediately afterward we know about the imprint and its enduring nature or when they relive anoxia at birth and then lessen their addiction we see the connection but if you do not have the means to observe all that your conclusions will be faulty and you will be led to believe that addiction is a brain disease depression is by and large a parasympathetic reaction i suggest reading my books for a full discussion of this but the depressive is stuck at the time when he was in the trough trying to get born all to no avail as drugs rushed in to block his efforts , or he was strangled on the cord , or he had unavoidable trauma during womblife that left a mark on him the system goes into parasympathetic excess or passivity in order to survive , and that survival mode , parasympathetic , endures for a lifetime we are stuck way back there and we don t know it i know it and my patients know it and now you know it we all know it ahhh
