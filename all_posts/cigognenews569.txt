the question so often posed in philosophy class is , are you loved if you think you are ? are you happy if you think you are ? i mean , what s the difference so long as you think you are happy ? well , we might ask , are self delusions useful ? do they take the place of reality ? not if you believe reality is in your head , in your perceptions not if you 're thinking that thinking is what counts but alas , it doesn t because , no matter what you think , the body thinks too , and it sends out messages of pain and unhappy and unloved that is why patients come to us saying they were loved as children , and six months later they learn from themselves that they weren t when they get to their pain they suddenly realize what happened to them in their lives what does that mean , they learn from themselves ? are ourselves the best teacher ? yes we learn from our real history , not the self deluded one that could not see what was going on we learn about love from what we didn t get , and we learn that happiness for us , was a poor fa ade to cover what we dare not faced we learn , above all , how we fool ourselves unconsciously , how we cannot see what is right in front of us how do we do that ? we learn that when our early pain got too much there was an automatic shutoff , repression set in and blinded us to reality first the inner one and then the outer one so there are several levels of consciousness one is our top level perceptual one , and the more important is what our heart , brain and blood system say about our lives it is often not a pretty picture even though we are taught to pretty it up , not complain and look on the bright side isn t that what cognitive therapy does ? look on the bright side , think happy thoughts and have wholesome ideas it is how we grew up writ in psychologese so who is the real you ? the happy one or the unhappy one ? well , there are two you s , the unreal self that you present to the world , and the other one that you present to yourself and that one you cannot really face even though it talks to you all of the time it speaks to us in a language we barely understand in high blood pressure , in migraines and muscle aches we need to speak that language and we need to learn it if we hope to get rid of the complaints our bodies are making does it matter so long as i think i am loved and happy ? no if you don t mind falling sick and dying early otherwise , yes because all that repression kills i think the real disease so widespread today is repression when researchers put animals in pain they developed symptoms , but when they gave them chemicals that stopped repression the symptoms went away in short , it is blocking pain that creates symptoms , and unblocking it that eradicates them those with leaky gates , inadequate repression , do not have the symptoms others have , specifically cancer , because they cannot repress as others do leaky gates are the anxious ones , the adders , the hysterics , all over the place , unable to focus or listen to instructions but they cannot cap it all to develop serious symptoms , at least in the beginning over long term anxiety , there are consequences they will die of heart attacks and strokes , but it is the repressives who will die of the diseases of repression so to answer my question , yes , it counts a lot not to be deluded , not to think we are fine when we aren t there is a price to pay for not facing reality , and yet so many do not get physical exams because they don t want to know denial is so convenient , and so deadly then we wake up and want to know when it is far too late when our disease is so advanced that nothing can be done such as in emphysema people know that smoking is harmful but the need to suppress pain is a lot more powerful than that knowing understanding is helpful but a weak sister to need and eventually our pain killing habits are what will kill us , and we don t want to know because we know that we can t stop the only way to stop is to get rid of the early imprinted pain not easy to do and painful who wants that ? those with leaky gates who suffer all of the time and cannot delude themselves so those in pain can be helped those who do not know it cannot such a dilemma
