so said lilly sales reps who pushed the drug in alaska i did a little reading on the topic from the new zyprexa document set from the recent alaska case , but was scooped by furious seasons , where it was written that lilly was using cases of patients apparently with bipolar disorder , likely type who ran into problems on ssris such as agitation to create a scenario for selling doctors on using zyprexa in these patients snippets from sales call notes are then added to strongly support this assertion well worth a read especially the clincher that involves the old fashioned trick of bribing docs with candy to get them to write zyprexa scripts if i get a little spare time , i hope to wrangle through the new zyprexa docs and spread the word about whatever horrors lie therein
