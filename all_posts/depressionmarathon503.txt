i think i'm getting better my mood has been a bit more stable lately , and that has been despite , or perhaps because i 've been busy the roller coaster has mellowed it 's more like a kiddie coaster now i am still dipping , but the valleys are fewer , and they are more shallow i'm hoping these are both good signs like i said , i 've been busy this weekend i ran my last mile training run before the twin cities marathon i was out there before the sun rose yesterday morning it was a gorgeous day ! things went well i hit the pace i planned to hit , and i was n't too pooped at the end i think i 'll be ready when i hit the starting line in three weeks last night , i told my story at my regular aa meeting i 've only done that once before , and it was a few years ago , so i was nervous i typed up what i thought was a fair amount of information yesterday afternoon , as i was expected to speak for close to an hour at the meeting , what i typed up only took minutes to say , but i still got good feedback from the audience members i guess i 'll have to add a couple of anecdotes to my story next time today was another busy day do you remember d , my boyfriend from last year ? we met on a bike path in northern wisconsin last spring and dated until i was hospitalized in january he disappeared when i was in the hospital he could n't handle it the depression scared him well , d and i have been talking off and on since mid april it was very , very sporadic texts at first , but in mid to late july , we began speaking a bit finally , we decided to meet about one month ago we live hours apart from each other , so we met in the middle and had dinner it was nice , but we did n't talk about what happened or anything substantial i did n't think things were going to go anywhere after that meeting , but d and i kept in touch and met again today today we spent about hours together and we talked a lot about what happened in january , about depression , and about where we might go from here we are both so comfortable with each other , i hope he 's willing to be educated we plan to meet again , and i'm really happy about that now it 's time for bed
