the initial sleep study i had a couple weeks ago apparently showed some apnea , as i am scheduled for a follow up study the second study is to titrate the c pap machine in other words , i will go to bed with a c pap on , and then the tech will gradually increase the air pressure throughout the night the goal is to find the pressure point at which my airway will remain open it sounds like a loooong night to me as i said before , i'm torn about this whole business with all the fatigue and sleepiness i 've had these past two weeks , there is a part of me that is thrilled with the possibility i have apnea maybe this is the key which will unlock my energy again maybe this fatigue has been about more than depression all along ! of course , there is a larger part of me that does n't wish to add another diagnosis to the litany i already have the necessity of sleeping with a machine for the rest of my days is also not appealing ! that 's not appealing at all and what if i have apnea , go on the c pap , yet still battle with this fatigue ? ugh now i'm thinking too much ! i gotta stop thinking and just wait i need to wait and see what the test shows and then wait and see if the fatigue abates however , if there is anyone out there who has experience with fatigue , and apnea , and c pap , i 'd love to hear from you !
