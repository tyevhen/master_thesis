we 've been having a great discussion over on the post tell me an ethical dilemma the post talks about a young man who wants to know if he can check no to a question about whether he has a psychiatric disorder if his illness is not relevant to the situation the comments have been fascinating do read them and very thought provoking one reader asked , if a patient asked if they were boring you , and they were , would you say yes ? this is a great question , and of course the right thing to do is to explore with the patient what meaning the concern has to him but is that all ? i'm not very good at doing the old psychoanalyst thing of deflecting all questions , and mostly i do answer questions when they are asked of me this can present a really sticky situation because one can not think of any clinical scenario in which it would be therapeutic to have a therapist tell a patient , 'yes , you 're boring , omg are you boring , ' or 'no , in fact , i do n't like you ' and not answering could be viewed as negative response by the patient if you liked me , you 'd tell me , so clearly you do n't like me so if the exploration of the question does n't take care of the issue , and the patient continues to ask , what 's a shrink to do ? i'm not in favor of lying to patients , therapy is about having an honest relationship , but our readers have given some great examples if a gunman asks for your money , is it okay to lie and say you have none ? is it okay to lie about whether you 've been the victim of sexual abuse on a job application one reader saw this ! just because someone asks , do you need to answer truthfully ? of course , you can be truthful and say you do n't plan to answer that question , but so many times , the assumption is that the answer must be yes because if not , you 'd have nothing to hide psychiatrists do n't owe it to their patients to be totally transparent shrinks have the right to their privacy , and professional boundaries dictate that it 's wrong to share your problems with your patients even if they ask that being said , it still can feel very uncomfortable on the shrink side of a couch when a boring patient asks if they are boring what would you say ?
