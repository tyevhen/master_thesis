being a recovering alcoholic and person with depression , i do n't find the bar scene too inviting so , i am meeting some new people online and expect to be dating one of them , officially , soon here 's the problem , the question , the conundrum when do i drop the d bomb on the guy ? he thinks i'm swell smart , funny , charming , sexy , blah , blah , blah but just how sweet , charming and sexy will i be when i add depression to my list of attributes ? how about chronic , debilitating , treatment resistant , do n't have enough energy to brush my teeth depression ? charming ? sexy ? sweet ? i do n't think so ! this is such an anxiety producing dilemma for me i feel like these guys are getting to know me minus the catch i do n't feel like i am being honest nor totally dishonest in fact , this whole process is painfully bittersweet i see these guys getting to know the person i used to be i can still be that person , but only occasionally and for short periods of time it 's also a whole lot easier via e mail than in person to play the role in reality , i no longer am that person , and it is just an old , familiar role it takes a lot of energy to play the role weird , huh ? it takes energy for me to play the role of me the me i used to be me minus depression if i act the part for for too long it absolutely wipes me out that is the point i'm getting to with this guy i like him he likes me will he also like me the me with depression ? it 's ridiculous , really ! obviously , if he ca n't handle it he 's not a person i want to be associated with but if not him , who ? major depression is not a selling point ! it 's one more thing that is wrong with me and when i start thinking like that , the demon depression is winning , and i still do n't know when to drop the d bomb
