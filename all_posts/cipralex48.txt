been couple of days since my last post , i had a very busy week and a lot on my mind here 's a quick review of what happened these days and what i went through i had some work related meetings this week with some people i didn t knew and some i have n't seen a long , long time , went very good i think its amazing how easy it is to communicated when you 're not so busy with dealing with the panic attacks , anxiety and depression , it was actually fun i was at a barbeque with friends , made everyone laugh that 's funny , usually i would just try survive the situation if would get myself to ever get out of the house and when i did find myself in those situation i would never talk or talk as less as possible , but this time i could n't shut up , i was funny , interesting and seems like people really enjoyed my company its like i feel i can finally truly express myself , my real self around people and that 's awesome later the same week i called this new girl i'm suppose to date today , her name is carrie and once again it 's a blind date , now you 're probably asking yourself why am i doing this to myself lol so was i , but my plan is to attack my greatest fears , one by one , until i will comfortable around people i had a conversation with her over the phone , it went smooth , i felt relaxed and made her laugh , seems like i'm improving all the time , she sounded a bit old or too slow on the phone but maybe its just me , never the less will try to meet her open minded and have fun , get some more experience and gain more confidence this is mostly what i'm after mostly lately later , still the same week on the way saw this girl that could n't open a door and i helped her , also at launch talked to the waitresses a bit went nice too , i think she want something from me ? maybe not i'm still fighting myself to break a specific barrier that really annoys me when it comes to approaching strangers and initiating conversations with them i really want to be able to do that after that day i woke up ok , but almost forgot to take the pill again lately i'm forgetting that i take pills at all which is good but bad cause i don t want to forget or skip a day , anyways , i 've made an emergency package of cipralex pills and placed it in my wallet for emergency situations had to come back home to take it i place a my appetite is getting better lately and over all i had no special dramas this week , thinking a lot about getting a girlfriend , i have another blind date today , i wonder how it will go thats it for now , i will update you how it went on my blind date wish me luck and take care ! email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
