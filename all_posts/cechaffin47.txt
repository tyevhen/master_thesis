i do not mean to make it a practice again to blog about my long manic depressive cycles , i only alluded to some recent hope in my last post from resuming medication in the face of another depression alas , after two weeks of improvement i felt the swill and suck of demon melancholy pulling at me monday by today i was weeping in my psychiatrist 's office where he made me laugh , referring to me as a third generation blueblood bipolar i laughed in the midst of my tears great guy anyway , he added meds today and i hope they work , but i am prepared to endure what i must to endure my best times are with my hospice client , who has metastatic cancer , for when i am with her i am simply being with her , only sometimes doing for her the being with is what counts and in that i can forget myself , a major blessing but god how i hate being depressed , and no amount of doing can bring me out of it just time and medications what i most wish for is a stretch of stable years like i had from to on lamictal why in the last four years i lost that stability i ca n't say bad luck is the extent of my understanding i'm hoping for good luck i hope to take craig with me this weekend to visit my grandson and daughters and friends , and not be stuck with his weeping doppelganger that melancholy man can be such a bore , and living in his body gives me the willies ! as if everything were a test he was about to fail , from tying his shoes to wiping his mouth after a sandwich , with his constant self judgment and accompanying terror without object or relief , the vacuum inside , the loss of self , self being replaced by a golem of anti matter , not even a dark self , more a non self , as if a ghost were speaking words through my mouth should this depression continue i may have to return to my blog for therapy , though slightly embarrassed by the need but why should i be embarrassed ? i 've laid it all out before let this depression pass through me like a radioactive cloud borne on the wind let it touch me but not become me though it hurt me more deeply than my daughter 's death , though its burning fangs sink into the gray cushion of my mind , let the poison pass however long it may linger , i cling to the grace that it is temporary let the blessed winds blow ! thine , craig
