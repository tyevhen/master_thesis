back in diet and violence , i presented evidence from two decently sized randomized controlled trials of adding a multivitamin multimineral essential fatty acid supplement to normal prison fare the trials were done about years apart and in different countries , yet came out with a similar conclusion actual violent discipline requiring incidents committed by the prisoners who took the supplements was reduced by about compared to pre supplement days , and in one study the placebo taking prisoners had an increase in violent events , whereas the other study showed just a small change on placebo my conclusion practically speaking , i hope that prisoners in the us get a supplement come to think of it , i have a friend who is a doctor in the prison system but she was asking me what i thought about recommendations for vitamin d , so maybe the official guidelines are n't solid hmmm time to fire off a facebook message i do n't care if it is the best pharmaceutical grade supplement on the planet , a month of supplementation ca n't be more costly than a couple of days in prison and total number of days in prison and parole and solitary and all those situations are in part determined by prisoner behavior , i imagine i'm guessing that prisoners receive the most horrendous , cheap , grain and soy and margarine foods imaginable we have to get tough on crime after all our tax dollars at work of course i am being far too sensible from the article about the pioneering diet and violence researcher gesch in science in decades of studies by schoenthaler and others have supported a connection between nutrition and violence , but for a variety of reasons some scientific , others political it hasn t yet translated into policy but let 's step back from pragmatism for a moment here 's the real issue with the science i pursue , at least in the eyes of the medical establishment also from the science article this field has seen a lot of exaggerated claims and not enough solid placebo controlled research , says eugene arnold , a psychiatrist and former director of the nisonger center at ohio state university , columbus studies have shown that there clearly is a connection between nutrients and behavioral disorders for example , between nutrition and depression but rigorous research has been the exception , he says most studies of the effects of nutrition on antisocial behavior are dismissed because of poor experimental design and arnold notes that misleading claims by the booming nutrient supplement industry have brought the taint of pseudoscience to those studying diet and behavior even good scientists in this field have been treated as guilty by association , he says gesch began working with young offenders in the s as a social worker he would invite groups over for home cooked meals , the goal being that the atmosphere would help them open up and share their troubles and gesch noticed that after a while , the kids would be transformed becoming healthier and often abandoning the antisocial behaviors that had gotten them into trouble he began to believe that shedding their scattershot diets of junk food was central to the behavioral shift , perhaps even more so than the family like socializing finally he was able to obtain funding for his study , now replicated , and at the same time gesch gathered data for a second paper on how food choices of prisoners affected actual daily intake of nutrients he found not surprisingly that , when they got the chance , prisoners would buy food like peanuts , chips , candy and cookies from the prison store , which would add to their daily intake of omega oils , trans fats , grains , and sugar in addition , though the prison diets were designed by institutional dietitians , most had suboptimal amounts of vitamin d even compared to the lowly iu recommended for people with little sun and selenium , and the vegetarian and muslim menus often had some suboptimal b vitamins and total calories just want to mention here schoenthaler 's randomized controlled trial from , of six twelve year old schoolchildren who had previously been disciplined at school in working class hispanic neighborhoods of phoenix schoenthaler notes that previous randomized controlled trials of supplementation of the rda for prisoners resulted in a decrease in number of violent acts his results were a decrease in violent acts among the supplemented kids compared to the placebo controls i 'd call that more replication and a call for some serious multivitamin multimineral efa supplementation action on a large scale in institutions such as prisons , especially where relatives are often not allowed to bring in outside food of course , nutrition is only a part of the larger problem of violence and crime but in institutions , it seems like a relatively controllable part , if only common sense would prevail
