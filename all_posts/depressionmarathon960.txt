so i got myself a tri bike this spring with the thought of one day trying a triathlon maybe i'm not a great swimmer , and i'm a little afraid of the water , so the swimming portion of the tri scares me with that in mind , you 'd think i would jump at the chance to try a duathlon , right ? well , apparently not you see , there is a duathlon run , ride , run right here in my back yard this saturday it is a mile run , followed by a mile ride , followed by another mile run the distances are n't overwhelming i know how to run i know how to ride my bike what is the problem ? the problem is i'm afraid i do n't know why ! it 's silly why am i afraid to try this ? yes , i 've never done this before yes , it would be uncomfortable being a newbie yes , like most people , i do not find bike shorts particularly attractive so i'm afraid because i 'd have to run miles in big butt bike shorts ? i guess so i'm writing this here in hopes of inspiration i hope to be so embarrassed by my fear that it will force me to confront it after all , i really do n't have a good reason to be afraid doing a duathlon would be new it would be different i would n't be a comfy veteran of the sport i guess those are all reasons for my fear , but i do n't think they are particularly good reasons i should do the duathlon despite my fears , big butt bike shorts and all right ?
