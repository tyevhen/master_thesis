if you are a consistent reader of my blog , you may have read an earlier post that i have a high school senior so in exactly ten months , i will be the parent of a college freshman ! i ca n't believe my baby girl is leaving to go to college and we will have an empty nest something i have only fantasized about after raising kids for the last years evil laugh my kid has a long list of schools that she is interested in attending however as we all know , you must make a plan to visit the campus although she has good intentions , i have found out that my daughter does n't always follow through on her responsibilities now that we are in october , i really have been pushing her to apply for scholarships , retake the act , and go on a college tour um , it is not working so well sigh okay morton , i thought , you have been a high school counselor for years how would you help these types of students ? ? ? believe me , it is more difficult being a parent of a high school senior than just being his or her school counselor ! since my daughter is a dual enrollment student and i have taken a new job in our district , we both have become disconnected from all the senior news at her high school which puts us at a disadvantage in essence , she has been missing her senior meetings , the school counselor visit into the english class , the college lunch visits , the trips into our college and career center well , you get my point now , i truly understand how parents and students can feel disconnected from school and how important it is to keep them connected during the senior year so now that i feel like a disconnected parent sad face , i have to find ways to reach out to the school and hope the school will reach out to me ! helping disconnected senior parents and students okay , i admit it ! i have complained about disconnected parents and students i wondered why they could not reach out to me and take care of business i have students for crying out loud ! however , i am feeling rather empathetic toward our disconnected parents because it is easy to loose touch with everything going on when you are out of the loop for example , it is like binge watching your favorite show for two weeks and not staying abreast of current events or going out of town for vacation and being overwhelmed when you get back in the office you do n't mean for it to happen this way , but other things require your immediate attention the majority of our parents really care about what is going on in school and want to be a part of the process the problem , as prince pointed out in one of his songs , is this thing called life parents have so many daily obstacles that many of them do not have the time or energy to go to a high school assembly or meeting also , many parents do not realize they are disconnected and count on their teen to inform them of what is happening and even keep on track in fact , i did n't realize i was disconnected until this month and i started a plan to make a change my plan first , i had to recognize that i was disconnected as a parent when i realized i was disconnected from my daughters' school , i looked for ways to find out information that i had missed fortunately , i have the knowledge to find out the information i need however , many parents do n't have this luxury as school counselors , it is important to get out information to parents and not expect them to get it from their teen here are some examples of information that may be helpful to parents from high school counseling departments th grade action plan for parents questions to ask your school counselor questions to ask on a college visit th grade resources college fair checklist second , i had to find out what we missed and future events asking questions and having accurate information is imperative at this point however , if parents do n't know what events have happened or will happen in their students' senior year , they may become frustrated and start putting the blame on others um , you if there are parents that you have n't heard from during the senior year , make attempts to reach out to them sending out a parent survey may be a helpful way to find out the needs of your parents brookwood high school senior survey third , i had to do my research and get accurate information since we are not at our old school , we must go the extra distance to get information about college fairs , application deadlines , scholarships , testing , and senior events again , many disconnected parents do n't know what they do n't know here are some college resources you can share with your parents on your website !
