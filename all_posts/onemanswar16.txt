it s just a meeting and it s a week away it s not real hard there s no reason to be anxious what if everybody hates my idea ? i know fred won t like my idea he never likes my ideas he ll probably say something ugly , which will make me mad we ll get into an argument i hope i don t lose my cool when we start arguing he always says something that sticks in my craw i already know what he ll say i might as well get ready for it what am i going to say back ? i better think of something fast barclay looks tired i would ask her what s wrong but i m not sure i want to know the answer i know it was something i did or didn t do what did i forget to do ? what did i do that made her mad ? she s probably mad because i haven t told her i loved her in a while i bet she s mad because i haven t helped around the house , either i know she s upset because i can t concentrate on the kids when i m around them lately she s going to say something to me if i don t say something to her first but if i say something to her first , she s going to get mad at whatever i say and we re going to get in a fight i m not saying anything my son s basketball coach just yelled at him i m not going to let that bother me it s part of growing up and learning from adversity i can t believe that idiot yelled at my son he doesn t even know anything about basketball i ve forgotten more about basketball than he ever knew i m going to say something after the game not sure what i m going to say , but i m going to say something he s going to get mad , but i don t care if he shoves me , i m not sure i can turn my cheek i might shove him back then he might come after me when he does , i ll either get somebody to help me or i ll run to the car i ll have to go to the city and tell them he can t be a coach another day i m going to get banned from the gym but i don t care because we aren t playing for this jackass anymore there s dog hair all over my clean socks again i ll let it go this time , even though this dogs sheds faster than a stripper in vegas i can t let this go i m sick of having dog hair all over the house and all over my stuff why can t we just have an outside dog ? i swear my wife likes the dog more than she likes me i m going to build a kennel outside so the dog can spend more time where she belongs my wife s not going to like it i don t care anymore i m tired of it we ll probably get in an argument and she ll point out i never clean anything anyway i don t think i ll say anything we re doing bench press at crossfit today maybe i ll get a new personal record oh no we re doing bench press at crossfit today this is my worst exercise there are girls here who can lift more than i do no way i m going for a personal record it will be humiliating when i try what if the bar gets stuck on my chest ? i can t ask for a spot because everyone will see how little weight i use i ll never look like those other guys that for some reason take their shirts off all the time , even when they aren t even changing clothes why do they do that ? maybe i m secretly jealous because there is no way in hell i m taking my shirt off i think i ll just skip crossfit today i m going to write a blog about what it s like to live in my head no way i can write about what it s like to live inside my head people will think i m a lunatic mom will probably call is this normal ? other people sure don t look like they have paralyzing anxiety they look calm and confident they look like they aren t thinking about anything but what they re doing right now must be nice surely somebody can relate or maybe they can t i can t write about life inside an anxious mind because it s too hard to explain maybe it doesn t matter people already know i m a bipolar alcoholic with generalized anxiety disorder and that i have the shakes i don t even know why i write this blog am i embarrassing my family and myself ? i think i ll quit doing it what if i ever have to apply for a new job ? i m screwed when that happens all they have to do is google my name and they won t even take my call they might change their number i wonder how long until i have to apply for a new job ? maybe i need to get my resume together damn that s going to take forever because i never wrote down when i started a new job or what i did at my old jobs does anybody even have that information ? if i get it wrong they ll think i lied on my resume , and then nobody will hire me i better sit down and pray right now i never have to get another job that 's going to be a nightmare
