we need only read the paper , watch tv , or see internet news updates , and we will be bombarded with doom and gloom predications that recession is coming ! or , recession is here ! and of course , world heading for global depression ! the fact is that some countries are already suffering the effects of recession , with rising inflation , higher unemployment , and an increase in the number of the homeless my wife has shared with me the troubles that many families are experiencing in japan now since company provided housing is often part of the job package , when a father is retrenched , they lose not only their income but their home as well many fear that the world is in danger of slipping into another depression akin to the great depression of the late s and early s many factors that brought about the great depression are at work in today s global economy , such as distress selling , banks in serious financial straights , falling asset prices , lower profits , falling interest rates , soaring unemployment , and so on what attitude should we take towards the threat of national global recession and depression ? should we live in fear of their arrival , dreading how recession or depression will affect us personally ? should we allow fears of what may come tomorrow destroy our ability to live today ? jesus told us not to worry do not worry , saying , 'what shall we eat ? ' or 'what shall we drink ? ' or 'what shall we wear ? ' for the pagans run after all these things , and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own matthew so we should live today with the strength that god gives us today worrying about tomorrow not only destroys our ability to enjoy and cope with today , but it doubts god s ability to look after our future and when 'tomorrow' comes , should it arrive hand in hand with calamity , what should our attitude be ? what if national or global recession depression deprives us of jobs , shares , investments , even our homes and possessions ? the answer is that we must seek first the kingdom of god and then trust him to meet all of our needs one of god s names is jehovah jireh , which means , the lord will provide so abraham called that place the lord will provide and to this day it is said , on the mountain of the lord it will be provided genesis i am convinced that as we put god first and present our requests to him , we will be astounded by the miracles of his wondrous provision philippians and my god will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in christ jesus god knows what we need we have nothing to fear matthew therefore i tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink or about your body , what you will wear is not life more important than food , and the body more important than clothes ? look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns , and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they ? who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life ? there is a running joke in my family if we receive a tax bonus or a cash windfall for a certain amount , we often get a bill the next day for that same amount it is my personal opinion that one of the primary ways god will provide for the needs of his children during recession depression is through the body of christ these trials are an opportunity for christians to watch out for each other s needs , so that those with plenty can help those in need , just as in the early church let us each be mindful of the needs of our christian family , especially those of our local church acts all the believers were one in heart and mind no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own , but they shared everything they had with great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the lord jesus , and much grace was upon them all there were no needy persons among them for from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them , brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles' feet , and it was distributed to anyone as he had need please note that there is a difference between god supplying all of our needs and god maintaining our wealth or current previous life style our riches are those things we have stored in heaven our relationship with god , our salvation , each soul we have lead to christ , every good work we have done for god what attitudes should we have if such trials as recession depression destroy our previous lifestyle ? let examine the life of the apostle paul , who set us a great example through the many trials he endured corinthians i have worked much harder , been in prison more frequently , been flogged more severely , and been exposed to death again and again five times i received from the jews the forty lashes minus one three times i was beaten with rods , once i was stoned , three times i was shipwrecked , i spent a night and a day in the open sea , i have been constantly on the move i have been in danger from rivers , in danger from bandits , in danger from my own countrymen , in danger from gentiles in danger in the city , in danger in the country , in danger at sea and in danger from false brothers i have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep i have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food i have been cold and naked how did paul respond to these trials ? did he worry , grumble , or blame god ? no , he relied upon christ s strength instead of upon his own corinthians therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses , so that christ 's power may rest on me he learned to be content whatever his circumstances philippians i know what it is to be in need , and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength in fact , he went further than being content in the book of acts , we even find him singing and praising god while in prison ! acts upon receiving such orders , he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god , and the other prisoners were listening to them how was paul able to respond like this ? it was because his hope was securely and firmly in christ , not in this world or its riches , material possessions , stock markets , job , or house thessalonians we continually remember before our god and father your work produced by faith , your labor prompted by love , and your endurance inspired by hope in our lord jesus christ paul also fixed his hope upon the riches he would receive in christ when he died and went to heaven peter therefore , prepare your minds for action be self controlled set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when jesus christ is revealed further more , paul considered the unimaginable , eternal riches that await us in heaven , and compared to these , the temporary trials we endure on the earth faded into insignificance romans now if we are children , then we are heirs heirs of god and co heirs with christ , if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us i think of my ill health in the same way hearing impaired , bad tinnitus , epilepsy , slipped spinal discs , difficulty swallowing when examined in their own light , these troubles could weigh me down and yes , i know god can and does heal , and i have sought such healings however , if he never heals me of these ailments , i am not troubled why ? because my hope is in christ i know that my time in this world is temporary i am only passing through on my way to heaven to be with christ , my lord and saviour and when i get to heaven , i will receive a brand new , resurrection body perfect in every way , just like christ s resurrected body i will have this new body for eternity if you are reading this article and you have not accepted jesus christ to be your lord and saviour , let me encourage you to take that step now pop over to my blog s right hand side bar , scroll down and you will see a heading becoming part of god s family follow the instructions given by these bible verses and you will begin your new life as a born again christian our life in this world is temporary , and without god , has no meaning , as the bible shows us in ecclesiastes meaningless ! meaningless ! says the teacher utterly meaningless ! everything is meaningless but for those with faith in christ , our lives have meaning , significance and purpose those who belong to god s family have a wondrous hope that one day we shall spend eternity in heaven , where we can see the face of god and jesus everyday , a perfect place filled with love , joy and peace so if recession depression deprives us of our job , shares , investments , home or possessions , let us remember to keep things in perspective this is temporary , christ is our hope , and glory awaits us and our god shall supply all of our needs download a pdf booklet of this blog 's articles all verses from the niv images from freeimages co uk
