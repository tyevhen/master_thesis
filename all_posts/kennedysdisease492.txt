last week was interesting for me since beginning my own dutasteride trial , it was the first time in eighteen months that i felt any real weakness the following is a summary of my daily journal for this unusual episode day i noticed a slight weakness in the legs when getting up and transferring then when i exercised , the leg extensions were very difficult everything else was okay , but not easy the rest of the day the weakness was noticeable day i noticed more weakness in the legs and also the arms i was experiencing some muscle tightness day legs and arms are weaker the entire exercise program was more difficult the rest of the day i struggled far more than normal the last months day still noticing the weakness i am beginning to have some concerns what is going on ? day not quite as weak today my exercise routine went okay this is positive let s hope i am on the mend again day weakness hardly noticeable day everything seems fine again full strength , no problems with exercises , no noticeable weakness in other activities still have some muscle tightness after exercising , however day everything is fine once again i am taking this one day at a time again i became so used to good day after good day , i forgot what it was like to have weak days life has been pretty good since starting the dutasteride trial the development is interesting and i hope not a trend i have enjoyed the ride
