it 's that time of year again where i review my past year i 've done this for the previous two years , which can be read here and here it 's been another intense year with ups and downs but many achievements i finished my first year studying law at university and moved into the second with a pass rate i am very pleased with university has been the best choice i have made as i have made so many great friends , become independent and battled my anxiety head on i have some amazing memories and laughs from this year which i will never forget i have been to numerous concerts and met my idol for the third time , reached a one year anniversary , had many nights out and great times with friends and family and moved into my own house ! this summer has been a massive achievement for me i travelled back from germany to london completely alone , worked in a charity shop for two months , did a weeks work experience in a law firm , held my blogger meet up and did lots of travelling i also took my driving test for the first time , but unfortunately failed nevertheless , because it is one of my biggest anxiety triggers i am so proud i took it i retook my driving test for the second time and passed ! a three year battle which i 've won ! of course , as with any year there have been battles that had to be conquered and i 've still battled my anxiety and depression this year and some stages were definitely more tough than others but , i have felt that by going to university the struggle has lessened as i look back at my years in review , it 's encouraging to see the improvement over time i still continue to work with it and battle it and i'm hoping that maybe even next year i will be able to come off of my medication i am immensely proud of this year and what i have achieved you can do it ! amy xx
