i do n't want to slice it too fine , but i am feeling a tad better today i have n't wept so far as my grandson 's favorite , thomas the tank , is wont to say , i have tried to be a useful engine kathleen dislikes this concept in the thomas the tank series the toys originate from britain because she thinks it makes behavior the price for self esteem i argue that certainly , children need to be loved unconditionally , but they also need a sense of mastery and striving for mastery is an important source of self esteem achievement , work , mastery , striving , are part and parcel of our self view , and i do n't think this confined to the west mastery begins early and remains important , whether it involves dressing a doll or riding a bike of course the very question of self esteem is ridiculous in depression , as a nobel prize would n't change one 's opinion of oneself it 's raining heavily today in spurts i wanted to mulch my garden before the rains started but was caught short in my sloth this year i plan only to have a flower garden as most vegetables did not fare well last year i cried through most of my appt with my psychiatrist yesterday he wants me to give up alcohol altogether , my last vice besides coffee , though that is not the reason i cried i am desperate enough to comply with his advice , though i never saw alcohol consumption having any influence on my mood in the past now comes the hard part , saying good bye to a good friend i 've quit drinking for long periods in the past , and could never see how it made my life either better or worse here 's a little exercise for today triolet the madman lost his magic sequined hat whose tiny mirrors gave him the power to think now his brain babbled jehoshophat the madman lost his magic sequined hat without it he could not tie his cravat he needed silver moons to help him link the madman lost his magic sequined hat whose tiny mirrors gave him the power to think unstably , ce
