i have had a really nice weekend , i have been on my own for most of it but i am starting to appreciate time to myself and this weekend i decided to just do what i would do if i had the perfect company with someone who likes doing exactly what i do i have to break the socialisolation i have found myself in some how and i have decided getting out of the flat is a good start life is not worth living without the company of others yesterday i went to a few banks building societies to see how much i could borrow to buy a house i can borrow more than i thought i could , i have searched a few websites but places with gardens are very limited in reading with my budget i do seem to have a choice flats apartments that are not studio apartments though ! i also went to a pub on my own to watch an the opening england game come on england ! ! ! yesterday i also met my best friend at the pub , she had experianced contractions all friday night but they stopped again she is now weeks pregnant she went in to hospital tonight to be induced , i am waiting to hear something ! ! today i went to the park near my house , i intended to just sit and read but the insects got on my nerves i went and sat in the pub garden the pub is in the middle of the park i sat there had a glass of wine and started reading angels and demons by dan brown i even ordered myself some food ! i have managed to get a little sun burnt on the back of my neck but i can live with that i went salsa dancing tonight , it was only my second time i really enjoyed it i am a little over weight though and i have suddenly become motivated to join weight watchers again ! i am yawning , i must get to bed or i will never wake up in the morning for work i have become addicted to the social anxiety uk discusion board if you are visit my blogg from that site please leave me a comment and say hello !
