if you 're a regular reader of my blog , you 'll know that i encourage talking about mental health as the best route to recovery however , i know this is easier said than done and i know that talking about your problems with mental health can be very difficult therefore , i 've compiled a list of a few things that may help you letter often we have the words to say , but we just ca n't bring ourselves to say them aloud by writing a letter , it may be easier for you to tell someone about the issues you are facing and give the other person time to reply trust it 's always easier to talk to someone who you know really well and trust you know that these people will support you with whatever you will tell them a problem shared , is a problem halved therefore , you 'll not only find it easier to talk to them , but it may give you the courage to talk to other people who you are close to in your life research unfortunately , mental health is n't as understood as we 'd all like it to be however , there are ways you can help it will become easier for the other person to understand if you have some information to help you explain the condition you can find this information from the doctors , charities , the internet and of course your own experience ! you 're the same keep in mind that you 're still the same as you were before you had told this person about your mental health you have n't changed , you just have to battle something extra in your everyday life perhaps explaining this to the person , may help them to understand and support you you 're still the person they 've always known walk and talk try to find the best way for you to tell the person perhaps it 's easier to go on a walk and have a catch up with a friend , or it 's easier to have a cup of tea and tell them face to face , perhaps telling them online whatever is best for you it 's important that you try to find a way in which you feel comfortable and at a time when you feel ready generally speaking , people saw the changes mental illness were having on me and thus it was hard to hide on the other hand , for those i managed to keep it quiet from , i managed to have a general catch up with them in person , rather than online or by sitting them down i found it easier to tell them straight away , as excuses only made it harder for me tell them what was really going on i hope these tips have helped everyone is different , so the method you have used may not be on this list if you have used a different method , then please let me know in the comments below take your time perhaps this video may help you best wishes , amy xx
