at the aiim show this week , i talked to a number of consultants and others who told tales of an uptick , recently , in net based cms business one potential buyer wanted to know who the top net players in ecm are there seemed to be a lot of interest , generally , in net based content management i can confirm that one software vendor whose net cms has been around for years has been experiencing strong business in the recession it occurred to me that the much talked about but slow to happen acquisition of sun by ibm , combined with the increasing entropy level around java , may be giving it decisionmakers a bit of stomach acid right now smaller shops with a significant existing investment in microsoft infrastructure seem to see this as a good time to stop thinking in java one consultant told me that a recent customer went with a net system based on the ability to get a usable delpoyment up and running quickly the unspoken sentiment seemed to be who has time for java ee ? bottom line acquisitions are disruptive they put fence sitters back on the fence , and they may others jump in unexpected directions with java , you also have uncertainty around the next edition will there be a java any time soon ? doubtful these are not good things if you 're sun but it 's not a bad environment for microsoft not bad at all
