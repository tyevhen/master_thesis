we are doing staff meeting today where three different beginning patients were each taking a different pain killer and each takes a pill according to the level of consciousness he was on and of the amount of pain he suffered it actually is a diagnostic tool indicating the level of access the patient has to each level of consciousness that is , the kind of pain that can access certain levels of consciousness predominantly , first line pain often calls for a first line blocker , the benzodiazepines such as xanax or atavan or when the pain is based higher up and less severe , second line , we may use zoloft or medication aimed at the limbic system here we use the kind of medication that was used up originally in the initial trauma in the battle against a lesser trauma it needs replenishing and that is the function of feeling level drugs such as zoloft so who gets addicted ? those first liners who are loaded with very early preverbal and often during womb life these first liner may well be compounded by later traumas , neglect and indifference from parents thus , first line pain may not be addicting but when it is combined with infancy and childhood pain may well be addicting that is why having a therapy of feeling may lessen limbic pain enough to wipe away addiction but still leave the tendency in place i liken this to homosexuality where the person is becoming less addicted to male love for men as he relives first line pain and also some of childhood emotional deprivation embedded in his nervous system inside that obsession with male love is terrible need , and that need , unfulfilled , turns into the need for surcease , a temporary drug fix i e , a homosexual affair and or a shot of whiskey or tranquilizer pills for the druggies we can see from this that nearly every obsession has some kind of need behind it that obsession , masking the real need , and it has to go on for a very long time so long as the basic need has not been felt and relived how do i know all this ? because luckily for the past two decades there is research on all this long before the laboratory neurobiologic research , we made the discovery of deeply imprinted pain in our clinical work but it took years to quantify the pain we found biologic equivalents that pointed to when the pain lessened and years later a new field of methylation came along to inform us of how pain got imprinted , and above all , thanks to measuring demethylation , how pain got removed from the neurobiologic system thus we knew how much pain was in the system and where , and then we found out how the pain was extirpated , and where we came onto this because when patients reliving early pain , their drug addiction lessened and after a time it disappeared we saw that there were different levels of primal pain and different nervous systems that imprinted them and then we saw symptoms begin to disappear but not always which led to another discovery that feeling was healing and that the more the patient felt deeper levels , the more severe symptoms left we learned how the connections on deeper levels of brain function were essential to cure and that there is no cure without a complete reliving of the basic need for love and that love has different meaning according to the level were are operating on the need for calm and proper nutrition , the need for a good and drug free birth the need to be touched and caressed , the need to be safe and understood there are many , many more needs and any lack will be marked as pain i mean marked , literally , as pain leaves a mark of methyl that says there is pain and how much as pain is relived there is less pain , indicated by demethylation so we now have a marker for less pain and the resolution of neurosis if the doctor asks you , were you loved as a child ? and you shrug and say , i do not know , now you will know exactly because to be loved means to experience basic need and the body knows even when we were not loved it cries maladies and makes us miserable because something is missing in some cases we are sure it is a man s love or another fix of a powerful painkiller it tells us , watch out ! neurosis has set in thereafter the habit still won t go away until the need is felt completely until it is experienced we can only be partially well and healthy the lack will trail us for a lifetime since every unfelt need prevents full healing we know that feeling equals healing there are no shortcuts biology is not constructed like that it never takes the easy way and neither should we
