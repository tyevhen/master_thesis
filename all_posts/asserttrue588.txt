for the past several months , i 've been privileged to be allowed to test acrobat , which has now been released as the acrobat x family now that i'm finally at liberty to discuss actual features in detail , i can give some impressions of the software overall , the news is good very good the biggest news is that by virtue of a serious ui makeover , acrobat has gotten much easier to use it no longer feels quite so heavy and monolithic adobe has done an excellent job of moving little used commands out of view while putting more frequently used tools and commands in logical places and letting the user configure toolbars as needed there are now only main menus instead of , for example the product has scored a gigantic and much needed usability win , as far as i'm concerned the save as word functionality has undergone a significant , long overdue improvement in quality forms creation editing is easier , thanks to the aforementioned ui overhaul i'm getting things done in fewer clicks now for heavier duty form design tasks , acrobat pro and higher on windows will ship with livecycle designer es i'm of two minds about that on the plus side , livecycle designer offers superior forms creation tools and comes with a nice assortment of prebuilt templates as form designers go , livecycle 's tooling is right up there with the best of the best on the down side , forms you create with livecycle are as before not editable using the standard form design tools of acrobat so you 're stuck either in livecycle designer mode or acrobat native form design mode and livecycle designer makes it very hard to add scripts to form elements i have n't tested the most recent designer , but the version that shipped with acrobat has not proven in my experience , at least to be very stable , and on the whole , i remain somewhat disappointed with the relatively primitive integration between acrobat and livecycle designer the sooner adobe can make livecycle forms compatible with acrobat , the better acrobat x introduces a notion of actions the ability exists to standardize processes in an organization department by combining multiple tasks into a single action that can run on single or multiple files and that can be accessed through a single click users can author a new action through file pdf actions create enterprise customers of acrobat x will no doubt laud the product 's integration with sharepoint you can open files hosted on sharepoint from acrobat or reader 's open dialog by browsing to a mapped drive or a webfolder under my network places when a pdf is opened from sharepoint , you have the ability to independently check that pdf in and out , similar to office , via an option in the file menu sharepoint is accessible from all of acrobat or reader 's open and save dialogs e g , if there s a dialog that prompts you to browse for a file , you can browse to a sharepoint hosted file just like a local file and if there s a dialog that prompts you to save a file , you can save to sharepoint just like you can save to your local drive if the sharepoint system requires that version information be specified when the user checks in a pdf into sharepoint , acrobat reader will prompt the user to provide that information the ability to save search results in pdf and csv file formats is a nice plus , as is the new xlsx export functionality adobe reader has been enhanced with the ability to create sticky notes and highlight text on pdf documents also , the adobe reader browser plug in is now a bit universal plug in which supports safari running either bit default or bit what 's missing from acrobat x ? the javascript api still offers no selection api i blogged about this before also , the net http api remains a disappointment it 's possible to do ajax like asynchronous posts programmatically , in javascript , but only from an application scoped script a so called folder level script , not a document level script and i could n't get http get operations to work at all but overall , my quibbles with acro x are few on the whole , i think it 's the best major new release of acrobat to happen in many years , and customers should be quite happy with it
