today is a gorgeous spring day i'm spending the day one moment at a time i did n't try to get up early to run rather , i allowed myself to sleep in i did n't rush through my morning rather , i allowed the coffee to be slowly taken in i attended one of my favorite , funny , friendly aa meetings then , taking advantage of the caffeine , warmth and sun , i went for my long run fourteen miles today , that was my quest i did that , too , one step at a time although i 'd be a liar if i said it was easy i really pooped out around miles , but i finished , nonetheless ninety moments of napping followed the run i love napping i especially love napping after a long , successful run now , i'm spending moments with my friend bill while bonking at miles i envisioned grilled burgers with all the fixins fortunately , bill is always happy to utilize his grill i supplied the burger and buns , bill the former chef supplied the grill and skill needless to say , i'm full i'm having moments of fullness ! i made a decision to live in the moment today , to stay present , in hopes of quieting this latest bout of fatigue and noise so far , so good my brain 's been quieter and my energy has flowed it was a good decision i 've been present and enjoyed the moments of this day
