my long road back from an extruded l disc , months ago , and back surgery , months ago , got just a bit shorter today i can hardly believe it myself , but i ran today ! on an absolutely gorgeous , crisp , sunny morning , i ran fully weight bearing on my own two feet , for just over minutes , i ran miles it was slow and steady and unbelievable my left leg has gotten stronger my hard work has paid off i'm not back , but i'm on the road a finish line finally appears to be within sight after returning from my run , i texted and e mailed everyone i knew then i sat at my kitchen table , and i cried i ca n't begin to express how relieved and grateful i felt maybe it was fitting this occurred on thanksgiving day , as i 've rarely experienced such gratitude my cautious optimism has developed into a true sense of hope i now feel my return to running is less a matter of if and more a matter of when the missing chunk of my identity will eventually be replaced i feel so fortunate i'm very happy ! the taste of freedom , of running through crisp morning air with jet at my side , leaves me more motivated than ever to continue working hard and pushing my limits i'm satisfied the work i 've already done appears to have paid off i was questioning whether that was true as recently as last week the road has been long , difficult , and frustrating , but perhaps payment of the dividends has begun i'm so , so grateful happy thanksgiving , everyone !
