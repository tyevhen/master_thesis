i thought today 's post should let you know about the up and coming mental health awareness week this year , mental health awareness week is taking place from the th to the th of may with a main focus on anxiety similar to the time to talk day back in february , the aim is to try and raise awareness of mental health next week there will be a range of events to help get rid of the stigma and inform people about the issues surrounding it unfortunately mental health is still somewhat of a taboo and thus we need to raise awareness of it it just so happens that this year the focus is on anxiety , which a very common mental health issue and also what blights my daily life so just like the time to talk day , everyone has the opportunity to help raise awareness there are so many possibilities you could share you story of mental health to someone else , give a presentation to dispel myths , tweet something , raise awareness in your school anything to raise awareness is great and is just what the week aims to do of course , some of you wo n't feel comfortable to talk about your personal experience and that 's fine do n't feel ashamed if you 're not ready after all i'm an anonymous blogger luckily , mental health is slowly gaining more respect and thus hopefully we will one day no longer have to put forward such campaigns but for now , go for it and let 's get the ball rolling and as always , mental health awareness is on every day of the year not just one week make sure to tell as many as you can about this up and coming week and encourage them to take part to banish the stigma you can click here for supporter kits and more information let 's do this ! best wishes , amy xx
