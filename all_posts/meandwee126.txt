hi friends ! i 've been cooking up some ideas over here during these holiday preparations what do you think of this silhouette ? it 's hand painted on a piece of red oak wood x inches square and stained in red cherry i'm going to carve out the back so it can hang flush against the wall i plan to make one of paige and one of noah it 's fun because you could do one of a pet , woodland animal , or one for each member of the family they are very giftable not only for christmas , but for valentine 's day , anniversaries , and birthdays i'm considering offering these for sale custom options for painting whoever you want on there i would do this red cherry option and perhaps others below is another version in a sunwashed stain color gives the wood a gray look i'm also thinking about doing versions in colored wood stains blue , green and yellow options with the white silhouette hand painted on top survey is this something you 'd like ? i still have n't fully decided on whether or not to offer them let me know what you think , i 'd love to hear ! save
