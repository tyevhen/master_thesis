i escaped the inpatient unit yesterday last night was my first night home alone with my dog , jet it 's strange being home because ect destroyed my memory , i feel lost in my own home nothing looks familiar nothing feels familiar i ca n't remember why i'm doing certain things it 's very disconcerting i feel like a stranger in my own home , and it sucks ! tomorrow i'm hoping to get outside and walk a little bit i need to get back to running i'm actually missing the new york city marathon , which is tomorrow i have many friends out in new york who will be running tomorrow i got my plane ticket , hotel room reservation , and was planning to be there , too , but it was not meant to be hopefully , i 'll make the journey next year instead i 'll focus my energy on getting myself back onto the road tomorrow if i can accomplish that , tomorrow will be a very successful day besides running , i 'll also hope to putz around my house a little tomorrow after being away for so many days , i feel the need to be present and accounted for around here
