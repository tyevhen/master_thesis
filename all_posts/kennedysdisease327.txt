the kda forum is a good resource for asking questions , expressing opinions , and finding answers this week a mother , who is a carrier , posted a question concerning her one year old son who might have the defective gene she wanted to know whether she should be taking her son to a doctor familiar with kennedy s disease to make certain she is doing the right thing as a parent to ensure the best care for him as he grows up well , if you know me , you know i have an opinion about most everything that doesn t always mean i am right , but i will at least give you my thoughts my response if there is a benefit in having kd it is that onset will not begin until adulthood it could even be late onset s , s or s a genetics counselor can be helpful in answering your questions please , if you really feel the need to know , first discuss timing and needs with the counselor first for what it is worth , i believe you should wait what difference will knowing have in how you raise your child ? testosterone is the enemy and it will be many years before that kicks into high gear once it has started flowing , it still will not make a difference unless again , unless there is a treatment or cure allow me to share a personal story my son at the age of two was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor he had surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible without causing further damage he then had massive cobalt treatments as parents , we were crushed and all we could see was a child that had a huge horseshoe shaped incision on the side of his head and stitches that looked like frankenstein 's monster do n't get me wrong , he was beautiful to us , but he had been through so much and we were so concerned that they did not get all the tumor when we visited the surgeon for a post op follow up and by the way , we were fortunate to have one of the top ten brain surgeons at the time , i asked how we should treat our son should we put a football helmet on him in case he fell and hit his head ? what happens if he raises up from the floor and smacks his head against the coffee table ? we had a bunch of concerns as most any parent would the surgeon smiled and said , you will do your child a terrible injustice if you do not let him be a kid he needs to run , fall , run some more , play , get hurt , and do all the other things a kid his age would do just let him be a kid ! our son was pronounced cancer free five years later he is now some of the best memories were the times we let him be a kid i hope this story helps what are your thoughts ? there are a lot of parents who are reading this article it would be great if you would share your thoughts on this subject i am just one person and my wife will tell you that i am wrong more times than i am right unfortunately , she is right once again
