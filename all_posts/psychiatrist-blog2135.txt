all from today 's new york times magazine chuck klosterman , in one slice with extra meaning , talks about how he accidently dumped an entire canister of red pepper onto his pizza slice i suppose i just could have ordered another slice instead , i acted as if i had done this on purpose in front of the other pizzaria patrons , he painfully injests the peppered pizza and goes on to say , very often , i do n't know why i do the things that i do it is my assumption that many people feel this way pretty much all the time but whenever you do something especially idiotic , and if your reaction to such an event is especially unreasonable , you 're forced to question a the motivations that drive your behavior and b whether such motives even make sense klosterman could be a patient how many times have we asked patients why they 've done something seeming nonsensical to have them reply i do n't know ? and how many times have we asked the same question of ourselves , only the come up with the exact same answer ? hmmmm , and i 've started a blog because mark edumundson , in freud and the fundamentalist urge talks about freud and hitler and freud 's theories on how tyrants come to power take a drink or two , take a lover , and suddenly the internal conflict in the psyche calms down a divided being becomes a whole , united and temporarily happier one freud had no compunction in calling the relationship that crowds forge with an absolute leader an erotic one and , finally , in a question of resilience , emily bazelon asks if genetics , and specifically the long allele of the httt gene , play a role in contributing to the question of why some people and some rhesus monkeys are more resilient than others in the aftermath of abuse
