i hate having to tell people about pointless studies like the one just published in the new england journal of medicine by the nameless look ahead research group , but unfortunately , it 's the kind of study that will have a lot of people saying see this ? dieting and exercise wo n't make you live longer with the unspoken message so live it up have another big mac , light another camel when your time is up , your time is up in other words , people may leap to the wrong conclusion so let 's look at what was actually found the study followed two groups of obese type diabetics , in the control group and , in the study group for a median period of years the study group was subject to an intensive intervention of diet and exercise consisting of weekly group and individual counseling sessions for the first six months , sessions that occurred with decreasing frequency over the course of the trial not surprisingly , subjects lost a modest amount of weight just under ten kilos in year one , then gained much of the weight back , then lost some of the gainback toward the end of the study but the control group also lost weight over the study period by the end of the period , in fact , the control and study groups differed only in weight the study group ended up at minus the control group , minus both started out with a body mass index of plus or minus for the control group and for the study group and an average weight of kg the major finding of the study was that the death rate among the two groups was not statistically different after years in the control group , people died from cardiovascular causes while in the study group died cardio in the words of the authors in conclusion , our study showed that an intensive lifestyle intervention did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality i have only two comments one is that the study was not sized properly the researchers admit they were banking on seeing an difference between the two groups and so they 'd sized the study with that in mind it seems clear to me that had they been more conservative and aimed for a higher enrollment target , the study 's authors might very well have found statistically significant results as it is , more people died in the control group but the difference was n't statistically significant a second way the study could have been improved would , of course , have been to get serious about weight loss how can you call weekly meetings for six months , in a study lasting ten years an intensive intervention ? how can you call weight loss serious weight loss ? when someone with a bmi of who weighs pounds loses , then gains some of it back , finishing the study at well over pounds , that 's not serious weight reduction , my friend not even close in cardiovascular effects of intensive lifestyle intervention in type diabetes , new england journal of medicine , june , what we have are two groups of obese diabetics , each of which lost an unremarkable amount of weight and each of which suffered casualties at surprise ! just about the same rate , over a ten year period that 's not science , in my book that 's a waste of nih grant money but that 's what passes for science in modern america
