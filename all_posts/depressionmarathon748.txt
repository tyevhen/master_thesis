my brain is broken again it 's been going on for a few days i 've got broken thoughts i 've been dreaming broken dreams my mood is a okay , but my brain is broken the catalyst , i think , was discovering the ex 's kids but i'm not sure about that because the last few days have really been the roughest i'm having strange thoughts , repetitive thoughts , racing thoughts some of them scare me some of them make me feel unsafe some of them are just stupid they 're all annoying they 're all disconcerting i hate writing about this it bothers me to have these thoughts i do n't like to admit to them but maybe this makes sense to some of you maybe some of you do n't like to admit them , too so here i am admitting to my broken brain i'm working with my doc to fix my brain a med we recently decreased may need to be restored to it 's previous level of course i want to take as few meds as possible , but if that 's what i need to do , i 'll do it other than that , i'm trying to stick to my training schedule , work when i need to work , sleep when i need to sleep , and battle with my brain when it gets out of line i'm making it sound easy i wish it was it 's not i hate my broken brain
