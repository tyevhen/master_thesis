yesterday 's post was , i admit , discouraging to say the least to compound my sins i described to my daughter the method i would use if i were to commit suicide while of course promising not to do it such a sick mixed message if my children were n't legally adults i should n't be allowed to be around them happiness is contagious to a degree and so is gloom why they should matter to us so much is what i do n't understand why do we all want to feel good ? is n't this the most basic of hedonisms ? and why does an organism even harbor the expectation of feeling good ? and if feelings are amoral , why do we judge our morality so much on the feeling outcome ? and yet bad feelings are the most painful of experiences , one reason why cutting is popular the distraction of the physical pain is more pleasurable , or less uncomfortable , than an awareness of painful feelings when badly depressed i rejoice in my back pain because it distracts from the holocaust of my heart i have had a couple of thoughts first , if you 're as sick as i am , and i mean really sick , it 's very important to accept yourself as such instead of walloping your pride with the bludgeon of failure my brain is sick it is therefore unreliable and i ought not to listen to it and here why not pursue whatever beauty and truth has traditionally given you joy , even if you are at present incapable of experiencing joy ? surely it must prime the pump to some extent i should try reading eliot and shakespeare and listening to jimi hendrix as for christmas , i had a thought as well what if i was not put here for myself , to pursue my art and interests , but for the sake of others ? christ was not sent here for himself a healthy tenet of a christian faith is the belief that this is true we are gifts to others , not ourselves the less we concern ourselves with our own gifts and the more we concentrate on being gifts to others the sooner we forget our misery in my philosophy , happiness and feeling good are not the purpose of life they can be by products of living a good life still , my actions do n't confirm my beliefs unless you admit i am only trying to feel normal , not happy , which is how i understand it the first mark of goodness is honesty , inseparable from humility to have a sober assessment of oneself is the prerequisite reality check for consciously doing good but how black our hearts are ! as soon as we see ourselves in our place we begin , walter mitty like , to imagine ourselves in a more exalted position as a manic depressive blogging for my own sanity i should have no illusions that what i do is noble i do it to distract myself , to keep my brain from feeding on itself that reminds me of a poem from the archives , let me see , yes how i got published when i think of a fire i know what to grab after my children are safe not my stratocaster whose rosewood fingerboard is spooned between the frets from loving use , nor my irreplaceable pink paisley blazer custom made in the s , but my poems see me run through coiling smoke , cradling manila folders , arm hairs curled like fuses in high school my writing teacher whose silver brown wig stuck to her head like a frozen salad screamed at me you will never be a poet , mr chaffin ! shame stole my voice and made my purple acne blaze so even the girl i loved in secret looked away in college one professor called my poems a confused blur of images and was probably right , though i comforted myself that he was gay and taught restoration literature after my fourth trip to the bughouse i started writing poems to feed my mind something besides itself afterwards , just as new drugs began to lift my suicidal melancholy , i was published de published by the cortland review madness can be made into art and art into madness to think we are all driven by a desire for good feelings , how very simple ! too bad that for some , good feelings only come at the expense of others kilorats , dr chaffin
