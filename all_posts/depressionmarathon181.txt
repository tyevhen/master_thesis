with the events of paris fresh in my brain , i went for my walk run this morning it was an absolutely gorgeous morning for jet and i , sunny and degrees , and i found myself contemplating my good fortune as we walked and ran a mile loop within my small city , i had the opportunity to run on paved , tree lined bike paths , alongside a gently flowing river , and up and down quiet streets in peaceful neighborhoods it was surreal in comparison to what i had just viewed , for the third straight morning , on my television screen at home and that 's all i'm going to say about that i 've got nothing else i just felt grateful another opportunity for gratitude and perspective shortly followed the end of my walk run my friend , joan , and i went to visit my former sponsor friend in a local nursing home km is on hospice , which means this once vibrant , intelligent , strong woman , now only in her early 's , is very near the end of her life she has a brain tumor joan and i sat with her at her bedside and then joan fed her lunch while i held km 's hand i do n't know if she understood who we were or even that we were there it did n't matter km held my hand throughout most of my first years of sobriety she was my teacher and role model i pass her teachings on to others in recovery i guess that 's the only way i can repay her it was difficult and sad to see her today i may not see her alive again that 's reality cruel reality my life , my health , my struggles it does n't compare i am very fortunate i'm feeling fortunate , too , to be back to regular employment i survived my last four days , which included three , hour work days as i reported in my last post , i was a little anxious going into this schedule i had n't worked that much , or that long , for months it went well worries about forgetting paperwork requirements , inefficiency , and rustiness with patients were largely unfounded i did get fatigued , but i was able to push through and even kept up with some exercise i'm still a little anxious about maintaining the regular schedule going forward , but i'm feeling more hopeful hope is a nice feeling it 's been awhile hope and gratitude are with me today whether it 's half a world away or right here in my back yard , there is much to remind me of just how fortunate i really am i just have to look and notice carry on , my friends
