yesterday i wrote about the geography of colorectal cancer crc and showed a map of crc mortality in the u s the striking thing about the map was is that crc is much more of a problem in the northern states than in the southern states it turns out this is not an anomaly and in no way limited to the u s colorectal cancer tracks latitude , worldwide the further you live from the equator , the greater your chances of dying of colorectal cancer the above graph comes from a paper by mohr et al no longer online but see the paper by cuomo , mohr , et al that correlates cloud cover and distance from the equator with cancer rates in countries it shows quite clearly that colorectal cancer incidence varies with latitude the countries with the lowest crc rates are near zero degrees latitude the equator this effect does n't just apply to colorectal cancer , though it also applies to breast cancer breast cancer and colorectal cancer are distinctly different cancers , so in order for these graphs to be as similar as they are , there must be a common denominator of extremely broad applicability underlying the latitude trend it turns out the common denominator is vitamin d i 'll spare you the book length treatment suffice it for now to say more than , research studies have been published in biomedical journals investigating the inverse association between vitamin d , its metabolites , and cancer , including almost epidemiological studies for a good overview , i recommend the review article by garland et al you might notice as i did a certain amount of hesitancy on the part of big name researchers to come right out and pronounce vitamin d a bonafide cancer preventive agent , due to the relative dearth of prospective intervention based randomized controlled trials one intervention study worth reading is the trial by lappe et al in am j clin nutr after the caret disaster , no one wants to get caught recommending a vitamin regimen based on epidemiological happy talk , and i can understand that nevertheless , i think the weight of the evidence in favor of vitamin d , at this point , is substantial enough and any down side negligible enough that people should start thinking about taking substantial amounts of vitamin d as prophylaxis against cancers of all kinds not just crc and breast my advice is read the literature and decide for yourself do n't wait for fda , cdc , the national cancer institute , or anyone else to give you the green light on this one they 've got their own agendas to worry about
