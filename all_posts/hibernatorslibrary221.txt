this post will discuss the psychological causes and treatments of mental illness , as described in butcher 's abnormal psychology psychological viewpoints consider humans not only as biological entities but as products of our personalities and experiences there are three major psychosocial views on behavior psychodaynamic , behavioral , and cognitive behavioral they psychoanalytical school was founded by sigmund freud , as described in my summary of chapter freud structured personality into three elements id , ego , and superego the id is the individual 's instinctive drives , and is the first element to develop in infancy it is separated into life instincts such as libido and death instincts such as aggression the id can generate wish fulfilling fantasies but cannot undertake any actions to meet these desires the superego develops later in childhood , and basically comprises the conscience after a few months of life , the ego develops the ego mediates between the demands of the id , the urging of the superego , and the realistic constraints of the world for instance , during toilet training , the id tells the child that he needs to go poo , the superego urges the child not to go poo in his mother 's bed because she is annoying , and the ego takes these two drives and determines the right place and time to go poo sometimes these three drives can come into conflict because they are striving for different goals these intrapsychic conflicts can cause mental illness freud also described a set of psychosexual stages , which you can read about on wikipedia i do not put much credence in the psychosexual stages , so i will skip them in my summary later , a few psychoanalysts branched off from freud with the interpersonal perspective alfred adler focused on social and cultural forces instead of instincts in adler 's view , humans are social beings , and we are driven to interact effectively with other members of our group erich fromm focused on the dispositions of people , and how that affected their interactions with other members of society despite the current unpopularity of freud 's psychosexual stages and gender prejudices , freud is considered the father of psychoanalysis he developed the groundwork for further psychotherapy he showed that certain maladaptive behaviors develop as a result of an attempt to cope with difficult problems he also laid the foundation for the study of unconscious motives of maladaptive behaviors another psychological approach to treatment of mental illness is the behavioral perspective it is described in my summary of chapter in addition to pavlov 's classical conditioning and skinner 's operant conditioning , we can also learn by observation for instance , my sister apparently developed a fear of insects only after seeing a friend respond very negatively to an insect that my sister had collected in a jar behavior theory was not well received by psychoanalysts , but it provided several important views of the causes of mental illness it suggested that maladaptive behaviors develop when a person fails to learn the adaptive behaviors , or when he learns maladaptive solutions the third psychological viewpoint is my favorite the cognitive behavioral perspective albert bandura developed an early form of cognitive behavioral theory when he suggested that people learn by internal reinforcement rather than external reinforcement we choose to perform a difficult task because we can visualize the negative outcomes of not performing that task for instance , i'm writing this blog post despite the fact that i'm so tired my eyes are blurring over and i'm not sure my sentences make sense because i can envision the negative consequence of doing poorly on my upcoming exam today , cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how distorted perspectives can influence maladaptive behaviors for instance , if i'm walking down the street , and i see a friend getting on a bus i wave at that friend , and he does n't wave back i might have the distorted perspective that the friend hates me , and i might consequently be rude or abusive to that friend the maladaptive cognitive process is called assimilation , where i gather new information the friend did n't wave at me and distort it to fit my existing self schema nobody likes me the adaptive cognitive process that our therapists attempt to elicit is accommodation , in which we change our existing frameworks to incorporate new information that does n't fit in this case , my self schema might be nobody likes me , but for some reason i 've been asked out to prom instead of distorting the friendly behavior he 's only asking me to prom so that he can dump pig 's blood on me in a highly public setting , the therapist encourages me to accommodate the information he might actually like me chapter finished its description of the psychological causes of mental illness by describing some of the events that can lead to a predisposition to mental illness it discussed early deprivation or trauma , inadequate parenting styles , marital discord and divorce , and maladaptive peer relationships i found this section interesting since i 've just finished reviewing the blank slate , by stephen pinker , which discussed pinker 's views of the relative influences of parenting styles verses peer relationships on a child 's behavior pinker claimed that parenting style had much less to do with the child 's ability to adapt than peer influences did he implied that the reason we do n't accept that peers have a greater impact than parents is because parents do n't want to think that all the love they 're pouring into their child does n't matter he also points out that such a worry is silly , since we 'd never say that all the love we 're pouring into our spouses does n't matter butcher 's text , on the other hand , spent a lot of space discussing the different parenting approaches authoritative , authoritarian , permissive indulgent , and neglectful uninvolved and their effects on child development despite pinker 's strong arguments , i'm still convinced that parents have just as much impact on a child 's development as his peers this is a series of posts summarizing what i'm learning in my abnormal psychology course much of the information provided comes from reading my james n butcher
