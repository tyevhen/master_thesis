rest is something the world seems to be in desperate need of , yet many would say it is illusive it is for good reason that the theme of rest is a consistent thread throughout the biblical scriptures and we find the idea is indeed introduced in genesis in the beginning , and continues until the last book , revelation the sabbath signifies entering god s rest , yet ironically and sadly , many contentions and arguments have surrounded the symbol of rest , ultimately causing much strife and unrest among believers my intention here is to review the scriptural references to the sabbath , with the hope that the journey will illuminate the role and purpose of the sabbath as reflected in the biblical witness the first mention of instructions concerning the sabbath command was in the text of exodus he moses said to them , this is what the lord commanded tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest , a holy sabbath to the lord so bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil save whatever is left and keep it until morning exod the instructions were given to the israelites shortly after their deliverance out of the land of their captivity they were to learn to cease from their labour on the seventh day , and to dedicate this day to worship there are two defining aspects of the sabbath , first there is a ceasing from usual labour , and a dedicating the day holy to the lord we get a glimpse in exodus that the sabbath is ushering the people s release from captivity and their freedom to worship god as he intended cf leviticus on the sabbath year of jubilee when all debts are cancelled and slaves set free the sabbath is undoubtedly central to the law given through moses and thus central to worship the instructions regarding this day become one of the ten commandments or words in the hebrew the sabbath , the day of sacred assembly is the first of the appointed observances outlined in leviticus it is it is envisaged as a day of joy isa also signified by the prohibition of fasting or outward expressions of mourning moreover , every festival seems to culminate or revolve around a day of sabbath rest for instance , the day of atonement , the day signifying cleansing from sin was to be a sabbath rest lev leviticus is another reiteration of the words given to the community of god and you must observe my sabbaths i am the lord your god v observe my sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary i am the lord v and finally , the year of jubilee comes after seven sabbath years this is the wonderful time where all the debts are cancelled , the slaves are set free and the people would return to their land lev although the concept of the sabbath is introduced in exodus , it is firmly grounded in the opening passages of scripture , in genesis , in the beginning observing the sabbath is fashioned after the example set by god resting on the seventh day after the creation days remember the sabbath day by keeping it holy six days you shall labour and do all your work , but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work , neither you , nor your son or daughter , nor your male or female servant , nor your animals , nor any foreigner residing in your towns for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them , but he rested on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy exod see also exod seventh day observance is essentially an identification with god as lord and creator as mankind are made in his image , they follow his example , not only in creative activities by ruling over creation , but also in resting thus the sabbath was to be an acknowledgement of god as creator and sustainer of his world the sabbath was to be a sign of the covenant between the lord and his people a sign between me and you for generations to come exod , a reminder of their identity as god s liberated people thus a continual testimony of keeping the covenant the israelites are to observe the sabbath , celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant it will be a sign between me and the israelites forever , for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth , and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed exod , a many have argued based on this that the sabbath is for the israelites alone , serving as a sign of their covenant with the lord whilst the significance of the sabbath as a sign of the mosaic covenant is undisputed , there seems to be a deeper underlying spiritual principle in effect the sabbath extends to bless and protect and form a sanctuary for the foreigner , the slave , the animal and even the land six days do your work , but on the seventh day do not work , so that your ox and your donkey may rest , and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed exod see also exod , deut not only are the people to observe a sabbath rest , but also the land the lord said to moses at mount sinai , speak to the israelites and say to them when you enter the land i am going to give you , the land itself must observe a sabbath to the lord lev the land is to have a year of rest v the land was to enjoy its sabbath rest as decreed by the lord and if the people neglected this command , the lord would secure it in chronicles the people are taken captive for disobedience and the land rests there are a number of references of the sabbath and the sanctuary as two provisions and side by side patterns for worship lev observe my sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary i am the lord lev ezekiel later links the defilement of the sanctuary and the desecration of the sabbath eze just as the sanctuary miqdas was a holy place space for worship , the sabbath was a holy time for worship keeping and breaking the sabbath during pre exilic periods , the kingdom enjoyed blessings ushered and associated with sabbath observance this was signified by the involvement of the levites in sabbath duties such as the burnt offerings both david and solomon firmly established their reign upon honouring the sabbath chron , chron later neglect of the sabbath brought judgement neh and conversely , at times of restoration , the sabbath observance becomes the bedrock of renewed relationship with god nehemiah acknowledges before the lord that the sabbaths would be again observed and he acts to protect its sanctity the same message is echoed by the prophet isaiah whichever historical context you place the last chapters of isaiah in , true sabbath keeping becomes the image of restoration for god s people blessed is the one who does this the person who holds it fast , who keeps the sabbath without desecrating it , and keeps their hands from doing any evil isa and foreigners who bind themselves to the lord to minister to him , to love the name of the lord , and to be his servants , all who keep the sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant isa if you keep your feet from breaking the sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day , if you call the sabbath a delight and the lord s holy day honourable , and if you honour it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words isa the book ends with a vision of the new heavens and the new earth when true worship will be restored from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another , all mankind will come and bow down before me , says the lord isa the message on the sabbath is the same in jeremiah s time god s people will prosper and enjoy the blessings of their god if they keep the sabbath holy as he instructed , but like the preceding generations , they will forsake their security if they neglect the sabbath jer ezekiel reiterates this picture that a desecrated sabbath and the rejection of god s decrees and laws , ultimately leads to estrangement and suffering ezek , , her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things they do not distinguish between the holy and the common they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my sabbaths , so that i am profaned among them ezek later , the prophet provides once again a picture of renewed relationship with the honouring of the sabbath on the sabbaths and new moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the lord at the entrance of that gateway ezek the prophet amos points to israel s unwillingness to enter the true rest of the sabbath , instead personal gain was had become a focus for the people amos thus a clear relationship is established between sabbath keeping and blessings , and conversely between desecrating the sabbath and judgement if one was neglecting the sabbath and not ceasing from striving and work it meant that their eyes were fixed on themselves rather that on their creator and sustainer at the heart of the sabbath is a complete reliance on god , the one who always provides and forsaking all self reliance it confesses trust in the lord of the sabbath resting in his sanctuary the sabbath is entry into relationship and surrendering time and attention to the one who is worthy of it loss of sabbath is essentially a loss of relationship loss of sabbath is a sign of a broken relationship , a broken covenant the following article will consider the sabbath in the messianic age
