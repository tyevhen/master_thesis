greece pm alexis tsipras has a problem the greek people are going to vote yes on the referendum greek atm line on saturday , june early polls show greeks supporting a deal with creditors a survey by alco polling institute , published in sunday 's edition of the proto thema newspaper , found of , respondents say yes to a deal with creditors , while say no another poll , by kapa research , finds of respondents in favor of an accord , against it 's early , of course tsipras has time to change people 's minds but he has not done a good job , so far , of explaining what a no vote is for yannis koutsomitis yannikouts as long as tsipras does not explain consequences of 'no' votes , he sends majority of voters to 'yes' yes is austerity , no is what ? am jun , people are talking about this twitter ads info and privacy alexis tsipras tsipras eu many are asking what happens after the referendum ? with a clear no , we will have a much stronger negotiating position greece vouli am jun , , people are talking about this twitter ads info and privacy sadly , tsipras is portraying a no vote as merely a tool for achieving a better bargaining posture which , of course , assumes that the creditors will still want to play kick the can with him they might not in essence , he 's saying vote no , and i will have thicker boots with which to kick the can ! tsipras has created a huge sense of drama with the referendum as a leader , he needs to rise to the occasion now , with a dramatic , believable , concrete vision of how greece can get itself out of its current mess and a plan b for moving ahead without the creditors' help , should it come to that tsipras needs to articulate a set of talking points that will be put in front of the creditors demands , if you will not only practical demands based on sound economics , historical precedent , and international law , but moral demands based on basic fairness and humanitarian concerns he could cite the numerous concessions that were made to west germany by creditor nations in , when the germans were allowed extremely lenient terms for repaying its marshall plan debts debts that were mostly forgiven , ultimately he could ask for a six month moratorium on payments and time to implement key reforms to give the greek economy a chance to recover at least a little bit before plunging back into an aggressive repayment schedule he could insist on various other forms of consideration as well , including maturity extensions , interest reductions , and outright debt forgiveness all of which were offered to and taken advantage of by germany in he needs to remind the germans of where they 've been , how they got to where they are what kinds of treatment they got when they were behind the ball he needs to guilt them into doing the right thing as a leftist politician , tsipras also needs to come up with a plan for taxing the rich with a wealth tax and a more progressive income tax total private wealth in greece is almost a trillion euros greece owes billion euros in debt payments next year a very small tax on greek wealth would make a huge dent in the latter figure the creditors have not been terribly flexible let 's not mince words they 've been dismissive , rigid , and thuglike therefore , tsipras needs to have the greek people 's support for a set of fallback options , in case things do n't go well tsipras has spoken many times of red lines that ca n't be crossed but his last proposal was sent back to him , you may recall , with copious red ink edits , mocking his red lines metaphor tsipras needs to know that the greek people will support him if the creditors must be persuaded the hard way of greece 's need for flexibility greece may need to suspend payments enter into default proactively , as argentina did in this worsened argentina 's problems initially , but led to average gdp growth of per year from to tsipras should explain to the greek people that default is a possibility , if things go wrong he should be honest about this possibility tsipras has only a few days to do an amazing sell job he needs to get busy as things are , if the referendum is held today , the people are voting yes yes to staying in the eurozone , but at a horrible cost if the referendum comes to pass , and people vote yes and tsipras does n't resign in shame , extremely harsh , regressive austerity measures will be imposed there 'll be protests in the streets the current government will get a no confidence vote interest on debt will become even more crushing , and the cycle of despair will continue , until there 's an involuntary default , for real tsipras has only one chance to get this right here 's hoping he can do it please retweet this post with the greece hashtag ! many thanks to the great folks who retweeted me yesterday have you added your name to our mailing list ?
