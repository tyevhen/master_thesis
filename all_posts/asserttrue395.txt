funny how the availability of so much free dna data can go to your head when i learned that dna sequence data for more than , mitochondrial genomes could be accessed , free , at genomevolution org , i could n't resist i wrote some scripts that checked the dna composition of , mtdna mitochondrial dna sequences what i found blew me away if you 're a biologist , you 're accustomed to thinking of genome g c guanine plus cytosine content as a kind of phylogenetic signature related organisms usually have g c values that are fairly close to one another for purposes of the following discussion , i'm going to reference a t content , which is , of course , just one minus gc a gc content of , or , means the at content is , or what i learned is that mitochondrial dna shows strand asymmetry in coding regions regions that actually get transcribed to rna , as opposed to non coding control regions and junk dna in particular , it shows an excess of pyrimidines t and c on the message strand this is the exact opposite of the situation in archaea and bacteria , where message strands tend to accumulate purines g and a the interesting thing is , just like bacteria and archaea , mitochondrial genomes tend to show a steady , predictable rate of increase of purines on the message strand with increasing a t , even though purines are outnumbered by pyrimidines on the message strand a picture might make this clearer purine a g content versus a t for the message strand of mitochondrial dna coding regions n every point in this graph represents a mitochondrial genome , in all as you can see , the regression line which minimizes the sum of squared error is upward sloping , with a rise of , meaning that for every increase in genome a t content , there 's a corresponding increase in message strand purine a g content what 's striking about this is that in a similar graph for , bacterial genomes see this post , the regression line slope turned out to be chargaff 's second parity law predicts a straight horizontal line at y obviously that law is kaput i 've written before about my repeated finding in bacteria , archaea , eukaryotes , viruses , bacteriophage basically every place i look that message strand purine content accumulates in proportion to genome a t content strand asymmetry with respect to purines and pyrimidines seems to be universal but why ? strand asymmetric buildup of purines or pyrimidines is very hard to explain without invoking either a theory of strand asymmetric dna repair or a theory of strand asymmetric mutagenesis , or both is it reasonable to suppose that one strand of dna is more vulnerable to mutagenesis than another ? yes , if you accept that in a growing cell , the strands spend a good portion of their time apart during transcription and replication neither replication nor transcription is symmetric in implementation i 'll spare you the details for the replication side of the argument , but suffice it to say , replication related asymmetries are not likely in my opinion to be behind the purine pyrminidine strand asymmetries i 've been documenting what we 're seeing , i think , is the result of asymmetric repair at transcription time during transcription , a gene 's dna strands are separated one strand is used as a template by rna polymerase to create messenger rna and ribosomal rna the other strand is free and floppy and vulnerable to attack by mutagens but it 's also readily accessible to repair enzymes the above diagram oversimplifies things considerably , but i include it for the benefit of non biogeeks who might want to follow this argument through note that dna strands have directionality the sugar bonds face one way in one strand and the other way in the other strand this is denoted by the so called ' to' orientation of strands rnap rna polymerase dna repair is a complex subject be assured , every cell , of every kind , has dozens of different kinds of enzymes devoted to dna repair without these enzymes , life as we know it would end , because dna is constantly undergoing attack and requiring repair the ogg family of dna base excision enzymes exhibit a signature helix hairpin helix topology hhh see faucher et al , int j mol sci some types of repair take place in double stranded dna that is , dna that is not undergoing replication or transcription other types of repair apply to single stranded dna in bacteria as well as higher life forms , there 's a transcription coupled repair system tcrs that comes into play when rna polymerase is stalled by thymine dimers or other dna damage this remarkably elaborate system changes out short sections of damaged dna at considerable energy cost because it involves replacing whole nucleotides sugar and all , it 's categorized as a nucleotide execision repair system ner the alternative to ner is base excision repair ber , which is where a defective base usually an oxidized guanine gets snipped out without removing any sugars from the dna backbone the enzymes that perform this base clipping are generically known as glycosylases for many years , it was thought that mitochondria did not have dna repair systems we now know that 's not true mitochondrial dna is subject to constant oxidative attack and it turns out the damage is quickly repaired , in double stranded dna evidence for repair of single stranded mtdna is scant those who have looked for a transcription coupled repair system or indeed any ner system in mitochondria have not found one mitochondrial ber repair via ogg does exist , but it seems to operate when the dna is double stranded , not during transcription this makes sense , because for ber to finish , the strand must be nicked by ap endonuclease after the bad base is popped out , then the repair proceeds by matching the opposing base opposite the abasic site using the other strand as template in clostridia and archaea which have an ogg enzyme that other bacteria do not have see this post and this paper , ogg can pop out a bad base while the dna is single stranded ogg then binds to the abasic site and is only released by ap endonuclease when it arrives later on bottom line , we know that mitochondrial dna spends much of its time in the unwound state because mtdna products are very highly transcribed and that the non transcribed dna strand is extremely vulnerable to oxidative attack the template strand is less vulnerable , because it is cloaked in enzymes rna polymerase , transcription factors , ribosomes , etc we also know that oxoguanine is the most prevalent form of oxidative damage in mtdna and that , uncorrected , such damage leads to g to t transversion the finding of consistently high pyrimidine content in the message strand of mitochondrial dna see graph further above is consistent with a slower rate of repair of the non transcribed strand , and the differential occurrence of g to t transversions on that strand or at least , that 's a possible explanation of the pyrimidine richness of the message strand of mtdna but there are additional factors to consider , such as selection pressure mitochondrial dna tends to encode membrane associated proteins , and membrane proteins use nonpolar amino acids , which are in turn predominantly encoded by pyrimidine rich codons more about this in an upcoming post
