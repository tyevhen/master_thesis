people often start psychotherapy to overcome trauma that keeps them stuck and in emotional pain my experience , as a psychotherapist in private practice in nyc , is that emdr is a safe and effective form of therapy for trauma when practiced by a licensed , skilled emdr therapist getting into relationships with romantic partners who keep hurting you there are many situations that cause people to get retraumatized in their lives one of them is when people keep getting into relationships with romantic partners who hurt them why does this keep happening to certain people over and over again ? is it just bad luck or is there something deeper going on ? getting into relationships with people who keep hurting you of course , every situation is different , but it 's often true that when someone keeps getting into relationships with people who cause them emotional pain , they 're unconsciously repeating an old pattern from their childhood this phenomenon usually involves unresolved childhood trauma that keeps getting repeated in one relationship after the next it 's usually hard to see this phenomenon on your own and it 's even harder to try to change it by yourself without help from a skilled psychotherapist let 's take a look at a fictionalized example , which is a composite of many different psychotherapy cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality susan by the time susan came to therapy , she was at her wit 's end her two year relationship with sam was falling apart , and she came to our psychotherapy consultation hoping she could find out what she was doing wrong so she could save her relationship originally , susan wanted to attend couples counseling , but sam wanted no part of this he came to the consultation because she begged him to , but he made it clear that he was n't interested in couples counseling in fact , minutes into the consultation , he dropped a bomb by telling susan that he wanted out and he was waiting until our appointment to let her know so that susan would have a place to deal with the emotional aftermath of their breakup and , having said that , sam stood up , gave susan back her apartment keys and left the session , leaving susan in tears i wish i could say that this is very unusual during a consultation but , unfortunately , this was n't the first time that two people came in to talk about their relationship where one person used the session to bail out after i helped susan to calm down , she said that , although she was surprised , this was n't totally out of character for sam , and he had a way of bailing out when the going got tough their dynamic would be that she would pursue him when he left and take all the blame for their relationship not working apparently , sam never had to take any responsibility they just resumed their relationship with susan walking on eggshells , hoping that sam would n't leave again when this happened during the consultation , susan wanted to pursue sam again , but she agreed to stay to talk about what happened they reconciled after susan 's first session but during the next month , sam was in and out of their relationship on a weekly basis whenever things got tense susan was working in therapy to change her behavior so that she was n't continually graveling before sam in our therapy sessions , she began to realize , for the first time , how awful she was being treated by sam she also became exhausted with their on again off again relationship until , finally , she decided that she just could n't do it any more , and she allowed him to leave without pursuing him again without the chaos , we were able to explore how this dynamic , which went on in her prior romantic relationships , was a recreation of her relationship with her father , who was a cold distant man he would manipulate susan 's mother and susan by constantly threatening to leave the family when he did n't get his way this resulted in susan 's mother allowing him to use the family savings for very risky business ventures which usually failed and left the family on the brink of financial disaster susan 's mother was so afraid of the father abandoning her and susan that she would give in to his outlandish schemes susan grew up to be an anxious child who had nightmares of her father leaving her stranded in the middle of nowhere she was so afraid of being abandoned by her father that , even at the young age of five , she would take on the blame for whatever her father was angry about children at that age often blame themselves for their parents' problems , and susan was no exception the problem was that there was no one to tell her that she was n't to blame her mother was too overwhelmed and preoccupied with accommodating the father , so she was n't emotionally available to comfort susan and susan 's father was too narcissistic to feel any empathy for susan he was mostly concerned about getting his way so , when susan began dating , she continually chose men who were like her father because these men were familiar it was also her way , in an unconscious effort , to try to have a different outcome than what she experienced as a child in other words , she was still trying to be the good girl in her relationship who would be so good , kind and accommodating that her boyfriend would love her and never leave her except it never worked out that way because these men were too self involved and did n't have the capacity to be part of a loving relationship so , these relationships did n't end well when susan was able to see that she was repeating the same pattern over and over again , it was an eye opening experience for her but she felt it would be impossible for her to change we began talking about emdr , a trauma therapy that was developed by francine shapiro , ph d and she agreed to try it after spending several sessions developing internal resources and coping skills , we began our emdr work on the current situation but focusing more on the older trauma that was getting emotionally triggered in susan 's relationships as an adult emdr is a safe and effective form of trauma therapy that helps restore your sense of self as we worked through her emotional trauma , susan began to feel more confident and less burdened by her traumatic past with emdr , she was able to work through the current and prior trauma so she was free of her traumatic past emdr emdr , which stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is n't magical but i have found it to be one of the most effective forms of trauma therapy much more effective than regular talk therapy many of the clients that come to see me for psychotherapy have had a lot of talk therapy and they have developed intellectual insight into their problems but they have n't healed and they continue to be affected by their trauma getting help if you have unresolved trauma that keeps you stuck and in emotional pain , you owe it to yourself to get help from a
