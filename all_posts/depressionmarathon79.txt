for as long as i 've had depression , that 's years , this illness still has the power to amaze i ca n't imagine hurting much more than i hurt right now i ca n't imagine suffering more hopelessness , emptiness , desperation or despair i'm barely muddling through each day with a foggy brain and sluggish body everyday tasks are now monumental chores i feel isolated and alone my world is awash in shades of gray gray is hard gray is unforgiving gray hurts
