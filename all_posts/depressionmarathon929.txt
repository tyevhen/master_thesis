with a temp of degrees and wind gusting up to mph , running my planned k this morning was suddenly not very appealing of course my leg hurt , and i'm still having my morose mood moments , too taken all together , it would have been much easier to stay in bed however , i needed to run if i wanted any chance of placing in my track club 's grand prix series today 's race was the last chance to earn points at the start of the day , there were three of us within three points of each other at the top of our age group i knew both of those women would run , so being the competitive spirit that i am , i got out of bed and ran , too competition is funny i love it and hate it it 's not like i felt overly stressed , yet i had thoughts of quitting even before the gun went off perhaps my fear of failing is stronger than my joy of competing or winning that 's likely and that 's why i felt it was important for me to stay , to run , to race to conquer that stupid fear ! i really have nothing to be afraid of there 's no contentious rivalry between any of us i love and enjoy the other women with whom i compete you might even call us friends in fact , after the race we hung out , laughed and socialized for a couple hours ! it was really nice the race , on the other hand , was less than nice it was cold and hard the wind really took it 's toll as one of my fellow racer 's noted , the wind was another competitor today we really had to fight against it the course was also hilly , with the largest and longest hills coming right at the end and into the wind not nice despite those challenges , i raced well i wanted to go out fast , and i did i ran a first mile and hung around a pace through mile four miles and , like i said , were either uphill , directly into the wind , or both my split times pointedly reflect that fact mile five took me , and i ran an sixth mile while exerting the same effort it took to run earlier ! i finished in , fifth overall and second in my age group i felt really good about my effort and about conquering my fear in the end , as usual , i'm glad i went only two weeks until marathon day
