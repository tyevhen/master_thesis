happy holidays to everyone ! personally , i celebrate christmas as my seasonal holiday , and it happens to be christmas , so merry christmas to all ! i had a pretty average week here leading up to christmas nothing exciting to report except that i went to dinner with my parents and boyfriend last night steak ! and then he and i went to rogue one which was awesome and later today i will be headed out to celebrate christmas with my boyfriend 's family but first christmas mass with my parents it 's a freezing drizzly christmas here , with wind and rain all day long , followed by snow on monday lovely driving weather for me , my sister , and my nephew who are planning on going up north to a lodge tomorrow to celebrate her th birthday hopefully everything will work out as planned ! currently reading same books as last week but i'm nearing the end of two of them completed it 's been an uneventful week for reading , so i have n't actually completed anything to report this week acquired i have n't opened all my presents yet , so this is n't my complete christmas haul i managed to get free copies of trevor noah 's born a crime and ralph ellison 's invisible man from audible and a friend on librarything sent me two books i had n't heard of before the hakawati , by rabith alameddine and binti , by nnedi okorafor i 'll report the rest of my christmas haul next week
