i'm headed off for vacation for a long weekend in my family , we love vacation , but we hate planning it it 's a funny problem we 've left the country on as little as days notice before and this past summer we switched our plans from montreal to san francisco on the monday before we left oh , and we 're taking vacation now because we never did get our act together to go anywhere over the holidays , but that 's okay because the day we were supposed to leave , we woke up to inches of snow and we would n't have gotten there , where ever there might have been , anyway so i'm writing a blog post when i should be packing hours before departure , i asked my husband if they speak english where we 're going and he asked me if we can use american dollars and off to google we went yes and yes he 's confident he 'll be able to watch the ravens' playoff game which is good one of the reasons we had so much trouble organizing ourselves over the holidays was that he had ravens' tickets and there was a push of resistance against leaving town arg ! blogger wo n't let me put a photo in ! oh , and please do encourage clink to get a puppy roy and clinkshrink will hold the fort see you next week !
