as i have written maintes reprises , many times over , we respond primarily and firstly to apparent problems in the present , and later to inner links that are awakened by those current problems , such as job losses or divorces those repressed traumas are ready to fire and when those links fire together they become wired together , solidified that is the process i call resonance the body and brain are busy reacting to what happened decades earlier during womb life and birth those are the events we continually react to because of their remoteness , something that occurred when we were vulnerable and easily and heavily impacted this is not only my hypothesis within the past years , there have been literally hundreds of studies verifying the importance of early imprints , how they last a lifetime and alter our systems imprints lay down engraved memories that show themselves when we are alone , in a weakened state or otherwise too open to events that is what i believe may have happened to l wren scott in those moments alone before she took her life she must have had an inkling , a deep down unease and hopeless feeling that would have warned her it was all hidden inside her , pushing through her weakened defense layers and making her feel so hopeless and down , despite her current surroundings being alone for a short time can set it off it can first set off , i am all alone and no one to hold and comfort me just a few hours alone with no one nearby can do it remember , small things can set off huge feelings if she were left alone and neglected by her parents very early on , the connection to despair of the past it becomes clear she probably had no idea about imprints or deep lying trauma memory that is the reason our theory is so important , so that people who are suffering can be aware of what is going on inside and understand where their despair and suicidal thoughts come from this may avoid needless deaths how tragic and unnecessary all this and now you understand our mission not money nor fame , but the lives of us humans we all have a basic right to a full length life the way in is the way out you may wonder why a privileged and wealthy celebrity can t find distractions for her despair why doesn t she run away or go to parties and take her mind off of it ? she cannot the imprint confines her she lives within that primordial memory and cannot imagine or think about other solutions there were no alternatives originally , thus there are none now while awash in the imprint and the imprint forces her to remain on the same route all over again her hopelessness depression is all consuming she cannot stray outside its bounds the stabs of depression she suffers are reminders of the mounting memory that periodically surges upwardly toward awareness there is no way to know now exactly why she killed herself but a clue to her motive can be found post mortem , in the manner in which she chose to kill herself scott had just about everything in life although she was in debt , she lived well and lived high with jagger yet she took the trouble to go through the machinations of hanging why not take the simpler way out , with pills ? though some will find this hard to believe , the answer goes back to the very beginning of life the way in is often the way out the same imprint that produced deep hopelessness at birth the root of depression is also what likely led to her to choose hanging i am not familiar with the circumstances of scott s death , but i am not limiting my discussion only to her this applies to all of us the fact of the deep imprint also can lead to hanging for if she were strangling on the cord she is most likely to repeat the act it was the closest she came to death and the trauma and its consequences remain fifty years ago , i wrote about methods of suicide and i noted that they followed the deep imprint being strangled on the cord would lead to hanging being suffocated in the womb might lead to gassing oneself being mangled at birth might end in jumping off a building or in front of a train a mother drugging herself might be duplicated in suicide by an overdose of pain killers in the offspring thus , the imprint , now embedded , searches out its duplicate , like most act outs and act outs follow the imprint closely because there is a sense of approaching death early on , and it follows by approaching death now , where death is the final relief from this catastrophic imprint that is also an imprinted memory final relief it is the final denouement of the imprint recent research has confirmed the link between the nature of trauma at birth and the manner of suicide chosen in adulthood in a study published in the journal biology of the neonate , k j s anand and associates state that in a number of suicides by violent means the significant risk factors were those perinatal events that were likely to cause pain in the newborn anand scalzo , in other words , suicides will often choose a method that reflects the prototype of their birth experiences why ? because each prototype requires its own conclusion for a neonate strangling on the cord , further strangling would have ended the agony those drowning in amniotic fluid at birth may opt for death by drowning those who received a massive dose of anesthetic at birth may take an overdose of barbiturates , or they might gas themselves in their garage and so on i remember one patient who saved up dynamite having experienced anoxia at birth , he was going to put a stick to his head and blow his head off so that he would n't have one second of pain and hopelessness he laughs at that now , but at the time it spoke volumes of his desperation another patient was obsessed with jumping off a building during her birth by cesarean , this person had felt wrenched into space with nothing to hang onto another patient , battered and squeezed at birth , obsessed about jumping off a bridge , head first i found this was almost a universal law we attempt to die in the way our birth was threatened those memories , that of trauma during gestation , last a lifetime and lead to same attempt years later to die in the way it might have happened at the beginning in other words , as the memory of the early trauma rises , the memory of the early result mounts as well thus early strangulation may lead to the same course of action with the final denouement death the logic of the system it is confirmation of the imprint and its lifelong effect on the system it drives behavior ineluctably so the imprint includes the probable outcome death we need to consider suicide as another form of act out it channels behavior despite exhortation and encouragement the sense of approaching death what is often articulated for those who have no idea about the imprint is , i don t want to live anymore and even that is not fully articulated it is usually a vague thought or sense it is often not , i am in so much pain i don t want to go on it is just a vague sense of hopelessness and helplessness that leads to an attempt it all remains vague and aleatory , a constant rumination inside of a black cloud descending anand , k j s , scalzo f m can adverse neonatal experiences alter brain development and subsequent behavior ?
