this morning i sat in a mayo clinic dental specialty chair for hours and minutes while two doctors cut , drilled , scraped , hammered yes , hammered , and sewed a high tech new bone slurry into place it was the first step in what will hopefully turn into new , supportive bone in my jaw in order to allow placement of a canine implant at a later date now it 's up to my body , and all i can do is wait prayers please that solid new bone forms within the next months if new bone does not form , i will have to undergo another procedure and wait another months i'm hoping to avoid that result , but ultimately i have no control what will happen will happen i'm hopeful my decent physical condition and overall good health will be of benefit right now like i said , if you 've got a direct line to a higher power , feel free to use it and use it often thanks the surgery itself was uncomfortable and long , but it was n't terrible they had to re numb various parts of my mouth at least times at one point i could feel the stitches being stitched into the roof of my mouth that was n't so fun i tried to tune out and listen to some music , but my phone died about halfway through the procedure oh well the doctors were wonderful and did their best to keep me comfortable i 've been home for several hours now , and i'm doing better than i expected i'm taking antibiotics to keep away infection , steroid pills to control the swelling , and of course , pain pills i have stitches in my gums , my palate , and in between my teeth which run from canine tooth to canine tooth it 's a large area but so far the pain and swelling are n't too bad i'm surprised and grateful for that it 's going to be a long weekend i ca n't do any physical activity or eat anything that requires chewing for days i bought some protein powder for smoothies and some potatoes for mashing and since the doctors say rest , that 's exactly what i'm going to do it 's a good thing i have new movies to watch and a host of football games to keep me occupied this weekend i certainly do n't want to do anything that may jeopardize my healing i 'll practice being a good patient this too shall pass
