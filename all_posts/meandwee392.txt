dear paige , today you are months old ! i can hardly believe it you are now closer to being a whole year old and , as usual , i'm clinging to your babyhood with every breath you 're just so precious to us it 's hard not to ! this past month you grew in your two bottom center teeth ! one day i saw them breaking through and days later they poof ! were pretty much all the way grown through around that same time , you started crawling around , commando style , around the living room you 're attracted to the cable box of course , the heating grates , and the bottoms of the furniture so , i spend lots of time distracting you toward your toys instead you love to crash your wooden rings i stack them up nicely and you make a game of crashing the tower down big fun ! you 've also started giving us kisses before your naps and bedtime i 'll reach over to give you a kiss and a hug and you will reach toward me from daddy 's arms to give me a hug around the neck and an open mouthed watery kiss on my cheek i about died with happiness when you first did it and feel the same thrill ever since when i'm alone with you during the day you are n't quite as lovey dovey but , it 's nice you 'll do it when daddy 's around at least here 's a picture of you sitting alone without my help good for you ! you know , last week i was washing your bottles in the sink and i was sort of sighing from annoyance when i was doing the fifth one so many parts to wash ! and while i was scrubbing i thought back to before we had you in our life and how i would have given anything to have bottles to wash i remembered that ache so vividly i looked down and felt a huge wave of gratitude crash over me i was jolted back into remembering how lucky i am and how these sweet moments of your babyhood need to be appreciated even the little chores like bottle part washing i thought about how one day soon enough you will be in school and i 'll miss you so much during the day and i will wistfully look back on these sweet times and i 'll say that every little chore was so worth it that i 'd do them a million times over again to have this time with you during this time of thanksgiving , i am realizing that i am just as grateful for the chores in life as they heighten the fun times even the most mundane tasks serve to remind me of the special and sweet times i have with you this is also true for the rest of life it 's important to find joy in the darkest times the most boring times the most annoying or frustrating times the saddest of times joy is always there if you look for it and never let go you are my treasure please know that my heart beats in you that i'm with you and loving you always love always and forever , mama save
