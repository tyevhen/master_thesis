i recently saw a documentary that featured a man in his forties talking about his unpromising youth a youth filled with neglect and abuse from alcoholic parents , a life that revolved around drugs , drinking and multiple arrests for crimes from burglary to auto theft he was arrested times before he was with the threat from authorities that his next crime would lead to an adult conviction and prison , he sat in front of the high school where he was struggling through classes , reflecting on his past and his future with despair soon after that , his life changed for the better when he landed a job delivering merchandise for a high end furniture store he enjoyed the job and liked meeting the customers , whose lives were so different from his one day , he made a delivery to the lovely home of a pediatric surgeon something clicked he poured out his heart to the doctor , telling him how he wanted to make something of his life the doctor said so do it ! and the ensuing life changing friendship with this kind , but no nonsense doctor encouraged the young man to learn to read , to continue in high school and college in the next shot , showing him washing his hands with his bad boy day tattoos still visible , the young man had morphed from juvenile delinquent to noted thoracic surgeon whose academic progress through college and medical school was mentored and cheered on by his doctor friend while most of us may not have such dramatic life changes , we 've all encountered many accidental angels in our lives who are accidental angels ? they 're people who were not family , but who came into our lives by chance or for a reason and who taught us life changing or life enhancing lessons along the way as we review our lives from the vantage point of middle age or beyond , we can see with new clarity how many times we were at a crossroads , how many times someone came along to give us a word of encouragement , an extra push or a piece of information that allowed us to grow and change who are yours ? have you paused to think about the people , beyond close family members , who made a huge difference in the course and the quality of your life ? stop and think for a while who , in each phase , each season and each challenge of your life , walked with you and made a difference ? some of my most significant angels are teachers there was sister rita mccormack , my brother 's first grade teacher and one of my dearest adult friends when i was a child she was a young irish nun who was playful , musical , funny and deeply caring think julie andrews in the sound of music rita cared enough to confront my parents about some abuse at home and helped me to recover my confidence after lingering symptoms of my battle with polio caught the attention of playground bullies she reprimanded them , embraced me and spent hours after school helping me to regain clear speech and , at the same time , inspiring my love of acting that would be so important to me in high school and college by acting out poetry and short plays with me she is now , a spirited activist , and still incredibly dear to me there was sister ramona bascom , my high school journalism teacher , who not only encouraged me to write , but also was a caring and trusted friend to whom i could tell my deepest secrets and feel only love , warmth and total acceptance in return she taught me what it meant to be a successful human being , quite beyond one 's profession or lifestyle at , she is still giving generously of herself now bringing comfort to students as a staff counselor at stanford university and we are dear friends to this day there was elizabeth swayne yamashita , a tough talking , chain smoking australian journalist , who taught the first writing class i ever took at northwestern university 's medill school of journalism i was terrified when i first saw her and heard her long list of requirements for us as fledgling journalists the rule was do n't bore me she wrote almost more on my papers than i did and , as painful as some of the criticism was , initially , it was right she forced me to confront and overcome my shyness by making me do more interviews than anyone else and , to help me along , paired me for one assignment with another student , tim schellhardt , who happened to teach me an unforgettable lesson about effective interviewing tim went on to become , among other things , the white house reporter for the wall street journal , as well as my lifelong friend many years later , tim called me from his wall street journal office to tell me that news had just come over the wires that elizabeth , a noted journalist herself , had died of a heart attack shortly after her retirement we cried together on the phone for the loss of this testy , vibrant , immensely talented and caring woman who had been such an angel in our lives there were unexpected angels in bosses bob macleod at 'teen who encouraged me to develop my writing niche in psychology and health , betty price at 'teen who taught me crucial lessons in kindness , integrity and living one 's faith , dr tiffin clegg at college hospital who encouraged me to go back to graduate school for my clinical psychology degree and a new career as a psychotherapist , dr michael scavio at cspp for his kindness , inspiration and encouragement and nora valdiviezo at ucla medical center who took a chance on me and helped to smooth my way to a new life phase and , of course , we all have angels in our friends who have yours been ?
