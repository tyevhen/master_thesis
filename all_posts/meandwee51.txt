i got interviewed for an article on pricing on etsy today it 's on the homepage and i was quoted and everything i'm thrilled and excited and grateful ! pricing my items has been an ever evolving process creating hand made means you take on all the overhead for supplies , time , shipping and marketing efforts it also means you put your level of expertise into the mix the customer gets something made of quality , love , care and attention in the end , you hope someone values what you make and sees a little of themselves in it and just because , here is a photo of noah feeling proud of his animal parade save you might also like new work new work illustrating and living linkwithin
