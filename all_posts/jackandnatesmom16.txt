is a pat on the back , a hand on my shoulder a reminder that i am not a bad mother sometimes i do n't even realize how low i am feeling about my boys' challenges until someone says to me you are doing a good job or i have been a behavioral therapist for years and trust me , you are a wonderful parent it does n't occur to me that i think of myself as this terrible , inadequate mother but i do it also does n't feel like the teachers at school , peers , and many other professionals can really see what i am trying to do , how much i am trying to do that i would love to take my sons to occupational therapy twice a week , but it would truthfully require the therapist to accept appointments at pm oh and a lottery win that i sit with my son both in the evenings after school , work and therapy , and in the mornings , working on concepts that his peers apparently fly through that sometimes it takes minutes of begging to simply get him to look at a worksheet , much less start it that i would rather take a bullet to the brain than think or hear about all of the typical kid experiences it feels like my sons are missing out on so when just one person has these things to say to me and i know that she knows what she 's talking about i feel like i can take a deep breath , and for a few minutes put aside the grant applications for services still sitting on my desk , the fact that jacks developmental pediatrician has n't called me back , the fact that i am taking him to his first cognitive behavioral therapy next week , which we are skipping another therapy appointment to attend it helps me swallow the times that my son has hit and spit on me this week it helps me to stop beating myself up over the fact that we are weeks into intensive potty training with nate and have had not even one single success or that i had to choose between taking him to speech with a quality therapist or to ot with a wonderful therapist and i chose speech it also helps me swallow the guilt i feel for taking better care of myself lately for eating well and taking the time to exercise i am valuable to my children , my health and well being are not just for me to the person who reminded me of this today thank you on so many levels
