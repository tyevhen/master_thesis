i updated the poll today to reflect a new topic medications i'm curious to know how many of you take meds and how many do n't and which one you take not only that i am curious how you feel about your prescription , how much or how often do you need to take it , or why you do n't take medication at all i will start i take one mg a day and to one pill of clonozepam when needed which is like waves or rollercoasters i will go for weeks without needing to take one of those but then there will be a month or so where i have to take it several times a day to make it through clonozepam i swear i spell it differently every time has been a life saver for me it took me a lot longer to warm up to zoloft but i think i am finally seeing results from being consistent with it the poll will be up until next friday night and then i will replace it with a new one feel free to take it and add any comments you want if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like white and nerdy exciting blog updates what to do when feeling overwhelmed blog against abuse day breaking the stigma linkwithin
