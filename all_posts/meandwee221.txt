dear little n , i was driving home in the dark from dinner with a newly pregnant friend last night and thought about you the whole way my head swirled with many thoughts , but mostly about the fact that you are indeed a tiny little person inside my tummy who i am going to meet in about weeks thanks to a pending induction i wondered what you will look like , what you will feel like , and what your personality will be like everything began to feel so real and so profound i 've been scared to let myself get excited you are almost here though and i'm allowing that excitement to seep in as i was driving , on the radio , the song lightning crashes by live came on it always seems to come on when i'm going through some sort big thing in my head like a sign from the angels reminding me of the miracles of life and the bigness of it all that song never fails to move me to tears i think about endings and beginnings and all the moments in between sometimes i worry about life ending too soon with all my intentions along with it there 's nothing more sad to me i also think about new beginnings like your impending birth , and all the possibilities your and our future holds here are the lyrics for you to read they discuss how while one old mother dies in one part of the hospital her children are grown and she 's lived a full life , albeit one with things left undone or unsaid there is a birth for a young new mother in another part of that same hospital everything she has waited for is just beginning the cycle of life is ever present and bigger than all of us lightning crashes , a new mother cries her placenta falls to the floor the angel opens her eyes the confusion sets in before the doctor can even close the door lightning crashes , an old mother dies her intentions fall to the floor the angel closes her eyes the confusion that was hers belongs now to the baby down the hall oh now feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind forces pullin' from the center of the earth again i can feel it lightning crashes , a new mother cries this moment she 's been waiting for the angel opens her eyes pale blue colored eyes , contains the circle and puts the glory out to hide , hide i 've carried you in my belly all this time keeping you safe and warm and fed i 've been endlessly aware of how your arrival is going to permanently change the lives of your sister , daddy , and mommy in such a profound and exciting way sure , i 've been nervous and scared but not about you just about what it means for me to give you and your sister my all will i be enough ? i hope so i do n't want to let you down , ever i'm so excited to peer down at your little face and get to know you to look in your pale blue colored eyes and see the circle of life i'm excited to include you into our family forevermore what is to come ? your sister is thrilled you are coming she talks a lot about being able to give you a bottle and help you sit in your high chair even if that is n't for a while yet she 's also excited to pick out your outfits and help with your diapers is n't that nice ? you 'll have to remember that when you feel like giving her a hard time your daddy has been endlessly excited about you coming he loves to think about all the fun we will all have together physically , this pregnancy has been very hard i have n't known pain like this torn labrum in my hip , sciatica in my back both legs , rashes , routine pregnancy pain , etc etc but i know it will be worth it in the end if it means there is you the past several months have been a roller coaster of emotions ranging from excitement , fear , anticipation , anxiety and happiness what a ride ! as we get closer to your arrival date , i'm feeling a deeper sense of peace and calm i know i can do this now you are on my side i 've felt all your little kicks and punches at the same times each day reminding me that you are here and you are ok you are loved little n so very loved beautiful boy , i'm so lucky to get to be your mama that i 've been blessed with the treasure that is you i hope you love being with me and us too now come out already ! we 're ready to start our adventures with you ! love you always and forever , mama save
