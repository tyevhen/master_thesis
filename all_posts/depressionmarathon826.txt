oh my gosh , i 've been busy ! yesterday was a very full day , made fuller by me not dragging my butt out of bed to workout before work i had a morning filled with patients , an hour break at lunch , during which time i ran with puck , and then an afternoon filled with patients by the time i finished my paperwork it was my golf lesson began at , and by i was in the pool doing intervals uff dah ! thankfully , my mom made delicious pea soup for dinner , which we ate around ! i was bushed by the time my head hit the pillow today has been more of the same i actually got my butt out of bed early this time , so i was done with the strength portion of my workout by am i still need to ride my bike for minutes , but i'm not sure when that 's going to fit in ! i had a dentist appointment , followed by hours at work , followed by emptying out my basement for the soon to be started construction down there i'm taking this break now , but i have to type quick in order to eat dinner and get to the track club board meeting on time i guess i 'll be biking right up until bed time uff dah ! again i'm feeling a little stressed with all the activity i'm being careful and monitoring my mood because i can sense danger lurking i wonder what it 's like to be a normie not having to worry about stress landing you in a hole must be nice i do n't think many more days of this would be recommended , so i'm hoping to feel a little slowing and relief soon whether that happens or not , you 'll likely be the first to know ! gotta go !
