hey all ! sorry i disappeared from my blog for a while my dad was having carotid subclavian bypass surgery and i was helping him out he 's doing great now , so it 's back to the grind unfortunately i totally missed all discussion of exodus which i have n't even started yet i 'll read that at the same time as starting leviticus , though , so that i stay on schedule just need to put a fire under my butt and catch up i'm supposed to post my questions for the unwinding part ii on monday the th , i might be able to get that far by then , but no promises i might be a couple of days late but i 'll catch up ! otherwise , there 's not really much to say about the past couple of weeks of absence i was mostly focusing on dad i 'll also try to catch up on blog comments and visit people 's blogs soon , but i'm way behind in life , so give me some time currently reading because i'm behind , i 've narrowed down my currently reading list to the bible , the unwinding nonfiction for my group read , kindred audiobook , and dark matter fiction for my real life book club oh ! and i almost forgot to mention that i hope to attend the march for science in dc on april nd i wish i had the skill to knit this cap anyone know how to knit who wants to do one for me ?
