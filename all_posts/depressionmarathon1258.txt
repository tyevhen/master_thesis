in my experience , depression has been a constantly changing foe unlike today , where fatigue is my constant companion , i do not recall this physical heaviness earlier in my journey whereas i used to stay awake with racing thoughts , now i require one , sometimes two naps plus my full complement of nightly sleep just to stay upright early in this journey , the depth of my despair was more constant and severe i could not cry not a tear for years , not a tear it sounds cliched , but i experienced the reality , and the depth of that suffering was excruciating my tears flow now , and my mood is generally less desperate , but also less stable overall , i'm pretty stable forgive me , now i must run around my house knocking on every wood surface i can find ! , but what 's changed is how quickly my mood can change lightning fast over the course of a few hours sunshine can turn to covers over my head paralysis fortunately , i 've been at this awhile , and my coping skills have improved with the years i no longer feel the need to explain or figure out every dip and dive it 's part of my illness , is good enough and waiting it out has gotten a bit easier but , i 've also developed some new symptoms over the past years when my symptoms are bad , i sometimes think my radio is playing in the other room or that someone is watching my house how fun ! a little paranoia to keep me on my toes ! and my memory absolutely sucks ! cognitive function is what i feel i have lost the most and again , as my symptoms worsen so too does my memory , concentration and distractability i 've gone from a woman who used to carry half the phonebook in her head to a woman who ca n't carry on a conversation because she has nothing to talk about even if i saw a movie last week , i could n't tell you about it today i love world war ii history and have probably seen every movie documentary about the holocaust that has ever been produced , but do n't expect that i can intelligently discuss it with you i ca n't i know i am fascinated and interested in it , but i ca n't tell you why ! i ca n't talk about the battles , the dates , the political leaders it just wo n't stay in my brain , and that 's been as a direct result of this illness and my treatment for it instead , i battled with irritability , poor judgement , irrational decision making , and a brain that often would n't shut off the more constant fatigue and increased need for sleep began midway through this trip in fact , it has been my most constant , stable symptom over the past several years tired just tired however , my mood was also so low many years ago that i could not even cry it sounds so cliched , but it was and still can be an incredible depth to experience no tears , ever , for a long , long time depression now causes me a lot of cognitive challenges
