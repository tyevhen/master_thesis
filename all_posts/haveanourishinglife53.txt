a while ago , i found a recommendation an artistic exercise that offered to help my body image and eating disorder perspective i m not sure where i found the suggestion i m thinking it was from the blog weightless , but now i can t find it , nor can i remember what it was called anyway , i remember thinking it was a bit silly at first , kind of like one of those fifth grade homework assignments you know the poster board , the glue sticks , and having mom run to the dollar store to get your supplies because it was the night before it was due i wasn t going to do project i was just going to read through it , but something inside pushed me to just give it a try what did i have to lose ? no one would have to see it anyway just me the task was to take a manila folder , and on the cover , write the words , if i was , then i would in the blank you were to fill in what was holding you back from life for example , you could put confident , smart , assertive , pretty , or in my case , what i thought i had to be before i started living skinny in my mind , i wasn t thin enough to do all the things i wanted to do so , i was putting my life on hold until i looked the way i wanted to look then , on the cover of the folder , i drew a locked door on the inside of the folder , you were to make a collage you could glue magazine pictures , draw things , color , and create the life you would have if not for that thing that was holding you back i put many beautiful pictures inside that folder for there were many things i wanted to do i wanted to travel , to visit the rest of the states i wanted to make craig and i pancake breakfasts on saturday mornings without feeling guilty for eating carbohydrates and sugar i put pictures of people smiling because i wanted to be truly happy there was a picture of a pregnant woman because i wanted to be a mom someday but was deathly afraid of gaining weight inside , i put famous paintings and drawings because i wanted to create with confidence instead of not painting out of low self esteem the folder began to fill with fun things , places i wanted to go , career goals , lofty dreams , ambitions , and desires all things that i was putting on hold because i wasn t perfect yet i didn t think i could do those things until i was skinny enough as i was looking at my primitive creation , i realized that it looked like a scrapbook from someone s wonderful , fulfilling life would i be able to look back in the years to come and feel as much joy from a life well spent ? i thought about all the years i focused only on losing weight instead of working toward my dreams on the back of the folder , i wrote the words , i will no longer let this expectation stop me from living my life the exercise re awakened dreams i didn t know i had anymore my life had been so concerned with being perfect was i going to let my ridiculous expectations keep me from living life ? and what if i never did feel good enough , if i never did feel thin enough , then what ? i thought about the empty manila folder that my life was shaping out to be this experienced helped me realize that there were things in life i wanted more than an eating disorder even if i couldn t remember that fact all the time there is more to life than being thin
