i ca n't sleep i'm awake with worry specifically , i'm worried about disclosing the fact that i have depression to my new male friend , d when exactly is the best time to tell someone that you have depression ? even though i 've been relatively stable for more than six years , with the damn exception of a few months ago , i'm scared to tell him it 's the stigma even though i 've been relatively stable , he does n't know that he might hear the word depression and run the other way yet i do n't want to lie i wo n't lie but when do i have this conversation ? i have n't told him yet i want to get to know him better , but more importantly , i want him to know me better i figure he 'll have a harder time running away if he knows the real me , but is that fair to him ? am i lying by omission ? it is hard for me not to worry about this and i have reason to worry i 've had other suitors run after discovering this blog this blog , it 's another thing i'm concerned about it 's one thing to tell d i have depression , it 's another to have him scour this blog for all the gory details do i tell him i have depression yet omit the fact that i write a blog about it ? i just do n't know what to do i'm awake with worry i wish i was n't i 'd much rather be peacefully sleeping it does n't pay to worry , as i have no control over how he will respond but i do n't want to be hurt either i do n't know what to do
