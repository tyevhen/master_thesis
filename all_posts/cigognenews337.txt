too often we think of memory as something we can remember verbally , that is but there are several kinds of memory and each level of consciousness remembers in its own way the emotional system remembers when something moves us to tears something we may not be aware of thus we remember on non verbal levels in non verbal ways and there is another form of memory that is most primitive , and is purely instinctual and below even the emotional level seizures can be that form of memory so that in group therapy , as one of my epileptics was about to have a seizure , i told him that it was from birth and let himself go there he did , and transformed an inchoate seizure into a reliving of a traumatic oxygen deprived birth i knew where it was coming from , otherwise i would never dare suggest what i did and those kinds of suggestions are rare , indeed there are forms of what i call first line memory avoiding enclosed places as a doppelganger of an oxygen deprived gestational life enclosed spaces , for those who have that imprint , are avoided in order not to trigger off a panic attack it is not the enclosed space that is the danger it is the memory of what it provokes a primal can make it conscious but even when unconscious , it is still a memory and in primal therapy we make all of those levels , over time , into consciously aware experiences not verbal experiences conscious ones we would never try to transmute a non verbal memory into something verbal and or intellectual we don t encourage a patient to remember something verbally that was never verbal , in the first place that is when we get abreaction and no help in therapy that involves deceiving the patient and trying to change his memory system intellectual therapists too often try to do that make every experience verbal and forcing the memory into the verbal mode our first job in therapy is to recognize what form of memory we are dealing with birth traumas are never relived verbally or even with tears there are never any words involved trying to get a patient to scream when there was never any scream or need to scream involved in the memory is yet another road to abreaction the discharge of the energy of a feeling onto the wrong level of consciousness onto a different memory system and a different level of consciousness that is often what a seizure is yes of course there may be brain lesions , but the tipping point could be latent anxiety and we bring down the level to below overt symptoms , so that there may be latent anxiety but not overt seizures all this so we can be clear what kind of memory system we are dealing with what we get too often in insight cognitive therapy is verbal expression to the exclusion of the other levels and so we get only partial wellness because we have dealt partially with memory to be clear , there may be several factors involved in a seizure anxiety may be one when we reduce that factor we may help the patient to be below symptomatic levels it is not an ultimate cure but it helps ultimate cure is when we deal with the neurology , physiology and key primal memory we cannot neglect any aspect of ourselves and expect cure we can use pills to block anxiety but that is not going to be cure let us be sure about what kind of memory system we are dealing with knowing that there are different kinds and never the twain shall meet if we confound memory systems the patient will not get well this is not just a theoretical point , but a profoundly neurophysiologic one
