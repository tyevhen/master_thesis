the american psychological association released a gargantuan page report on the use of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for children and adolescents it 's nice to see that the organization that is so devoted to getting psychologists to prescribe medication is actually , on the other hand , also releasing a report that points out many of the evidence gaps in treating children with psychotropic medications the majority of child psychiatry practice relies on clinical folklore rather than evidence , unfortunately however , psychological interventions for many disorders also have n't shown a lot more efficacy than placebo interventions but at least they seem quite a bit safer than meds i 've not had the time to read the report in its entirety , but i did like one section of text quite a bit it is ironic that the specific advantages of available treatments , whether psychosocial or psychopharmacological , for depressed youth are small compared with the nonspecific effects of placebo and other supportive comparison treatments it could be argued that more resources are warranted to investigate and train practitioners in the nonspecifics of the therapeutic alliance , support , exposure , and problem solving skills that seem to cut across many treatments it could also be argued that watchful waiting may be appropriate for some youth who present with milder symptoms of depression pg full text here and a press release summarizing the findings here
