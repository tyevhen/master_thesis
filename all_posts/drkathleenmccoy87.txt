reviewing our imperfect , complicated lives as yet another thanksgiving rolls around , there is still so much cause for gratitude but there are times when the negative crowds out the positive , either due to an immediate crisis or to lingering pain over a long ago wound now is the time to let the positives come to the forefront , to count the blessings of your life cultivating gratitude in the present means growing past the negatives if you came from dysfunctional family , there is a time for letting go of the past in whatever form that takes and that time is now it may mean forgiving if not forgetting and going on with your life it may mean creating a safe distance between yourself and the ongoing dysfunction it may mean concentrating on what and who was good and loving in your family of origin and you can feel blessed today that you 're no longer a powerless child , but an adult with the power to make positive choices letting go of past pain , not allowing it to define your life , makes room for joy if you 're not as fortunate in life as you had hoped , it 's time to look at what has gone right in your life instead of focusing on how things have never measured up to those long ago dreams as time passes , our dreams change or often need to change maybe what we dreamed in our youth just was n't realistic perhaps the dreams were reasonable , but life as it unfolded did n't oblige sometimes we can make a dream happen with hard work and determination but sometimes , because of random luck and circumstances beyond our control , a dream eludes us but even dreams that do n't happen can take us to unexpected places and even positive surprises in our lives it 's a time to feel gratitude for those random happy surprises and for the dreams that did come true , perhaps in ways we could n't have anticipated if you 're in pain , it 's time to treat yourself gently , to listen to your body 's needs and limitations , and , at the same time , to challenge yourself to stay as healthy and active as possible it 's a blessing to have a life to live despite physical or emotional pain and your own personal challenge to live as full and loving a life as possible if your current family situation is n't perfect , it may be very much on your mind these days there may be that son in law you find trying sitting there being relentlessly himself during the holiday meal or those empty chairs at the table signaling family members who have died or become estranged or who for a variety of reasons ca n't be with you to celebrate this year it 's a time to celebrate what is instead of grieving what could or should be open your mind to try to discover why a dreaded in law might be so loved by an adult child send loving thoughts to those who are n't with you those who have passed away and those who are at a geographic or emotional distance celebrate those who are sharing the holiday with you and the wonderful variety of love we have in our lives if you 're alone this holiday , make this thanksgiving your own creation , your own singular celebration perhaps , just for today , you will choose to feel warmed rather than sad by the memories of holidays past when your holiday table and your heart were filled with family and friends maybe , just for today , seize the opportunity to celebrate exactly as you wish no pressure , no obligations , no long hours of cooking unless that pleases you maybe your celebration will be curling up with a good book and reading it cover to cover or it could be listening to your favorite music and calling distant loved ones to wish them a happy holiday it could also be a time to warm your heart by reaching out to others many churches and charities sponsor thanksgiving meals for the homeless and disadvantaged some bring holiday cheer to those who are hospitalized or in nursing homes for the holidays you might find your own happiness this holiday by joining in and serving others it can help , too , whatever the circumstances of your imperfect , complicated life today , to count your blessings in the ordinary aspects of your life a warm home sheltering you from a winter storm a sweet dog or cat warming your lap and your heart good , healthy food a family that may be scattered geographically but that can bring you joy by simply thriving wherever they are the strength to do what you need to do and , often , what you want to do maybe you 're not able to be as active as you once were maybe health concerns have begun to multiply but you 're still breathing , still aware , still able to welcome yet another holiday season when we grow to see and savor the blessings in the ordinary , our lives can become truly extraordinary
