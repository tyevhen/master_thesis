okay , if you read my last post , you know i ranted who me , rant ? about tara parker pope 's nytimes well blog post where she asserted that phone therapy is effective for depression as effective as real life therapy with less attrition people wrote in to talk about their feelings about phone therapy , but really my gripe was with the idea of presenting a conclusion without any details i had a lot of questions about how this conclusion was reached , and i thought perhaps there were only patients in the study so i emailed the author of the study , david c mohr , ph d at northwestern , and within hours , i had a reprint of the study it was a lot of data and i only did a quick read , but my questions were all answered , and here 's the scoop this was n't a research study the journal article is a review of the literature of all phone therapy studies done , and such studies were identified all but were excluded because they did not meet the authors' specific criteria to be included for example , some were surveys , not therapy trials , and any study that had any face to face contact was excluded mohr goes into detailed discussions of therapist training , treatment orientation , co morbid illnesses , treatment format , and other variables mohr discusses how many of the patients and control subjects may have been on medications prescribed by primary care doctors or oncologists some of the studies looked at phone therapy in patients suffering from specific illnesses i could n't find any data from these studies that revealed that phone therapy worked as well as the traditional in person stuff in a face off controlled trial the well blog said the researchers also found that telephone therapy was just as effective at reducing depressive symptoms as face to face treatment actually , the researchers wrote we also want to emphasize that it is premature to generalize the results of this meta analysis broadly individual studies suggest specific uses under specific circumstances for example , telephone therapies may provide added benefit compared to care for depressive symptoms by a primarycare physician or to no care at all however , because the depression symptom outcomes used in this meta analysis were self report instruments , the generalizability of these findings to clinically diagnosable depressive disorders is limited kendall flannery schroeder , furthermore , the measures of depression used in this study had a wide range of specificity and sensitivity minami , wampold , serlin , kircher , brown , thus , the aggregated effect size estimates for depressive symptom severity should not be used as any sort of benchmark in addition , the level of heterogeneity across studies suggests that we do not yet understand the characteristics of patients for whom such telephone interventions may be effective , and those for whom telephone intervention may not be appropriate the heterogeneity in the severity of depressive symptoms and in medical comorbidities in the samples also limits generalizability aa noted in his her comments that we here at shrink rap sometimes make statements without fully backing them up or giving a full assessment of the literature i have to agree we 're rambling for fun , we try to be accurate , we look up and link , but psychiatry is sometimes vague , still a mix of art and science with more questions than answers and the it never ceases to amaze me that how differently individuals react to the same intervention be it a word muttered or a medication prescribed we try to be careful , but we ca n't be exact and some of this is about ducks and chocolate and us just venting about our days i promise , however , that the moment the new york times wants to pay me a salary to do this , i 'll become really really careful about the conclusions i draw ! thanks to dr mohr for providing the paper the effect of telephone administered psychotherapy on symptoms of depression and attrition a meta analysis david c mohr , northwestern university , hines veterans administration hospital lea vella , san diego state university stacey hart , ryerson university timothy heckman , ohio university gregory simon , group health cooperative
