the first ever summer montreal unschoolers gathering happened this past week which is why i dropped off the face of the earth for a little while in terms of online activities , and now that it 's over i have much processing to do i'm so happy we did it , i had such a great time , yet i also had some very emotional moments , and dealt with a lot of stress over the course of the week i 'll write a lot more about that in the coming days i just arrived home from the campground earlier today , and as often happens from sleep deprivation and eating too few vegetables for an extended period of time , i 've been feeling the beginnings of a cold coming on i was feeling really sad earlier about everyone leaving , and i 've been stumbling around in a ridiculously tired , beginning of cold fog yet as i stood tonight in a just too hot shower with the steam billowing around me , thinking about balance and violence and progression and life , i felt this overwhelming contentment settle over me a feeling that i'm fine , in the right place a feeling of deep centered ness and rightness life is good , i thought , as i sniffled a bit from a cold induced runny nose life is good and i 'll have plenty more thoughts and experiences to share on this blog in the coming days , just as soon as i 've caught up a bit on sleep ! ! for now , i'm concocting a cold fighting tea , then curling up in my own bed for the first time in days love , idzie you might also like i hate colds cold blues avoiding bio hazards at all cost sickness , sushi , graphic novels , and what 's been going on linkwithin
