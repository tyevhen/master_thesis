cpt coding changes for with e m discussion from american psychiatric association on vimeo worried about the new cpt codes ? i'm sure this will make it crystal clear piece of cake i 'd also like to borrow a quote from the new york times by leora horowitz from a shortcut to wasted time doctors are paid not by how much time they spend with patients , how well they listen or how hard they think about what could be wrong , but by how much they write down and the rules for what we have to write are byzantine medicare s explanation takes pages to receive the highest level of payment for an office visit , i have to document several aspects of the main problem , screening questions about at least organ systems , something about the patient s family and or social history , and or a lengthy physical exam in addition , i have to demonstrate that my medical decision making was very complicated , considering the number of possible diagnoses and treatments , the complexity of the data and or the patient s risk of serious complications that type of visit is supposed to take about minutes last week , i spent minutes with a patient who had just placed her mother into hospice care my patient was distraught , not sleeping , not eating i gave her some advice , but mostly i just listened by the end of our visit , she was feeling much better but i wouldn t be able to bill much for that visit based on my documentation i didn t review her medical or family history , conduct a review of organ systems or perform a physical exam what the payment system tells me to do is to cut her off after minutes , listen to her heart and lungs and give her a sleeping pill which doctor visit would you prefer ?
