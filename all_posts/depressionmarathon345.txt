in my travels throughout the psychology psychiatry building today , i separately ran into three prior treatment providers a psychiatrist , a clinical nurse specialist , and a nurse all three treated me at one time or another when i was an inpatient two of them were involved in my most recent hospitalization it was nice to bump into each of them it 's always nice , i think , to bump into previous treatment providers when i'm more like my normal , healthy self why is that ? i think it 's nice for me to be able to relate to them on a more even level i'm no longer the very ill patient i'm just another person , and i find it satisfying when they see me as i am , not as the vulnerable sick person i am when i'm experiencing severe depression the nicest thing about bumping into each of them today was that they each told me i was , looking good ! they all thought i looked healthy and energetic that was so nice to hear these people have seen what i look like when i'm not well it was somehow validating that they recognized , and verbalized , that i looked good , especially since i did look good today i looked healthy i looked healthy because i have been feeling better my mood is improving , and i think it shows physically i 've even occasionally been wearing work clothes , rather than just jeans or sweats , to my mood disorder treatment program that is a sign i'm feeling better when i'm ill , i do n't care how i look or what i wear it 's nice to be getting some of my character back i'm halfway through my mood disorder treatment program it 's obviously been helpful , as i just noted feeling better is such a relief i'm not back totally , but i'm getting closer to uncovering the real me once again it will be a grand day when this depression episode is a long past memory i'm happy to be moving in that direction
