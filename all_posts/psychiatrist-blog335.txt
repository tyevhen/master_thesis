back when we discussing the basic treatment plan , i asked jesse if he would write a blog post on non compliance jesse , however , was non compliant and he wrote a guest blog post on how we dialogue here on shrink rap was st bernard right ? qui me amat , amat et canem meam who loves me , loves also my dog st bernard , th century st bernard quoted this latin saying in a sermon , and it led me to consider whether it applies to much of what we discuss on shrink rap granting that st bernard had a very big , and most likely unwashed and untrained , dog , which would have tried the patience of many homeowners of his time , may we apply his principle beyond retainers , followers , and family to equally speak to our possessions , words , actions , and beliefs ? if you love me , you 'll also love all that i think , say , and say how often do we see here on shrink rap dialogue which is heated rather than restrained , opinions which are held ex cathedra , invectives thrown with careless disregard , and individuals attacked quite casually ? shrink rap is not unique , but a rather educated example of what we see commonly in the news , on talk shows , in editorials what i am positing is that st bernard 's adage is often taken in the reverse if you do not agree with what i say , you do not love me , and i will respond accordingly there is a failure of empathy , and hurt feelings , the sense of not being loved , leading to an exaggerated response shrink rap is a psychologically attuned blog with a thoughtful community do others see what i do , or disagree ? do you see that when an opinion is presented a disagreement may lead to a nuclear response rather than to a thoughtful reexamination of whatever argument is present ? do you think that hurt feelings are frequently underneath this ? lost in history is the housewife who did not want bernard 's big unwashed dog on her couch how do you imagine the conversation went ? moral if you disagree with an adversary , it is best said in latin
