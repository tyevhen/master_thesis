this morning i was up to my eyeballs in self pity my right hip hurt that was the beginning i dove into the pot the thing about self pity is once it starts , the end point is limitless like compound interest on your high rate credit card , the pitiful possibilities are exponentially vast the pity was blinding me in no time at all my hip hurt therefore i re tore my labrum the hip injury which has already twice been surgically repaired therefore i will not be able to run this saturday therefore i will have failed to attain a goal for which i prepared with weeks of committed work in addition , my hip ca n't be repaired again therefore i am facing the end of my running career therefore i will lose a huge piece of my identity and joy therefore life will lose meaning and purpose therefore i will get fat and lazy therefore i will lose my running community friends therefore i will be isolated and lonely therefore my depression will get worse therefore i will drink again therefore i will end up a sad , lonely , pathetic woman without a purpose to live ! whew ! and i only gave you the shortened version of one of my scenarios pretty impressive , huh ? each poor me scenario began at the same place my hip hurt , the only reality contained within each imagined path i had scenarios tracing backward , literally years into my past a self pity connect the dots starting and ending with my hip hurting today and i had scenes projecting forward , like the one above , which moved me from a sore hip to the gutter in no time at all what can i say , left unchecked i have a very active brain ! sitting here now , after performing some pt techniques on myself and then swimming a mile , it amazes me how hyper defeated my self pity thinking can be i have the knowledge and skills to get myself out of that icky pity pot , but today there i sat , soaking in the mire and the muck while sopping up those mucky thoughts , i was aware i was there i knew it was a dark , dirty place for my brain to be , but i floundered there anyway despite myself , i was no match for the pity pot poor me poor me photo courtesy daphne barnett
