posted by dinah face it , even though psychotropics do wonders for many people , as a society and even as a profession we remain ambivalent about medicating people for what goes on in their mental life oh , of course , there are many examples of people where it 's not an issue we do n't medicate one night of insomnia , and we pretty much agree to medicate anyone with severe symptoms who arrive screaming in psychic pain , but on the edges of the symptom spectrum , there is still controversy , there is still hesitance , and there is still stigma as psychiatrists , we each have our own threshold in the question of when to medicate as we go on with sigmund freud 's birthday weekend , william h gass writes about freud in the inside man in sunday 's new york times op ed section had there been pills and similar potions he might have prescribed them and swallowed the rationale for their use as well cocaine , after all , was a chemical solution he used and quite in harmony with psychiatry 's present pill pop , hip hop , rub out attitude pill pop , hip hop so this is what i do for a living ? mr gass goes on to note it became fashionable to be neurotic , to be in analysis and to be able to afford it and we were having such a good time , we scarcely noticed that this therapy which took so long and cost so much was n't curing anybody interesting that mr gass manages to disparage both psychoanalysis and psychopharmacology i wo n't speculate on what he does advocate for the treatment of mental illness
