i keep looking for an online code beautifier that will convert my distinctly simian looking greasemonkey scripts to properly indented , formatted source code my current favorite code editor notepad does n't provide proper code formatting i know what you 're thinking why are n't you using a proper ide in the first place ? then you would n't have this problem ! well , first of all , i am thinking of upgrading to wordpad but it does n't do formatting either second of all , i have n't found a javascript ide worthy of the name , which is why i use notepad more on that in a minute i spent an hour the other day looking for an online beautifier that would do a makeover on my ugly javascript what i found is that most people point either to this one or this one i tried others as well they either do n't keep my existing newlines , or do n't indent if blocks properly or at all , and or just plain do n't indent consistently quite unacceptable finally i gave up on the online schlockware and went straight to flexbuilder which has been sitting unused on my desktop , and i thought surely this will do the trick imagine the look of abject horror on my face when i found that the actionscript editor could not do the equivalent of control shift f for java in eclipse in fact , the formatter built into flexbuilder 's actionscript editor wo n't even do auto indenting you have to manually grab blocks of code and do the old shift right shift left indent outdent thing by hand , over and over and over again , throughout your code , until the little beads of blood begin to form on your forehead i'm left , alas , with half solutions but unfortunately , two or three or ten half solutions do n't add up to a solution how fortunate we would all be if it did
