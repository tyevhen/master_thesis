so when i give a medication recommendation i talk about why i think the medication would help , i talk about what it treats , what the side effects are and what the risks of taking the medication are that 's a lot of information to absorb all at once so i ask my patients if they have any questions about what i 've said most of the time they decide to take medication , sometimes they do n't when they decide not to take it they 've got good reasons , most of the time the only bad reason i 've heard is i talked to my mother and she heard bad things about it , so i'm not going to take it every inmate has a sister , a girlfriend , an aunt or a mother somewhere with some health care training all of these family medical advisors know more about psychotropics and are more reliable sources of information than i am , apparently i try to be generous and remember that maybe there are idiosyncratic issues here , like maybe the patient did have a weird reaction to some medication that he does n't remember but his mother does , or maybe there are multiple family members who all had the same problem with a certain medication so he might too but usually it 's just a matter of trust the inmate 's lpn sister has taken care of him all of his life , has rescued him and given him shelter and sent him money when he needed it , so what she says about medication goes it reminds me of a story i heard when i was an intern my attending went to visit his mother , who was in the hospital for elective surgery he offered her some advice about her anesthesia , and she responded i 'll talk to my doctor about that her doctor was an intern my attending was the chairman of the anesthesia department at a major academic institution so i guess it goes both ways when it comes to being the family medical advisor are you the family medical advisor ? do you want to be ? and if so , do they listen ?
