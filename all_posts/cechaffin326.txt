i posted some manic depressive poems a year ago now why not some love poems ? i do n't have to be a poet to share what i wrote when i thought i was a poet , although saying this comes close to a tautology in its obviousness , more a redundancy , actually , just like my use of actually how i do blather ! ignore me or do n't and thanks for all the lively discussion that followed my last post here gift you are a fever in my blood you douse the sun , turn the sky violet all my veins flow backwards swollen with love , my heart seeks its double your mouth seals mine , inhaling all my purple waste love , i am riddled with glory light pours through bullet holes tomorrow i lead my first tour at the fort bragg botanical gardens as a certified master gardener , one of the first in our county though it 's kind of like a medal from the wizard of oz there are so many gardeners here who know so much more than i and always will bouncing between kilobunnies and kilorats in a mixed state little things piss me off , and i'm not just speaking of my anatomy , ce
