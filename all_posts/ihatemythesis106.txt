according to the chick fil a com meal calculator my lunch was as follows chicken sandwich calories waffle fries medium calories polynesian sauce oz calories sweetened ice tea small oo calories grand total calories this is horrific ! i am shocked and distressed by both the amount of crap i put in my body and by the amount of time i wasted going to their dumb web site , typing it all in and then reproducing it here my entire purpose of eating fast food was to save time , and somehow i failed at doing that well , i guess this goes to show that i need to leave the university food court and find a study spot that does n't have an internet connection
