there is an article , i believe , from the recent new yorker about someone who took acid lsd in the seventies and wonders what happened to the youth of today who prefer the shutting down drugs such as prozac versus the opening up drugs such as acid he claims that society no longer wants to take risks , preferring to keep it safe he believes that our choice of drugs is indicative of the general zeitgeist , reflecting the world we live in in the early years the s we craved freedom now we crave security he seems to be nostalgic for those old acid days and doesn t discuss their dangers enough and i believe it is one of the most dangerous drugs around what does it do ? grosso modo , it immediately depletes serotonin and other gaba chemicals , and diminishes the work of the gates , thus allowing all kinds of pain on all levels from surging ensemble toward the prefrontal cortex gamma amino butyric acid is a repressor holding down pain and blocking against feeling hurt what acid does is disrupt gating and allow us to feel our pain but all at once since that constitutes an overload , the exact feelings are blocked or disconnected but their energy level gets through to higher centers and what do those higher centers do ? they absorb all that force and begin the cognitive defense against it they do what any person does when overloaded with imprinted pain they manufacture far out , bizarre ideas to encapsulate the force this is true with lsd and in everyday life that is why lsd is sometimes called a psychotomimetic the ideas are far out because they are forced by a heavy load into concocting something and the leitmotif of the feeling , the feeling of feeling , gets through so that the content of the hallucination somehow reflects what the person is dealing with someone is trying to kill me death is near or they feel a cosmic oneness with the universe , which seems like an hallucination to me since what the person is thinking is idiosyncratic solely to her and what helps eradicate the hallucination it for the moment is a tranquilizer pain killer it is so easy to see the connection between pain and hallucinations since pain killers stop those beliefs in their tracks the frontal cortex is the last refuge of defense going psychotic to keep from becoming insane absorbing heavy energy with beliefs before they can affect the heart to produce a fatal cardiac arrest it is not the drug that makes hallucinations it is the pain that has no specific context that drives the higher levels to become exotic there is a context but it is usually a very early imprint with no specific scene attached its force , however , is preverbal with life threatening consequences there is no specific scene for the cortex to hang onto if at first you had a good trip , it is because you have a good enough defense system to allow only some of the pain through like smoking pot but you will have a bad trip when first line terrors and rage surge through to produce the equivalent of a nightmare and indeed , the trip is a nightmare daymares are nightmares with the sunlight otherwise , no difference terror is terror , day and night the physiology does not change when the sun goes down it bursts through unchecked because beliefs which work in see saw fashion with imprinted feelings , are not strong enough to hold them down then you make no sense these neural gates are not huxley s doors to perception on the contrary they block perception in specific ways and allow only global perceptions so called universal truths you are never one with yourself or with the cosmos you mind has flown into pieces and you can only recapture pieces of yourself you feel liberated because the lid of the repressive load has been temporarily lifted it is primal therapy on speed instead of getting to one feeling at a time and integrating it you get to all at once and it is really too much but you do not have enough critical faculties left to understand what is happening we did lsd research decades ago and found the brain very speeded up but with low amplitude which means to us the breakdown of defenses we see on patients on the verge of deep non verbal feeling that defenses mount with the heightening of the amplitude when they crash , so does the amplitude and after some ten trips the effects last for years trouble sleeping , needing tranquilizers , cannot concentrate and unstable behavior , in general that is the danger of rebirthing and drugs that prematurely unleash early pains out of sequence you can and do often get hallucinations at one with the cosmos , etc i have seen it over and over in those who take drugs , smoke pot all of the time , or go to rebirthing centers they come to us overloaded and seemingly in space they are not all there when a booga booga therapist thinks this is a good response to his therapy , watch out when his beliefs merge with the patient all is lost when the therapist thinks that at one with the universe is to be fervently sought they are both hallucinating integration is the sine qua non of progress in psychotherapy nothing artificial can make that happen it is a biologic law not to be abrogated because someone has invented a quick way to ourselves to defy biologic laws is to contravene nature and natural law to bypass nature means not to get well , for it is only through nature that we can be cured we need to go at nature s pace , follow the rhythm of the evolution and not hurry the process up the human brain is a delicate instrument we need to play it carefully lsd has been used for treating depression what it does is ease the cap of repression and thereby easing depression , which , as i have said over and over , depression is repression elevated to a high level one no longer feels the specific feelings they are usually preverbal and heavy valence so that they cannot be accessed easily the writer in the article marc lewis went from lsd to heroin no surprise since the gates had been flung open by lsd and needed closing what better way than through a powerful painkiller if he did our therapy he would not need heroin he would have felt the pain in all its agony one piece at a time lsd shows us nothing except how it feels not to repress pain for a brief moment that is good getting there through drugs is definitely not good doing the artificial can never produce natural responses and it is always nature we are after we are after inner harmony , and only nature can provide it
