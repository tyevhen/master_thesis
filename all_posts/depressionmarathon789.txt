tired worked hours today , and i 've still got paperwork to do but you know what ? except for missing my softball game tonight , i did n't mind i like working in home health care so much that hours does n't feel like a long time especially since more than of those hours came with driving to and from one patient we cover counties , and today i think i traveled to the furthest reaches of the furthest county we cover so i'm tired and it 's way past my bed time i 'll catch you up tomorrow
