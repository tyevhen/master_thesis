astrazeneca is really pulling out all the stops in marketing seroquel first , there was the misleading marketing regarding seroquel that got them slapped by the fda let 's also not forget about the new astroturfing campaign involving nami add in the clinical trials testing seroquel for everything here , here , here , and here once these trial results are published , look for seroquel to be marketed stealthily off label and , of course , we have the sponsored editorials this time , it 's the same one i mentioned earlier here and here and it appears in the january issue of the journal of clinical psychiatry as i 've said before , it 's well beyond unacceptable for an independent journal to run a sponsored editorial unbelievable i 've got my own idea for a spot in a journal stealth marketing it may be more common than you think you like ?
