gardiner harris has an article in today 's new york times called talk does n't pay so psychiatrists turn to drug therapy the article is a twist on an old shrink rap topic why your shrink does n't take your insurance only in this article , the shrink does take your insurance , he just does n't talk to you with his life and second marriage falling apart , the man said he needed help but the psychiatrist , dr donald levin , stopped him and said hold it i m not your therapist i could adjust your medications , but i don t think that s appropriate ah , dr levin sees patients a day and the doc is years old this guy is amazing , there is no way i could see patients a day for even one day he 's worried about his retirement , but i would n't make it to retirement at that pace should we take a bet on whether dr levin has a blog ? so the article has a whimsical , oh but for the good old days tone in and out psychiatry based on prescribing medications for psychiatric disorders is bad , but the article does n't say why in the vignettes , the patients get better and they like the psychiatrist maybe medications work and psychotherapy was over emphasized in the days of old ? the patients do n't complain of being short changed , and if dr levin can get patients a day better for your guess is as good as mine , but let 's say a pop and they only have to come every one to three months , and there 's a shortage of psychiatrists , then what 's the problem ? why in the world would anyone pay to have regular psychotherapy sessions with the likes of someone like me ? after my post last week about the patient who did n't like the doc on line , i'm a bit skeptical about on line reviews still , i googled the psychiatrist in the story , and the on line reviews are not as uniformly positive as those given by the patients who spoke to mr harris some were scathing , and they complained about how little time he spends with them in all fairness , others were glowing the article makes psychiatrists sound like money hungry , unfeeling , uncaring , sociopaths either they 're charging a session oh , can i have that job ? or the financial aspect is so important that they 're completely compromising their values for the sake of a buck this doctor believes that patients get the best care when they receive psychotherapy , and the rendition mr harris gives is that it 's understandable that he 's compromised his values to maintain a certain income i do n't buy it and i do n't think it portrays psychiatrists accurately or favorably if the doctor felt that it was the high ground to give treatment to patients a day who otherwise could n't get care , then this portrayal would n't be so bad and that may be the case i do n't know him and i do n't know mr harris and i do know that an occasional reporter has been known to slant a story i found it odd that there were no other options here aside from patients hour , hours day , not to mention the emergency phone calls a day that he manages in the midst of all the chaos why has n't this doctor left the insurance networks and gone to a fee for service model with a low volume practice if psychotherapy is what he enjoys and what he feels is best ? or why does n't he devote an hour or two a day to psychotherapy ? okay , i should n't rag on the poor doc , i only know him through a newspaper portrayal , but i do n't think this article showed psychiatry at its finest hour and yes , i know there are psychiatrists out there who have very high volume practices
