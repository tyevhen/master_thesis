self portrait , fitful , oil on canvas , x , , is a paradoxical painting if the viewer did not see the title , would he she think that i was sleeping peacefully , under the watchful eye of my cat ? it would seem so , however the title is very indicative of how i was feeling at the time i thought it would provide a nice contrast between what is seen on the canvas and what the title would imply i like schisms a contrast in the viewer 's initial impression of my work with additional clues to the narrative provided by the title i intentionally leave many of my titles pretty static , perfunctory , almost clinical i am not one to swan about with wildian titles such as my own private melancholia or the existential dilemma i fight with that is the job of the paint , to provide clues as to what is happening on the canvas i do really think that titles can hinder paintings what do most people do after they take a quick scan of a piece of art ? they look at the title now , that little card can provide some great knowledge about the piece , but perhaps we should look at that sculpture , photograph or etching and formulate some of our own ideas about it before we seek the counsel of the little white card beside it i am ranting here but my point is that personally , my titles serve to provide little hints of information , not hand the meaning to the viewer on a platter i have said this before and i will say it again i want people to draw their own creative conclusions ultimately the title is merely a railing on which they can rest their hands for awhile while they guide themselves down or up the stairs self portrait , fitful is the product of a rather manic bout of reference shooting deadlines were looming , inspiration was almost non existent and my cat simon was terribly interested in why i was acting so strangely it was not a happy day , not a peaceful time therein is the real irony as i have had people comment that i looked like i was quite serene not at all i was anxious and desperately wanted some magic to happen on a quick technical point , the blacks of my comforter were fun to paint i could write a whole entry on blacks , mixing them and having fun with their different permutations depending on the ratio and colours used to make said tone i have written about blacks before , but they do fascinate me , perhaps because they really are a conundrum they have all colours in them and yet they appear devoid of colour sometimes also , my episode of the artist 's life on bravo ! channel aired today i will be sure to post when it will be shown again to give you , dear reader , some time to perhaps set up your pvr or vcr if you are interested in seeing it i paint self portraits because i am so often alone , because i am the person i know best frida kahlo
