photo publish on web here when you fall , don t get back up so quickly everyone has heard that common response to failure to get back up or to keep trying perhaps you have even said those phrases to others in times of trial behind the words are sincere intentions , of course sometimes , however , i think the advice is more of a reaction than a thoughtful response concluded from reflection i am human everyone reading this is a human thus , we have all fallen , and we have all failed at a something at some point in our life it s been drilled into our brains to get back up and to keep trying it is so ingrained in our response that , i fear , we miss a key aspect about life by no means should you stop trying and stop getting back up when you fall yet , as a catholic , i believe that everything happens for reason if we get up too quickly after a mistake , we could miss that reason god allowed us to fail during my college years and the years after , i failed many times i got back up again as quickly as i could so fast that i didn t even acknowledging that i fell i was so perplexed as to why i continued to make the same mistakes over and over my real failure was that i never learned what it meant to be fallen i never learned how to live with my broken self i was so concerned with being raised up that i forgot about being saved , and the one who was doing the saving when i looked at my life through the brokenness , things looked different i realized my great need to be saved i realized my intense need for god now when i fall , i see a glimpse of the incredible love god has for me he doesn t need me at all but i need him more than anything else if i never fell , if i never felt broken , would i have ever realized the depth of his love ? you are not a failure if you are fallen jesus christ came to restore the broken , and to raise up the fallen if you do not acknowledge your brokenness or your need to be saved , how can you allow him to save you ? be okay with being broken be okay with not being perfect it is only in those experiences that one can witness perfect love by all means , never stop trying to get back up again don t delay coming back to god in the sacraments but also , do not despair when you fall because we cannot be raised unless first we fall
