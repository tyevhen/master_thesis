hey everyone i'm taking a short break from packing moving , ugh to write this blog post and make a couple phone calls do you have a couple minutes ? sady doyle recently published a list of dems who support hr if you 're not sure what hr is , here 's a nice primer from mother jones i 'd appreciate it if y'all could take a second and contact one or two of them and tell them that this is not okay hr is not about saving tax payers money fyi , abortions were paid for by medicaid in we 're talking fractions of pennies compared to the debt we 're in source according to this bill , most rape survivors were n't really raped , and they will be denied coverage for abortion from their own private insurance so , tax payers wo n't be saving money and the government is regulating private insurance wtf , gop and the dems on the list , too ! ?
