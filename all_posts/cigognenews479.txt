dr aj primal principle you know it s funny drugs normalize the reason you get addicted is because you try to normalize the system and then they are taking away drugs why ? until you get normalized here , you need them the whole system is on its head i tried to offer the nimh my cure for addiction , and they said , see my friend in l a the guy s name is allen leshner and i said , why do i have to go to your friend in la when you are right here ? and he said , you have to go through my friend because i just don t deal with that anyway , that s my shit what about you , frank ? frank well , one of the first things i thought of when you were asking why did it keep coming up there like that and why did it affect your thinking ? my thought right then was , don t bug me , i m trying to survive i don t have time for this crap up here this studying i could never do my homework i was always scared i d sit on the couch and tying myself in knots physically and my dad screaming , sit on that goddamn couch like you re suppose to ! straighten up ! and i m just terrified my whole life growing up dr aj you were terrified of your father ? frank oh , yes dr aj to david and you were terrified of your mother frank i was terrified of her too dr aj to ken and you , your mother ? ken oh , yeah , she was a razor dr aj so that s how you exacerbate the whole thing from the start david what it does , in my opinion , is it keeps the gates from having any chance to close for me , i developed no defenses i tried to develop them later on but i had none i was just frank my only refuge was to go in my head and have fantasies of being captain marvel or some omnipotence fantasy , or saving the world or dr aj could you study as a kid ? frank i couldn t really study because it was so hard to keep focused in a book and even to this day i still depend a lot on audiobooks because i ll either space out , or , because i only have one eye , my eye won t stay focused , even with glasses , because the focus is changing , or nod off , or go off thinking of something else and virtually everything i read triggers a new thought pattern i have to think out dr aj at ken and david do you have that too ? david i ll be reading something and then one sentence will grab me and i ll start ruminating about it all the different angles and dr aj because ? david it s the gating there s the ability to focus and prioritize now , i m better at it but it still grabs me it s very hard to pick out the most important thing they all have a very similar level of importance and we ve talked about this , whether it s the bird chirping out the window or the boring english teacher dr aj that s one of the hallmarks of add it s the inability to get the values and priorities , the most important thing , straight david because they all have import , and like frank says , the vigilance is always coming up dr aj is that right ? turning to frank it s that way with you ? frank yes , when i was listening to him i was thinking that s why he knows my defense system so well he can relate to it directly it s not through books or anything he knows those feelings i m having those gwizshy gwizshy feelings it s the only word i could think up that approximates the feelings i have that are just tearing me apart i have to jump up and dr aj do you know what s causing it ? frank what it always goes to is i m trying to get out of here ! dr aj isn t that interesting frank i m literally trying to get out of my own skin dr aj you re trying to get out frank yeah , it certainly works out in my birth sequence and i do a little head banging too but i ve never been able to focus in on exactly what s happening , when i m going through a birth thing after i come out of it , i can t tell you if i m in utero or in vagina or if i m out when i think i m in utero is when i feel completely crushed and i feel like somebody is trying to twist my head of course my whole process is the curse of sisyphus in my birth i m trying and trying and trying to get out until i think i ve made it and then phew ! everything just turns to shit and i just give up to die dr aj because ? frank because i can t do it no more i m done i m finished and that s been a pattern throughout my life i come so close to success i think i ve made it i think i ve made it , and then pshew my whole life turns to shit dr aj was that because your mother was drugged ? frank well , she smoked she drank they thought it was oh , well , lets let him get a little tight too but you have to remember , this was in the s they had no idea what they were doing dr aj it s funny , you know , in the s my mother was psychotic and they didn t have shock therapy in those days , so we had to move to the beach where she had to go in cold water every day to have shock and that shocked her and tried to keep her sane david the cold water , it closed her gates dr aj yeah , it did isn t that funny ? but i m not sure how much it did , she was so wacko but that feeling i ve got to get out of here i think no matter where you are in a confined space , like a classroom , that feeling , i ve got to get out of here david i ve got both i ve got to get through and i ve got to get out of here it s actually more i ve got to get through if i m feeling blocked , if i can t get through to someone , if i can t make them understand what i m trying to say boy , that sensation of uumph comes it s a frustration it s a frustrated need if you will , to be understood or get through to someone and at the very bottom , just to get through dr aj when you had a project , did you get through , did you finish ? david no , i mean i had to wait until the last minute the pressure on the outside had to be greater than the pressure on the inside dr aj now , have you got that ? motioning to everyone this is really important and it probably is good for you too this applies to everybody david and i want everyone who s out there watching this to know it probably sounds just like words , but the suffering people go through with this thing is really not to be taken lightly dr aj well , you can t concentrate , you can t sleep david if you want to put a word on adhd , for me the word is failure failure , i failed to get my parents to love me , i failed at the projects i used to do , and i failed at my birth dr aj and you felt like a failure david yes , and i felt like a failure that s one of the things i liked about this program on pbs , again i know they re only words , but it had a little palliative effect it doesn t last long but nevertheless , you know when people call you crazy , lazy , and stupid , you know that little thing , well , that s what i was called my parents called me all of that , and then i get tested and my iq is kind of high , in the s or something well , gee , he s not stupid , then he must be lazy but all the time , i can t focus , i m trying to survive dr aj because there s so much to focus on inside david yeah , there s so much to focus on inside , exactly frank i get a hundred projects going on at the same time even now , i have a hard time with that i m busy working on a fiction novel , and i m busy working on a nonfiction book , i m busy with my primal therapy , i m busy with my therapy at fsa , and now i m in training here , and i m trying to shift my priorities and get rid of all the stuff i don t need so i can focus on just here , and take care of my fsa patients dr aj i should add , that these guys are on their masters and doctors so here we ve got three guys that are messes but can function and get on with their advanced degrees now how do you account for that ? frank but wait a minute i couldn t really function until i came to primal therapy i mean i came here so i could feel a little bit better before i died david that s right i remember that s what brought you in dr aj what s that ? david when i asked frank what brought him here when he started therapy , he said he was coming here just so he could feel a little bit better before he died those were his exact words frank i mean i d given away my martin d guitar , years old i thought i had no more use for it i mean you were the last thing on my bucket list and then when i came here after a year and a half i thought what am i going to do with the rest of my life so i thought i ll go to graduate school dr aj and you did frank yeah , thanks to you , and thanks to david dr aj i know how hard it is , yet you guys do it it s a miracle the question is , what kind of feelings allow you to do this now ? frank well , ken said it in his dissertation i get in touch with me the real me down here what do i want ? and as long as i can stay with that the failure doesn t take over but otherwise , every time i hit a real hard spot whew , i collapse dr aj so that s a repeat of the birth sequence frank my whole life has been a repeat of my birth and now i can say , oh , here come those feelings i m ready to mess it all up and give up to die i mean it s over and over i m in a suicidal dr aj i just understood it he s always next to death that s what s coming up all the time david yes that s exactly right that s the failure dr aj turning to ken you too ? ken yeah , but not the add i can t sleep lately the anxiety is always coming up and it s to die and the terror thing that you are talking about , it just so rings a bell and when i get to that in therapy it s not therapy anymore it s not like oh , feel that it s fuck that i m out of here there s not an option to feel it it s just terror dr aj do you know where it comes from ? ken yeah , i know being trapped and stuck and not being able to breathe and being alone it s just all that dr aj and when you re trapped , what happens like being in a classroom and having to study what happens ? ken i m antsy , i m moving around , i do other things it takes me , i mean doing my dissertation , it s been years i m great at procrastinating , or doing something else you know , just sitting down to do it it s been really hard like i was saying reading , that s so hard , like i fall asleep i get so bored dr aj procrastinating that s one of the key points of add what s causing it because i know , but do you know ? frank when it gets too hard , i can t take it anymore so i ll go to something that s easy and i ll keep going and going with that until it gets too hard and can t do it anymore and i ll switch over to another one dr aj right frank but i get going until the pressure of the old pain has made me so nervous and so upset and tense , i ve got to go on to other stuff and i had such a startle reflex that when i watched a tv program , as soon as it got really tense , like someone was about to get killed or something , i d jump up and run out of the room and when i m out of there why d i do that ? and then i stop to think dr aj wow how about you guys , do you procrastinate a lot ? david i can tell you what it is for me to sit down , focus , and finish a project , for me that is a sensation of confinement you re asking me to go into a very small space , that is my subjective experience you are hurting me by asking that i ve got to move no , i can t you re going to kill me dr aj and you can t get down to anything david no , i can t you re putting me in a real bad situation dr aj why can t you get down to something ? and you too , ken ? david because the feeling is very overwhelming i know this sounds so melodramatic and people watching this , trust me , it s not melodramatic i m using words that sound melodramatic but that is how big the feeling is i m being crushed to death i mean you want me to go and sit here and read and concentrate on a book that is as boring as the day is long , and if not enjoy it at least be there with it and learn from it and my brain is just crackling trying to get out of it trying to get out of a space , it s confinement you re blocking me you re blocking my movement you re blocking air , it s terrible ken a couple of things resonated it s just , i get this feeling it s the only way i can answer it about procrastinating i get this feeling that i m being held down it s like this rage i ve got to move i ve got to get out of here i ve got to move and i m not sure how it applies but i guess that s what it s like making myself sit there and do something like that and the only way i could do my dissertation is because i did it about something that meant something to me david that s right it means something to you and if that meaning overpowers that in there , you can lock in and you re ok dr aj what makes you finally get down to something ? david like i said , the pressure from the outside has to be greater than that on the inside for me that s a lot and number two , if the thing is so stimulating for me , like the research i used to do and do in here that is so stimulating , it can abate it can ameliorate , and kind of put a lid on dr aj it soups up the function of the prefrontal cortex , which pushes the top gating david right , and helps focus because of the gating that s right frank and when you have so many thoughts coming in like if you re writing something , and all these thoughts come in , pretty soon it s like there s no way possible i can get all these thoughts in here and make them all right and so i get up and pace dr aj but how do you finally get down to it ? frank tenacity one , go back , and go back , and go back david you asked me to do the add thing you ask me on a friday and say , can you have it to me by tomorrow what ? and then i sit down and start to write a little and there s this thought attached to it and this thought attached to it and you can go into each channel and it s like ha frank little things get real big dr aj i ask you guys to have something done in three days and you couldn t do it because ? david well , i have a great rationale for it i m doing sessions every day , and all that but nonetheless the point is well taken i sit down and start to write it and it s overwhelming it s overwhelming there is so much to it it s not a just write it , there s so much to it and then there s making sense of it , and then there s putting it together into coherence and there s a thought here , and a thought here and yes they relate but coherence , yeah , and on to resolution frank to get a first draft done , the first thing i ve got to do is to get my judgments to get out of there because always it has to be right so help me god , that better be right ! you know my dad that , and then another thing with me , when i was a toddler , i had severe eczema , and they would put this real stingy salve on me underneath that is a big itch then they would put socks on my hands , so i couldn t scratch myself and then they would tie my hands to either side of the crib , and then leave me there to go to sleep to cry myself to sleep dr aj unbelievable you know , by the way , primal point that the best treatment for this eczema stuff is to rub the person to sooth them to do what should have happened to them in the first place to be continued next sunday
