often i will hear on tv and movies and even talking with your friends holy cow that guy is so schizo or she has so many personalities its like she is bipolar it gives me , and i'm sure other mental health professionals a nice laugh when we hear this though after my initial amusement , you can usually hear me yelling at the tv saying stop being ignorant hollywood you 're using it wrong ! ! ! so i thought , maybe this would be a good time to explain the misconceptions or stereotypes of certain mental health disorders there are n't too many people who confuse so many of the disorders mainly because there are over mental disorders listed in the dsm iv tr , but i think the following three are the ones many people misuse schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder ocd so here we go ! schizophrenia schizophrenia is a chronic , more or less debilitating illness characterized by perturbations in cognition , affect and behavior , all of which have a bizarre aspect two or more of the following , each present for a significant portion of time during a month period or less if successfully treated delusions , hallucinations , disorganized speech e g , frequent derailment or incoherence , grossly , disorganized or catatonic behavior , negative symptoms i think people get it confused with dissociative identity disorderdid , formerly known as multiple personality disorder i have heard people use their understanding of did , but tag it as schizophrenia they could n't be more wrong as stated , none of the symptoms above show any part of a person displaying other personalities delusions , hallucinations , slurred speech yes an adult male thinking he has another personality but in a child version of himself no bipolar disorder bipolar is characterized by having significant mood changes that last from weeks to months at a time patients will experience at least one manic episode where the mood is an elevated one followed by a period of normalcy or balance for at least two months before an onset of a major depressive episode these mood changes cannot be due to schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , psychotic disorder or delusion disorder i have also heard people refer to bipolar as that guy is seriously delusional at times he must be bipolar or something clearly , he will not have those symptoms if he is bipolar i always think about bipolar being similar to a pendulum swing on speedmanic episodes and on weeddepressive episodes the above definition makes it very clear how it is not like any of disorder in the dsm iv tr obsessive compulsive disorder is an anxiety characterized by complaints of persistent or repetitive thoughts obsessions or behaviors compulsions the person feels compelled to continue despite an awareness that the thoughts or behaviors may be excessive or inappropriate , and feels distress if they stop them in response to their obsessions , most people with ocd resort to repetitive behaviors called compulsions i am guilty of using ocd incorrectly at times myself for instance , i like to make sure my apartment and my desk at workeven my lunch is neat , not so much as in clean , but that if i have piles of papers at least they are in a neat pile on the table , so those of you who do n't know me , i usually say i am ocd about neatness if you read the above definition , i do n't really have ocd if my apartment or desk are n't clean , but i need to take care of something , i will be able to put off making it neat until i come home or finish the task my day can continue without me being able to make my desk or apartment neat those who suffer from ocd will be unable to move onto other tasks and their daily life unless they are able to complete their compulsions which will help combat their anxieties displayed by their obsessions i hope today 's post gave you a little insight , and hopefully helped you in how you use these terminologies in your everyday vernacular have a fantastic day ! yes
