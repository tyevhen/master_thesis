dear a b curtiss , after reading the summary of your book depression is a choice , i came across many things that i had discovered personally although i have no scientific knowledge of depression or manic depression , i know what its like to snap from the neocortex to the subcortex in reading the summary of your book , i was reassured , in a sense , that what i have been going through is valid i have found to beat the cycle of depression , it is about creating yourself at every waking moment , completely giving up any preconceived notion of yourself , and ultimately shutting off the past i understand this may be hard for those who are traumatized by deaths in the family , ptsd etc , however i believe with these techniques depression merely turns into a thing of the past a phrase that is commonly used to fuel the booming pharmaceutical economy i am glad that i have found someone that sees past all of the medication and modern treatment that most of the depressed consider in summary , i really enjoyed reading the summary on your book and i plan to purchase it soon ! thank you for your time , and may god be with you tn dear tn , thanks for your letter i sent it on to someone i thought could learn something from it without your name and she said that this sentence was very helpful i have found a way to beat the cycle of depression , it is about creating yourself at every waking moment , completely giving up any preconceived notion of yourself , and ultimately shutting off the past a b curtiss
