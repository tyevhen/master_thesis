on top of being scared that i would end my life , i was scared that depression would end my relationships sometimes , the only thing that kept me alive was the thought of hurting the ones i loved at those times , i could care less about myself but i cared about other people i have to thank my husband , my family , and my friends for loving me and caring about me through thick and thin in my darkest of moments , my relationships were what got me through , whether or not they knew it at the time depression affects millions of people every year among those suffering from depression , those people who have a support system are less likely to commit suicide see stats ask anyone who gambles those are good odds another thing that kept me going , was reading about other people who have survived depression those witnesses don t know they help me , but i have included them in my support system too speaking of surviving , i found a good quote a while back that has consistently calmed me it reads if depression had no termination , then suicide would , indeed , be the only remedy but one need not sound the false or inspirational note to stress the truth that depression is not the soul s annihilation men and women who have recovered from the disease and they are countless bear witness to what is probably its only saving grace it is conquerable by william styron , darkness visible because other people have survived , i am saved by their grace and graced by their salvation i have to read that paragraph over and over , word for word depression is not the soul s annihilation that line gets me every time if depression did obliterate the soul , there would be no hope but there is always hope , always hope , always hope countless others have lived to prove it
