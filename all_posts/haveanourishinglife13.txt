a new day , a fresh day with no mistakes in it yet i think annie of green gables might have said something along those lines i do n't feel like looking it up lazy , i guess i am already feeling defeated before the day even really starts hmmmmm before , like in college and before kids , i used the beginning of a new day as a natural reset button it feels logical to start over on a new day the sun will come out tomorrow kind of thing in the past , if i was having a really difficult time , i would check out for the day , isolate myself , read in my bed , watch tv , cancel all activities , etc not exact healthy , but it kept me going i definitely ca n't do that now as much as i 'd like to check out until i can start again tomorrow , i have two itsy bitsy kids who need me to stay checked in so how can i click the reset button during the day ? i am really limited in what i can do i would like to go for a run make a cup of coffee and read on the porch go to church and pray a rosary take a minute nap but i ca n't do those things right now , because what are these kiddos going to do ? but , by the time i can coordinate a last minute babysitter , if i can do it which has more to do with me admitting i need help , it seems to turn out more stressful then if i would have just let it go missed nap times , missed meals , missed poopy diapers resulting in diaper rashes , them just needing more mommy attention and getting the screamies i feel so guilty about using television i feel like i need to figure out another way to save the day this week , i'm like , no more tv but it 's monday morning at am and i 've already caved what do you do ? how do you reset in the middle or beginning of the day ?
