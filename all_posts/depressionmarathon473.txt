my heart is broken today i am overwhelmed with grief my beloved puck is no longer here by my side no longer do i hear his nails click , click , clicking across the hardwood floors his repositioning groans are absent and his heavy sighs have disappeared i dropped something on the floor and immediately expected his quizzical look off to my left , but it was n't there there are empty beds in every room , and lonely toys and balls strewn across the living room floor i hesitate to vacuum for fear of losing every trace of his physical presence i knew this time would eventually come , but it came so suddenly , and this is the hardest thing , by far , i 've ever had to endure puck developed internal , abdominal hemorrhaging around pm thursday night i rushed him to the emergency vet clinic when it became clear to me that something was wrong he was using every muscle he had just to breathe , and he could n't stand up the emergency vet found bloody fluid in his abdominal cavity she surmised he had a malignant tumor which had ruptured apparently , this is quite common in older labs and retrievers there was a possibility it was an isolated incident , and the bleeding would stop , and he would fully recover surgery was an option , too but where there is one tumor , there are often several , she said , and it would only be a matter of time before another one ruptured even with surgery , his life expectancy would likely have been only months it was too little reward , i thought , for the pain i would have had to put him through he stabilized enough in the emergency clinic that i was able to take him home we laid on the bed together my friend cindy also spent the night he did n't sleep , and by the middle of the night , it became clear he was n't improving it was at that point that i made the most difficult decision i 've ever had to make it was time to let him go i snuggled with him and tried to make him comfortable for the rest of the night cindy drove us to the vet yesterday morning , and we began the process of saying goodbye cindy and i stayed with him through the end it was impossible even my vet cried everybody loved puck i know today he 's in a better place i have to believe he 's running free in some unbelievably magical place , without pain and with pure abandon , just the way he did in his earlier years i have to hold on to the possibility that we will meet again i have to , or the pain is simply too much to bear my heart is broken i'm overwhelmed with grief i'm trying my best to walk through it with dignity and grace i'm sure that 's how puck would 've wanted it i love you and miss you , buddy
