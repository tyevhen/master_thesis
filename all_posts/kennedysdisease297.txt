for many years i felt that something was terribly wrong with me , but i lived a life of denial believing that if i did not acknowledge it , perhaps it would go away then fifteen years ago my neurologist ran a series of tests and concluded that i had kennedy s disease spinal bulbar muscular atrophy he recommended that i see a specialist at the university of pennsylvania a dr kenneth kurt fischbeck and the rest is history fifteen years ago dr fischbeck believed that we should have a treatment in five to ten years unfortunately , research is not an exact science and predictions do not always happen as planned yet , my hope never diminished about a year or so ago reality came a calling my expectations , hopes and prayers for an effective treatment had been tested many times watching my strength wasting away as my muscles withered has taken a toll on me experience is a great teacher and , perhaps wisdom does come with age whatever you want to call it , i realize that a treatment cannot reverse what has happened to my body so now i just hope and pray that i can maintain a certain 'quality of life i have said many times that hope is what we live for if it weren t for hope and faith life would be much more difficult that does not mean that reality cannot enter into the equation and with it a new sense of realism some of my audience will read into this article more than what i am saying please don t ! this acknowledgement does not mean that i have given up or i am depressed it is nothing more than another form of acceptance furthermore , this new level of acceptance has allowed me to focus even more on the words working together to find a cure if not for our generation , then for our children and our grandchildren
