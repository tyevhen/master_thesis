i have written about the prototype before it is that traumatic event that impacts the fetal system and changes its evolutionary trajectory it helps set up who we become later on and warps our personality it also directs how we react to the trauma at birth , if there was one a carrying mother smoking a half pack a day , and then suffering from lack of oxygen at birth a lack of oxygen would compound the prenatal asphyxiation and warp the development of personality the memory is then stamped in so that it governs all future behavior in the event of stress it is the limbic system , most particularly the hippocampus , with a bit of help from the amygdala and striatum , which scans history and automatically finds the prototype , the imprint that originally fixed the survival mode for the organism this survival reaction becomes fixed and directs us for a lifetime of course it can be compounded by later events in childhood let us keep in mind the prototype when trying to understand sex to reiterate high excitation in sex can be taken as a danger by the system because the original high level of excitation was a danger the system cannot distinguish between the two since they have an equal force or valence in this way sexual stimulation can trigger off the original trauma and our reaction to it the brainwave patterns of past and present become indistinguishable so that sex and trauma fuse and run off identically together it is the hijack they are old friends sex climbs aboard the trauma vehicle and goes along for the ride but it goes where the trauma takes it and no place else it leads the way because it involves survival that is what is reawakened during sexual activation that is why we can examine sex life and look back to the kind of birth and pre birth that the person underwent in this way when there is an excess of stimulation there is an immediate shutdown or shut off the very same reaction as originally sex stops abruptly when a certain level of excitation is achieved we can look at birth and predict the kinds of sex problems there may be in the future this is in general terms there are many other factors that play into this equation but in an overall sense it holds true i am focusing for now on what has been left out of the equation conversely , we can look at sexual behavior and post dict look back on the kind of prenatal and birth life one has undergone because pain insinuates itself into sexual behavior with the identical imprinted force , it seems clear that once pain is felt for what it is there will be radical changes in sexual conduct sex will no longer be a conduit for something else but will be what it is pain will no longer be rerouted into sexual rituals by the limbic system because pain will no longer be a factor during the reliving , the whole physiologic system joins in the fray it must be otherwise it is not a valid , complete memory , and not curative the same blood pressure , heart rate and vascular processes are there we can measure the trauma and its force in this way we can estimate the effects certain events have on sex , as well as other behaviors ordinarily , the voyage to our depths is not a difficult trip when we consider that current feelings are an elaboration of early sensations if we take care to allow the brain to follow its own evolution and do not talk too much or exert too much control in therapy the therapy is usually successful if we abstain from intellectual control and third line discussion we will find the patient going back in time in ordered fashion this will happen if we have no preconceived ideas or anti evolutionary theories about what the patient has to do we need to trust the process and above all , trust feelings these feelings lie in a different universe of discourse from conventional therapy follow the brain follow evolution because evolution follows us that is the key to successful therapy of sex problems one final word yes , it does help to deal directly with sex problems just as one would give shots or pills to the migraine sufferer palliatives are sometimes very necessary no one should suffer until final cure is achieved
