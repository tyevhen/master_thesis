i have been asked are you happy you bought the house yet ? how do i tell people that no , i am not happy i bought the house ? how do i tell people that i feel like i have done a monumental mistake , a mistake that i cannot correct ? i have over extended myself financially , physically and emotionally ? how can i tell people that i regret what i have done and am struggling to find a way to cope with the fall out ? how can i tell people that this may be the one biggest mistake of my life ? the kids have made it quite clear that they are not happy about it either in the last two months , all i seem to hear them say is i hate this and i hate that ! i also hear how nothing is good enough they are angry that i do n't have the money to just keep buying anything my son wants a new laptop again rd one in a year as his current one is also breaking by buying this house i do n't have the money to borrow anymore i do n't even have the money to get interesting food or to eat out mind out i had run out of the bonus or extra money and things were going to get tight anyway , but now things are more tight i thought that by buying rather than renting , it would give them something after i died , but due to my fibromyalgia and bipolar , i cannot be insured , so they will just inherit a whole bunch of debt once more i ca n't do anything right you might also like being careful happy holidays , season 's greetings working mom linkwithin
