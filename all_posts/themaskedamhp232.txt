fast forward to after two years working as an unqualified generic social worker i did a two year certificate of qualification in social work course in those days the training was only two years , and the official social work qualification was the cqsw , and then returned to work in my old area office i had been qualified for about a year when the new area officer , gerald , called me into his office we ve got a request for a mental health act assessment fancy doing it ? i m not sure i m qualified to act as a mental welfare officer , i replied nervously i haven t had any training or anything have a look on your social work warrant what does it say ? i looked at my id card the front had a passport photograph of me , sporting the obligatory long hair and beard of a male social worker of the time , along with my name and the local authority the back said who and what i was and had the signature of the director of social services in rather small print in one corner there was a statement which i had never bothered to study the holder is authorised to act as a mental welfare officer for the purposes of the mental health act i read this out there you go then , gerald said , and proceeded to give me the details of the request and that was my full initiation into the arcane world of mental welfare officers the person i had to assess was an informal patient on one of the wards of the local victorian asylum which thankfully no longer exists peter was a married man in his s who had been admitted because he was believed to be delusional although he had initially agreed to the admission , he was now suspicious that the hospital was a part of the conspiracy against him i spent an hour reading up on the mental health act and the relevant sections i was desperately trying to remember the training i had had on my social work course and the things i had learned from observing a few assessments carried out by other mwo s then i went to the ward to interview the patient he seemed pleased to see me this will explain everything , he said , giving me an exercise book filled with neat handwriting i started to read it it detailed his life when working as an engineer in an african state that had previously been under colonial rule he had basically lived , with his wife , in a post colonial enclave , which , he said in his account , was run by the masons he had never been much enamoured of the masons , and when he discovered that they were providing local women to single and married british men for personal services , he decided to blow the whistle on the whole thing the masons had , of course , objected to this , and , according to him , had made it impossible for him to continue working there and he had then returned to his home town in england even there , he told me , he had continued to be hounded by the masons , who were preventing him from getting work and were making his life not worth living and now , he said , after i had read at least some of the exercise book , they re getting to me here they re drugging me , they don t want me to tell they want to kill me ! i had little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that peter was extremely unwell , and was displaying clear symptoms of psychosis , including paranoid delusions the consultant had already completed a medical recommendation , and another doctor had already been to assess him and had left his recommendation although i was unable to contact his nearest relative to discuss the assessment with her , i duly completed an application under sec for assessment this was the act , remember it felt good it had been a comparatively straightforward assessment the patient was already in hospital , and was displaying clear signs of mental illness i felt i had managed the whole thing rather well a few days later , i visited his wife to discuss the situation with her i told her about the contents of the exercise book , and his belief that the masons had been conspiring against him oh yes , she said all that s true it did happen it really got him down we had to leave the country because of it a month later i completed my second mental health act assessment when i detained him under sec of the act , for treatment he was still clearly unwell , but this time he had a diagnosis of depression
