ms scott , designer and girlfriend of mick jagger hanged herself yesterday in her apartment in new york the question is , why ? could anyone have seen it coming ? mick , maybe ? i doubt it here is why she had just about everything in life although she was in debt , she lived well and lived high with jagger yet she took the trouble to go through the machinations of hanging why not the simpler out , pills ? i will explain the way in is often the way out the same imprint that produced deep hopelessness depression is also what led to her to choose hanging this bespeaks of the enduring life of the imprint this all has to be surmise but i am not limiting my discussion to ms scott but to all of us the reason no one could see it coming is that it was coming from deep inside , thrusting its head through the defensive layers into conscious awareness , where she felt so hopeless and down despite her current surroundings as i have written a mainte reprise , many times over , we respond primarily and firstly to inner imprints and much later to external life and outside circumstance the body and brain are busy reacting to what happened decades earlier during womb life and birth those are the events we continually react to because of their remoteness , something that occurred when we were vulnerable and easily and heavily impacted a mother taking drugs or drinking , heavily depressed herself these lay down engraved memories and last a lifetime and show themselves when we are alone , in a weakened state or otherwise too open to events and why doesn t she run away or go to parties and distract herself ? she cannot the imprint confines her she lives within that primordial memory and cannot imagine or think about other solutions there were no alternatives originally , thus there are none while living in the imprint and the imprint forces her to remain on the same route all over again her hopelessness depression is all consuming and completely channeling she cannot stray outside its bounds the stabs of depression she suffers from is the stab of the mounting memory that periodically surges upwardly toward awareness being alone for a short time can set it off when there are later circumstances of neglect and lack of love the deep imprints become compounded and cemented in , defended and long lasting those later traumas lack of love increase the repression and force unconscious acting out cutting oneself to try to get at the source , hopefully , yet unconsciously but suicide is still a long way off it is amazing how so often people cut themselves , unwittingly digging out the source without even knowing what they are doing the fact of the deep imprint also can lead to hanging for if she were strangling on the cord she is most likely repeat the act it was the closest she came to death and the trauma and its consequences remain that is why i state , the way in is also the way out and years ago when i took notes and studied the problem i found this was almost a universal law we attempt to die in the way our birth was threatened those who were over drugged try pills , those who were mangled at birth try jumping in front of a train , those who were strangled on the cord will try hanging those memories , that of trauma during gestation , last a lifetime and lead to same attempt years later to die in the way it might have happened at the beginning in other words , as the memory of the early trauma rises so does the early result mount , as well thus early strangle leads to later strangle the logic of the system it is confirmation of the imprint and its effect on the system it drives behavior ineluctably so the imprint includes the probable outcome death it channels behavior despite exhortation and encouragement the sense of approaching death what is often articulated for those who have no idea about the imprint is , i don t want to live anymore and even that is not fully articulated it is usually a vague thought or sense it is often not , i am in so much pain i don t want to go on it is just a vague sense of hopelessness and helplessness that leads to an attempt it all remains vague and aleatory a constant rumination inside of a black cloud descending that is why cognitive therapy cannot touch it cognitive tries to re channel behavior but the imprint will have none of it it is far stronger than any re direction or insight that sense of approaching death is what remains marked within us and controls our behavior later on nothing special had to happen at the time just nothing to do and no pal around can do it all by oneself with no current distractions this is the exact replica of her feelings in the womb and becomes the trigger for suicide utter loneliness , no one to help or rescue her she could not articulate this in the womb but now she can and she is interpreting her feelings during life in the womb they are utterly compelling they lead to the outcome that was in the offing originally let me repeat her current life mirrors the original milieu of her current feelings they draw her back to the primal imprint , and force her to repeat the situation again the feelings reactivate the imprint and lead to where they would have originally death l wren s suicide could not be seen coming except by her she must have had an inkling , a deep down unease and hopeless feeling that would have warned her but she had no idea about imprints or deep lying trauma memory that is the reason our theory is so important not so they can come to therapy although preferable but so that they can be aware of what is going on inside and understand what is happening this may avoid needless deaths how tragic and unnecessary all this and now you understand our mission not money nor fame , but the lives of us humans we have a basic right to a full length life
