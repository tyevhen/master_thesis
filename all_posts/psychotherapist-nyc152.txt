this article will be helpful to clients who are n't sure if they need to reevaluate or leave their therapy i have been a psychotherapist for over years and i 've known many therapists i believe that the vast majority of therapists are caring , qualified and ethical professionals most therapists enter the field because they feel a calling to help clients and use their expertise in an appropriate and professional manner but , just as there are unethical people in any profession , there are cases where some therapists should n't be in the profession even if none of these circumstances apply , if you think you 're not making progress in therapy after a reasonable time , you 've discussed this with your therapist and you still do n't know how your therapist is going to help you to overcome your problem , consider that you and your therapist just might not be a good fit or your therapist lacks the skills to help you making a change in your therapy can feel daunting , but continuing to work with a therapist when the therapy is n't right for you is a waste of your time and money if you find yourself in one of these unfortunate circumstances in your therapy and you 're not sure what to do , it might be wise to have a consultation with an experienced , objective therapist to talk over your concerns so you can make a decision about what to do finding the right therapist can make
