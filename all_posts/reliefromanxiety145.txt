my poem , 'raw letter' based upon the stigma of mental health please do not publish without permission copyrights to relief from anxiety dear a person who does n't care to understand mental illness , do you know what it feels like to lose everything you 've ever loved , to lose yourself , to be too scared to face the world , crying in a heap on the floor ? it would seem illogical that someone would stay in hell , if they knew they could leave , so why i am still here , if i knew i could be alive ? but you would n't know what it 's like for the world to black , when everyone else is basking in the sun , you would n't know what it 's like , to think you 're the only one so do n't tell me to be happy , because not everything is possible to change , i 've tried climbing up these walls , but falling down time and again would you ignore me if my blood pressure was too high ? or if i had cancer running through my bones ? you 'd surely tell me to get the right dose of medication , so i could get back on my toes so tell me why i am so bad , if my brain falls ill , and i am not allowed medication , even if it 's me it 's going to kill ? so think again , if i have made this up , because you would n't doubt , if i was coughing my lungs up if you really believe that i would waste my young years , missing out on opportunities and crying blood and tears , if i could just embrace life in all its glory , try telling me again this is just another fictional story do you think it 's fair ? that we only believe in what we can see ? because once in a life the world was flat until it was found what it could really be science has proven that chemicals are at play , it just so happens that blood is n't dripping out of my brain , because that is what it feels like , every single day , but you would n't know because you ca n't see pain we can still work and we can still play we 're just people with high blood pressure living day to day we are more vulnerable , and the media is just a game , it 's time to look out of the box and see the reality the right way we are not killers , and no one is a saint , so stand against your merky view of mental health today
