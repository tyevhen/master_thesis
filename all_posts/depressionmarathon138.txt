i just turned on a baseball game i 've been listening to national public radio all day that 's my usual sunday routine but unlike usual sundays , my radio has not been filled with clever quips and laughter today my usual shows , car talk , wait wait do n't tell me , and prairie home companion , have , of course , been preempted today by constant reporting about the tragedy in orlando , florida i ca n't listen anymore this tragedy this hate crime this terrorist attack this murder of people is really affecting me i 've never mentioned this here before , but i used to be a part of the very community targeted in this attack like the boston marathon bombings , this one feels too close and i do n't get it ! i just do n't get it i ca n't listen anymore i feel overwhelmed by the enormity of one person 's hate it sickens me i'm shocked , horrified and angry my heart aches for the victims and for the hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people directly impacted by this small minded murderer 's actions why ? why ? i do n't understand
