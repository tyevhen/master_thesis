it seems i'm always late to a good party yesterday , i finally did something i 've been meaning to do for , oh , at least two years i compiled and ran my first adobe air application and in typical masochistic fashion , i decided to do it with notepad as my code editor and command line tools for compilation it 's not that i ca n't afford dreamweaver or flash builder , mind you i have both products and recommend them highly it was more a matter of wanting to get dirt under my fingernails , so to speak that 's just how i am the whole process of downloading the air sdk , reading online code examples , and getting my first example up and running took a little less than an hour from start to finish there were only a couple of rough spots both easily resolved the first was creating my own self signed security certificate i did this with the adt tool that comes with the air sdk the magic command line incantation that worked for me was adt certificate cn selfsign ou kt o kas thomas c us rsa cert p password naturally , you 'll want to change some of the parameters e g , the ones with my name and initials , and the password when you do this yourself but running this command should produce a certificate named cert p on your local drive , assuming adt bat windows is in your path for example code , i turned to the text editor example described here i compiled the code with bin adt package storetype pkcs keystore cert p texteditorhtml air application xml running a command console from a location of c air texteditorhtml , with my certificate stored under c air the first time i did this , i got an error of file c air texteditorhtml application xml is not a valid airi or air file if you get the is not a valid airi or air file error , it means you left the trailing period off the foregoing command line note carefully the period after application xml at the very end and that was basically it my first air app done in under an hour now , as shantanu narayen says , let the games begin !
