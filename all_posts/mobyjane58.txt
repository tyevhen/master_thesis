don t wait around for somebody else to boost your spirits be your own best friend and pat yourself on the back now and then i saw the movie the help quite a while ago and found it fairly forgettable since it was all so stereotypical however one small phrase must have impressed me because it came to mind recently it was uttered by the nanny who said so lovingly to the baby , you is beautiful , you is kind , you is smart imagine having someone say that to you every day since you were a baby probably would have made a big difference in your life , wouldn t it ? maybe nobody told us such uplifting things very often when we were young but so what ? we can always tell it to ourselves the thinking that we have to love ourselves first before we can love anybody else has some validity perhaps but the reverse is certainly true if we hate ourselves for any reason , if we are stressed to the limit , it will surely be difficult to connect with anyone else in a loving way and since we are a herd animal , we have a primal need to feel connected so we can use something even as simple as this , with all the incorrect grammar use it as a mantra it probably will do more good than what we may already be using as a mantra i m so discouraged i feel so down on myself i m such a failure i m so damn stressed out all these thoughts , remember , since our brain works by learned association , are instructions to our brain to put us in touch with everything downer and negative in our memory banks yuck so i m going to tell myself and you tell yourself and i ll tell you as well , you is beautiful , you is kind you is smart believe it ! a b curtiss
