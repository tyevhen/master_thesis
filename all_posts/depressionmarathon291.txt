things have been going well i 've been working , running , lifting weights , going to meetings , and generally keeping up with life but today , as they say in bike racing , i apparently cracked i 've fallen a long way down , and i do n't like it one bit the day began as every tuesday and thursday does , with me lifting weights and circuit training in my am , minute class i then had some breakfast , saw my doctor , and did a bit of shopping for my mom 's birthday gift it was a beautiful morning and all was well the plan was to come home after shopping , rest , and watch the tour de france hence the bike racing reference above , before going for my afternoon run and to my evening meeting but the plan did n't materialize after returning home , i began feeling off suddenly i was slammed with fatigue and could barely keep my head up i tried to take a nap , but my brain was n't as sleepy as my body , and it would n't shut up i was bothered by horrible , intrusive thoughts as i fitfully tried to rest without the needed rest , my day quickly went black it all happened so fast my mood followed my energy and dove into the toilet as i sit here now , i'm frustrated and confused i know i should just force myself out of this chair and at least go for a walk i know i should stop typing and get to my thursday night meeting but the motivation is flagging to say the least knowing what i should do and doing it are two very different things there 's still time , of course this very strange , rapidly changing day is not over yet i'm going to make an effort to do something outside my house perhaps it will help likely , it will help but getting out of this chair may take all the energy i 've got i pray it 's a one and done day i pray the sun arising tomorrow lifts me up i do n't have to figure out what happened it is what it is i 'll keep on keeping on after all , this too shall pass i have to count on that
