i'm feeling ambivalent about writing this it 's been a long day , and i do n't necessarily want to focus my energy on how long it 's been but then again , that 's what this blog is for , i guess so here goes i'm feeling paralyzed it 's been a very long day i 've done a little here and a little there , but i 've also taken to my bed for many hours today i'm low my motivation is low i'm overwhelmed little things feel very big too big i'm feeling paralyzed , and i'm so , so frustrated i do n't want to focus on this , because i want it to go away now i know it will go away eventually i 've been doing this long enough to realize that but it 's so frustrating in the mean time i hate feeling paralyzed and that 's all i 've got to say for now
