as i write this , i'm sitting with my feet up recovering in my recliner for the second saturday in a row , i had an awful long run last saturday i had an awful miler , and today my miler sucked this is not a development with which i am pleased ! of course , the weather here is not helping matters it 's been either very cold , as it was last saturday , or very snowy , as it was today but the weather is certainly not the whole story i continue to be physically and mentally drained from the long days in my mood disorder treatment program i'm betting that , and the fact that i'm still carrying extra weight , might also have something to do with struggling to complete each of my last two long runs i hate when running is difficult i especially hate it when i'm actively training for something , as i am now it 's hard for me not to think ahead and worry about the boston marathon i have lots of worry thoughts about not enjoying the experience , struggling to finish , or worse , not finishing at all the thoughts are silly at this early stage , so i'm trying to ignore them and stay positive nonetheless , i really hate when running is difficult however , i am also aware if i am able to use an entire post to complain of my struggles running , things are going pretty darn good and for that , i am quite grateful
