last time , i showed that you could rotate an image degrees in what amounts to one line of javascript , basically just doing pixels reverse rotating an image by an arbitrary amount something other than degrees is almost as easy it requires about lines of code javascript for doing the rotation with the java advanced imaging api is shown below jai makes short work of this and a ton of other graphics transformations all you have to do is be sure the jai jars are in your classpath then you can set up a transformation by creating a parameterblock with appropriate parameters in this case , the x and y coordinates of the rotation origin , the amount of rotation in radians , and optionally a rendering hint as to what kind of pixel interpolation you 'd like in this case , we do n't specify a hint and thus accept the default of interp nearest rotate js kas thomas january public domain requires java advanced imaging library http java sun com products java media jai current html run this file using imagemunger http asserttrue blogspot com simple java class for running scripts html pb new packages java awt image renderable parameterblock pb addsource image pb add new java lang float x origin pb add new java lang float y origin pb add new java lang float math pi rotation amount renderedop packages javax media jai jai create rotate , pb image renderedop getrendering getasbufferedimage panel setimage image note that jai expects parameters of type float , which is not what javascript provides by default by default , numbers in javascript are doubles so you have to explicitly create java lang floats as shown as in previous posts , i'm using my little imagemunger app to run the script also , as with previous scripts , performance is quite good through no fault of my own rotation occurs at a rate of about pixels per millisecond on a dell inspiron laptop with ghz intel duo processor running gack ! windows vista which ai n't bad at all i 'll take pixels per millisec throughput any day , on any os
