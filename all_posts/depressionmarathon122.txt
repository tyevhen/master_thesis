i finished up my mentally challenging , and therefore physically exhausting , week with a nice , sunny ride this morning on my elliptigo i was supposed to run miles today , but i 've been having some lingering soreness in my right achilles tendon , so i fought my urge to run and went for a ride instead i needed a challenging effort , one without worry about my achilles , to clear my head i got one i rode an out and back mile course on a smooth , wide , country road with beautiful views of local farms and greenery it was also a hilly road , so i got a really good workout it took me just over minutes , which is about the same time it would have taken to run miles , so i'm satisfied i'm hoping for a less challenging week this week i'm working my usual schedule , nothing extra i have one more dental consultation tuesday morning , and i'm praying that soothes some of my anxiety and worry i'm also going to dial back the intensity of my marathon training in order to decrease the stress on my achilles i have to remember the goal is simply to get to the starting line in new york and to let go of my high performance expectations if i re injure myself , there will be no performance at all keep it simple , etta keep it simple still feeling frazzled , stressed and worried , i'm hoping to get back into some sort of comforting rhythm and routine this week , i 've been feeling so close to breaking , worrying about the potential doom lurking around the next corner , that day to day functioning has been challenging i 'd like to shed that feeling this week that will be my goal i 'll let you know how it goes
