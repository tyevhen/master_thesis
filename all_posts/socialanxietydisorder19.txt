commonly question about anxiety disorder symptoms are they associated with obsessive compulsive disorder ? question what should i do about this anxiety of mine ? i wash my hands a lot , so much that my hands up to the wrists are clearly dry and discoloured and i can peel of the skin i constantly have these intrusive thoughts and sometimes it is very hard to remove them from my mind i always have this urge to crack my knuckles i crack them at least five to ten times a day i keep trying to get assurances many times from people for really very unnecessary things i always have a silly order of doing things and if gets disturbed i get very upset i worry a lot of what people think of me and i m very nervous when i have to do something in front of anyone when i have to do something in front of the class i get all tensed up my heart starts beating really quickly and my body especially hands and legs begin to tremble even when i m talking to my classmates this happens especially when i m not close to them a few times they noticed it and asked me about it but i simply shrugged my shoulders and said i was feeling cold i rehearse many times in my mind what i m going to say to even my closest friends and also my family members i never pick up the telephone unless i know who s calling and i wish to taik to them i rarely go outside other than school even in the holidays i rarely get out of the house i like to play sports but i can barely gather the courage to ask someone who are playing whether i can join them i ve not really talked about this to anyone because i m not really open with my parents at least in the past few years i ask them every thing indirectly now i ve heard that these kind of symptoms are usually associated with ocdobsessive compulsive disorder and sadsocial anxiety disorder so can you please tell me whether i am suffering from either of them and a please also say what i should do if i am suffering from these answer you sound about right with your self diagnosis ocd and sad are both anxiety disorders , so it is not uncommon to have both of them wether you have them or not , and what degree to which you may have them , i can t say for sure thought it does sound like you have them now how to deal with them when i tell you how to deal with ocd you will probably say obviously ! or it isn t that easy and i know , but it is how ocd is treated this is to stop giving in to your obsessions and not engaging in the compulsive behavior don t wash your hands more than three times per day don t crack your knuckles this will be difficult and you will experience a great deal of anxiety and discomfort for not engaging in your ritualistic behavior at first just press through the discomfort , because this is the only way to overcome it this is often done with the help of a therapist , and perhaps a benzo anti anxiety medication in extreme cases , but it is completely possible to overcome alone show your brain and body who is in charge as for sad , i find there is often a root cause behind the anxiety there is some sort of insecurity you have if you can pinpoint this insecurity , which is often a dillusion or exagerated belief , you will find it much easier to begin overcomeing the anxiety sad can be dealt with much like ocd be concious that it is simply anxiety be concious of your feelings and thoughts and wether they are appropriate for your environment along with this , deep breathing and attention to the movement of the air in your lungs can help calm you down and remove panic symptoms google elevator breathing for clarification do what makes you uncomfortable and you will realize how irrational your thinking is the only thing to be anxious about is your anxiety best of luck , i know how difficult it can be as i am dealing with it myself take control , don t let it control you sources years studying psychology in college personal experience question what is the best cure for hypochondria ?

im , had a misfortunate tough life so far ive not always has the right care , therapy and treatment in my eyes im still pursuing psychotherapy that the mental health team have told me is no resources for in my area up till now , they recently told me they will try to organise some individual psychotherapy in my area , but first , i have to engage in some occupational therapy , which entails me going out into the community , to try get me integrated into society because i have lived as a recluse for many years i live in a one bedroom apartment , living on disability benifit owning few material possessions so far , these are the diagnosis that have been made by various consultants throughout the years paranoid personality disorder , bpd , antisocial personality disorder how ever , my present psychiatrist thinks i just have bpd , and that all my symptoms can be explained by the bpd i think otherwise , im certain i have co existing mental health problems and im pursuing a seperate , independent psychiatric assessment through my gp because i feel things have been missed and that i have co existing anxiety disorders , being ptsd gad or ocd my symptoms for years have been impulsive aggression outbursts , difficulty controlling them , frequent mood swings , from empty and depressed one minute to content and ok the next thoughts racing obsessively each day persecutory paranoia , feeling as though everyone is against me , socially ostracizing me and alienating me theres a conspiracy against me distrustful of those close to me extreme anxiety , obsessive worries that race through my mind daily , mind blanking out and forgetting things losing my train of thought and sense of self agoraphobia feeling i will lose control when outside of anger or anxiety disocociate , where i will space out in awkward times , like in the supermarket struggle to make eye contact because see it as a threat i stare and zone out vivid scary nightmares personalise everything people do struggle to know how to react or deal with humanity easily get very enraged , have to fight the rage to stop from losing control struggle to focus or concentrate on reading struggle to collect and organize my thoughts have obssessive worries about health , other things , material items etc feeling paranoid that loutish white trash guys and black louts are persecuting me , trying to control my life earlier in life , in areas i lived in , and in secondary schools i attended i was victimised by gangs of black low life ruffians and white trashy type ruffians because i was quiet , reserved and sensitive and went to a multicultural school i then later got pulled out of there and sent to an all white comprehensive school , where i fitted in , but still didn t like going to school could nt adapt to secondary school life but had the time of my life in primary school , where i had lots of friends i never fully got over traumatic big school experience the feeling alienated and socially ostracised by the rest of society ive had this symptom for years since my psychological problems came into existence my personality in itself is im quite introverted and private , carefully choose who i associate with , aloof , reserved , unsociable except to those im close to slightly misanthropic i can think and talk intellectually and intelligently , im thoughtful , considerate , giving to those i know or are close to , but can be very self centred honestly , in all the symptoms ive described , does anyone think i could have any co existing illnesses with the diagnosis i already have ? my present psychiatrist is certain i dont have bipolar disorder because at point , i was worried i could have bipolar some of the illnesses that im worried about , especially because ive sustained a lot of trauma in life are ptsd ocd gad , general anxiety disorder autism adult adhd scitsophrenia does anyone think i could have any of those undiagnosed ? i want to get to the bottom of my mental difficulties so if anyone thinks i could be suffering from other things please say so , or just say what you think thanks answer as soon as i saw racing obsessive thoughts , i thought of ocd , but since you dont mention anything about compulsions rituals you could have pure o then again it could be adhd both are linked to anxiety , which you know you already have , so its likely i strongly doubt that you have autism or skitzophrenia , judging by your symptoms its best if you talk to a proffesional and let them know all of this information and that you suspect you may have other illnesses im not an expert , this is just an opinion i hope you figure everything out soon
