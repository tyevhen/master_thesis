in the last clinical tip september we discussed the role of the triple burner as the avenues of fluids , a view deriving primarily from the nei jing in the previous clinical tip august , we discussed that of the triple burner as the agent of the yuan qi , a view deriving primarily from the nan jing we shall now discuss the view of the triple burner in relation to the movement of qi the triple burner governing movement of qi chapter of the nan jing mentions the function of the triple burner in governing all qi in the body the triple burner stems from the yuan qi it governs all qi in the body , it has a name but no form , it belongs to hand shao yang , it is an external fu this short passage summarizes most of the aspects of the triple burner it stems from the yuan qi discussed in the august clinical tip it governs all qi of the body we shall see how below the triple burner has a name but no form , i e it is not an actual organ but a function it pertains to the shao yang with the gall bladder it is a fu let us explore now the meaning of the triple burner governing the movement of qi the movement of qi in general is called the qi mechanism qi ji this qi mechanism consists in the ascending descending and entering exiting of qi in different places and different organs each organ has a particular direction of flow of qi , e g spleen qi ascends while stomach qi descends in each channel , qi flows in an upward or downward direction as acupuncturists , we are very familiar with the ascending descending movement of qi we use this movement every time we insert a distal and a local point to treat a particular problem along a channel for example , when we use l i shangyang for example and l i jianyu to treat a pain in the area of the acromio clavicular articulation of the shoulder , we are making use of the ascending descending movement of qi along the large intestine channel by stimulating the ascending descending movement of qi in the channel , we are removing the obstruction and therefore the pain we are somewhat less familiar with the horizontal movement of qi , i e entering and exiting of qi qi enters and exits in and out of various structures and organs for example , qi enters and exits the space between skin and muscles , the membranes , the joint capsules , and all other cavities moreover , qi enters and exits in every part of the body among the tai yang , shao yang and yang ming and among the tai yin , jue yin and shao yin take the shoulder as an example on the scapula we have tai yang small intestine channel , on the lateral side of the arm we have the shao yang triple burner channel and further forward the yang ming large intestine channel within this zone of the body , the tai yang area is on the most yang area the scapula , the yang ming on the most yin area because it is near the lung channel and the shao yang in the middle this ties in with the view that the tai yang opens onto the exterior , the yang ming opens onto the interior and the shao yang is the hinge exactly the same reationship exists in the yin between tai yin most exterior of the yin , jue yin the hinge and shao yin most interior of the yin the avenues of qi qi jie described in chapter of the ling shu are another example of the entering and exiting of qi horizontal movement of qi in the chest qi has streets in the abdomen qi has streets in the head qi has streets in the lower legs qi has streets therefore if there is a problem with qi in the head , stop it at the brain if there is a problem with qi in the chest , stop it at the front of the chest and at the back shu points if there is a problem with qi in the abdomen , stop it at the back shu points and at the chong mai on the right and left of the umbilicus which is the moving qi or dong qi if there is a problem with qi in the lower legs , stop it at st qichong here called qijie and at bl chengshan notice how it recommends the use of points in the front and the back for each area in the chest , use the front of the chest and back shu points in the abdomen back shu points and chong mai points in the legs , st front of leg and bl back of leg this suggests a horizontal movement of qi within each area the triple burner controls the ascending descending and entering exiting of qi in the qi mechanism one of the words most frequently used in chinese books to describe this function of the triple burner is tong which means free passage , to pass through , penetrate this describes the function of the triple burner in ensuring that qi passes through in the qi mechanism , in all the cavities and in all organs this whole process is called qi transformation by the triple burner the result of the qi transformation is the production of nutritive qi ying qi , defensive qi wei qi , blood and body fluids that is also why the triple burner is said to control all kinds of qi the central scripture classic zhong zang jing , han dynasty says the triple burner is the three original qi of the body , it is the yang organ of clear qi , it controls the zang and fu , ying qi and wei qi , the channels and the qi of the interior and exterior , left and right , above and below when the qi of the triple burner has free passage , qi passes freely into interior , exterior , left , right , above and below the triple burner irrigates the body , harmonizes interior and exterior , benefits the left and nourishes the right , it conducts upwards and descends downwards as mentioned in the previous clinical tip , chapter of the nan jing also confirms that the triple burner controls the movement of qi in general the triple burner makes the yuan qi separate into its different functions and it controls the movement and passage of the qi of the upper , middle and lower burner through the zang and fu the qi are the qi of the upper , middle and lower burner apart from referring generally to all the types of qi in each burner , this passage also refers specifically to the gathering qi zong qi in the upper , nutritive qi ying qi in the middle and defensive qi wei qi in the lower burner although the defensive qi exerts its influence primarily in the upper burner and the superficial layers of the body the space between skin and muscles , it originates in the lower burner from the ming men chapter of the ling shu says ying qi originates from the middle burner wei qi originates from the lower burner chapter of the nan jing also confirms that the triple burner exerts its influence on all types of qi the triple burner stems from the yuan qi it supports all of the qi chapter confirms the influence of the triple burner on the movement of qi in all parts of the body the qi of the triple burner gathers in the avenues of qi qi jie this means that the triple burner is responsible for the free passage of qi in all channels but also all structures such as cavities of the body thus , the triple burner s function in governing the movement of qi is quite similar to the liver s free flow of qi and indeed , there are many similarities with regard to the movement of qi , it is useful to compare and contrast this function of the triple burner with those of liver in ensuring the free flow of qi the liver ensures the free flow of qi and this aids the ascending and descending of qi in all organs , and especially in the stomach , spleen and intestines the triple burner 's influence on the ascending descending and entering exiting of qi extends to all organs moreover , the triple burner controls the entering and exiting of qi in all parts of the body and especially the body cavities the liver has no such function in relation to the body cavities clinical application as the triple burner controls the movement of qi in the qi mechanism its points may be used in a similar way to the liver points to ensure the free flow of qi the main point i use to move qi in the triple burner is tb zhigou nanjing college of traditional chinese medicine a revised
