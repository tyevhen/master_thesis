in my blog post yesterday , i wrote about overcoming the 'i'm too old to change' mindset and gave a fictionalized composite account of john , who was in his s and used his age as an excuse to cover up his fear of changing today , i 'd like to focus on my neighbor , katherine , who , at the age of , is still inspired by life and inspiring others she 's an excellent example of someone who is in good health , has a zest for life , and who does n't use her age as an excuse to avoid change in her life first , let me say that katherine is n't her real name when i asked katherine permission to discuss her in my blog , she 's so modest that she could n't understand why anyone would be interested in her once she got over her surprise , we agreed that i would n't use her real name or too much identifying information about her when she and i talked about what keeps her open and looking forward to new experiences in life , katherine told me that she 's always been a curious person who was n't afraid of change throughout her life she 's still healthy , mentally sharp , and enjoys walking a few miles a day and practicing yoga daily she also said that she does n't hold grudges and she 's learned not to sweat the small stuff until she retired , katherine was an elementary schoolteacher for most of her life retirement for katherine does n't mean sitting on a park bench feeding pigeons she 's still an active volunteer at the local elementary school reading program she still loves working with children and instilling a sense of curiosity and wonder in her students she has a strong social network of friends , many of whom are years younger than her and find it challenging to keep up with her pace aside from inheriting healthy genes both of her parents lived into their s , you might think that katherine has lived a charmed life and this is why she has such a good attitude but , far from it , katherine has had her losses and misfortunes , including losing her first husband , the love of her life , to cancer when they were both in their s this was a loss she thought she 'd never get over , but she had teenage children to raise , so she attended psychotherapy to deal with the loss , and she channeled her grief into doing volunteer work with a local cancer organization to help others who lost their loved ones to cancer she remarried when she was in her s and lost her second husband five years ago , which was also a tremendous loss for her aside from losing both husbands , katherine has outlived many life long friends she felt strongly about each of these losses , but she was determined that she would n't allow these losses to defeat her emotionally she 's one of the most resilient people that i know katherine 's attitude toward life is that she takes each day as it comes , a variation of living one day at a time she looks at the changes that life brings as opportunities to learn and grow at age , she knows she 's not going to live forever but rather than worrying about how much longer she might live , she focuses on making whatever time she has worthwhile for herself and others and what does katherine say to people in their s , s or s whose mindset is i'm too old to change ? she tells them , life is short and precious live life fully while you can learn to change and grow at years young , katherine is still inspired by life and still inspiring others around her we can all learn a lot from her i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist who provides psychotherapy services to individuals and couples , including contemporary talk therapy , emdr , clinical hypnosis , and somatic experiencing to find out more about me , visit my website http josephineferrarotherapy com to set up a consultation , call me at
