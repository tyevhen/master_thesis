reality is not always kind reality when living with depression , i think , can at times be the least kind of all i so appreciate all of your comments on my last post it seems many of you could relate your support and understanding were very helpful when i wrote that post , i had nothing more to say it literally hurt to breathe i was n't sure it could get any worse that that things did get worse by yesterday it hurt to breathe and the mere action of taking one breath after another was exhausting i tried my best to keep up i even made it to work for hours thursday but by yesterday , getting out of bed was a monumental task i tried to sleep a couple of extra hours before going to work but even after slumbering two extra hours things were still tough i tried to get to work anyway i got up , cleaned up a bit , and even pulled on my shirt but that 's where getting ready for work stopped i felt so guilty as i collapsed back onto the sofa we are short staffed i knew i was leaving my bosses and co workers in quite a predicament by not getting to work but it hurt to breathe and breathing was exhausting i could n't do it i could not function anymore within a few hours of collapsing on the sofa , useless , a friend arrived to take me to the emergency room by yesterday afternoon , i was admitted and so i am here , on my local inpatient psych unit , a place i swore i would never , ever come again ever but sometimes i do n't always have the best foresight this illness cares not what i have planned and could n't give a rip about any pronouncements i 've made it is an illness , and whether i like it or not , i do n't always have the final say i 've done well for the past several years i 've weatherered several storms , rode some highs with pleasure and endured some lows with grit and integrity but i was no match for this low no match it was taking me down one painful , exhausted breath at a time i do not yet know the inpatient treatment plan i feel like something drastic needs to change to pull me out of this depth i 've even thought about ect again my brain is that far gone but it 's too soon to know what direction this treatment will take i want to make my stay here as productive and brief as possible i want to leave this unit breathing deeply , with strength , and without exhaustion or pain i just want to get back to being me normal , healthy , me thank you , my friends , for your continued support
