adele and paul spent the episode sparring it 's reminds me of some of his sessions with gina , only not as good adele 's manner feels forced , like she 's reading her lines , and they all have the same inflection paul calls her 'remote , ' and 'a freudian ice goddess , that is when he 's not cursing at her , saying she 's a narcissist , or accusing her of purposely humiliating him by letting him express fantasies about having a relationship with her when , in fact , she 's pregnant she does inspire him to call sunil 's daughter in law and to see sunil as a more imminent threat watching a half hour on tv is draining enough glad my days are n't so filled with conflict , anger , angst , and interpersonal confrontation
