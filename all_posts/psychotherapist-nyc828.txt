in prior blog posts , i addressed avoidant and passive coping strategies as maladaptive strategies that usually do not work by the time we become adults i mentioned that these maladaptive coping strategies usually develop from a combination of individual temperament and early home environment in this blog post , i will focus on controlling behavior as a maladaptive coping strategy what are the signs of controlling behavior ? controlling coping strategy just like any other type of behavior , controlling behavior is very individual and it will manifest in a variety of ways similarly , controlling behavior is on a continuum from moderate to severe people who are moderately controlling will try to control some aspects of their lives and the lives of those around them , but they realize that they ca n't control everything often they will respond to others' discomfort with their controlling behavior by backing off at least for a while people who are severely controlling have a need to control or micromanage nearly everything in most severe cases , when others around them express their discomfort , people who are severely controlling become angry in some cases , they might become violent in both cases , controlling behavior often stems from underlying anxiety , fear , or insecurity the following fictionalized vignette , which is not about any one particular person , is an example of moderately controlling behavior ruth ruth grew up in a household that was almost always on the verge of chaos she was the oldest of six children her mother , who stayed at home , tended to be very anxious and overwhelmed most of the time her father spent long hours at the office , leaving the mother to take care of the children and the household by the time she was , ruth was helping her mother to prepare meals , do the wash , and take care of chores around the house since her mother tended to be in a state of high anxiety most of the time , this caused ruth to feel anxious and insecure too by the time ruth was married with children , she tried to make a lot of decisions for her husband and her teenage children , which caused friction in the household often , when she and her husband went out to dinner , she would order his meal for him , even before he had a chance to look at the menu whenever her husband pointed out to her that he would like to order his own meals , ruth would realize that she overstepped her bounds and she would apologize similarly , when she continued to choose clothes for her and year old daughters , who still lived at home , and they told her that they wanted to make their own choices , she backed off but even though ruth backed off , in both instances , not being in control of these situations made ruth feel anxious it was n't until she began psychotherapy to deal with these issues that she realized that she had underlying family of origin issues and her own temperament that caused her to develop this maladaptive coping style the following fictionalized scenario is an example of the other end of the spectrum of controlling behavior , severe controlling behavior henry when henry was , he moved out of his family 's household to get away from his abusive father for most of his life , he grew up witnessing his father hit his mother he also witnessed his mother 's passive response he thought his father was a tyrant always wanting to control every aspect of their lives henry vowed to himself that he would never be like his father he quit high school , got his ged , began working , and got his own apartment in his early s , henry began dating a young woman , linda , that he really liked after a few months , they decided to date each other exclusively at first , their relationship was going well but after a while , as henry got closer to linda , he began asking her to let him know where she was going and with whom at first , linda was flattered because she thought this meant that henry really cared about her whenever they went to a restaurant , henry ordered for linda initially , linda felt he was being chivalrous , and she liked this after a while , linda got tired of having to answer questions all of the time about where she was going and with whom , and she wanted to order her own food when they went out whenever linda tried to talk to henry about all of this , he refused to talk about it one day , when linda brought this up again , henry felt like he was going to explode as linda continued to insist that they talk about henry 's controlling behavior , henry lost his temper and he slapped her linda was stunned and hurt henry was shocked by his own behavior after that , despite his repeated attempts to apologize to her , henry could not get through to linda she wanted nothing to do with him shortly after that incident , henry began psychotherapy to understand how and why , despite his vow to himself that he would never become like his father , he had become severely controlling and violent in his relationship just like his father these two vignettes illustrate that , depending upon the person and the circumstances , controlling behavior is on a continuum i provided examples of moderate and severe controlling behavior with the understanding that there is a wide variety of behavior between those two extremes what can you do if you engage in controlling behavior ?
