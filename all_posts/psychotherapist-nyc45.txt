used for performance enhancement fictional vignette emdr therapy for performance enhancement tom when tom 's director told him that he was promoting him to an executive level position with a significant increase in salary , tom was thrilled he worked hard for this promotion , and he was happy that he was being recognized by his director then , his director told tom that part of the new responsibilities would be to give presentations to the board of directors , and tom felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach while tom really wanted the promotion , he dreaded giving presentations especially to the board of directors he suffered with a lifelong dread of public speaking even when he was in high school and he was asked to address his teachers and fellow students , he stammered and trembled on stage giving his presentation in high school was one of the most humiliating experiences of his life after that experience , he avoided public speaking even in college , he managed to get through without having to do a presentation but now he knew that there was too much at stake for his career and he wanted to overcome his fear of public speaking a close friend , jim , told tom that his son , who was a college basketball player , was seeing an emdr therapist for performance enhancement his son tended to choke in a big game , which made him feel ashamed and

an emdr therapist to deal with his anxiety about public speaking tom had never heard of emdr therapy before , but he looked it up online and saw all the positive research about emdr 's effectiveness , so he contacted an emdr therapist to begin therapy during the first several sessions , tom 's emdr therapist obtained information about tom 's family history and helped him to develop internal resources then , they were ready to begin processing tom 's fear of public speaking his therapist asked tom to recall his memory of speaking in the auditorium in high school after tom accessed the memory , she asked him several questions , including what his negative belief is about himself as it is related to that memory tom thought about it and said , i feel powerless when i have to speak in front of an audience he told his therapist that he wanted to feel confident and in control when he does public speaking then , tom and his emdr therapist began the desensitization phase of emdr while they were doing emdr , they discovered that there were several other earlier memories that were related to the memory they were working on so , over time , they processed these underlying memories as well when tom no longer felt anxious about his memories , they worked on the current situation and a future situation until tom no longer felt anxious about speaking in front of the board of directors when his therapist checked with tom to find out if he felt confident and in control about public speaking , tom said he was very surprised that he actually did feel confident and in control the proof came a few months later when , in his new executive position , tom had to go before the board of directors to do his first presentation to them before the presentation , tom was surprised to notice that he was n't at all nervous he felt confident that he was the top expert in his company for the topic he would be presenting , so there was no one else who knew more about it than he did emdr therapy for performance enhancement during his presentation , tom felt confident and in control he also saw his director standing in the back of the room smiling and nodding at him , which made him feel even more confident afterwards , the chief executive officer thanked tom for an informative presentation and told him that he hoped it would be the first of many conclusion emdr therapy was
