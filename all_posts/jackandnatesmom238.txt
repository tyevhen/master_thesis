today is my year blogiversary ! i can hardly believe it i never thought i would get the type of response that i have i initially started the blog to keep family and friends updated , to vent a bit , to avoid being asked the same questions over and over i have definitely accomplished this i just was n't necessarily expecting that other people would be interested too ! now , i am not a frequently viewed blog by blog standards , i do n't have thousands of views everyday however , i do have about views each day i have had close to , views over all i have about facebook followers and over twitter followers not too shabby for a year 's work ! the blog has become so much more than just an update vehicle to myself and my family my first entry was the result of feeling very very alone , of feeling desperate for some support from somewhere and it came in droves i tried to prepare myself for both negative and positive feedback the negative never really came , and this has truly become my sanctuary a place where i can vent about , pray for , praise , or freak out about the boys a place where i can honestly share the impact that the boys' challenges have on my life , my work , my marriage i thought i was losing my family when i started the blog instead , it is more solid than it has ever been i was feeling hopeless when i first wrote i ca n't say we have made crazy progress , but i have documentation of the progress we have had , and it is there and that means something to me thank you to each and every one of my readers i was saying to a friend of mine last week that i am always amazed when i run into people i have n't seen in a long time i never know who reads in general , but these days it is immediately obvious by the person 's greeting i either get how are the boys ? or i read your blog every day the people who read do n't have to ask and that was the point ! your support means everything to me i know i could do all that i am doing without writing about it , but this outlet really does help me process everything
