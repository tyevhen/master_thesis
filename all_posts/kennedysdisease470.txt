i read an interesting article the other day titled , simplifying your life by manal within the article was something that i thought might be of interest to my readers the section on gain clarity determining what is important was thought provoking i performed a couple of the exercises and they were eye opening if you find this article interesting , try a couple of the exercises gain clarity this is the first and most important step you can do for yourself be clear about what s important to you clarity about your desires and priorities will guide you through simplifying your life and adding more meaning to your experiences when you know what s important to you , you ll let go of the noise and distractions picking a handful of important desires and values will make it easier to say no to everything else you will focus on the things that matter and reduce the superfluous demands on your time and energy to the minimum how do you gain clarity ? the subject of clarity has been extensively covered in the self growth development field yet , it s one of hardest aspects of growth to actually do it s been a constant struggle for me i ve been experimenting with a combination of two tactics that are helping me tremendously in continuing to stay focused on what s important and keeping it simple the two ideas are not new i ve heard them recommended a few times , among other things it s the synergy of both that is effective in maintaining simple focus make a list of what s important to you list the to most important values or aspects of life that matter to you most what are you craving in your life right now ? do you want a meaningful connection ? do you want more love ? do you want financial freedom ? do you desire a healthy body ? do you value creativity , peace of mind , autonomy etc ? sit with it and think about it what would bring you more peace and fulfillment ? what would your ideal life look like ? write down what you really want and value list all the things that come to your mind and heart set your priorities no this is not an invitation to call out the devil it s an exercise in helping you prioritize your needs and desires answer the following three questions the best way you can start with the first question and give it your full time and attention once you re completely done , move on to the next one don t overanalyze just go with your gut feeling and answer based on how you feel answering this question will add a self imposed sense of urgency based on your personal values and priorities , not those of others if you had months to live , what would you do in those months ? if you only had weeks to live , what would you do in those weeks ? what if you only had days to live , what would you do ? by going through the process you will clarify what s important prioritize the important without stress or worry eliminate the unnecessary now that you have the answers , start with the shortest term answer what would you do if you only had days to live ? a personal example from the author i have a lot of things i desire to do i ve always started with the biggest things and ignored the smaller ones that nag at the back of my head turns out that the most important thing to me in the shortest term is to simplify my financial life and make it as easy as possible for my family to deal with our affairs after i m gone if i only had days , the most important thing for me would be to clean up my financial act i ve complicated things over the years i have numerous documents , accounts , and transactions known only to me if i depart this planet today , i ll leave my family with a financial mess that will take them months , if not a year to untangle so i ve been spending the last week getting rid of the unnecessary and streamlining the process after i strip down everything to the basics , i aim to leave a document with my will that will serve as a step by step guide my day action is going to take a bit longer i had to stop a few times for family obligations and unexpected interruptions but that s okay i know where to focus and what to do more importantly , i didn t commit to anything new and i eliminated a lot of smaller things that didn t matter once i m done with cleaning up my financial records , i ll have a look at my answers and determine what i d want to do in the next days the next thing will be from the weeks list i ll pick one item at a time and work with it no excuses or distractions when you re focused on a single important action with an added sense of urgency , you ll be able to eliminate the excess without hesitation and this is the core of simplicity
