thank you again , a b the last paragraph you wrote was beautiful and very touching it simply glows with your own genuine love and compassion while i am hearing what you are saying about boundaries , i also guess i have for the last several years , been more inclined to see difficult moments as reminders of or pointers to what i have to work on in myself if i have a problem with another 's behavior , it is indeed , my problem why should they change ? i suppose that every situation and relationship is different i can see myself remarking about certain things , but choosing to leave others alone some behavior patterns are so ingrained that the individual can not be any other way what business is it of mine , ultimately ? i have so appreciated , learned from , and made regular use of your advice to ask myself , how can i take care of myself in this adverse situation ? eventually , i also ask myself questions like , why do these words or actions bother me so ? what fears in me are being triggered ? how am i failing to be a better person here ? what can i learn about people , life , and myself from this ? no one is supposed to be a tool for our use or worse , be viewed and treated as an obstacle ! we have all felt we were being used as a tool and treated like an obstacle , and we 've all been guilty of using people i see awareness of our self centeredness as key to living a better life , as well as a desire to do something about it is a way of taking our space to be grounded in our beliefs , adhering to our guiding principles ? warm regards , g dear g , yes , you are exactly right taking your space is speaking your truth , quietly , in accordance with your guiding principles a b
