the concept of resonance is important in understanding anxiety because situations can resonate within us from language centers to below the level of language where the panic exists we can be stirred up even when we don t know with what the outside situation is resonating thus , in sex , a nude female body can resonate in a man with an early experience with his mother she may have been seductive long before the child had any understanding of it i had one white patient who had a very seductive mother she french kissed her son later , he could only have girlfriends who were black or asiatic too white a girlfriend would resonate with that early seduction that scared him here white women resonated with a white mother , something to be avoided i treated a lesbian woman who was molested sexually by her white stepfather she could only have relationships with black men later , any man resonated with the early stepfather she switched to sex with woman it seemed much safer to her she discovered that when she was with a man in bed she had a chronic low level apprehension when she switched to women there was no more problem when there is a life and death struggle at birth due to lack of oxygen anoxia , for example , the existing reactive system is activated , but because it cannot fully respond due to the complete load of pain and terror to feel it completely would be to run a cardiac attack or at least to lose consciousness , it reacts partially within its biologic limits and then puts the excess part of the terror away for good keeping it houses it until our system is strong enough to feel and resolve it it lives behind our repressive gates however , we continually respond to this stored terror with chronically high stress hormone levels , a compromised immune system , misperceptions , strange ideas , nightmares , and chronic malaise and a startle reaction this high activation level gnaws away at the cardiovascular system so that we fall seriously ill at age , even though at the time we seem to be living a normal , relaxed life we have done systematic stress hormone cortisol studies with our patients and have found a normalization after one year of therapy that tells us that the variable , reliving , may well be responsible for the reduction of anxiety this drop is also associated with a drop in heart rate and blood pressure the patient also claims to feel better biologic measurements are more reliable because they inform us of what the physiology is doing , irrespective of what the person thinks tranquilizers seem to be obligatory to enable someone in pain to function on a daily basis what is diabolic is that in spite of a loving childhood the person suffers she may not have been loved on the first line where good oxygen and nutrients were essential , which were lacking or there may have been a mother terribly tense over losing her job in the economic crisis from the baby s point of view he is unloved his needs for calmare not met from the mother s point of view she was doing the best she could and could not help her feelings a carrying mother who smokes and drinks is not loving her baby her needs come first if she takes drugs such as cocaine she is alterating the physiology of her baby male monkey offspring of mothers were given cocaine had poor impulse control and possibly were more likely to take drugs later on this study went back years to monkey mothers who were given cocaine despite the effects from womb life , too many of us were not loved in obvious ways later in our emotional life when there was no touching or holding one of the ways we know where anxiety comes from is the depth and agony of the feeling of terror there is always the fear of dying because that is what actually happened in the womb or at birth fear is second line , organized higher up in the brain anxiety is paralyzing because it is how some part of us reacts to terror when we have chronic over arching anxiety we are dealing with a m lange of fear and terror overwhelming the defense system a compounding of a harsh childhood and poor gestational life here is resonance current apprehension soon turns to anxiety as the feeling triggers off low level terror the terror , i remind the reader , is already there it keeps us from relaxing on the beach , pushing us into constant activity and we rationalize , i don t like the sand what we do in the present is usually the reflection of our history life becomes a rationale for our imprints if we have a therapy of current focus we are missing out on all those causes in order for some patients to feel the fear and its context we need to tranquilize the terror so that it does not interfere with the feelings the patient has we offer first line blockers in conventional medicine and psychotherapy this is sometimes known as anti psychotic medication what is being blocked is the terror that often produces bizarre ideas in the patient the tranquilized patient will no longer be overwhelmed because we have reduced the overall pain load she can focus on a single feeling and there is no longer an overload that caused the generation of all those strange ideas and beliefs we see here how psychotic ideation develops feed in too much pain and the systemic searches for an outlet reduce the level of pain and the system calms down and no longer needs the ideas to rationalize what is going on inside those strange ideas are like an overflow valve that channels the pain away from consciousness and into awareness he is hyper alert feeling overwhelmed happens when something in present resonates with terror , and the combined force is overwhelming it is all too much we cannot follow orders because there are a string of orders from the past inside that command us they take precedence what is diabolic about anxiety is that many of us suffer from chronic low levels of anxiety , barely perceptible , acted out constantly the person is rarely aware of it yet it drives her to go and do all of the time cannot read a book without that agitated feeling cannot focus for long , cannot listen to a long lecture , cannot listen to the children s stories and above all that agitation catches up with her at bed time when she cannot fall asleep we cannot be a loving parent when we don t have the patience to listen to our children and their stories it is not that the parent is bad person or unloving in his intentions , but that he suffers and cannot help himself he rationalizes that he must keep busy to feed his children we know otherwise he has to keep busy to discharge all of that energy if he cannot he suffers the low level anxious person can rarely listen that takes too much patience and the person can t wait this individual cannot listen to complicated instructions how to assemble this table or how he must turn right at a certain intersection he bows out and glazes over very quickly if he is given a chore of what to buy at the supermarket , as soon as it gets to three choices he is gone i know she said to buy low fat but low fat what ? sleep is problematic when the low level mobilization against the early pain is now active as the third line diminishes its hold a bit don t forget , the higher level neo cortex is often pressed into service to control our lower level feelings it is an escape hatch as we need to let go of that top level control in order to sleep we become more vulnerable we have to release control enter a ruminating mind a very busy , unceasing mind that cannot stop itself long enough to fall asleep as we get closer to the deep brain in deep sleep we approach those primal feelings they agitate and move upward to make the thinking brain work very hard even in sleep when we begin to suffer from the uprising of first line terror the brain rushes in to cap it with a nightmare the nightmare attempts to encapsulate the feeling so that it never becomes conscious it is not a willful act , that nightmare it is a built in survival mechanism that ensures that our conscious awareness will not be impaired by overwhelming input the story in the nightmare does not count for much , but the feeling in it counts a great deal that feeling can give us a way in the royal road to the unconscious the imprint of a memory is really an ensemble of reactions that is impressed simultaneously into the whole system when there is inordinate danger , a smoking mother , for example it is a total experience , unlike recall , which is largely mental , meaning a left prefrontal cortex operation we may not be able to recall an imprint we can only remember it with our entire system with our muscles , viscera , and blood system , because all of us was involved in the original experience therefore , it must be relived with all systems involved originally when it was set down not only that , but it must be relived with the same intensity in which it was impressed , which is why it has rarely been seen in conventional or cognitive therapy where the emotional level is rather subdued a few tears is not exactly deep wailing that we see in our therapy let us not confuse recall with memory deep preverbal pains can only be recalled with the entire biologic system verbal recall is another animal literally altogether it is systemic , organic , physiologic memory that cures verbal recall does not when we suffer high blood pressure , for example , we may be suffering from a lingering residue of an overall trauma very early in our lives in the womb the high blood pressure has been stripped from the generating memory and lives its life apart it is trying to tell us something about where it came from but alas , we drug it unmercifully so that it never volunteers its origin same for heart rate we are forever putting those memories to sleep so there are at least two main avenues to provoke anxiety and repression one , the meaning of a certain look by the parent , or any negative reaction of theirs which means i am not loved nor will i ever be two , something is happening that is an immediate threat to my life in either case there is a disruption in the evolution of the organism originally , suffocation during birth provoked repression to order to keep the system on equilibrium and to keep the baby from dying two of my patients were later told by a doctor that they had what seemed like a heart attack at birth later on , as the feeling was compounded by additional pain and terror it provoked even more shut down in both cases there is danger it will be crippling anxiety and not plain old fear terror light when the lower brain centers are actively involved when the resonance travels down the chain of pain and reaches low levels of the neuraxis , terror then appears it is not something new not something to try to reach it is an old friend or enemy in fact willfully trying to reach a lower level feeling is an oxymoron the more we use top level will , the less we can descend to where we have to go the more we let go of the present the more access we will have the person in terror will suffer anxiety because the body is preparing for extreme reactions in order to survive you cannot be slow to react if there is a lion coming toward you there is usually the gloom and doom aspect of the anxious feeling , i feel like i am going to die since no one manufactures a feeling that has no basis in reality , we must seek out origins if we want to successfully treat any of the so called psychosomatic migraine , high blood pressure symptoms we must find the generating sources here the feeling needs to meet its maker , and there is a maker what happens is that a current situation , giving a speech through the process of resonance , a mild fear and apprehension has set off the original terror deep down in the brain so that the person is not just sort of fearful , but suffers a full fledged anxiety attack , feeling she is going to die the feeling is correct ! we don t understand her reactions because it is just giving a speech to fifteen people yet she feels overwhelmed or someone is criticized and goes into an anxiety state why ? because it can mean , i am not loved if i make a mistake or catastrophe happens if i make a wrong move and no doubt this person in her childhood was not loved when she made a mistake
