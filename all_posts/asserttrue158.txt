if you want to become the next buzzfeed , i have good news and bad news the good news is it 's never been easier to curate a great looking news page excellent free tools exist more of which , in a minute the bad news is , no one 's going to read what you post , unless it 's by accident if you 're looking to build community around your paper li page , good luck a bit of context blogging was supposed to be a big thing , until social media came along and supposedly moved all discussion away from blog comments sections , toward facebook and other timelines so now , blogging is dead and social sites rule that 's the consensus view , more or less but the reality is as usual a bit more nuanced as pinterest , snapchat , whatsapp , and flickr were quick to notice , what people really gravitate to are images , not snippets of text facebook has always known this they 've leveraged imagery almost since the beginning twitter wisely added image embedding fairly quickly graphical timelines rule text only timelines , by and large , are n't as successful except maybe for hacker news and reddit , outliers that buck the trend meeker report via om co stats for daily photos shared online show pretty clearly what 's going on people want to share pics do people want to see all these pics ? that 's another question i'm not so sure nevertheless , under the graphical content is king theory , we can begin to understand the success of something like buzzfeed as a triumph of photo driven content bits over long form reportage just as we can grok the failure of google as a basic unwillingness to grasp the importance of image streams early on , google was not terribly graphical it cost them bigtime even if we back out the selfie nation piece of all this , there 's a lot of good graphical content online now , and such content will remain popular for good reason i can skim a couple dozen blogs an hour maybe with concerted effort i can skim a couple hundred headlines an hour , if they 're in a plain list format as with top st or hacker news but i can probably skim two thousand photos an hour , because it 's what my brain is good at contrast this with trying to skim a youtube video very hard to do , and there 's no app for it google ? are you listening ? worst of all is trying to speed listen to a podcast ca n't be done in the attention span wars , therefore , video and audio formats are bound to suffer , going forward , due to how shall we say ? spacetime constraints the ideal presentation vehicle is thus arguably a digg like palette of tiled news stories that look like the standard diggtile is pixels square and devotes about of its acreage to an image , around to the headline and kicker , and the remainder to a text blurb , credits , and social sharing buttons this formula graphic head text seems to hit a cognitive sweet spot and now you can hit it , too , with the aid of specialized aggregation apps like paper li , scoop it , flipboard , and rebelmouse , which allow even the rankest untrained non journalist to glom together a polished looking turd tiled news page in seconds , armed with little more than a bookmarklet and a twitter stream see my earlier post , an orgy of curation , for details the question is whether anyone will visit your news page or will you be left with a weak stream ? bwah ha ha , and i think the answer here is the same as with blogs where there 's ten thousand people whispering and nobody listening and social timelines ditto add another ditto for curated pages of the paper li variety nobody cares what you think of obama , and no one much cares that the joe blow daily is out ! paper li claims to have million users curating million stories a week or is it per day ? but similarweb shows paper li with only million visits a month , which means the only people reading paper li pages are the people who create them paper li is withering deservedly , in my opinion under competition from better designed services like rebelmouse , scoop it , and flipboard , which have superior content management tools and offer better hope of letting you gain a following i created a news page at scoop it that got over views in the first week , before my free one week trial of scoop it business ran out and the analytics went dark after two weeks , my rebelmouse news page got to views with very little promotion and the analytics still work in terms of page appearance , i like flipboard 's design the best , although it truncates headlines willy nilly and analytics have yet to show any views , for my page in comparing bookmarklet performance , flipboard 's snappiness completely aces the pack , with scoop it a close second but flipboard 's bookmarklet is technically not a bookmarklet it 's a chrome extension the paper li bookmarklet blows major chunks it 's slow , fugly , has a clumsy ui , and makes me log in again all of which applies to their main app as well flipboard truncates headlines dynamically depending on the viewing environment and window size scoop it is a fantastic service , allowing you to scoop any web page in real time using the handy bookmarklet and have it show up immediately as a tweet in your stream and as a news item in your page but the down side is that the shortened urls that show up in your timeline can be mistaken by users for a direct link to a story , when in fact the user gets brought to the story 's tile in your scoop it page that gets old fast twitter users are accustomed to going directly to a story rather than being indirected through someone 's landing page when i get double routed through someone 's landing page , i start to get annoyed as i mentioned in my earlier post , flipboard is fast becoming the pound gorilla in curationism , with million users and upwards of , newbies a day , which i think can only spell trouble for underdogs in what 's already a too crowded market what 's flipboard doing right ? the consumer facing ui is drop dead gorgeous on all devices , the admin ui is very good but not great , the curation tools rock , and did i mention it looks good on all devices ? last month , when a post on this blog went viral analysis here , almost half the traffic was from zite , which decoded means flipboard by contrast , i have yet to see paper li or scoop it show up , even as a blip , in my blog analytics so if you 're wondering how to increase the wattage on your social megaphone , you can try adding a curated page to your mix or you can internalize the message about graphics above and start adding pictures to everything you blog or tweet , which is honestly ? probably about the smartest thing you could do right now hey listen , the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might not be complete , but it 's as good as i can do with my silly notifications scraping hack in any case , you should get busy following the folks shown below they 're fantastic twitter networkers , and they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links have you added your name to our mailing list ?
