paul meets with gina for supervision or debate team or personal torture or whatever you want to call it he down plays his role in sophie 's overdose on his meds in his office , right after her meaningful breakthrough i prefer patients not breakthrough quite like this , i would n't even like the back flips off my couch he told the psychiatrist at the hospital not to hospitalize her because she would feel he 's abandoning her omg to quote my year old her second serious suicide attempt in a couple of months and she 's still seeing her coach who 's slept with her and he prevents her from going to a safer place for stabilization oh give me a break gina and paul talk in diffuse ways about diffuse things and who knows what it 's all about he 's mad that she once wrote he was compromised by his wanting to please his patients , even though everything else in her letter was glowing he carried the letter around for months in his pocket , it kept him from being the head of the institute they talk about doris and the institute i do n't know who doris is and i do n't care about the institute paul tells gina she 's cold and has no empathy finally , paul engages gina in one of those conversations about why ca n't i have a relationship with laura , the personality disordered patient who is years younger than he is prole husband says he wants permission to have an affair , and yet he goes to the person who he knows would never give it to him dinah says this show started off strong , paul was a good and likable therapist the first week and lots of stuff was happening now , he 's a creep , his own therapy supervision sessions give insight into him not as a thoughtful therapist , but as a damaged man who ca n't negotiate his own family life and who has no sense of reasonable boundaries his treatment of his supervisor is completely unrealistic he behaves like a narcissistic , entitled , and insensitive idiot who goes to a supervisor they have so much baggage with , and why do these two people sit in a room together pretending it 's just fine that he 's disrespectful and treading the line of abusive and why do they both like it ? hoping it 's over soon i 've committed myself to blogging about it , i sort of like writing the blog , but i no longer like the tv show roy tells me our hits are way up since i started this , and last week we had over , page views unlike roy , i tend to finish what i start if you click the link , check out roy 's number
