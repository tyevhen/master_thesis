i 've decided to run another marathon i signed up to run the richmond marathon in richmond , virginia on november th i'm officially in my second week of training i was right the women 's race i ran a couple weeks ago did jump start my training following the runner 's world training program , rather than creating my own , has also been helpful this way , i can just run whatever the schedule tells me to run no thinking required ! i 've also reduced the long term stress by printing out only one week of the schedule at a time training for a marathon is daunting focusing on only one week at a time has made it much less so i think i'm off to a decent start i'm really tired , of course , but that makes sense it is much nicer to be tired as a result of running than it is to be tired as a result of depression ! join me in richmond , wo n't you ? i 'll be the one with 'etta' emblazoned across my chest
