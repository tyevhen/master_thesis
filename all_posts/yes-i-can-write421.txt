today it 's snowing i was watching it snow earlier today , the small flakes drifting slowly down , in no apparent rush to reach the ground later , the wind picked up , and so did the speed of the flakes , swirling around in miniature flurries , seeming to create momentary ghosts that quickly scatter into thousands of individual shards i find it hard to believe , having grown up here , that some people in other parts of the world have never seen snow ! never walked on a frozen lake , or built snow forts i know it 's true , but winter and snow have always been such a big part of my life that i 'd truly miss them now here 's another thing i do n't understand so called snowbirds who leave for warmer parts at the first whisper of snow i would never want to do that ! i 'll admit that by the time february rolls around i'm sick to death of brushing snow off the car every single time we want to go somewhere , sick of shoveling , sick of frostbit cheeks and wet pant legs simply from taking a walk but still , all that is most definitely worth it for the beauty of a fresh , untouched snowfall and catching snowflakes on your tongue for the way that snowflakes glitter under a streetlight , and the way your voice is muffled by the blanket of snow for having a huge snowball fight , then stumbling , still laughing , into the house to warm up by the wood stove , nursing a cup of hot chocolate in case you had n't noticed , i'm in a poetic mood , and loving the beautiful snow i said i had n't posted pictures for to long , so i'm now going to remedy that as the days grow colder i experiment with black and white photography does n't my blog look more interesting that way ? i experiment with sepia tone i eat peanut butter fudge we become pensive i watch the snow we pull out our fuzzy sweaters we happily move inside to escape from the cold outside we go to emi 's pipes and drums school christmas party i continue to make lots of yummy stirfry 's i read about paganism i continue to find cool names and the cats put in even more snuggle time may you all have beautiful cold weather days peace , idzie
