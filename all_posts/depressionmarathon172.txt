it 's a big , amazing , unbelievable day today double digits it 's been ten years since i took my last drink of alcohol ten years since i lived in the self centered , manipulative , miserable world of an active alcoholic today , thanks to my higher power , my adoption of the tools of my recovery program , and my work with others , i am a recovered alcoholic one day at a time , , days , i am sober , and that truly is amazing i'm amazed because ten years ago i could not have imagined a life without alcohol it was my medication , my social lubricant , my muscle relaxant , and my solution to life but , and i must remember this , alcohol also isolated me , filled me with despondency , and left me a suicidal mess incapable of coping with life sobriety is a gift it is a gift of life the tools i 've been so freely given in my recovery have allowed me to live life on life 's terms i no longer try to control the uncontrollable that is , the people , places , and things outside of myself that is truly a gift drama has been removed from my life i now have the internal resources to deal with that which is in front of me , whether it be a crumbling relationship , a debilitating injury , a job decision , or major depression of course it 's not all sunshine and roses life never is i struggle i hurt i feel but the gift of my life today is i do n't have to get drunk over any of it even in the depths of my mental illness , the darkness that is depression , i know it would only get worse if i took a drink i'm so fortunate to understand that and i'm so grateful i do i have no great understanding of why i got this gift why me and not my fellow sufferer ? i cannot explain it i am not special or unique i certainly did not approach sobriety with a stellar attitude i saw no similarities between myself and my fellow sufferers , only differences of course i had no desire to be like any of them ! alcoholic was not a diagnosis i yearned to acquire yet despite my attitude and arrogance , i got the gift anyway i stuck around i became willing i kept coming back and ten years later i'm still here , still listening , still soaking it all in today i live in the solution rather than the problem with the deck seemingly stacked against me , i got sober anyway and i'm sober today i'm a participant in my life , doing the best i can , and not looking back thank god ! ten years more grateful , i could not be
