there is a new study out about cancer and psychosis it pretty much supports what i have been writing about for years what they found is that a mother who smoked throughout her pregnancy has a greater chance of giving birth to someone who later develop cancer and or psychosis at a relatively earlier age if the mother was subject to pollutants or carcinogens while pregnant , she carried toxins in her system , those toxins found their way into the baby and the amount was about the levels the mother had i believe that the earlier the mother smoked the greater the later chances of catastrophic disease it is also a problem if the carrying mother does not get the proper nutrients because there are chemicals that help build gating very early on that contributes to the later ability to hold back pain and emotional turmoil think about this the more catastrophic and earlier the imprinted trauma the more catastrophic the effects later on what they also found was that it was epigenetics , the effects of the baby s life in the womb influenced directly by the mother but also later life stress that would produce cancer or psychosis in other words , it is not only changes during womb life that is the problem but the compounding of stress and of lack of love in childhood that made the symptoms overt and manifest in short , if the child were completely loved , despite the changes in the effects on the changes during womb life , he might not become schizophrenic or develop cancer this makes total sense , and is what i called compounding early trauma plus the add on of no love , neglect and indifference on the part of the parents of course , growing up in foster care or in an orphanage greatly exacerbates the problem it may not show for years but chances are it will show you can t fool mother nature and her offspring mother nurture so yes , there is hope to avoid serious disease , even with a bad gestational period , but once it is manifest it is very very difficult to reverse once there is organ damage , and that includes the brain , it is a tough job once the gating system is affected all sorts of problems later occur from impulsive acting out , to explosiveness and bad temper from premature ejaculation to bed wetting you fill in the blanks but it usually involves compounding even growing up in poverty delivers its adverse affects on the genes the epigenetics one of the clear effects in the epigenetic changes is found in later addiction why is there such an aha ! moment when someone takes a drug that soon makes them addicted to it ? for this we are indebted to dr eric nestler whose research into cocaine addiction is crucial but first let me say that during womb life and infancy there are chemical changes occurring that become imprinted and endure for a lifetime when a drug comes along that makes up for the deficit it is sought after assiduously there are changes in the chemical composition surrounding the genes that help either give permission for later expression of feelings acetyl group or deny permission methyl group in other words , the personality of repression , and laid back , non emotionality has its starting blocks during womb life then when coupled with repressive , unemotional parents there is a compounding of this kind of personality which endures she is not being able to express herself which began with methylation during womb life and exacerbated during childhood for cocaine addiction it may be that the cellular permission an opening up of the system , given by ingestion of the drug which helps expression of feelings , taking away the heavy burden of repression engendered by a childhood of neglect and lack of touch makes it very attractive biologically so addiction may well begin in the womb there is a lack of certain chemicals we needed but did not secrete enough , that made some drugs such as cocaine fill the bill in depression we need to look seriously at how were over methylated during womb life again the starting block for later depression lies very early in life and makes for suicidal depression later on when other adversities impact us loss of wife or husband , loss of job and above all , loss of hope epigenetic mechanisms play into our childhood social life and can reinforce basic personality types rat pups raised by loving permissive mothers do better later on than those same pups raised in non loving domineering mothers and wouldn t you know it , one of the great spreads of the methyl group finds its way into the emotional centers such as the amygdala in any case , heavy addiction is found not only in an unloving childhood environment , but earlier when the epigenes are forming and causing biochemical deficits that have to be made up for later on here is what late research shows mothers who smoke cause a radical increase of diabetes , hypertension high blood pressure and obesity in the offspring then if the mother is anxious or depressed we have compounding and a greater chance for premature disease this includes psoriasis the point is that it is not only genes that are heritable but also the epigenes what happened to the gene development while we lived in the womb genes are the notes to the music but the music depends on the epigenes they conduct the symphony and decide who plays and who remains silent during the development of the piece if the mother does pot or takes serious pain killers then there is a direct effect on the offspring s gating system , producing serious dents and leaks in it and perhaps affecting later psychosis what those drugs do is operate on the methylation and acetylation process affecting our ability to repress and inhibit this results often in an out of control impulsive personality womb life has opened the gates prematurely acetylation at least , it makes the gating system vulnerable to later trauma compounding , again not all is lost it has been found that later great parental loving can help reverse some of the damage epigenetics can be somewhat reversed , i think with our therapy where we relive and integrate very early damage or maybe later on there will be drugs that contain methionine that help reverse damage , as well one of the major effects of womb trauma is later pulmonary dysfunction and breathing problems , not the least of which is asthma it looks like genetic but that isn t the whole story if the carrying mother is fat there is good chance that the offspring will have that tendency how she eats while pregnant has a lot to do with the nutrients available or not to the baby and worse , very bad nutrition affects the chemicals that go into producing good gating including methionine that we produce , along with folic acid it is never one thing , but one childhood
