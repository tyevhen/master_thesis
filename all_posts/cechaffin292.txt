my weeping spells continue most of the day there has long been a debate in psychology about which comes first , the affect or the thought obviously in the death of a loved one the thought precedes the affect but clinically , as in my case , the affect overcomes me and afterwards i may append thoughts , but the thoughts are not valid when sad you seek something sad in your mind to explain it so i can fasten on rachel s death , or my own infinite shortcomings to fill the necessary object for the sadness but in truth there is no object the labels are falsely appended afterwards i cry because i cry when i cry i keep hearing in my inner mind god helps those who help themselves it s true , you know i m not saying i have to make the burden worse by trying harder , just that i should make the effort to cope and seek help as best i can i am doing that in fact , the doctor started me on a new medicine yesterday , only a tablet which we can t afford nevertheless kathleen insisted that we buy it now that she has a job i would not have spent the money but she would do anything to make me well this depression has now matched my longest depression of , also mos and sent packing with ect i ve thought of starting a fund drive dr chaffin needs ect he has no insurance and no way of getting the proper treatment it will cost around k please send your donation to dr craig chaffin , po box , ft bragg , ca , who knows ? maybe a millionaire will read this and send me the money i promise to use it only for treatment , and if the medications start working consistently , i will naturally send the money back i said i was done with poetry but the other day i reverted to the familiar form to exorcise some dark feelings kentucky fried christ i wear the elephant man s mask like a jewskin lampshade do you see the glow of hell through it ? come , warm yourself , take my gold fillings , my bones for your camellias living is for men in sunglasses who can filter the not me from the me suicide is for sissies in little nautical suits with big bow ties don t worry about me if my blood has been desiccated and ground to red pepper , remember me on your pizza i am the jesus of the broken cell phone , the savior of ceramic kitsch i ll glue that broken cat with the clock in its belly back together with my spittle of my healing there shall be no end i think that s pretty dark the title , incidentally , was furnished by my old friend with whom i have recently reconciled , eric he seems in a very good space , content with his lot in life , grateful to serve in a church where he is a deacon it was my illness that drove him away in the first place funny , for the last two nights i saw tv ads for bipolar treatment although they never came out and named a drug , you know some big pharmaceutical company is behind them and in emily martin s book , bipolar expeditions , she points out that the hypomanic manic side of the illness is considered valuable in business so bipolar disease has become fashionable nowadays , it seems , and is being greatly overdiagnosed in children i for one resent the lowering of the bar for diagnosis the word lunatic is derived from early observations of manic depressives , whose cycling was thought to be associated with the phases of the moon as a true lunatic i don t want some penny ante bipolar ii or cyclothymic wannabe sharing my hard won moniker in this matter btw , i should say , that although i don t pick up the phone , i am always happy when someone calls me , as a friend did today though i teared up several times on the phone , my voice cracking , listening to him was a great comfort so don t be afraid to call me , i m happy to hear from you write me if you need my phone number my only caveat is that i already know you i don t want to encounter new people , i am in no position to make new friends right now , the strain of the introduction would be too much thine in lunacy , ce
