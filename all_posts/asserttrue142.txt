every once in a while , a scientific theory comes along that so aptly covers a problem space , you want to slap yourself in the head and say how could we possibly have missed that until now ? that 's kind of how i feel about the selfish ribosome theory it 's so retrospectively obvious and apt , such a good working hypothesis , that you just go good , good , let 's stay with this a while and see where it takes us let 's assume , provisionally , that it 's right until proven wrong if you 're not a biologist the ribosome is a large , complex molecular machine , a kind of nanobot , found within all living cells , that serves as the site of protein synthesis an rna guided process called translation peptide syn by boumphreyfr licensed under cc by sa via wikimedia commons transfer rnas each attached to an amino acid arrive at the ribosome , which acts as the scaffolding for production of protein in accordance with the sequence information provided by messenger rna the trna donates its amino acid to the growing peptide chain , then gets released back to the cell 's trna pool the ribosome is a structurally complex beast made up of more than individual proteins plus ribosomal rna rrna , not shown a bacterial cell may have , ribosomes but a mammalian cell can easily have million this is what they look like each ribosome is about nanometers in diameter meredith and robert root bernstein sum it up in their feb paper the ribosome as a missing link in the evolution of life many steps in the evolution of cellular life are still mysterious we suggest that the ribosome may represent one important missing link between compositional or metabolism first , rna world or genes first , and cellular last universal common ancestor approaches to the evolution of cells we present evidence that the entire set of transfer rnas for all twenty amino acids are encoded in both the s and s rrnas of escherichia coli k that nucleotide sequences that could encode key fragments of ribosomal proteins , polymerases , ligases , synthetases , and phosphatases are to be found in each of the six possible reading frames of the s and s rrnas and that every sequence of bases in rrna has information encoding more than one of these functions in addition to acting as a structural component of the ribosome ribosomal rna , in short , is not just a structural scaffold for proteins , but the vestigial remnant of a primordial genome that may have encoded a self organizing , self replicating , auto catalytic intermediary between macromolecules and cellular life the ribosome centric view says that ribosomes , not cells , were the first self replicating proto life forms and in fact the genome may merely have arisen as an artifact of ribosome self preservation and also the bounded cell is a further artifact created to make ribosomal machinery more portable meredith and robert root bernstein provide many great bits of evidence that ribosomes were , in fact , the first replicons , well in advance of dna , chromosomes , cells , etc , some of which are alluded to in the above quoted abstract yet another intriguing bit of evidence is the fact that the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase which has the curious ability to create rna without using a dna template has many deep structural similarities with ribosomal protein s , a fact that was first noticed almost years ago pnpase is a ubiquitous , highly conserved enzyme , probably quite ancient , that catalyzes a reversible reaction in which rna can be degraded into high energy nucleoside diphosphates , or conversely ndps can be polymerized into nonsense rna the pnpase reaction can go either direction here , just a down arrow is shown with equal ease i 've long felt that pnpase which i think we can assume arose as a variant of the s ribosomal protein originally served to create non templated rna for energy storage and for stockpiling of biologically rare and valuable complex nitrogen products in the form of nucleotides the rna produced by pnpase is a lifo last in , first out stack based , nonsense sequence product , which makes no sense from a genetic information storage point of view , but makes a lot of sense as an energy molecule , a prehistoric kind of starch if you will , a polymer for persistent storage of nucleotides and the energy they represent , in the ndp form nucleoside diphosphates would have been quite valuable to the replicon , not only in an energy sense but for nitrogen stockpiling it 's possible and likely , it seems to me that nucleoside diphosphate energy molecules preceded triphosphates atp , and the early energy economy may have indiscriminately used ndps of all four major types udp , adp , gdp , cdp before settling on adenine based adp atp as the chief energy currency so many ideas like this spring into your mind if you 're a biogeek from the ribosome first hypothesis that it 's just plain thrilling i , for one , ca n't wait to see where the selfish ribosome theory takes us it has broad implications for evolutionary theory , cell biology , astrobiology , genetics , bioenergetics , and other areas i say let 's get to work fleshing this thing out have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ? tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms lie but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend i want to thank the following great folks who retweeted me yesterday on twitter my advice ? follow these guys they retweet ! have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit
