many people begin psychotherapy because they either become aware that they 're disconnected from their emotions , they ca n't identify or express their emotions or they are overwhelmed by feelings that they do n't understand they might know that they 're not feeling right , but they do n't know what 's wrong they might be able to see the consequences of their problem in their personal or work relationships or in their difficulty with achieving their goals they might also have problems just getting through the day but , other than knowing that something is wrong , they do n't know where to begin then , on top of that , they judge themselves harshly for not knowing what to do an inability to identify , understand and express certain emotions can be frustrating it 's not unusual to be aware that you 're having a certain , vague emotional discomfort but not know what 's happening to you at times , this experience can feel scary because you might feel out of control most people like to have a sense of control in their lives , especially over their own emotions for some people , when they feel out of control , they might feel like they 're going crazy or , conversely , some people feel emotionally flat they do n't feel the highs and lows that others feel and they wonder if something is wrong with them often , it 's more about never having learned to identify feelings in the first place this usually occurs in families where , for a variety of reasons , children are discouraged from feeling their emotions in subtle and not so subtle ways , children in these families learn that emotions are dangerous things to be avoided , especially any type of strong emotion these children learn to disconnect from their emotions and , if strong feelings do come to the surface despite their best efforts to tamp them down , they find other ways , usually self destructive ways , to dissociate from their emotions an inability to identify , understand and express your emotions can ruin your relationship the following vignette , which is a composite of many psychotherapy cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality , illustrates how a child in a family where emotions are discouraged grows up into an adult who is unable to identify his emotions tom when tom began psychotherapy , he was in crisis his girlfriend of two years , betty , was threatening to leave their relationship because she felt that tom was not emotionally available to her and her emotional needs were n't being met in their relationship on some vague level , tom understood that betty was n't happy , but he was also confused about the problem he did n't understand what the problem was , why it was happening , or how to change it he had never participated in psychotherapy before because he thought it was for people who are crazy but , at the point when he started therapy , he was at a loss as to what to do he did n't want to lose betty and she offered to give him time to figure things out in therapy before she left the relationship at the start of therapy , tom was only able to identify his fear of losing betty , which he also did not understand other than that , in general , he could n't say if he felt angry , sad , frustrated , or happy he talked about feeling like , before his relationship with betty , he was just going through the motions for most of his life he said that he was unaware of any highs and lows most of the time aside from how betty experienced tom , now that he was faced with the possible loss of his relationship , tom was n't satisfied with his inability to identify , feel or express his emotions he wanted to change , but he did n't know how when we explored tom 's experiences as a child , it made sense that tom was so out of touch with his feelings as an only child , tom grew up with parents who provided him with everything that he needed materially , but they were emotionally distant from tom as well as in their own relationship with each other they never abused him physically or emotionally he was not physically neglected in any way tom 's parents taught him to be an ethical , hard working person , but they did n't value relationships they had no friends of their own , and they could n't understand why tom would want to spend time playing with other children or why he would even want them , as his parents , to spend time playing with him it did n't make sense to them they could n't understand why he would want them to come to see him in a school play or why he would even want to participate in the play at all they viewed most things in terms of its utilitarian value was it right ? was it useful ? if not , why do it ? so , tom spent most of his time alone tom 's parents also discouraged him from having any strong emotions , whether it was happy , sad or angry rather than treating tom as a child who needed emotional nurturing , they treated him like a little adult tom never saw his parents being affectionate with each other they were often preoccupied and distracted with their own individual projects and concerns in separate parts of the house even at dinner , his father often read the newspaper to himself and his mother read a book tom usually ate his dinner staring at his plate in silence when he got a little older , tom became convinced that he was a mistake , and they never intended to have children at all whenever his parents heard about a couple who wanted a child or someone who was happy about having just given birth , they were mystified without any awareness of how it might affect tom , they often openly expressed their bewilderment about why couples would want children at all they talked about how expensive it was to raise a child and how it limited people 's lives because it was so time consuming as a result , as a child , tom was careful not to be a nuisance to his parents he was diligent about his studies and got good grades because he knew it was expected of him throughout his life , he often had only one friend at any given time most of the time , it was someone who was outgoing and saw something about tom that was appealing and endearing usually , this person made most of the effort to keep the friendship going tom felt that he went through the motions in college he neither enjoyed it nor disliked it he did n't think in those terms going to college was something that was expected of him , and he knew he needed to do it to get a decent job he dated very little in college he was accustomed to spending most of his time on his own , so he did n't miss companionship and he did n't feel especially sexual after college , tom understood that his parents expected him to move out on his own his parents felt they had done their duty as parents to raise him to the age of , and now he needed to take care of himself he obtained a good paying full time job as a technical writer , and he also worked part time in a book store to be able to afford his own apartment in manhattan his parents never came to see his apartment nor did they express any curiosity about it after he moved out , tom only saw his parents occasionally they always seemed surprised when he called them and he said he wanted to come over to see them when they did get together , it was often at times when tom could help them with some household project so , after he moved out , this became the focus of tom 's relationship with his parents once again , the focus was utilitarian and not based on mutual love or affection when tom met betty , he sensed immediately that there was something very different about her aside from being very bright and sharing similar values , she was an affectionate , enthusiastic young woman at first , he was n't sure if he liked how emotionally effusive she was with him it felt somewhat strange and unfamiliar although he did n't understand it , he tolerated it but he also felt she was a good person and he wanted to get to know her better initially , she told him that she was drawn to him because he seemed so emotionally independent early on , she teased him sometimes about being somewhat aloof , but she also cared about him a great deal for his part , tom felt himself drawn to and curious about betty it was the first time that he felt sexually drawn to someone they also both cared about the environment and worked on local ecological projects together the problems began in the second year of their relationship at that point , betty wanted to take the relationship to the next level she felt committed to their relationship , but she said she was never sure how tom was feeling about it she knew that she loved him and that he cared about her , but she was n't sure if he loved her or not they were both in their mid s , and she wanted to get married and have children she told tom that she wanted to make a life with him , but she was n't sure how he felt when betty told him this , tom was somewhat bewildered by it he felt fine about how their relationship just the way it was he did n't see the need to change it to get married , and he certainly did n't see the need for children as time went on , betty began to express her dissatisfaction with what she described as tom 's emotional distance what she once saw as tom 's emotional independence she now perceived as his being cold and too distant she told him that she loved him , but he was not meeting her emotional needs when tom heard this , he realized that he had never really thought about his own emotional needs before it was n't until tom was faced with the possibility of losing betty that he even considered his emotional needs as betty became increasingly aware of the extent of tom 's problems , betty suggested that tom seek out a psychotherapist to get help tom contacted his doctor , and his doctor referred tom to me when tom started therapy , betty agreed to be patient and to give tom a chance to change in therapy tom came to our psychotherapy sessions diligently once a week slowly , over time , tom began to identify his feelings at first , tom was most aware of the fear that he felt about losing betty gradually , he began to be able to identify other feelings , including a deep sadness , which had been buried since childhood , about his parents' emotional aloofness with him he struggled to mourn what he did n't get from them as a child and how lonely he had been at first , experiencing his emotions was frightening for him we worked on tom developing coping strategies , including daily meditation , for when he felt overwhelmed but struggling with these emotions also heightened his appreciation for betty 's love and affection over time , betty told tom that she noticed a difference in him that she liked she felt that tom was more emotionally available to her for his part , tom expressed feeling like he was waking up from a long , dull sleep he was a naturally curious person , and he approached these changes with a mixture of curiosity , real excitement for the first time that he could remember , and also some fear and sadness but , as he became more accustomed to feeling his emotions , tom also felt that his every day world was opening up to him he approached his relationship , his work and life in general as if he was given a new pair of eyes where he could see and sense things he never felt before as he developed a greater capacity to identify , feel and express his emotions , tom 's relationship with betty became much closer he realized what he had been missing for most of his life , and he felt a deep sense of gratitude that he had finally found it and could appreciate it within a couple of years of starting therapy , tom and betty were planning their wedding and talking about having children for the first time in his life , tom felt he understood that he had something to offer a wife and family on an emotional level , and he could also take in emotionally what they had to offer him there are so many reasons why people have difficulty identifying , feeling and expressing their emotions in tom 's case , it was due to being raised in a household where his parents were very aloof and discouraged the expression of emotions or even the recognition of emotional needs for other people , it might be the opposite maybe they grew up in a family that was explosive where they learned that emotions were dangerous getting help in therapy the good news is that it 's never too late to learn how to identify , feel and express your emotions in a healthy way psychotherapy
