my nomination in the category of best ajax based word workalike for this week is zoho write , one of a suite of impressive zoho apps it took a while sec for firefox to pull down all external js scripts , but when the app opened , it was a thing of beauty imagine my abject stupefaction upon using the import button to suck in a complex many tables , many fonts sxw file , and seeing it open without errors , looking just the way it should ! yes , zoho write handles openoffice files just as nature intended unlike a lot of web apps , zoho is not the product of a teenager locked in a closet behind the z suite is a ten year old company , adventnet , with offices around the world this is starting to get exciting
