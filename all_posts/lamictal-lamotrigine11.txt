i promise , i 'll stop writing about constipation soon because i think it 's finally going away in a post last week , i wondered whether my gi problems might be caused by a minor electrolyte imbalance electrolyte imbalance is n't a common cause of constipation usually the culprit is a low fiber diet my diet includes enough fruits and veggies that this should n't be a problem i tried eating prunes , and cheerios , and and anything else that might have a laxative effect , but no luck i thought that perhaps the lamictal dry mouth is causing me to drink so much water that i'm pissing away electrolytes over the weekend , i started drinking emergen c , which in addition to crazy amounts of vitamin c which i do n't really care about serves as an electrolyte replacement drink and i can report that it helped enormously ca n't say that i'm back to normal , but i'm feeling so much better so if you 're having gi issues with lamictal , try drinking gatorade or any other electrolyte replacement beverage it might really help
