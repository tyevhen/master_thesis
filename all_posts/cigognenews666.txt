i discussed right and left brain in my primal healing but i will take it a step further and make it more personal i grew up a mess , anxious and in unrelenting pain i was dominated by my right brain i could not learn , focus or concentrate i can now but as i got into feeling and connection , my left brain began to take over its proper function and i think there is a balance now that is also what our research shows since i believe that the right , feeling brain is charged with an overall perspective , a coordination of disparate event , i was good at that and poor in point by point research the details eluded me too anxious for that the good part of this is that it allowed me to see the grand picture and to place separate aspects of human behavior and feeling in a more holistic frame of reference thus , the right brain dominance allowed me a broad frame of reference , the connotative approach i could pay attention to nuance and implications rather than the denotive process of each and every fact being examined separately and it led me to an overall therapy that did not focus on this fact or that , like cognitive therapy or emdr it allowed me to deal with the whole human being so there is a good part of being dominated by one s emotions now as my left brain develops , and i think it developed very late in my life , i can add the intellectual dimension to what i am researching and put two and two together our research into our patients who had one year or more of our therapy found that there was this shift from right to left , forming a more balanced brain finally , we can find relief and harmony no small matter now why was i right brain ? judging by my birth primals i had a horrific , extended birth with a mother who became psychotic after my birth , and who gave me immediately to my grandmother who eventually killed herself , forcing my mother into an asylum i was then given away to a strange family for some long period of time the pain was building from the start and there was nothing i could do , no behavioral option that could get me love , or at least approval there were no options to get out of my predicament so i suffered i never knew it was suffering it was just add plus plus constant anxiety and nightmares so generally when there is add , look for the suffering and treat it , not just the lack of focus or concentration and when there are nightmares look carefully at gestation and birth you will no doubt find many answers there there is hope the more we become integrated it will show in our brain scans and in our general feeling of relaxation you cannot relax with an uneven , unbalanced brain a brain that is skewed to one side or the other being normal means being balanced and harmonious that is the best of feeling you will never get there in one blow it takes many , many relivings but the direction is always right and slowly integration takes place and the imbalance becomes balance generally of the scientists i have treated there is a common denominator they got what passed for love by being smart and getting good grades all they had to do was eschew feelings so they grew up left brain dominant even when they understand the research and the importance of feeling , they cannot make the trip from left to right they remain unbalanced it is not an intellectual difference it is a matter of a whole upbringing you cannot by any force of will make that transition the only way is to open up the right brain to feeling and then build on that feelings come first , not the new ideas that is why fourteen year old students i have spoken to get it right away that is why my patients in pain and feeling also get it those who don t , see feelings as some foreign land it is strange and incomprehensible to them a place never to tread feelings will eventually sway the intellect never the reverse where one can understand it all with the left brain and then make the transition feelings change ideas ideas rarely change feelings
