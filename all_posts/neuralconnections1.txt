source what is needed in the recipe ? intra , inter , extra , and mysterious hippocampal connectivity serving size hemisphere while being one of the most extensively studied structures amongst the subcortical and cortical tissues , the hippocampus has shown itself to have quite complex connectivity and still remains an enigmatic structure , both in terms of functional , local , and regional connectivity while great strides have been made through anatomical , electrophysiological , and image based tracing , the hippocampal formation leaves much to be desired with the advent of the 'human connectome project' and the 'rodent connectome project' see references , mapping brain circuitry has never been visualized easier or more beautifully of interest to me , of course , is the hippocampal local and regional connectivity for an extensive , interactive version of the connections , check out here right click 'interactive diagram pdf' and 'save as' from here , my references to any hippocampal connections will be in regards to the rodent , as many connections mentioned are shared within the human brain read more for connectivity of entorhinal cortex to hippocampus and beyond ! fig burwell lab the hippocampus yellow in the figure is a banana shaped structure within the temporal lobe and a critical component in the limbic system its main input comes from the adjacent entorhinal cortex and the majority of the output is sent out through the subiculum from area ca it is classicaly described as a tri synaptic pathway , receiving information from the entorhinal cortex , sending it along through the dentate gyrus , ca , and ca however , this tri synaptic pathway term seems a bit irrelevant when you look more closely for the entorhinal cortex alone sends projections to all ca subfields , the ca has projections that go to the fornix , has recurrent collaterals with itself , and has a back projection to the dentate gyrus , and the subiculum sends projections back to the entorhinal cortex along with other cortical and subcortical regions this brief summary will be straight forward connectivity some may be bored , but i think that it is rather exciting when you think of the extensive connections and the functional implications ! this is meant to be a somewhat detailed primer of the major largely intra hippocampal connections if you want the full treatment , get the interactive pdf above or read the hippocampus book see references entorhinal cortex because i will be focusing on the entorhinal cortex efferents , i will only say that the entorhinal cortex receives information from a variety cortical and subcortical regions amygdala , olfactory bulb , cingulate cortex , temporal cortex and the orbital cortex along with other frontal and parietal regions fig entorhinal cortex see text to left for details source the entorhinal cortex ec is known primarily as the cortical region that feeds into the hippocampus green in fig green purple in fig a b the ec is divided in to the lateral towards the outside of the brain and medial towards the middle of the brain portions and composed of laminar layers i vi that are cytoarchitectonically distinct commonly , ec orientation is described running in a diagonal fig e , yellow band running from upperleft dorso lateral down to lower right ventro medial as an overview , most of the dorso lateral ec sends efferents out to the dorsal hippocampus , while the ventro medial to the ventral hippocampus fig e d , matching blue and purple in these subfigures see below for more details the ec sends two main projections to the dentate gyrus through the medial and lateral perforant pathways fig mpp and lpp the perforant pathway pp largely originates in superficial layer ii of the ec but also projections from layers iii , iv , v , vi exist this pp innervates the supra and infra pyramidal blades of the dentate gyrus and the axons terminate in the molecular layer there also exists longer projections to ca and ca subiculum from layers ii iii of the ec pyramidal cells in the molecular layer the lateral and medial ec send projections directly to ca known as the temporoammonic pathway and are processed in different parts of the ca and subiculum along the transverse axis lateral ec distal ca proximal subiculum , while medial ec proximal ca distal subiculum along the septo temporal long axis , dorsolateral ec project to the septal dorsal hippocampus , intermediate ec to the splenial intermediate hippocampus , and the ventromedial ec to the temporal ventral hippocampus fig e d , matching blue and purple in these subfigures these pp fibers bifurcate along the way and also send off collateral processes that innervate distal levels along the septo temporal axis in addition , a return projection from the ca subiculum into the deep layers of the ec exists , which then can take paths back into the dg from superficial layers like above , or out to other neocortical regions hippocampus proper there are two major ways to enter the hippocampus via the perforant pathway or via the pre commissural branch of the fornix from the septal nuclei the hippocampus proper is defined as the dentate gyrus and ca fields ca that form two interlocking cs the dentate gyrus contains two main regions the fascia dentata and the hilus it is made up of prominent layers below because the dentate gyrus is located between the neocortex new cortex with laminar layers , like that of the ec and the diencephalon , it is referred to as archicortex old cortex the subiculum , largely considered the output of the hippocampus , is a transition zone from to layers dentate gyrus has prominent layers hilus , granular layer , molecular layers source in the dentate gyrus , the deepest layer is known as stratum moleculare , which is divided into an outer red in figure and inner yellow portion this layer contains proximal dendrites and is the main synaptic junction for perforant path fibers from ec commissural projections from the contralateral dentate gyrus and medial septal area are located here this region , too , is situated directly above the hippocampal fissure separates dentate and ca field the layer below is the stratum granulosum purple in figure , so named because it contains the cell bodies of granule cells , which are the main excitatory neurons in this area the stratum multiforme , usually just referred to as the hilus or sometimes the polymorphic layer , is often considered a separate layer and sometimes is also referred to as ca yellow green in figure this layer is the house of inhibitory interneurons in the dentate gyrus and the mossy fiber projections pass through this region en route to ca neurons in the dentate are located along the granular layer stratum granulare these neurons send projections to area ca known as 'mossy fibers' neurons in area ca can send information out through the fornix , back project to dentate gyrus , re excite themselves , or continue onto area ca layers of ca fields source the ca cornu ammonis fields , too , contain distinct strata and house excitatory neurons known as pyramidal cells the alveus is the most superficial layer and contains the commissural fibers of pyramidal cells via the fimbria , a major source of output from the hippocampus stratum oriens layer contains basal dendrites of the pyramidal cells and a large body of basket cells inhibitory interneurons this strata includes fibers from the septal and commissural areas that are received from the contralateral hippocampus this region also contains the basal dendrites of the pyramidal cells the next layer is the stratum pyramidale , named so because it contains the soma , or cell body , of the pyramidal cell this layer in ca contains the mossy fiber connections and also houses interneurons the stratum moleculare is divided into sublayers the stratum lucidum is the thinnest layer and , in ca , this area receives input from the dentate gyrus mossy fibers stratum radiatum contains apical dendrites of the neurons in the s pyramidale layer in ca , these dendrites form synaptic connections with the schaffer collaters , which are the main axonal projections from ca the stratum lacunosum , in ca , contains synapses of the schaffer collaterals and is also where the perforant path projects from the ec stratum moleculare contains apical dendrites that extend here from s pyramidale and these dendrites , in ca , are where perforant path fibers synapse typically , these last two sublayers are referred to as stratum lacunosum moleculare if you want to see the main inputs and outputs of the hippocampus in action , check out here for their interactive diagrams d rendering of the hippocampus in layers bottom ca fields , middle dentate gyrus , top subiculum overlaying the hippocampus proper is the retrohippocampus , which includes entorhinal cortex , para subiculum , pre subiculum , subiculum post subiculum d images made using brain explorer available here i was going to continue and write about hippocampal connections with the septal region , fimbria fornix , subiculum , etc and try to cover neurotransmission , but this post would then be incredibly long another day ! i am not a neuroanatomist so , as one would expect , this is by no means complete and or detailed enough for a comprehensive connectivity guide references
