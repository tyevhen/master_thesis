there 's no change thus far in the mood department , but i'm tired of writing about that i 'd rather turn my focus forward today i am preparing for a weekend away with d actually , i 've been preparing for several days , as he and i are attending his semi formal christmas party on saturday semi formal is not something with which i am typically associated i had to go shopping it 's hard to shop when feeling heavy and tearful fortunately , i found a couple of items fairly quickly and bought them without even trying them on i could n't get out of that store fast enough my friend , cindy , took over from there i tried on a couple of combinations of skirts and tops for her , and we settled on a lovely combination of black on black ! how appropriate ! at least the color of my outfit will match my mood ! cindy set me up with a couple of accessories , like a black velvet coat , and i am apparently all set i am actually looking forward to this event it 's been a really long time since i 've gotten all dressed up and if i do say so myself , i believe i will look rather stunning despite how i 've been feeling ! maybe i 'll post some pictures and let you be the judge regardless of my appearance , i am looking forward to an evening of getting outside myself , focusing on others in the moment , and having some fun as difficult as life has been recently , it 's nice to focus forward for a change
