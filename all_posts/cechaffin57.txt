as in chronic pain , depression is a signal gone awry normally the physiology of grief is a relief how it felt when i cried at my daughter 's viewing and memorial tears were cleansing and healing in depression the body 's gone on automatic behaviors initiated by grief become automatic behaviors the constant state of ill feeling that accompanies this has been christened dysphoria by psychiatrists , roughly the opposite of euphoria normally depressive symptoms should signal a need for change in one 's environment or relations it is a warning that you are headed the wrong way but in the case of the manic depressive , depression can strike when all circumstances are good and there 's nothing in your life you would change or could change to make it better an example i left my first wife after thirteen years when the marriage had been dead for a good while i could n't bear to leave my young daughters but i had to leave for my mental health when i took that step my depression continued on for maybe eight months , irrespective of the changes for the better in my life if i were physically able to return to the practice of medicine it would only feed my self esteem if i were euthymic normal mood in times of depression i would think myself incompetent no matter how competent i was this is why therapy does n't work for bipolars in general if they get better , their mood was rising anyway if they get worse , perhaps it 's the wrong therapy i have a poem about this glass giraffe when my soul was sanded so raw the capillaries could n't even seep , i questioned the value of pain you must experience your feelings of abandonment until you are comfortable with them , you said when my suicidal doppelg nger turned me inside out , pulling my anus through my mouth , you said , now that you are stripped of defenses you have a better chance of changing them when i called you up one weekend to say i was terrified of inanimate objects like doorknobs and tea kettles , you said , stay with it globalized fear indicates a necessary therapeutic regression finally the antidepressants kicked in and i felt like myself when i left you gave me another card since therapy was unfinished and i might be back on your couch or another s i gazed at your office figurines , crystal leopards and pewter trolls , porcelain ballerinas and kachina dolls , and imagined the souls of all your patients trapped inside them those , who like me , sought relief through words when only medicines would do i could have been the glass giraffe published in poetry magazine even so i'm open to therapy perhaps it might help , it just never has the most popular and successful therapy in depression is cognitive behavioral therapy , which is a fancy word for cheering someone up with positive thoughts and actions , limiting negative self talk and the like but i am cynical about the process these sorts of things require a kind of blind faith which i lack i see through the fog of words to the truth unless one believes in a good god as the basis for loving oneself and others , on what can you base positive thoughts ? because it works , i suppose is the practical answer , though not to date on this patient one temptation in depression is thus a mad rush to change things but i ca n't think of a single major thing in my life i 'd want to change except for the universal complaint that a little more money would be nice i do want to be busier i'm presently training to be a hospice volunteer anything that gets me out of the house is welcome in my first great depression as an adult , during my last year at ucla , i worked three jobs and took a full course load just to fill every available waking hour , but it did n't help a bit still it is better to be in motion than becalmed and becalmed is what i feel right now i do n't have enough to do my back limits how much i can do physically , which is n't much beside walking it limits how long i can sit at this computer as i said at the outset , chronic pain is akin to depression the signal that warns us of injury wo n't shut down long after the injury is stable pain only concentrates the mind on pain , it does n't concentrate its powers because of it as i write i must suppress the signal from my lumbar spine , a deep ache , a gnawing cold , a steady burning although i have been technically disabled since i can hardly believe it i have never psychologically accepted my condition if i attempt gardening for an hour i am quickly reminded of the severity of my chronic pain and do n't recover from the new insult for several days i make a devil 's bargain with pain the pleasure of an hour 's weeding translates into several days of increased suffering ah , but i have flowers ! experiences like this ought to convince me but somehow my self concept wo n't yield to the idea of disability i always thought my condition would be temporary i never dreamed i would have gone without money earning work all this time it makes me feel guilty for how little i 've accomplished over publications and three books one edited you may say that 's something and it is , but if a dedicated writer had had this time to write he would have written more , perhaps garnered commercial success and gotten off disability as my main metier is poetry , it is unrealistic to expect that could ever happen but i suck at fiction , with the exception of a few short stories sure , as a poet i 've had minor successes , but i have n't been able to crack the glass ceiling of the best journals in my present rejection folder i have ten rejections from poetry yes , i 've sent out another submission to them what am i saying ? i wish there were something in my life i could change to escape depression my experience has taught me that all i can do is wait for the drugs to work , or change the drugs until they do it 's a helpless position every organism wants to believe it can save itself somehow but i ca n't save myself from this disorder so i blog and i'm endeavoring to write a poem a day during poetry month april i 'll post today 's below kilorats , ce journeyman ii i cannot speak for you any longer you have worn me out to say my gullet is straw would understate the matter your brains are shielded i cannot continue to rent your ears for nothing here is a law i know one ought not to expect too much one ought not to invest in impossibilities like speaking for the human heart there are many possibilities witness the runnels carved in desert rock from scarce rains i wanted to tell you i wanted to speak with you but no one listened my words were superspeciated to extinction i sought too hard to make it all comprehensible , to sugar the pill nothing to wash it down take for your audience no one perfect your art for god you do not get your name in lights by sheer force of talent like some porn star with a big dick unless you re also lucky luck has the power to deliver you unto the scribes and judges or celebrate your inevitable talent your screaming genius you this week s anointed flavor , featured fabler o how i wanted to speak with you and to you ! but i was not anointed consigned to honky tonk the sawdust floors , vinyl tablecloths beer bottles heaved at screens , glass sprays the open mic i pray someone speaks for you , some poet without jealousy or concern for himself who manages to cobble together a voice from all the technotwitter gabbing garbled into the ether like drugged birds how he must simplify ! how he must remind us that our souls are in god s keeping and our lives should demonstrate muster and meaning , bluster and shock and a thirst for righteousness this sort of talk is what turns editors off fuck em
