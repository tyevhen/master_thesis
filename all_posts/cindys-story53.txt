i wrote the following verses down like this sometime during when i was years old this would have been either during the end of my year spent as a missionary in kenya or during the first while that i was back home in the us this is exactly how i had it written down , even the colors are the same i pray that god will help me to keep these as desires and goals in my life , and that he will make them true in my life my pursuit you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you , declares the lord jeremiah my steps whoever claims to live in him must walk as jesus did john my mission we proclaim him jesus , admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom , so that we may present everyone perfect in christ to this end i labor , struggling with all his energy , which so powerfully works in me colossians my task i consider my life worth nothing to me , if only i may finish the race and complete the task the lord jesus has given me the task of testifying to the gospel of god 's grace acts my times but i trust in you , o lord i say , you are my god my times are in your hands psalm a
