patients frequently tell me their dreams part of the royal road to the unconscious , freud tells us i'm never quite sure what to do with them i listen , i comment on how the dream contents relate to the events in the patient 's life a phenomena known as day residue simply said , i do n't know that much about how dreams are helpful , or why they 've come to be that said , clinkshrink had an interesting dream last night , one that she shared with me she says i can blog about it , so why not ? clink is climbing a mountain with my dog , max max gets cold he 's shivering , in fact concerned , clink checks max in to a resort hotel where they offer to give him my dog ! sherry twice a day the dream , i'm told , was vivid and in color so what does this mean , doctor ? i asked clink if she 'd watch max overnight while i'm away at a party i will be staying in a hotel , though not a resort i wo n't be drinking sherry , at least i do n't think so , as i 've never before been inspired to drink sherry there may be some in the cabinet , clink , but it 's cooking sherry , please do n't give it to max and i ca n't imagine it 's much fun to drink why is max cold ? he has never complained about the temperature , ever he does like to eat meat and he likes mighty dog , but really , max is a mutt , and sherry seems way too sophisticated for the pooch he 's never been to a resort has clinkshrink ? and clink does climb mountains these days and max would probably be happy to go along he 's quite athletic , but he might get freaked by the steep edges he 's not much for vacuum cleaners and what did you dream last night ?
