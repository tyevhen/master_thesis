npr did a broadcast in september i think about conflicts of interest in medicine it 's worth a listen , though i do n't give it my absolute highest recommendation panelists include jerome kassirer , ezekiel emanuel , sanford friedman , and thomas stossel link here there are a group of physicians who are outspoken about conflicts of interest being a sign of mega progress in research who view drug reps as good teachers and conflicted interests as a means of benefiting patients stossel is in that camp the irony is that he talked a few times about there being no evidence indicating that conflicts of interest create problems he must have somehow missed such evidence as this , this , this , this , and this
