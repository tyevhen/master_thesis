sitting in a coffee shop , i'm trying to convince him to wear a suit and tie when meeting prospective employers the conversation reminds me of my own naivete at age eighteen he says , i think i 'll ask the other kids what they did when they went looking for jobs after reminding him that his friends are his age while i am hiring manager age , i let it go with a smile oh to be eighteen again he 's eighteen going on sixteen , which is an improvement when i met him , he was sixteen going on twelve a high school senior , and the product of a really sad alcoholic family , i 've been mentoring him for just over two years since i have no kids , this relationship has given me opportunities i never thought i 'd get teaching a teen to drive , for example , was an opportunity i wo n't soon forget he reminds me of myself at eighteen because , like him , i had no clue how to function in the world i find myself trying to teach him everything i wish i had known , things i learned through embarrassment and shame saying 'please' and 'thank you' was an early lesson taking responsibility for one 's actions was frequently revisited shaking hands , holding a door open so it does n't slam in someone 's face , and offering a guest something to drink have all been addressed he 's learned , and i 've watched him grow he 's grown , and therefore i 've grown he 's learned , and therefore i 've learned i am so grateful to be a part of his life , as he enriches mine i'm sure he 'd be surprised to learn i'm getting just as much , if not more , out of this relationship as he is two years ago i had no idea this relationship would develop i was n't searching for a teen to mentor i was n't feeling empty or alone without a teen in my life things happened , and we came together perhaps a higher power knew what was best for both of us i certainly did n't have anything to do with it , but i'm so glad i took the ball and ran after all , prom 's coming up
