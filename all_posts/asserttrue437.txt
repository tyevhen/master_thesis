one of the great myths about antidepressants is that higher doses are more effective than lower doses that 's not how these drugs work , though most studies show a flat dose response curve with ssris more is n't better this is an important point to understand , because antidepressants quite often do n't work for a given patient on the first try , and then it 's necessary to do some adjusting , which means either increasing the dose , switching to another drug , or adding a second med fredman et al found that among attendees at a psychopharmacology course , asked what they would do for a non responsive patient on ssris , most chose raising the dose as the best next step option but that 's the wrong answer in dose response relationship of recent antidepressants in the short term treatment of depression , dialogues clin neurosci september , full article here patricia berney of unit de psychopharmacologie clinique , h pitaux universitaires de gen ve , ch ne bourg , switzerland , examines a large number of clinical trials to discover the extent to which dosage matters in antidepressant therapy it 's worth going through her discussion drug by drug , because if you 're taking one of these drugs and your doctor suggests a higher dose , you may want to consider whether it 's going to be worth the time and expense usually it 's not citalopram celexa the short term studies with citalopram did not show significant differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day even a dose of mg day was effective compared with placebo the results of the maintenance study by montgomery et al and the meta analysis by the same authors support these findings therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage of increasing the dose of citalopram above mg day escitalopram lexapro this drug is the s stereoisomer of citalopram celexa , meaning that it 's structurally no different from half of what 's in citalopram citalopram is a so called racemic mixture of left and right handed versions of the same molecule according to berney the only fixed dose response study with escitalopram indicates that mg day was equally as effective as mg day fluoxetine prozac the studies with fluoxetine did not show significant differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day even a dose of mg day was effective compared with placebo therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage of increasing the dose of fluoxetine above mg day it might even be the case that the higher dose of mg day is less effective in major depressive disorder the latter refers to a study by wernicke fluoxetine and mg day were statistically superior to mg day one study dunlop involving patients found fluoxetine , , and mg day each produced an improvement that was no different from placebo on change in the hamd total score in itt patients with locf at the end of weeks itt intent to treat , locf last observation carried forward the result with completer case analysis , which is to say just considering the patients who finished the study , was that changes in the hamd total score were similar to those of the itt locf analysis fluvoxetine luvox in this fixed dose study on a large sample , only fluvoxamine mg day showed a significant therapeutic benefit over placebo at end point analysis on locf on modified hamd items final score at the end of weeks at fixed dose significant differences were not seen between fluvoxamine , , or mg day or placebo on the hamd items responder analysis , the differences were significant for fluvoxamine and mg day compared with placebo , but not between these two dosages on visual inspection of the figures in the publication on completer cases analysis paroxetine paxil in the publication by dunner and dunbar , there is a short description of a study involving patients the paroxetine mg day dose was no more effective than placebo , even on the hamd depressed mood item the authors reported also on a pooled analysis from a worldwide database , involving patients who remained on a fixed dose of paroxetine or placebo for at least weeks , which showed no differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day paroxetine therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage in increasing the dose of paroxetine above mg day note it 's also worth looking at a more recent study by ruh et al , evidence why paroxetine dose escalation is not effective in major depressive disorder a randomized controlled trial with assessment of serotonin transporter occupancy , neuropsychopharmacology mar , in which unipolar depressed patients on paxil or placebo double blind were scanned for sert occupancy by single photon emission computed tomography spect the overall finding paroxetine dose escalation in depressed patients has no clinical benefit over placebo dose escalation sertraline zoloft in the study by fabre and putman , sertraline mg day , but not and mg day , was more effective than placebo at end point analysis on change on the hamd items total score on itt locf at weeks there was no statistical analysis performed between the different doses , but inspection of the data in the publication suggests no differences milnacipran savella this snri is approved for treating depression outside the u s , but inside the u s it is approved only for fibromyalgia four studies were analyzed they showed flat dose response relationship between and mg day , with mg day being less effective than placebo venlaxafine effexor this snri inhibiting reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine is a top ten antidepressant in the u s patricia berney 's finding from reading the clinical trials in the venlafaxine studies , doses varied between and mg day a positive dose response curve was only demonstrated with trend analysis however , the difference between the higher dose range and placebo was not pronounced better efficacy could be obtained with a dose of venlafaxine above mg day in terms of remission rate in a review concerning all aspects of antidepressant use , preskorn mentioned an ascending then descending dose response curve for venlafaxine in an evaluation comparing dose levels between and mg day with placebo , coming from fixed and flexible dose studies however , the major difference in terms of mean hamd score change , ie , points , was between a group of patients receiving mg day and another receiving mg day , hardly a different dose ! this suggests a calculation artifact rather than a pharmacological dose response curve for the majority of patients , a dose of venlafaxine mg day should be adequate reboxetine edronax , norebox , prolift , solvex , davedax , vestra a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , reboxetine is approved for depression outside the u s said berney despite availability of several short clinical trials , we cannot comment on the dose response relationship for reboxetine duloxetine no positive dose response relationship has been found for to mg day the common thread here is obvious antidepressants , when they work at all , tend to work about as well whether you take a large dose or a small dose the dose response curve for most of these drugs is a straight horizontal line that 's the main takeaway not only from berney 's meta analysis but a separate meta analysis by baker et al , evidence that the ssri dose response in treating major depression should be reassessed , depression and anxiety , , it 's also the conclusion reached in yet another meta analysis by hansen et al , med decision making january february , said the hansen group dose was not a statistically significant predictor of categorical ham d response among comparative trials with nonequivalent doses , trends favored higher dose categories but generally were not statistically significant the lack of a dose response relationship above a certain minimum effect dose does n't necessarily mean the drugs are doing nothing it means that once you 've achieved an in vivo concentration of the drug sufficient to saturate whatever transporter proteins or receptors the drug in question targets , there 's nothing left for the drug to attach to thus any excess goes unused it 's important to note , though , that these drugs do tend to show a strong dose response relationship when it comes to side effects one meta analysis found that across different studies , higher doses of ssris were associated with significantly higher proportion of dropouts due to side effects bottom line upping your dose , on any of the major antidepressants listed above , is n't a good strategy it may worsen side effects , but it 's unlikely to change your therapeutic outcome if a particular drug is n't working for you , a far better strategy than upping the dose is to try a different drug and or add talk therapy to the mix if you 're not already doing it likewise if you are seeing good therapeutic effect from a drug but side effects are causing problems , you should ask your doctor or nurse practitioner about dialing back the dosage to the minimum therapeutic dose , so as to keep side effects from swamping the therapeutic effect
