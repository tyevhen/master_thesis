so much of our fear is driven by the outer environment it seems like a simple concept , but it was quite a wake up call once i joined recovery during the past week i ve had multiple opportunities to recognize the importance of not letting my outer environment affect my inner environment for example , i was flying for a business trip a pilot could not have asked for more ideal weather clear blue skies between destinations of course , there were some bumps along the way i m not afraid to fly , but turbulence typically makes me very anxious my hands clench , body sweats , eyes blur i fear the plane will crash average symptoms for me and probably many people on my return flight home , though , i realized that i have absolutely no control over the airplane , my outer environment , and i had a responsibility to make my mental health a business and practice my recovery training i focused on secure thoughts flying is one of the safest ways to travel and practiced objectivity by burying myself in a book soon my symptoms disappeared and even when there was an occasional bump i didn t develop a panic before recovery i would not have been able to practice this self control and would have been miserable the entire flight i endorsed myself the book i was reading was the sci fi novel dune some of the characters in the book have a saying they recite when faced with an anxious situation i must not fear fear is the mind killer fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain although this is not a recovery tool , i do like how this litany against fear emphasizes that fear can overwhelm someone but if he lets it pass , all will be well the book takes place thousands of years in the future , but humans still succumb to fear from their outer environment in the universe thankfully we have the tools to make our everyday , present existence less dominated by anxiety reference herbert f dune th anniversary ed new york penguin
