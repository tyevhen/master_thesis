it 's hard to imagine , but i'm still sick i'm on my second antibiotic for severe bronchitis i ca n't stop coughing , and i still ca n't talk , although i think i heard a squeak when i tried to say something earlier today maybe things are looking up it 's also hard to imagine , but i 'll be years old in less than hours on monday , december th , i 'll turn i really ca n't believe it they say age is just a number well , that 's not true trust me i work with the most aged among us i see it , and am beginning to feel it , on a daily basis things change as we age , and so far , i'm not a big fan but i guess the alternative is n't all that great either , so i'm going to be on monday whether i like it or not this has been a rough year , so you 'd think i 'd be happy leaving behind , but i'm not maybe it 's because it 's been a rough year that i'm not looking forward to this birthday i do n't feel like i accomplished any of the things i set out to do this year rather than jump out of an airplane with my niece , nephew and brother , earn plenty of money to get me out of the country in , or run at least scheduled marathons , i was either in the hospital or home recovering from one thing or another i lost the most important thing to me , my health , and as a result my lifestyle , this year on the other hand , i survived a very rough year my health is improving i'm beginning to be able to run again i still have a job and i'm still here writing about all of it perhaps i'm stronger than i thought i dealt with a wide array of difficulties this year , some of which i never imagined would happen to me , but i dealt with them nonetheless my mood is okay i beat back the beast of depression twice and held it at bay countless times i have amazing friends , wonderful coworkers , and very supportive professionals in my life those are relationships i cherish i know i have much for which to be grateful and i am i guess there is another way to look at this my th year can only improve upon my th , so i have much to look forward to and i have friends who insist life begins at i have big plans , so i 'll do my best to prove them correct
