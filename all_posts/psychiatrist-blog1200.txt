i liked it i really liked it my attention stayed focused , my blood pressure did n't soar i did n't rant once i do n't think , can that be ? maybe i'm just starting to age gracefully now that i 've had time to reflect , here 's what i liked in treatment captured some of the sub text , the underlying angst , that we , as therapists , might fail to talk about in a unifying way so mia meets her therapist years later now she 's a head litigator in a prestigious law firm and she sports a prada suit he 's the vulnerable one being sued and she can save him ! she was very attached to him , and he left her to move in a way she found painful and he never contacted her from the shrink side of the couch , that does n't seem odd psychiatrists do n't typically continue to initiate contact with former patients she feels jilted , and she 's never really gotten over that or something else it 's easy to see both sides she 's too demanding , he 's too aloof , why is this still lingering for her ? it 's pulled to the open when paul says she must like showing him both her success and her pain this was good and there 's his frustration with the limitations of the therapist 's role he wants to drag his patient who is refusing cancer treatments to therapy if she were her daughter if only paul 's daughter would return his phone calls what would the ceo in the cashmere coat do ? the one who wants to drag his daughter home from rwanda ? oh , if only paul 's daughter wrote him such lovely , heartfelt emails the father daughter issues are upon us and if that 's not strong enough , there 's the whole mother son issue with gina that bonks us over the head i 've criticized the blurred boundaries in the gina 's relationship friend , supervisor , therapist , have a shot of vodka ? with paul but the reality is that when one psychotherapist consults another , the issues can get a little blurry and the lines of when and where the lines lie might well be a bit fluid so , i liked it
