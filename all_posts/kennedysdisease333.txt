i just finished my minute workout this morning and felt it was time to update everyone on my little experiment it is hard to believe , but the end of this week will be six months since i started taking dutasteride in reviewing my journal this morning , i noticed the last month has been a great month for me almost every day i used words such as good workout , easy workout , feeling extra strong today , i have great energy today , etc in fact , there was only one workout during the entire month of july where i used the term a decent workout meaning okay or fine not once did i mention any decline in my energy or that i was experiencing any pain i averaged minutes of exercises every other day in july and august month to date every day but one in july and all five exercise days in august i commented that the reps were easy or i felt strong that day another term i used quite often was good energy what does this mean ? no , i am not cured but , it does mean that i feel i am far better off than a year ago in regards to strength , energy , pain management and confidence hindsight being , i wish i would have started taking dutasteride a couple of years ago isn t that always the way it is nih trial on a similar subject , have you signed up for the kennedy s disease exercise trial ? if you are interested , please read about it on the kda website on the kda news page for http www kennedysdisease org news or go to the nih website for more detailed information http www clinicaltrials gov ct show nct
