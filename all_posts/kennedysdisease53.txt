when you spill salt , do you throw a pinch over your shoulder ? if a black cat crosses your path , do you even if it is only for a second think about the old adage about 'bad luck' ? will you walk under a ladder ? do you have a lucky shirt or jersey that you wear on game day ? i do not consider myself superstitious however ever since i was a young boy , i was told , bad things happen in threes even as an adult , almost every time a plane crashes it seems that someone mentions the threes sure enough , the next crash just seems to confirm the superstition a little while back , a friend with kennedy 's disease called he mentioned he fell a couple of days ago and had broken two toes a week earlier when we talked , he had mentioned that he fell twice during their garage sale is this the threes again ? his call prompted me to think about the threes in my life for twelve years , i have documented my falls date , time , place , what happened , and any injury the spreadsheet has been helpful when discussing issues with my neurologist and useful in documenting my disability during that twelve year period , i fell forty nine times and six of the falls resulted in the breaking of one or more bones and , as much as i do not want to believe it , it sure seems coincidental that several of my falls happened in groups of three trying to apply some logic to this , i am considering the idea that the trauma caused by an earlier fall might weaken the legs enough to make you more susceptible to another fall shortly thereafter perhaps that is why the third fall in a relatively short period usually results in an injury what about your experiences ? does the threes enter into any of your falls ?
