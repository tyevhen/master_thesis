i just found out my aa sponsor relapsed about weeks ago apparently i am the last to know i have n't been to my usual aa meetings for about weeks , mostly because of my running schedule , but she could have called , do n't you think ? i do n't like being the last to know i do n't like that she did n't call when she was having trouble sometimes sponsees can help sponsors , too it 's been that way for us in the past i'm not sure why it was n't this time so i'm hurt but my being hurt is a small issue the bigger issue is she relapsed i think she had years of sobriety not someone you 'd expect to relapse , but that 's the nature of alcoholism , i guess now what do i do ? suddenly , i do n't feel all that safe my sponsor is my safety net but can i call a woman who just convinced herself it was okay to drink when i feel like drinking ? can i ask a woman about moral decisions when she 's been deceiving everyone around her for quite some time ? what do i do ? can i keep this woman as my sponsor ? i do n't know i do n't know what to do i told her i 'd have to think about it whether or not i want her to continue sponsoring me i really do n't want to start over with another sponsor , but do i still trust this sponsor ? do i believe she is currently seeing life clearly enough to give advice ? and will i feel that advice is valid now that i know of her deception and ultimate relapse ? i do n't know i guess that 's what i have to decide can i trust , and will i feel safe going to her for help ? or will i worry about her state of mind and question her wisdom ? this is tough why did she have to go and relapse ? and why am i so surprised ? i mean , this is alcoholism at it 's finest she 's just behaved exactly like an alcoholic perhaps i need to just forgive and move forward but with whom do i move forward her or someone new ?
