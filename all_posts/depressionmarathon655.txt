yesterday was my second official day of work , and it went better than day number one i treated more patients , which is always easier patients do n't change much from job to job it 's the paperwork that 's always tough to digest i did have more paperwork yesterday , too , but it seemed to go slightly better than wednesday i'm still worried about stuffing all the information into my resistant brain , but i 'll just have to keep cramming the bigger issue yesterday was my confidence , or i should say my lack of confidence and i think that is directly related to my depression relapse i do n't feel confident that i 'll learn everything i do n't feel confident that i can handle the stress of working i do n't feel confident in my pt skills i worry i wo n't know how to treat my patients i worry working will knock me flat i worry i 'll never understand all the policies and procedures i did n't feel this lack of confidence prior to the most recent relapse it makes for a stressful day , and i can only hope that it gets better with time i think it will one area where my confidence is n't lacking , however , is my running i returned to the road on thursday , and i felt great ! i ran a mile , fast , tempo run thursday afternoon i was thrilled to feel so good after running a marathon just a few days before today , i got up early and ran a mile long run again , i felt pretty good my legs got tired near the end , but not bad after running a marathon only days ago ! i think i'm still basking in the glow of grandma 's i think i 'll hang onto that glow as long as it continues to drive me forward march on do not tarry to go forward is to move toward perfection march on , and fear not the thorns , or the sharp stones on life 's path khalil gibran
