i 've been doing okay with my plan to get outside once per day i 've walked or run short distances the last four days in a row and by short , i mean less than miles on most days my mood , unfortunately , has remained at an all time low it 's frustrating and unbelievable today , since it was saturday , i decided to reinstitute a long run of sorts after all , boston is on the horizon , and if i am going to have any chance to complete it , i need to get some long runs done to that end , i scheduled myself for an mile walk run today it was an absolutely gorgeous morning today the warm winter weather we 're having is amazing i attended my usual aa meeting and then came home to nap after napping , something i 've been needing to do an abundance of lately , i stepped outside to begin my effort unfortunately , i knew from the start it was n't going to be an easy day my plan was to run one mile , walk for one minute , and then run again so really , i was heading out for , one mile runs doable , i thought unfortunately , my body did n't agree i was winded almost immediately by mile three , i had the urge to walk for way more than one minute , and after mile four i did just that i walked through half of mile five , and by mile six , walking percent of the time , i cut my route short and came home i was frustrated and disappointed while i have to give myself credit for getting outside , i'm really stunned at how difficult impossible my little experiment turned out to be when i got home , i fell asleep again my body , it seems , has a mind of its own right now and that mind is a depressed , sad , fatigued mind at best i am beside myself with frustration i'm trying to get out , even though i do n't feel like it i'm trying to participate in life , even though the thought repulses me but this depression episode just wo n't let go i'm tired all the time my mood is in the toilet my motivation is lacking i 'll try to forget about today , and i 'll get back out on the road again tomorrow maybe two miles is the maximum i can expect from this tired body right now
