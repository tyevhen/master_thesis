here is the response i sometimes get from so called well wishers hey , time has passed get over it and get on with your life blah blah blah this is not a well wisher it is the ultimate denier and the more you try to get over it the shorter your life will be you cannot leave a trail of emotional debris scattered around while you get over it biology will not permit this wait because you cannot get over what is now part of you now here is the problem if you are enmeshed in mental activity and insights and explanations you are in fact stating that memories are mainly in your thinking , remembering mind yet our work and recent research says the opposite , that key embedded memories that contain the mountain of pain are located much deeper than that and you cannot just get over something engraved in your neurology and biology and get on with your life your life is driven by those memories , ad nauseam it is like telling someone to cut off his hand and get on with his life well with imprinted primal pain he has cut off something far more important for survival his feelings they should guide and direct him but alas , they fail because they have been left in the wilderness i was going to say , left in the wilderness without trace , but unhappily there is always a trace a trickle of methyl that marks the spot and tells us where the memory lies and how forceful it is it damages us and then screams its message , i am suffering and i cannot stop the pain originates right here it demands that we return to the scene of the crime and address it again you mean to suffer all over again we can rationalize , forget and deny but the memory does not it stays in its pristine form , unchanging , clamoring for surcease yes you have to suffer again but this time there is an ending the first time we could cry but repression rushed in to stop the overload this time in therapy the therapist will help stop any hint of overload which can often lead to the deadly abreaction and the blockage of feeling that is what overload means no more feeling it is already too much so what are we getting over , at last we are not we are forgetting , denying , changing the subject we are changing our mind in the guise of getting over something and yes , we can force the top level mind to change the direction of memory and pretend mentally that it does not exist we can play tricks with our minds but never can we play tricks with deep lying trauma whose memories have penetrated the deepest levels of the brain and , like the methyl trace , are part of us biologically and those are the memories that wreak havoc with the system creating afflictions such as diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and numerous others and those are the same maladies that require addressing on the level where they were imprinted diseases that become systemic because the deep lying pain has also become systemic here lies the crossing of the road where conventional psychotherapy plays games with the brain , making it mindful , or unleashing volcanoes of pain when taking hallucinogens , for example but not making the slow , painful , journey into the zone of the interior to meet with the devil also known as birth with drugs , lack of touch , lack of nursing , or a nursing mother taking pain killers , and you can fill in the blanks and it remains a blank until we can give it a name pain we use any kind of painkiller , no matter the name , because it erases for a moment the real problem , imprinted agony why ? because we cannot see it , and above all , we cannot feel it because the system in its wisdom has shut down the pain just so we cannot feel it imagine what a miracle it is that when deep pain becomes overwhelming we have a mechanism to shut it down for decades , and oft times , for all or our lives how about that for efficacy ? we survived because we could build and create despite our pain and we could die prematurely because of that same pain we pay a price for repression that is , for cutting away part of us so we can go on creating and inventing when we go deep in the brain we can feel it in all its agonies and patients tell me that is a pain that does not hurt i would say that it is a pain that has an ending , where each session is limited to what the patient can feel and integrate that is the need for an expert therapist to make sure that patients do not suffer too much and are not pushed to go on feeling beyond his limit for that reason we need feeling therapists not someone who delights in watching someone writhe to prove what a good therapist he is believe me , it i could have gotten over it and got on with my life i would have but memories endure they are a life force we must deal with no way out and no short cuts i always knew the danger of abreaction but it was only recently that we know how to reverse it in long time abreactors who wanted the easy way they often become untreatable so caution and care do not treat your body as a toy or plaything there are serious consequences for not doing it right i can tell who is an abreactor , but treating it is a whole other matter an example my cats were yelling for their food this morning and i got anxious and wanted to feed them right away it is also the reason i am known as some one who gets things done why ? i felt about that need to feed the cats it took me back to my asking my father for something i wanted to buy his answer was either later or no response he was incapable of acting spontaneously this helped make him a loser he could not get going on anything kept it all inside , and died early of a massive heart attack it was all of a piece he could not say anything spontaneously , could not show love or affection , could not reach out to touch or hug everything was later for a later that never came he just could not make a decision he was happy to drive a truck and have no one bother him , which he did day after day , never putting his life in question or what his life was about he never read a book , listened to music , never escaped that tight circle he called life he had to have it that way because he wanted no surprises not even a son who asked for something to put it off for him was never having to make a decision or do anything new or different he was comfortable doing nothing and never changing his routine i became the opposite wanting to find out more and more reading religiously , becoming a musician , traveling to various countries you get the idea to become the opposite from him that was my way to survive i learned from him how not to be money was his only interest which was something that never ever interested me he never laughed or joked never saw the humor of life and above all , never saw any beauty in the world i learned to travel to art galleries in many countries i learned foreign languages he dined at the at inexpensive restaurants , not because he liked the food but because it was cheap money dominated everything i never knew there was a place to buy clothes apart from the little mexican shops on the east side he never gave gifts because he could not give a man with a short fuse , angry all of the time , something i never am i heard his screams constantly and vowed not to be like that he was my inverse role model a man with no interests and no knowledge and no idea how to interact socially a man without friends whose wife was mentally ill she was also my mother a five year old who called my father , daddy daddy can i go to the store now ? she was always a thing , a nonentity to me i needed love and believed i could get it from my father until i learned better and saw a man who could not love as shakespeare described him a man with no music in him i made my own
