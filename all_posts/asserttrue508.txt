darn those pesky japanese sometime over the last few years , when i was n't looking , the japanese muda mura muri meme slipped into the lexicon of people concerned with lean process management and agile software development perhaps you 're already up to speed on it if not , here 's the crash course muda think french merde is waste any activity or excess resource consumption that does not add value to whatever you 're creating suppose you 're doing a load of laundry using an excess of laundry soap would be muda mura is any imbalance or unevenness in your process , whether brought on by you , or imposed on you from the outside you can think of it as the imbalance that arises from disruption of an otherwise smooth process henry ford famously chose black as the only paint color you could have on a model t that 's because he knew that different colors of paint have different drying times ford standardized on one color of paint black , the fastest to dry to eliminate mura on the assembly line caused by uneven drying times of paints muri means unreasonable , impossible , or overburdening for example putting two tons of cargo in a truck designed to carry one ton is muri muda , mura , and muri are often interrelated if you 're running a delivery business and you overload a truck muri to the point where it breaks down , that truck 's load will now have to be redistributed to other trucks , which will disrupt the normal routes of those trucks mura and doubtless cause them to burn more gas and wear out break pads faster due to the added weight and extra time spent on the road muda it 's possible to apply the muda mura muri meme to writing one can think of a static interpretation as well as a process oriented interpretation in the static view , verbosity obviously constitutes an example of muda extra words are wasteful uneven coverage of a topic for example , devoting too much attention to an introduction and not enough to a conclusion is an example of mura overuse of a particular word , phrase , quotations , or example is muri i once had the opportunity to look at the first draft of the first chapter of someone 's novel , in manuscript form it was written in third person , and i was struck by the constant use of he him his pronouns in fact , i think i calculated that over of the words in the chapter were he , him , or his that 's asking one pronoun to do too much that 's muri from a process point of view suppose you have an important writing assignment that will require you to come up with a , word document in working days obviously , to avoid mura imbalance , you should pace yourself so as to produce around finished words a day , or maybe you should plan to produce words of raw output per day for ten days , then revise words per day for another ten days if the writing of your piece requires ten rough drafts , that 's probably muda pure waste no one should need to write ten drafts of anything the standard college trick of doing research for days , then pulling an all nighter , is a gross example of muda , mura , and muri all in one you ca n't realistically do days of writing in one all nighter that 's muri unreasonable burden the unevenness of the process days of no writing , then one day of frantic writing is mura the sheer wastefulness of spending a disproportionate amount of time on research allowing only a tiny amount of time for actual writing is muda so , but that concludes the japanese meme portion of today 's lesson now if you 'll excuse me , i have to get back to writing the same old muda for a living
