here is a poem from a reader definition what 's wrong with you ? they say , ca n't you calm down for just a moment , take a deep breath slow down , get centered and relax stop being so damn negative , what 's the worry , what 's the hurry ? you ca n't solve every problem , let it go hey not so fast maybe , yes just maybe if you stopped being so damn frightened well then maybe for a moment all those fears would dissipate , if you just stopped your overthinking your hypotheticals , possibilities , if you let life flow all around you you 'd have that peace you say you crave but they are wrong anxiety is n't nervousness anxiety is n't cowardice anxiety is a call to those whose eyes are open to the fight it is a certain sensitivity an alertness a war machine never idle there s a buzzing below the surface , there is no calm before this storm it is the constant sentinel vigilant in clash with paralysis , there is no honor , no heroism in this struggle whose burden countermands reward it is not the soldier s nature to relax it is an instinct , it is concern for you , for me , for others , it is a special steadfast mutiny when psyche fights the soul you say it is a weakness you subject me to societal court martial , though you cavalierly create conflicts you say i am afraid but those consummate in combat , introspective and insightful , true veterans of life s battles know , it 's fear defines the brave josh mayesh
