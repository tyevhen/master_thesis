we must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves thomas merton i have completed only two paintings away from my regular studio in burlington , ontario , canada ever you gets attached to places of creation the familiar routine , temperature , rituals and ability to fall into a groove of focus tend to be pretty constant in one 's regular studio that is why i came prepared to omaha , nebraska a prolonged working vacation with three canvases in tow to finish while here erin , choices , oil on canvas , x is the first of the three i have spoken before about people i paint they range from new friends to old friends but an alignment of time and place must work together for a successful photoshoot and painting to take place erin , a good friend and yoga instructor , is an old soul she is one of those friends who possesses the gift of articulation , and that , combined with wisdom , makes for very good conversation i was thrilled when she agreed to let me paint her and where else to paint her but where she loves to be a yoga studio i have been taking classes at moksha yoga burlington for a year and a half the first time i tried hot yoga i loved it i knew as long as i could get out of bed every morning i would take classes as much as time and budget would allow erin teaches there , and thommy , the owner of moksha burlington , let us do a little photoshoot in one of the studios i knew from the outset that mirrors and reflection were needed i love the challenge that a reflected image places upon you , and the metaphorical significance is always enticing i liked the idea that the mirror might not be instantly noticeable , that you might have to wonder momentarily if she had a twin or is it a different version of herself ? why is she looking away from herself and not towards herself ? what is she thinking ? the idea of a fork in a road , of a set of choices upon choices was the inspiration behind this piece i packed the canvas of erin into my subaru and headed to omaha two weeks ago the drive took me two days , with a brief stopover to visit my friend joe in chicago what an amazing city i'm more of a country mouse but i have always wanted to experience the windy city though only a pit stop en route to the midwest , i was impressed a first glimpse at chicago evening sun setting on west fulton market a brief mention about the drive the border officials at the sarnia crossing into michigan were super nice i knew i 'd have to go to secondary inspection given my high threat vocation of being a painter but i duly pulled into a spot while a pair of guards with black latex gloves went through the car and queried me as to the specifics of my voyage i complied of course and we were joking around together after a few minutes then i was on my way despite tonnes of road kill and highway tolls in michigan , i was thrilled to be on another adventure adventure keeps you young , sharp and fully engaged with the world around you i highly recommend it joe on the rooftop of his warehouse loft a great end to a great evening in the windy city i will post another blog soon about my continued adventures towards omaha , and paintings i am working on here as a painter you need to keep moving , just as you move through your adventures that take you from place to place but the point is , like a stone that skips across water , to keep grounding yourself with your work , or your passion , or your play ground yourself to things that define who you are and you will never become lost somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood , and i i took the one less traveled by , and that has made all the difference robert frost
