i had just arisen it was a beautiful , fall , tuesday morning as a full time pt who worked four ten hour shifts , i always looked forward to my tuesday 's off i rubbed the sleep from my eyes , as i opened the back door to allow puck to escape wandering sleepily back into the kitchen , i clicked on the counter top tv i had just straightened up after fetching puck 's rations from a bottom cabinet when something surreal flashed before my eyes what the , i asked aloud ? i turned up the volume the good morning america hosts apparently i had n't taken the time to flip to sportscenter yet were similarly dumbfounded i stood there frozen , puck 's food in hand , as we all tried to figure out what we 'd witnessed they , horrified in a new york studio , and me , horrified in a small midwestern kitchen , hungry dog yipping at the door we all waited and wondered it was am central time the replay came , and it was all too clear a plane had just flown directly into the south tower of the world trade center , live , on national television horrifying scenes of columbine , which also occurred on a tuesday , flashed through my brain sirens , screams , gasps , and silence followed tv hosts silent , without words tears filled my eyes i could n't leave the tv there i was in my bright , sunny , serene kitchen holding my dog 's food in my hands it was a beautiful , fall day , and i was witnessing over people from countries dying right before my eyes it is a moment i will never forget today , i am flying my american flag in honor and remembrance of the tens of thousands of lives needlessly shattered by hate join me pray for compassion pray for tolerance pray for peace
