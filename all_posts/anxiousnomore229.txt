photo by cherbert so i am a little bit of a nerd i admit i work in a software company after all i am also a widget junkie i love trying out new tools and learning how to implement fun features i do n't want to overload my blogsite with these however , only the ones that have a real function and purpose so please let me know how you like the new features and if you think they are helpful to you or a waste of space so i can weed out the bad ones here are a several changes i have made i added a subscribe button that you can see at the top of the page when you roll over it buttons will appear that allow you to select where you want the feed to appear this works much better in firefox than in internet explorer by subscribing you add a feature to your favorite search engine google , yahoo , aol , etc homepage that will update whenever i update my blog this means you wo n't have to check back to see whats been changed instead it will tell you whenever there are additional posts and you can then visit the page or the feed to see the latest and greatest i have also added a subscribe by email box on the right hand side that will allow you to receive an email whenever there is a new post if you feel more comfortable doing that both of these are for your benefit and then they also allow me to see how many people actually are interested in what i am writing about my favorite webpages are usually interactive , not just pretty to look or nice to read , but something i can contribute to has a community feel to them which is what i want to add to my site so i just barely added a rating widget to my posts that i found from luna tail 's site its a rating system that you can rate stars for each post i 've been meaning to do the next one for awhile i took the songs from my chill out playlist and added them into a music player i do n't like pages that play music automatically when i go to them , especially if you are at work and it blasts really loud ! so you can look through them and choose ones you want to listen to if you want to listen i hope you like them i will most likely be changing the music every once in awhile when i find new songs that i like that fit into the anxiety category , and i will get rid of ones i am tired of i 'd love any suggestions of other artists if anyone wants to share also another interactive feature is a poll on the right hand side hopefully they will release it soon i think it would be interesting to know what types of anxiety my readers struggle with i plan on doing a poll of the week varying on different topics such as medication types , satisfaction of treatments and coping strategies , etc i think it could be a very interesting feature this also looks nicer in firefox as for my anxiety today , i woke up anxious this seems to be pretty common for saturday mornings i just took my time to get ready for the day and i am relaxing in front of guess what , court tv and surfin the web probably my favorite way to relax tyler is gone on an overnight trip with his brothers which gives me the whole day off i might help his sister with a craft project sometime , if she ever decides to call i really should do some yoga today since my overall anxiety level has been so heightened the last couple days i hope everyone else is feeling better out there ! linda , how are you doing ? i have n't heard from you lately you are in my thoughts if nothing else know that someone 's thinkin about you and sending well wishes your way brinn , has your anxiety risen lately like mine and molly 's ? i have a theory that the more time we spend talking to each other , the more our anxiety cycles parallel , just like menstrual cycles do let me know if you have any questions on any of this or have technical problems everyone take care ! if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like what to do when feeling overwhelmed celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip blog against abuse day what is rss ? how to stay up to date with the reality of linkwithin
