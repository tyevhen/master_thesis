a youth correctional facility in arkansas had some problems in the fairly recent past what kind of problems ? well , the private firm that was formerly contracted to run the facility , cornell companies , was fired last year for inappropriately injecting children with antipsychotic medications according to an ap report nice now the state of arkansas has hired another private firm , gs youth services of virginia , which will assume control of the facility in a few days i could n't find any further information on this , but it certainly jumped out at me
