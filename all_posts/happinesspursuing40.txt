hey , wow , did i leave this blog hanging or what ? what a bleak entry that last one was ! i was on no sleep exhausted and sure that i 'd never get a peaceful night again then the dreams stopped literally stopped within a night or two of my having written it i have two theories one is that i needed the therapy of describing them to someone thanks , readers , for your feedback and more importantly just being there for me to describe them to or two they were holiday related the date on that post is dec meaning that christmas falls right in the middle of that period of a solid week of nightmares but for now they 've stopped for whatever reason and i'm grateful i 've actually been feeling pretty well these last few weeks i do n't have any reason to but when can a depressive look outwardly to explain his feelings ? the economy is hitting me hard a significant portion of my income is based in a sector of us business that is really hurting so consequently my checkbook is , too frankly i do n't know how i'm going to make it through next month nevertheless i 've been in the best mood since new year 's day that i can remember for months it might have to do with my clean desk i ritualistically clean down my office and package up everything from the old year sometime in the first week of the new year there 's nothing quite like a clean desk and office it 's a silly little thing but there it is i even realized yesterday that i have n't taken sjw for days and have n't missed it it 's all almost disconcerting !
