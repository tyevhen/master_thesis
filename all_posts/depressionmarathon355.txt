it is the middle of the night i awoke around am , and it is now am i 've been ruminating ruminating , in case you were unaware , is not conducive to sleep even jet is looking at me with tired eyes , not bothering to get up , wondering what the hell i'm doing i'm ruminating writing , i hope , will be the cure i got out of the hospital yesterday morning it was snowing beautiful , fluffy snow , as it had been all morning i went home briefly , tried to start my snowblower , but despite long distance help from my step father via texted photos and phone calls , i had no luck i pulled the snowblower back in the garage and ran off to my aa meeting instead i thought a little wisdom and serenity time could n't hurt so soon after discharge it did n't returning home , and after multiple attempts to start the snow blower , my friend taylor arrived and started it for me i now know the trick should n't be a problem from here on out taylor had arrived to return my mail he kept an eye on my house and collected my mail over the last days it took me a few days , mail undoubtedly piling up in my mailbox and house appearing very empty , but i finally called taylor from the hospital and asked for his assistance he seemed genuinely pleased to be asked and took care of things for me as a result , i did n't have to worry about my house while i was in the hospital i guess that 's what friends do for each other , huh ? i'm at my friend wendy 's house right now after clearing the snow from my driveway and sidewalks , unpacking from my hospital stay , and organizing a few overdue projects in my house , i came here last evening to spend the night wendy and her family took good care of jet while i was gone , and he and i had a delightful reunion we took a cold , snowy walk under the full moon together , in order to release some of his excitement , and i did n't mind one bit it was also nice to be back in wendy 's home with her active family normalcy felt good i 've got some busy days ahead i will have an hour intake in a few hours for the outpatient mood disorders program i referred to a couple days ago if the intake goes well , i will be beginning an eight hour per day , two week , intensive outpatient program at some point in the near future that should keep me very busy , and structured , for awhile the structure will be good , although i am a bit concerned about it being too much i hope i can keep up with the rest of my life while participating that pretty much covers my rumination for now i'm going to try to get a little bit of sleep before dawn i need sleep or i do n't function terribly well it 's nice to be here , typing from a bedroom rather than from an inpatient psychiatry unit i'm going to do my best to make this recent admission my last admission and get back to my life as usual , i 'll let you know how that goes
