ah yes , well maybe you 're not pretty enough for a while this week , dropouthillary was the number one trending hashtag on twitter , with well over k tweets despite bernie 's superior poll numbers against trump , it seems we 're heading for a situation where hillary will stagger , bruised and wheezing , over the nomination finish line , grabbing if barely the prize she so desperately seeks , the democratic nomination she was supposed to be able to put away back in january then in february then in march except , even with hillary 's superior name recognition , not to mention super pac money , a string of closed primaries in which independents were shut out , wall street backing , and years of planning , she still is barely able to out compete an aging socialist jew from vermont some say that what this election season shows what trump 's success , in particular , shows is how eager voters are to reject establishment politics , at any cost on resume alone , trump is easily the least qualified presidential candidate of the last years combine that with his absurdly volatile , irrational temperament and you have nothing if not a screw politics as usual candidate clinton , on the other hand , represents everything about the established political order that so many voters seek to reject deep ties to wall street , the backing of a corrupt dnc apparatus , an extremely hawkish foreign policy outlook , over the top arrogance , faith in big government , and a craven venality that somehow compelled her to keep making , an hour speeches long after there was no need to this is someone who has n't driven a car in years and thinks it 's perfectly okay for a secretary of state to access a private e mail server with a non security hardened blackberry the contrast with trump is stark and she still does n't get it ! she does n't get that calling trump out for being an unpredictable , jingoistic racist political outsider only reinforces the impression of her as an insider , which people do n't want she paints trump as risky underscoring her role as the play it safe candidate , not considering that maybe voters have reached the point where they want to take a chance on an unqualified outsider , shunning the timid , risk averse , low aspiration mindset of establishment politics trump is the mysterious stranger in the fast car who appears out of nowhere and promises the bored , hungry hitchhiker a wilder than wild ride beyond city limits for many , that 's just the ticket gop sent of its best establishent contenders up against trump all went down in flames now the democrats want to send their best establishment politician hillary clinton will she land the magic knockout punch that so many others could n't land ? or go down in flames , like everyone else who 's gone up against trump ? one thing is certain the rules have changed in a race where being an outsider is an advantage , establishment politicians are severely handicapped hillary 's resume , her long list of qualifications , is proof of her alignment with an establishment voters are now rejecting in droves qualifications of clinton 's sort are now disqualifying raw inexperience , by contrast , is not only allowed , but a badge of honor up is down black is white people want change at ay cost hillary represents the status quo , the opposite of change my gut says she wo n't do well against trump not at all she does n't understand the new rules the system is rigged now against her thanks for visiting be sure to check out prior weeks' water coolers see links at right many , many thanks to the fine folks below who retweeted me recently on the twitter follow these tweeps they retweet ! buy my books or at least click for more info have you added your name to our mailing list ?
