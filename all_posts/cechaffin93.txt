a bit dense and disturbing , but i'm still recovering from the dream poem , , already posted remedies for diffusion i when my mind is splintering i need not to be alone identity 's fractionation who will squeeze my arm ? funhouse mirror , receding view are n't they all thinking of me ? this sickness is unto death , this sensation of me in distant pieces offered , when my body hair wakes with air and i lift toward heaven , how any part may or may not cohere , as likely to spin out as orbit in ii is it presumptuous to assume unity from personality , say from a gladhanding televangelist hawking soap who feels good about himself with no disunity between motive and action , money and gospel , who feels himself one self and not an act unless it be an act his real self endorses ? compare this with the redwood shattered into a million matchsticks , the lost parasols of a dandelion 's head perhaps the primary difference between him and me is that i can be diffused into a hundred piece symphony and he is like a saxophone playing one note at a time , whole and wholly sequential but how does he learn to take for granted the unity so necessary for every function ? a unity as a mental patient i am forced to fuss about ? iii i digress what helps ? concentrating on my typing in the moment of composition , i attain the identity of an archer fish shooting a mosquito down by parallax or the sunyata of the tarantula hawk 's orange wings flapping above its body bent in stinging these images concentrate quite wonderfully , though this comment , wonderfully , again divides me from my self , being an admission that normally i am not concentrated but it 's hard to hang on to this , surely there is also a time for being dispersed like pollen in a meadow without thought i had some mixed medical news as well , which left me feeling particularly mortal and so it goes kilorat , ce
