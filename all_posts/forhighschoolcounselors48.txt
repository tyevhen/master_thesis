tonight i was reading some posts on facebook from fellow school counselors who were venting about all the stress and pressure they were facing at the end of the year the most common complaints were about failing seniors , angry teachers who lost their planning time due to being pulled for testing , lost counseling time due to non counseling duties , inconsiderate parents , clueless administrators , and just being generally overworked reading their posts , reminded me of a conversation i had with a first year counselor at one of our high schools as the counselor and i were talking about one of her failing students , i suggested she call him down to talk to him about some assignments he was missing in his virtual class after i heard her typing on the other end , she said well , he is fill in the teacher 's name room and i ca n't call him out of her room if i call up there and she gives me an attitude , i am going go off on her ! i was kind of taken aback by her comments because she is generally a gentle soul , but she was just getting started ! after we talked about the student , she began to vent about the behaviors of some of her colleagues told me that she felt exhausted and overworked and expressed her anticipation of summer vacation at the end of our conversation , i told her that she sounded really stressed and i asked her if she was getting any rest her answer was not surprising to me as she told me that she not sleeping well and had a lot going on at work long story short , she was experiencing the typical end of the year counselor burnout end of the year burn out is real ! the overworked school counselor the struggle is real ! as school counselors , we may or may not realize that we are overworked in fact , the indiana chamber of commerce surveyed school counselors and found that counselors still face being overworked , carrying high student caseloads , performing non counseling duties , and face the increasing emotional needs of their students in fact , one indiana school counselor described today 's counselors as being caught in a no man 's land because our profession lacks a defined role because of this lack of definition , every school district has its own unique prescription for using its school counselors in another article about indiana school counselors , one of the contributors agreed that school counselors are overworked and lack enough time during the day to take care of all their responsibilities as school counselors , we know this to be true no matter what state we work due to increasing student ratios , increased student needs , and demanding schedules the comments from my counseling colleague took me back to the time i was feeling overworked and stressed in fact here is a excerpt from my blog back in chronicling my typical workday my workday begins at am each day as i am walking in the door , i often have two or three students stop me to ask questions when i finally make it to my office door , someone is knocking on our main suite door to get in some mornings , we can have people stopping by , in a short period of minutes , to pick up a transcript , ask a question , complain about a class , or ask to talk to us because they got in an argument with their parent as my morning starts , i am expected to check and answer all my email immediately , answer my phone or return calls promptly , come to an administrator 's office to talk to an upset student , and address parent concerns when they walk through the door oh , do n't forget the emergency situations !
