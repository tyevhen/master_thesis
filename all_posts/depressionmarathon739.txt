i'm still glowing , albeit quite stiffly , post marathon here 's the story the weather forecast called for temps in the 's at the start , with sunshine and mid 's predicted for most of the race based on that , my friend kate and i both went with tank tops , shorts , arm warmers , and gloves unfortunately , there was a mph wind , and thin clouds kept the sun from warming the air it was cold ! huddling at the start , i knew i was in trouble my teeth were chattering , my arms , hands and legs were freezing , and i could n't get warm no matter how much i jumped around i enviously gawked at all of the runners around me who had remembered extra , throw away layers or garbage bags to block the wind and retain their body heat fortunately , after standing there freezing for minutes , a woman in front of me began to remove one of her long sleeve shirts she was about to toss it aside when i desperately stopped her she graciously gave me the shirt , and i could n't put it on quickly enough ahhh i was still freezing , but i was immediately relieved i ended up wearing that throw away shirt for the entire race , as i never did totally warm up the cold wind just would n't allow it without that shirt , i doubt i would have finished this marathon i likely would have dropped out due to hypothermia the shirt is now in my laundry , and i figure i 'll use it as throw away garb at my next marathon it 's obviously got some good ju ju ! if the woman who lent me the pale yellow , hi tech , long sleeve , austin race shirt is reading this thank you ! with , runners , the waiting time at the start was significant like i said , i stood in my starting corral for at least minutes once running , it was slow going due to the crowds my first mile was my slowest , but things thinned out fairly early the race wound through downtown and some dallas neighborhoods with some of the largest homes i 've ever seen before heading out to white rock lake and even bigger homes the lake would have been the highlight if it had been warmer , but instead we were exposed to the cold wind for miles i was happy to get back into the city from the beginning , i felt good that 's atypical for me , as i'm usually very slow to warm up i typically have several miles of feeling like the pace is too fast but this time , i was running fast and feeling good i actually forced myself to slow down through miles , as i let my worry about the quick pace get the best of me in retrospect , i wish i had had more of a plan going into the race , but i really did n't know what to expect by mile nine , despite my best efforts , i had sped up again this time , i decided to just go with it i'm so glad i did i went through the half in it was then that i realized i was on sub pace again my brain was nudging worry in my way , but i tried to avoid it it was n't until after the halfway point , and after i reeled off sub miles , that qualifying for new york even entered my mind never in my wildest dreams did i think i 'd be in such a position after exiting the lake , we hit a few long , but not too steep , hills around miles i had heard it was all downhill to the finish from there i could hear the pace team behind me i still felt good , so i went my last miles were the fastest by far i averaged per mile over the last quarter of the race otherwise , my best quarter was an average i was passing people left and right , and i felt like i was flying it was hard it hurt but it was so doable , i could n't believe it according to the race website , i passed people , men and women , in the last quarter of the race , while only people passed me what a cool stat ! i went through mile in i thought then that i had new york licked after all , i was running minute pace , and i had minutes to get to the finish unfortunately , we re combined with the finishing half marathoners with about miles left to go suddenly the road was clogged with thousands of walkers and joggers i made my way through the crowds as fast as my rapidly tightening legs would allow with just a few hundred yards to the finish , i looked at my watch and realized in horror that i had less than seconds to get to the promised land ! sprinting and dodging people , i gave it everything i had passing under the finish arch , i stopped my watch i'm so proud of my accomplishment i ran a personal best my previous best was run more than years ago , and i had n't come close to it since ! yet those seconds leave a bitter taste in my mouth on the other hand , now i know what to expect from myself with the austin marathon just months away , i 've got another chance to run fast and this time , i 'll go in with a plan a plan that will not include panic if i'm running fast here are my splits , for those of you who like such stats , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , my sprint to the line was at pace ! overall , i finished th out of women in my age group , and in the top of over female finishers that , too , is pretty cool i'm so grateful to have had this opportunity and this experience
