growing up in the evangelical christian culture , i had a sense of what might be called linear history instilled into me that is , everything that happens is part of a plan orchestrated by god and is ultimately being used to achieve his purposes not only does this belief shape christians' basic concept of human history , but also their understanding of people 's personal stories when misfortunes fall on people , christians' go to words of comfort reflect and enforce this belief everything happens for a reason when god closes one door , he opens another it just must not have been god 's timing for things to happen right now or we have to trust god 's timing it 's all in god 's hands etc up till recently , i , too , clung to these mantras , even though i battled and resented them at the same time with every job or internship refused me , every club i was rejected from , every guy who did n't return interest in me , every desperate prayer that went unanswered or answered no , i suppose , as many pastors love to remind us that no is an answer to prayer , i tried to console myself with the assurance that it was all part of god 's plan surely something better was around the corner i always felt a desperate hope that sometime soon i was going to have my big break of sorts maybe the guy i liked would finally ask me out maybe my blog would suddenly gain a thousand readers or my music or i would find inspiration for my great novel or find some work or club to be a part of where i could finally make friends and have projects and a feeling of fulfillment and purpose i still find myself waiting to finally break out and become recognized , empowered , accomplished i still have those thoughts that come to find without prompting maybe today , while you eat lunch , some handsome man will approach you and strike up conversation , enamored by your beauty maybe college did n't work out because i'm supposed to become some great artist maybe my friends here at home will form a band with me maybe my sister will quit her job and start a business with me maybe college did n't work out so i would n't go on the conveyor belt to a brain sucking job but lately i'm starting to think that maybe life is n't a straight line to a destination with perfect little plot points along the way that make the character develop like one of those diagrams you filled out in writing class in elementary school maybe life is just a scatter plot of random points up , down , forward , backward a seismograph of raggedy big and little waves , constantly moving , changing every time i felt like i finally had turned a corner this year and was going to start my champion run towards greatness and recovery and normality and success and fulfillment , i felt myself yanked back around some new yet strangely familiar old corner this medicine should finally get you back on track oh , wait it leaves me sitting on a church pew , dying inside surrounded by twelve of what are meant to be my closest friends maybe if we take you off the klonopin you 'll feel less tired but , like , do it in less than a week oh , wait that leaves me literally shaking all over , trying to laugh with everyone until i become paranoid i said something stupid in front of my friends then i totally spiral downwards as worship starts and i hear the words , he loves us , ohhhh , how he loves us , oh how he loves i stop singing and shut down inside he does n't love me and i sure have my doubts now about whether he loves me i notice that he seems to notice but does n't do anything and it 's a little his fault anyways that i'm upset but i grab my phone and slip out as soon as the opening prayer ends and everyone transitions into practice mode i head for a sound proof practice room in the music suite and dial home and ball my freaking eyes out and mop up enough snot for a daycare of three to five year olds with head colds with my sweater i have to call a friend and ask them to bring my stuff outside from choir practice so i can remove myself to my room as discretely as possible and lie to my roommates that practice let out early maybe now that i 've dropped out from school maybe now that i 've had the summer off maybe now that i'm starting classes maybe now that i 've applied to this local school that seems to offer such great , personable service maybe if i go on this medication maybe now that i'm going off the medication maybe now i'm finally done with withdrawal oh , wait now it 's getting worse what will i do without something to help these dark though and anxious obsessions ? because now i feel like i did just a little over a year ago at the edge of slipping into that hole again and , after all , did n't i then find out that he was almost dating the other girl and lose grip completely and fall down into darkness and are n't i still upset over how he wrong me , over how no one wants me , over how i do n't have any chances to me history just feels like a circle game , as joni once said for me , i doubt these dark cafe days will be only a phase and what more will they keep me from accomplishing ? enjoying ? loving ?
