despite the fatigue mentioned in yesterday 's post , i'm still on my feet after writing yesterday , i did get out for my run i even ran a speed workout , x meters it went much better than expected i was wiped out afterward , but i'm glad i did it i always feel good after i run fast , despite the pain of running that fast the weather has been quite challenging lately cold , cold , cold and wind forced me indoors yesterday and today i'm glad i have that option i'm just not into battling mother nature anymore battling fatigue , apparently , is more than enough despite the fatigue , i had a decent day at work today was the first of a very busy stretch for me i handled it i know i can do anything for one day i'm trying not to worry about the days ahead we are nearly full with patients , and beginning monday , i will be splitting time with another facility in order to cover their therapist 's vacation it 's exhausting to think about i'm trying not to think about it , because splitting time is tough our facilities are about miles apart i'm not familiar with their physical layout nor their patients unfamiliarity requires extra energy and sharpness that 's tough as was the case today , i feel i 'll need to be on all day , every day , next week perhaps this does n't make sense to many of you , but being continually on is exhausting i deal with my fatigue by taking breaks i might take a few extra minutes in the bathroom or climb the stairs more slowly between patients i might prescribe a set of exercises and then steal a minute to write a note unfortunately , staying on does not allow for many breaks staying on can be exhausting an overload of patients requires treating them in groups , therefore no spare minute for a note unfamiliar patients require extra history , interaction , and observation it may feel as if i have no time to slow down yet , i 'll need to slow down i 'll need to find space for breaks and i need to quit worrying about what may happen worry is also exhausting , and it 's exhausting today despite the fatigue , i'm doing all right i'm doing what i can i'm trying to take pride in what i 've accomplished , rather than lamenting what i have n't i need to stay in today , not worry about tomorrow , and not project difficulty into next week i know all that perhaps telling you will help keep me on track thanks thanks for holding me to the track
