i saw my orthopedic surgeon today he took the stitches out of my knee , explained the photos of the surgical procedure , and checked on my progress then we talked about rehab unfortunately , the microfracture surgery he performed is not a quick healing procedure in fact , he does n't even want me fully weightbearing on my right leg for another weeks since he repaired the patello femoral joint , i have to avoid loading my knee when it is in any more than a slightly flexed position that means i cannot go up or down stairs , squat , kneel , bike , jump , row , or run i can return to swimming next week i can return to gentle biking from a high seat in weeks i wo n't be able to climb stairs , squat , or kneel for quite awhile but here 's the kicker i may not be able to run for months ouch i was n't expecting the running news i thought months would be the longest possible layoff six months took me by surprise , and i 've been working on swallowing it for the rest of the day obviously , things could be worse he could have told me never to run again i guess i'm having a hard time accepting this because it was a surprise i was n't prepared the other problem is the boston marathon , for which i am already registered , have a room and a flight , is almost exactly months from today i really wanted to run a good boston in the news from my doctor today was very disappointing despite the disappointing news , i have much to look forward to i am really looking forward to getting in the pool next week i feel heavy and out of shape already it will be nice to move freely and expand my lungs again i'm also looking forward to this weekend d is coming to visit it will be nice to see him and spend time together and i'm looking forward to continued healing day be day , things will improve , and i 'll likely be running again before i know it !
