i do n't know where most people go when they want to look up dsm diagnostic criteria on mental illnesses , but mindsite com looks like the place to be i googled dsm dsm dsmiv dsm iv to get all iterations of possible searches no , i did n't expand it to the other options of adding tr with or without a space , and here are the top hits psyweb has some illness criteria , though of their nav links are to xanax , valium , and ativan , pages which contain buy xanax here ads first link lists dsm disoders smells fishy to me wikipedia nice history of the dsm allpsych lists many more of the dsm diagnoses , and includes symptoms , etiology , treatment , and prognosis dsm iv tr this is the official apa site , though it does not have any dsm content on it , nor does is list in its faqs where to buy it huh ? it does list the contact email for copyright permission requests psychnet uk which lists a portion of the diagnoses including criteria , cause , treatment , and pharmacotherapy so , mindsite lists different chapters of the dsm mood disorders , sleep disorders , personality disorders , etc and lists the full text from the following dsm sections diagnostic criteria diagnostic features associated features disorders , including lab findings and physical exam findings course specific culture , age , gender features prevalence familial pattern differential diagnosis specifiers recording procedures take a look at their major depression page to get a feel for how complete this is it feels like i have the actual dsm book right in front of me this is the most complete version of the dsm on the web that i am aware of no , this is not a paid endorsement i am genuinely impressed with the content here they also have illness portals , containing links to diagnostic tests and community discussion sections there 's probably more here let us know what else you find in the comments i interviewed david eraker , mindsite 's founder and ceo , by email over the past month or two and learned some other bits about his site they pay big bucks to the apa to license the dsm iv tr content , so it is legit at this point , the revenue model is advertising , but i have n't seen any of that yet contains about half of the dsm at least diagnostic tests , most from the who 's cidi , which was developed at harvard he prefers redfin to zillow i hope to get him on a podcast soon if we can ever get back to doing them we will ! to tell us more about their plans
