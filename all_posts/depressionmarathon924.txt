easily the nicest , warmest , sunniest day we 've had since maybe august passed today without me stepping out on the road instead , i went inside to swim ugh ! i swam and swam and swam i had a mile run scheduled , so i figured a minute swim might be approximately equivalent i swam for minutes , the first time i 've ever done that , and i covered yards , the greatest distance i 've ever swam i'm grateful i was able to swim that far and that long , but i still wish i had been outside ! there is no substitute for running ! only days until my marathon
