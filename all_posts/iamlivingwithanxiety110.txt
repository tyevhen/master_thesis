i think one of the most difficult aspects of tackling my fears and anxieties is learning to trust myself trusting my eyes to see what is there , trusting my brain to accurately interpret the world , trusting that everything probably will be ok , as it usually is for people with ocd , this can be particularly challenging , as we do n't trust what are eyes are showing us we can look at something , , , times and still see something wrong with it , even though we know on an intellectual level that there is n't anything amiss i am learning to trust myself , but it has not been easy but if i ca n't trust myself , who can i trust ?
