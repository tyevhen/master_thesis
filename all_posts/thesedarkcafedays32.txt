do you ever have days where you wish you could crawl out of your skin and go run around doing whatever you want for a day , carefree from whatever burdens are weighing on your mind or whatever flaws on your body you keep staring at and hating ? i feel like that today maybe it 's the lack of sleep or maybe it 's just time for the good mood i was in yesterday to come to an end because good moods can never last , i 've come to learn but i'm starting to feel the walls of my mind cave in on me again , like that seen in star wars where they 're in the room where the walls are slowly squeezing together and han and leia are desperately trying to press back against them , all to no avail yesterday , i felt confident in myself and in the future i was able to be patient and reasonable with myself when i started freaking out about how i should talk to people in my classes i told myself that maybe i just needed to give these things time and work on myself in the meantime in zumba class , i was in a let 's do this ! i'm gonna dance and have fun ! mood and when i could n't get the steps to a song right , i reminded myself that it takes time and practice to get there , so i should n't get discouraged but all of yesterday i kept obsessing more and more about something that happened during my class where i was worried i had made a social mistake and upset my professor i interpret social interactions for the worst , so i tend to assume people are angry or judgmental when they were n't as my day went on , i kept obsessing about this incident , feeling stupid and embarrassed and worried i 've also been feeling worse about my body lately , starting to hate the stretch marks and extra weight i 've put on , it does n't help when my own dad made a comment about my appearance recently and i 've been gathering up my old skinny clothes to sell and marveling at how tiny i used to be it makes me feel like some kind of monster now it even makes me feel kind of disassociated from my body , like i'm just inhabiting it rather than that it 's part of me i'm no longer that size girl that i see in pictures and i ca n't seem to wrap my head around the idea that that was me but when i look at my new body or see pictures of how i look today , i have a hard time comprehending that that 's me either it looks like someone else , it does n't feel like me , it 's not what i'm used to so who am i ? is my body part of who i am or just a place i inhabit ? i do n't know how my body changed so much , so quickly and i wish i knew when exactly it happened i do n't want to hate my body , but i do n't really like it either i know it will probably take a long time to adjust to this new body and there will be a process of accepting it , but there 's always that voice inside you that says , have n't you moved on yet ? it 's been almost a year you should be used to this by now ! i think that voice is my perception of how the world sees me and what people would say if i complained , but i have to let go of that voice because it 's harmful and wrong of course it 's understandable that i'm having a hard time adjusting to my body changing so drastically of course there will be days when i hate how my body looks now of course i will feel confused and shocked looking at picture of myself before and now why do n't we give ourselves permission and space to feel these things and grieve even the small losses ? why do we assign judgments to everything ? why do we always have to give our opinion on what other people are doing and how they should have done things ? why do we always have to be judging ourselves ? why ca n't i just let go and accept how i look today , and let go and accept when i do n't like how i look today ? apparently other people put pictures in their blog posts so i thought i 'd try it too credit author taken in cavendish beach , prince edward island my body has been through a lot in the past two years , just as much as my mind has it has been beaten up by racing adrenaline from panic attacks that kept me from sleeping it has been dragged down by medications it could not tolerate it has shaken uncontrollably from medication side effects , endured withdrawal symptoms and rapid medication changes , and weakened further and further to the point where it could barely drag itself out of bed it 's no surprise that at some point one of those medications flipped a switch on my metabolism and i started piling on weight my body has endured a lot and remained strong , and i should respect it for that but the most important thing is that i should celebrate that today it is healthy , regardless of the aesthetic shape it 's in i may have stretch marks , but at least i no longer have self harm scars because i am no longer in so much emotional pain that i ca n't cope any other way my stomach may protrude a little okay , a lot more , but i have energy to leave the house again , to make myself food , to go to school , and to accomplish anything else my little heart desires my more shapely hips may no longer be able to squeeze into that favorite pair of jeans , but i have the energy to get out of bed at am instead of pm i would rather be in my current mentally and for that matter physically healthy state , than skinny and still depressed which brings me to my obsessive anxiety about the awkward interaction in my class yesterday life is full of awkward i'm sure most of the class felt awkward i'm sure nobody cares about what i said i am blowing the whole thing out of proportion what matters is that i talk in class now i talk in class that 's amazing like , almost every single class i contribute i could n't do that a year ago it 's time to celebrate myself , not berate myself ! why is that so difficult ? reader , i hope you 'll take some time now to take the negative thoughts and tell them to stop in the name of love it 's time to give yourself a break it 's time to celebrate yourself and your victories , no matter how small it 's time to look at the flip side of your coin instead of berating it for not being a dollar look at the shortcomings you 've been grieving and find the celebrations even if you 're still in a really dark place , celebrate that you are still here i am amazed by each person i come across who has fought the dark , nasty , thorny , painful battle of mental illness and has survived even if they are not functioning the way the world would have them , even if they 're not recovered , they are here still they are fighting every single day that is a huge testimony to you and your courage and that is an incredible story to have , even if a lot of people in the world would downplay or deny it it 's your story and you are beautiful , brave , and strong read other posts about social anxiety read other posts about depression read other posts about body image
