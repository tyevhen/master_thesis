excuses , excuses have n't blogged in a while the kids keep me busy , and i 've been working on some personal projects that make me happy , not to mention some major work going on with the practice , which , since it pays the bills , takes a good deal of my attention however , i do have a new article up at psychology today , about the recent jama pediatrics article linking acetaminophen use and the risk of adhd in offspring it 's an observational study , but the best sort of observational study however let me warn you , i'm biased against acetaminophen from my experience working the ers and icus i do feel for pregnant women suffering pain or inflammation what are they to use ? if aspirin , other nsaids , and acetaminophen are all off the table i 've been hiding from conferences since ahs last august , but i 'll be at paleofx briefly in mid april , on the thrive show a google hangout with jennifer brea producer of what looks to be an amazing film called canary in a coal mine on april nd , and doing a couple presentations at the american psychiatric association annual meeting in new york city the first weekend in may i'm teaming up with drew ramsey that sunday to do a practical workshop for the practicing clinician on food and mood , and then georgia ede will join us on monday for a full three hour symposium on evolutionary psychiatry i'm very excited about both these presentations , and not just because georgia and drew are some of my favorite psychiatrists and people in general the evolutionary psychiatry symposium will include sections on the gut brain connection , all the latest data about the micorbiota and parasites , the immune system , and psychiatric disorders , but also reviews of minerals and hormesis fasting and ketosis if you are going to the apa , be sure to come out to see us , and come early , because last year our workshop was filled to the brim with some folks refused entry we are planning exciting , interactive presentations that may be a little different from the typical dry academic talk , but still on point and evidence based , of course i will have a few more blog articles coming out at psychology today so keep on checking back !
