as a result of ect , or perhaps just due to the severity of this depression relapse , i recently discovered i had little recollection of what happened over the past few months i could n't answer the frequently posed question , how did it start ? fortunately , i have a blog so i took a look back the other day do n't worry , this is not going to be a post summarizing in gory detail my recent misery and despair but it was interesting for me to rediscover how this relapse began and progressed it was interesting and strange , actually i discovered i felt really good , even grateful , just a few days prior to my first post indicating something was wrong this relapse seemingly began overnight and the decent into hell was complete within just a few days those two things in and of themselves were strange how does that happen ? ? but what was more strange was my reaction , or shall i say my lack of reaction , to my own words it was odd i had weeks of posts filled with increasingly desperate hopelessness and despair the words were sometimes horrifyingly descriptive of an agonizing trek through depression , yet as i read them i felt very oddly detached the words were just words i was n't feeling them at all that seemed really weird and abnormal usually , when i read something with feeling , even something i wrote years ago , i sort of re experience what my words were attempting to convey but this time , nothing and i mean nothing i may as well have been reading the declaration of independence now i'm not necessarily complaining perhaps my brain was protecting me perhaps it was saving me from re living any of this hellish episode but that possibility does n't make it any less strange i felt , and still feel , so detached already from what just happened so detached i'm getting frustrated trying to put it into words i was reading the words in my posts as an outsider looking into a life of which i could not relate is n't that weird ? ironically , the only post that struck me just a bit was the poem i wrote entitled , just words like every other post i reviewed , i had forgotten i wrote that poem and if i do say so myself , when i reread it i liked it i may even re post it now is there some meaning behind that irony ? perhaps , but i do n't know what it is anyway , i do n't know where i'm going with all of this , so i 'll stop now i was just really intrigued by feeling so detached from my own words detailing my own very recent past and i do n't really understand why
