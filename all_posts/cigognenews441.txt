in my book on life before birth i talk about the levels of consciousness and how the imprint that is laid down deep in the brain while we live in the womb has spokes going higher containing that information which is integrated on the feeling level limbic system , and finally on the cortical level where beliefs and comprehension lies through a process of resonance each level relates to the others in what i think is a matter of frequency so suffocation even before birth when a mother is a heavy smoker or drug taker sends up antenna to the feeling centers where we manufacture a dream where we are suffocating and then finally to the frontal cortex where we believe someone is suffocating leaves me no space to breathe and what is reciprocal is that currently someone leaves me no reason to breathe , crowds me , and then the cortical brain sends antenna down to the lower levels where each level reacts in terms of its capacity the feeling level adds emotions to the mix while the very low brainstem level enhances all physiologic reactions and provides much more charge value or energy that is why i say that primal therapy is neurosis in reverse we use the same electrical brain networks going up and down they are all related through , i submit only a hypothesis , frequencies each level has its own contribution to the totality of a feeling energy force feelings comprehension insight painting a feeling is not feeling it is painting symbolic of a feeling not a total physiologic affair , and hence never curative or ameliorating it is basically an act out nor can you play your feelings and make progress of course , if you are close to feelings you can play more feelingful but it is not therapy i know i used to do music therapy with psychotics in a mental hospital we would play jazz for the catatonics who could barely move , they had what was known as waxy flexibility we bent their arm to the music but it stayed there i never saw any progress what they also found is that very high frequencies are not conducive to feelings and their connections there is a feeling zone in my opinion , and when patients come into therapy with beta waves , very rapid waves , they are far above the zone it may be that a new patient will lock into a feeling for a moment and then skid off into an abreaction , because it is less painful she has been detoured off the proper frequency there is something off there and when one is tuned to feelings one can sense it this is no more than to say that each synapse has its preferred frequency and may not accept any other and the frequency is perfectly rhythmic when the rhythm is thrown off there is less learning and less cohesion less cohesion of feeling what i think we do in our therapy is retune the brain , especially those who have imprinted stress once the pain and trauma is relived the brain normalizes goes back to its proper tuning and , lovely , we go back to the proper inner tune we are finally in tune with ourselves literally
