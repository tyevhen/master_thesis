i 've stumbled upon two shrink blogs i 'd like to share while there are plenty of medical blogs , there still are not all that many are about psychiatry a handful , but they come and go , and given the number of psychiatrists , it still seems small to me dr greg smith blogs here http gregsmithmd com he also has a twitter feed i 'll let you check it out dr jordan smoller has a blog over on psychology today i stumbled across his blog today and thought , wait , i know him dr smoller 's blog is called the other side of normal which is the same name as a book he wrote funny how that works in one of his posts , he starts by talking about his first real job as a research assistant in that lab had another research assistant me so jordan is stuck in my mind as we were as back then he introduced me to rap , a form of music i had never heard of jordan would walk around our shared office mumbling something about a blind dog and a seeing eyed man anyway , i suppose we all grow up , and in some strange bid for universal balance , i eventually had a child who spent years walking around my house rapping , and i became the shrink rapper while he became the normal guy go figure check out their blogs and tell me what you think
