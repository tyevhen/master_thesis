this christmas i gave myself the best gift an endorsement when my relatives were debating a particular religious view on which i did not agree , i controlled my speech muscles by not voicing my opinion before recovery i would have felt compelled to share my perspective , which inevitably would have led to an argument and tension on a day in which we are supposed to celebrate harmony and tolerance so instead of seeking a symbolic victory by trying to prove that my beliefs are the right ones , i simply focused on something else while they discussed their opinions and , of course , before long the topic changed i chose peace over power and was group minded i did n't allow the need to be right take over my day and avoided the resulting confusion , doubt , and anger essentially , i practiced what recovery and christmas are all about
