why is it so hard to keep this blog up ? the question is rhetorical not because i think that it s going to cause any reader to lapse into deep thought it s because i already know the answer i m lazy that isn t to say that i m too lazy to update the blog blogging is no big deal i do it all day half of my income comes from blogging no , i m lazy about my depression i whine and moan and appear to yearn for relief but it will take work and , dammit , i m too depressed to want to work at it that s a bit of a joke but then it isn t , really i m comfortable with my depression weird , right ? i m not comfortable with the deep , deep lows and it is during those that i promise myself and anyone listening that i m going to do anything to make it go away but the normal constant hum of self doubt and self loathing is a comfortable thing it s been there for as long as i can remember and , quite frankly , i find it hard to function without it that last point is something that i learned recently i m back off of the sjw here s why as usual , i m behind on my work i started it a few weeks ago with a promise to take the herb until my bottle was empty for the first few days i didn t feel much of a difference i m not sure if that s how it s supposed to work but that s what happened to me then one morning i felt happy giddy , in fact i couldn t account for it i just felt happy but i didn t know what to do i couldn t work because i couldn t sit still at first i followed my wife around just chattering at her about nothing when she left for work i tried again to work and nothing came i couldn t write ! if i can t write i can t pay my bills i hoped i would get over it i kept taking the stuff for a couple more days the silly feeling subsided but i remained distracted after three days i had to give it up because i was getting behind then a few days later i got a nasty summer cold i m just now getting over it and i am now way behind so , i need to stay off of it until i get caught up once i do , i m going to try again if it happens again i don t know what to do this is one of the reasons that i ve never wanted to take medication i have other concerns such as the fact that this society is overmedicated and it just rubs me wrong to put more money in the deep pockets of the pharmaceutical companies but being just too damn happy to function has always been a big fear i need me and this thing , as bad as it can be sometimes , is part of me i ve always felt socially isolated i ve always been bluer than my peers i can t remember a time when i didn t think about suicide and i can t imagine me without these things i hoped that sjw would gently ease me away from depression so i could learn to be me without it i still hope that it does anyway , that s where i am thanks for posting your thoughts it means a lot to me that people are regularly reading this blog
