so with all the cpt code nonsense , i 've decided to computerize my practice and do my own billing in a different way i bought a computer an all in one thing with the computer in the screen , and a printer , and a desk to put them on i got the password for the wifi from one of my office mates and am now chipping in for the verizon bill well , sort of so , yes , if you 're wondering , i did n't have a computer , or a desk , in my office until last week before i had a smart phone , i was e unaccessible while i worked , and i thought the office as my haven , a place where i sit and actually speak to people without the distraction of screens if i could serve wine and cheese , my job would be perfect ummm , some days so the new computer is fine , it has a really big screen that i can actually see without glasses , but i do n't like windows at all , and you can be sure that clink and roy have already thrown up their arms in geeky exasperation because i did n't buy a macbook the insurance form program i 've used for years does n't work with mac 's , but to my geek friends oy so cpt codes , and mental health issues all over the news , a new computer , new ways of billing , and the inevitable busy ness of before and after vacation last night , i realized that i had my novels floating out there and i 've never checked to see if anyone 's saying anything about them i googled double billing , and realized it was mentioned in my college alumni magazine which was also sitting next to my laptop , and that one of my neighbor 's books concussions and our kids was also in that same in brief review but then i stumbled upon a blogger who had written the nicest comments weeks ago do check out tee bee h 's blog about the non commercial things we do i borrowed her graphic above since i was surfing because i could n't sleep , this was just the nicest thing to read the book was a page turner because of elegant structure and pacing the language was often interesting and otherwise non jarring i really cared about the author s take on things because she is a psychiatrist ? because i ve followed her blog for a while ? which meant that i was interested in the protagonist s thoughts , feelings and actions at times i ached for the mess her life was in , at others i wanted to shake her into action , and then she d find her backbone again , just in the nick and there was nothing saccharine about the happy ending a fine achievement , seriously
