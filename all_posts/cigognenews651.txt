it seems like in psychology today the lingua franca in describing patients is emotionally damaged so what is that ? it means someone who is neurotic , full of pain , damaged by years of abuse , etc so i got to thinking about it and tried to define it in a more precise way there are two aspects to this one there is a timetable of needs beginning in the womb how completely they are fulfilled or not determines one aspect of the pain secondly , needs that require fulfillment are the most painful the earlier they occur and this is pretty much true for all of us early primal needs are nearly always a matter of life and death their lack of fulfillment can be catastrophic this is imprinted and endures for nearly all of our lives there are secondary , non lethal needs that require fulfillment but when not fulfilled hurt but do not change our basic neuro physiology these needs come late in the evolutionary time table so let us assume that of the many needs , to be touched , talked to and listened to , to have our needs acknowledged , to be understood and have our moods mirrored by parents , there are only one or two that are fulfilled the rest means pain there is hierarchy of needs those that are involved in life and death oxygen at birth , a calm environment while being carried , feeling safe in one s surroundings and being protected above all , being touched and caressed and kissed right after birth parents need to show their love lesser needs such as being talked to are important but they do not alter the great pain of not being held and caressed as an infant we can adumbrate the amount of pain by measuring the vitalness of the need and how much it was not fulfilled those who are most damaged are those who have in my lingo , first line pain the only damage equivalent is something that is commensurate with first line such as incest at age six or eight but in addition to that there are other needs not fulfilled , then you have the makings of serious mental illness when the parent who is supposed to protect you becomes the danger , damage is inevitable when a child has no one to express her feelings to , damage is also evident in my books where i write on the nature of love , i have discussed the various needs and their need for fulfillment if you have been touched and held but not talked to the damage is much less if you have not been held but have been talked to the damage is much more so damage increases as deeper brain areas are touched that is why hollywood does not ordinarily ruin people those who are already wounded seek out hollywood
