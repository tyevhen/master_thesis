jarod anderson , a young man , avers that my poem about kenyon was a successful pet poem what is a successful pet poem ? the closer you are to something or someone , the harder it is to write well as i was not so personally connected to my daughter 's turtle or tortoise , as the case may be , i post a poem about its demise below , along with its link to snakeskin , now a singularly august e zine for all the years it 's gone on , outliving melic my request , for any so disposed , is to tell me whether the last three lines originally published are worth keeping or not i think they try too hard to impart a meaning , thus am in favor of jettisoning them into the pool where all my almost poetry sinks do weigh in with your thoughts i am eminently teachable since my dear wife , kathleen , became the first human to come close to taming me my mother tried , but then boys will be boys ! the terrapin question we never named him or knew his sex he was n't happy if turtles could be happy i purchased an aquarium to protect him from the cats his chitinous serape was not enough , i thought , to keep him safe in this unnatural habitat his back was a mosaic of rounded squares his belly plate was yellow , marked with black i did n't know if he liked water or land i placed him in a shallow bath to see proving he was no amphibian , he sought the dry end like a refugee my daughter left for college his care devolved on me i tried to furnish him with water and food but never cared or really understood his needs , so my care was n't that good when i 'd put him on the floor for exercise he moved so slowly i did n't see him crawl when suddenly he 'd be at the far wall as if by magic , as if turtles could fly they ca n't but living things can always die when he first disappeared i was disturbed i looked in closets , crevices and thought he 'd joined the two iguanas we misplaced i looked in every possible hiding place except beneath the sofa where the space was much too narrow to admit him , i judged , when lifting it i saw his carapace ! relieved , i placed him in his house of glass and crumbled lettuce for his tiny beak , put out fresh water , forgot him for a week i found him with his legs and head and tail extended as if posed in a museum i picked him up there was a sour smell and no attempt to pull a single limb into its case i always wondered if his kind died outside or inside the shell now i knew i threw him in the trash like a spoiled pie , dead of neglect when my last hour comes will i retract inside myself , all doors and windows closed , or have the courage to die with limbs exposed ? thine in amphibian demise , shhh at two kilobunnies ! , craig erick
