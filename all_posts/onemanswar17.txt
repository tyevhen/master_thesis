by jack smith some say the holidays are hard because we expect too much we hope for norman rockwell and end up with clark griswold we cook too much we clean too much we shop too much we spend too much we drink too much , eat too much and expect too much those things are probably true but my guess is what makes the holidays hard for some of us is we carry too much weight into the season of giving and it 's exhausting we carry our burdens and resentments , our hurts and disappointments that have accumulated in our hearts and minds we carry our failures and our bitterness , our pain and our anxiety about what the future may hold with the end of the year approaching , it feels like dragging an anvil across a finish line we ca n't really even see
