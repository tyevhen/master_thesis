i love being a mom , best job i 've ever had jack is going to be very soon so i am feeling a little nostalgic cannot believe our lanky little boy used to be nothing more than a little bean he has changed our lives in every way imaginable jack 's story mommy and daddy wanted you very much mommy had been dreaming of having a baby her whole life ask grammy ! but first , we were taking a trip to italy ! and then we were going to settle in and hope for the best you , my love , had other plans ! mommy had just started a new job and was working in the office for awhile before she started working from home , and on her second day in elkridge , there was a blood drive i always used to donate , so thought nothing of it when i was done , i stood up and wham , down i went completely passed out i felt really bad for several days and this had never happened to me before what was the problem ? so on my lunch break i popped by target and picked up a pregnancy test , just to be sure that was n't the issue took it , saw nothing , dropped it in my purse and did n't think about it again welp , the next day on my way to lunch , i went to grab my keys , and accidentally pulled out the test ummmmm what was that other line doing there ? ? ? apparently you wanted to go to italy with mommy and daddy ! ! ! and you did mommy missed out on some great wines , but daddy took one for the team and tried them all for me sheesh ! you were worth it ! our first official portrait mommy at weeks in sorrento , italy you were a pretty easy baby to grow other than some major pukey moments namely on our plane trips to and from italy especially when a woman on the way there had a heart attack and mommy ended up taking care of her ! we ended up rerouted to newfoundland to drop her off at a hospital and that flight lasted no less than hours never fear , mommy got a lovely gift basket from the airlines for her efforts you were due on may th and i was bound and determined that you would not be late , i had a wedding to be in weeks after that i was a walking machine ! on may th i started feeling contractions , no biggie , that had been happening for awhile i called your aunt sarah just to chat , and told her i was having more braxton hicks we talked for about minutes before we got off the phone she said , you know , you just had contractions while we were on the phone , you might want to start timing those it was about in the morning so i started writing them down while i was working i still have those pieces of paper they were steady all day , but not increasing , and not painful i was getting pretty excited though maybe this was the real thing daddy was supposed to go to happy hour with coworkers that night , i told him he might as well go , nothing major doing at home mommy took a long walk by herself , and noticed things were picking up a bit in true expectant mommy fashion , i came home and in a panic , put together the brag books i had been planning for grammy and mimi , just in case this was my last opportunity to do so before mother 's day good thing i did because all of the sudden pain i called daddy and said what 's up ? feel like maybe making your way home ? so he came home , and we took a nice long walk our last as a family of two two neighborhood dogs jumped up on me i think daddy almost barked at them he was feeling a little protective that night since i had been a labor and delivery nurse , i was bound and determined to avoid one of those false alarm visits to the maternity suite when i went in , it was going to be the real thing ! we knew the rule contractions minutes apart , lasting minute for hour mommy waited through hours before she called even then her ob was skeptical but in we went and we did n't leave ! mommy did n't want any medicine , but panic set in , and in went the epidural i did n't know about hypnobirthing yet i recommend it to everyone i wo n't go through all the gorey details of your delivery but i will say that daddy , as you know , fancies himself pretty old fashioned and had been mumbling about not wanting to be in the delivery room i told him that was not an option , and he then said he was going to stay at the head of the bed and wanted to see nothing ummmm yeah your daddy was right there , cheering me on , and did n't miss a thing and he did n't pass out either when you made your entrance into the world , you did n't cry although both mommy and daddy did the doctor put you right on my chest and you just stared at me , without a sound it was one of the most precious moments of my life but everyone was a little worried that you did n't scream so they took you over to the warmer to check you out they suctioned you , they gave you a little oxygen still no crying but you were breathing , and looking all around you apparently needed to take it all in and did n't want to ruin the moment with all that racket those other annoying newborns make mommy could n't see you during that time and has never been more worried in her life those moments are what pushed me to avoid an epidural the next time around i wanted to be able to get up and check on my baby , make sure everything was ok your aunt and uncle and mimi came to see you right after you were born your mimi was so proud to have her first grand baby ! the hospital did this funny thing after days they told us we could take you home seriously ? ok , i know i was a live in nanny to an infant , that i am a nurse , that i have a sister who is years younger than me who i spent a lot of time caring for but could n't these people see that i had no earthly idea what i was doing ? ? below is your nursery see ? i was all prepared cue the snickers grammy and grandad were still in california when you were born daddy had just held a baby basically for the first time mommy was terrified to take you home ! but home we went and now years later , you 're still alive , so we must be doing something right look how tiny you were ! i love this picture of you next to daddy 's hand early memories your aunt helen seeing you for the first time and saying you looked like uncle joe this was not a compliment , however , it was temporarily true within days you were the most adorable baby ever the nurses in the hospital trying to comfort you , the doctor trying to comfort you , the lactation consultant trying to comfort you , grammy trying to comfort you you cried for hours your second day of life daddy and i have always thought that you were making up for your birth day daddy driving miles an hour the whole way home from the hospital this is how we know he loved you right away ! riley the dog knocking over furniture in your nursery while trying to check you out daddy making hamburger helper beef stroganoff more times than mommy can count those first few weeks playgroup ladies this is how mommy meals came to be daddy and i taking you for your first walk in the stroller i lifted the wheels over every bump watching the clock until your next feeding because i was terrified that this was the time i would n't be able to nurse you i also wanted to wear the nursing shield on a chain around my neck seriously freaking out granddad and aunt kate looking at you through the window when granddad picked kate up from college because kate had mono and granddad had a sinus infection interviewing nannies thinking one was way too young and inexperienced asked her to pick you up out of the swing and she opened the guard bar hey , i did n't know that opened ! sigh sitting upstairs in my office my first day back at work and crying the entire time you , by the way , were perfectly fine daddy and mommy freaking out that you were sucking your thumb and trying to stop it note that your brother sucks his thumb we encourage it you laying on your changing table for minutes at a time staring at yourself in your little lion mirror almost anyone will tell you that you do n't know what it is to be a parent until you become one it 's true it did n't matter how much child care experience i had , i did n't have parenting experience i did n't know that feeling of being one of the two people on earth responsible for a human life the feeling is completely awe inspiring and overwhelming so many new parents go into this experience thinking they know what it is all about myself included , they see family members do it , they see friends do it , and assume they have a clue they do n't the amount of love that we feel for you is indescribable i would do anything for you , i would give up everything for you , you and your brother are everything to your daddy and me how did we go from this one ! two ! three ! four ! to this ? ? ? ? ? we are so lucky to be your parents i love everything about you your smile , your kooky laugh , the way you turn around and give us that look when you know you are being naughty your amazing robot , lobster , crab , and scorpion imitations the way you make up animals like brontoscorpios oh crap , i just googled it http en wikipedia org wiki brontoscorpiohttp en wikipedia org wiki brontoscorpio ok , never mind the way you teach us about animals that we never knew existed , ask us to make their sounds , then look at us like we are morons when we do it wrong the fact that you gobble up fish and asparagus and refuse spaghetti , and choose strawberries over ice cream the way you say mommy daddy , i love you , you 're my best friend you usually want something , but honestly , we do n't care , it 's just so nice to hear the way you shriek get natey ! every time we try to let him walk somewhere you are so worried he 's not going to follow us the fact that you call me your princess every time i put on a dress , or come over to me and demand that i take my hair down so i look beautiful the way you scream mommy is the driver every time daddy goes anywhere near the driver 's seat of mommy 's car oh , and your genuine concern for fergie and those humps on her back do they hurt mommy ?
