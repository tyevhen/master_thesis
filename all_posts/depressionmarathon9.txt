perhaps it 's because i 've been sick the entire month i'm tired i returned to work this week , and it 's been a long , busy week by yesterday my brain and body were screaming for a nap prior to lunch time ! unfortunately , i did n't get that nap , but i just woke up from a two hour nap i enjoyed today like yesterday , my body was screaming at me to lie down i love napping , but i'm not used to being so tired i am still recovering from my illness it 's now days and counting since i got sick i'm still coughing a bit , and i can talk , although not yet normally i appreciated being well enough to go to work this week , but other than that i did n't get much done my evenings were spent vegging rather than doing chores or exercising but i allowed that to be okay i vowed to get some exercise this weekend i ran a nice interval workout this morning on the alter g treadmill i ran at of my body weight for minutes with five , minute intervals although i felt good during my run , i may have been a bit too aggressive the fatigue set in shortly after i finished i was whipped ! it was all i could do to eat some lunch and finish my laundry before i gave in and took my delightful hour nap with christmas on the horizon , i have a couple more days to heal and rest prior to returning to work i have no plans for christmas , which is okay , but i 'd be lying if i said it did n't make me feel a little sad it 's a big family holiday , and i just do n't have that my brothers all have their own families with children , in laws , and grandparents my parents live in florida it will just be jet and i for christmas here no worries , i 've got a couple of movies to watch , a couple treats for jet , and perhaps i 'll take a couple more hour naps merry christmas and happy holidays , my friends
