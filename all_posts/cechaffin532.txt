good morning i appreciate all the comments , here and by e mail , that you send my way , and am scrupulous about answering each one back to the manic half of sine wave the following poem was nominated for a pushcart by rose and thorn you can see the fountain if you click on the poem 's title , but i recommend you read the poem first to see how close we come to imagining it together at the inverted fountain , ucla i sat here as an undergraduate for hours , water tinkling like a muted xylophone above the background hiss and glug this stump of stream sounded real as any other , even smelled the same , mineral sweet with a tang of leaf though flowing not to sea but to a central well whose pumps fill the peripheral trench to spill inward over the concrete lip down to the hollow center today it s dry , its circling trench a reservoir of stagnant water where strands of algae flutter above bottle caps and newspapers and a few coins its stones , purloined from nature have dried dull mustard in the sun i think of running water as the white noise meant to cleanse the way between us , the inevitable tao of running down , the ultimately indiscriminate lover flattering every shape by imitation nothing is humbler my coin bounces off dry rocks , my thumb turns to glass , my hand drops with a splash on the plaza s bricks , my head bursts into droplets and where my shape stood sits a pile of soggy clothes if i recall correctly , i had returned to ucla for an advanced cpr and emergency trauma course when i sat on the edge of this fountain and penned the first draft it drew a certain wordsworthian voice from me , but i went strand at the end and lost my identity , then segued to one of my favorite themes , merging with the infinite , an extinguishing of personality , as eliot called it i just finished updating another ms , for kathleen love poems it has grown to seventy pages since i met kathleen , at roughly ten poems a year , though it was written in spurts and dabs and this harvest only contains the keepers i 've never sent it out , but i think it 's soup obviously we 're lucky to be in love after seven years we can hardly pass each other without some touch of affection i never thought such a love was possible on earth , though i 've read one account of such a union , sheldon vanauken 's a severe mercy , a book i highly recommend although kathleen has n't tamed me yet , she 's come closer than my mother as my daughters say , she 's the first woman who can shut papa up in public as my father said to me , women train us counted calories yesterday , and when i realized i had really eaten a different cut of pork with calories per oz i thought it was , i knew i had exceeded my daily limit of calories and thus took my revenge on the whole enterprise with salami , cheese , crackers , and a hostess cherry pie , easily another calories , putting me way over for the day when my goal was on the bright side , i did eat only two country style ribs a month ago i might have eaten three or four i binged from frustration and disappointment it 's easy to binge here because we 're near humboldt county i know this is a war , not a battle three steps forward and two steps back i think i 'll start reading women 's magazines i see in checkout lines they seem to have a lot of advice about such things if i blog about dieting , no doubt i 'll gain a larger audience than blogging about manic depression and poetry ya think ? near or at the top of all book sales are two genres cookbooks and diet books i 'll try to post my weight and before picture soon let 's hope i get to the after picture one day it would certainly help my blood pressure and my stamina , not to mention how clothes look on me even at body fat content , however , i 'll still have a belly i do n't think i could do enough sit ups to mitigate the stretching of my abdominal wall by repeated bouts of amoebic dysentery back in mexico i 'll probably end up looking like a basketball on stilts visualizing my inner male model , ce
