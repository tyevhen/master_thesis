we all know the story of rudolph , the red nosed reindeer and how he was suddenly plucked from obscurity into the annals of history by santa however , if you really listen to the lyrics of the song or watch the movie , you may notice some familiar themes that pop out to you as a school counselor themes from rudolph , the red nosed reindeer dancer and his pals were the leaders of the popular crowd and they set the bar of social acceptance in the north pole i e everyone must have a black nose to participate in the reindeer games no red noses allowed at the reindeer games ! when rudolph was born , he was born with a disability that made him stand out from his peers eventually when the disability was revealed , he was bullied and harassed by his peers this kid looks weird ! initially , rudolph 's parents tried to hide and ignore his disability in order to receive acceptance by the popular crowd no ieps here ! lets put some dirt on his nose and no one will ever know the truth ! when rudolph 's disability was revealed , rudolph and his family were ostracized by santa and his coach , comet no one is allowed to play with a red nosed reindeer ! santa never addressed the teasing , taunting , or shunning by the reindeer he acted like everything was okay therefore , he was definitely setting himself up for a lawsuit ! santa and his reindeer could n't pull the sleigh in the fog and became desperate for a solution they were forced to accept rudolph 's help because they did not want to be on the news for not delivering gifts to all the good little boys and girls santa actually forced rudolph to guide the sleigh and never even offered an apology for his workers' harassment ! get over it kid this is your chance to make it big ! the end result of the story comes out positively for the reindeer and his family ! rudolph was a resilient reindeer who decided not hold a grudge against his peer group and goes into the history books as a peacemaker with other pioneers like gandhi and martin luther king , jr fortunately , rudolph did not get a hunter 's rifle and take revenge on all those who persecuted him that would then be a different kind of movie ! so you see , rudolph could be your typical high school student experiencing peer name calling and staff bystanding ! although christmas is over , the story of rudolph can encourage you to do something that santa did not do educate your staff and students about the dangers of name calling in your school in january , glsen and its sponsors , have established no name calling week in schools what is no name calling week ?
