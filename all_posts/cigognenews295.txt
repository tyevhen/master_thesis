i have written about telomeres before , and it is something we plan to study with our patients but it is worth another look as it pretty much determines how long we live , but more importantly whether we fall ill prematurely the research on it is largely about outside stress , never on internal forces so it is a matter of war , poverty , strikes and parental fights yet the key chronic stressor is the imprint that carries forth those parental fights as a fixed memory that follows us for the rest of our lives and they say that we have to eliminate stress in order to live longer so how do we do that ? we can move to a new city or country but the imprint follows us assiduously and never lets up we can go to cognitive therapy and talk our feelings to death , or we can attack the imprint at its origin , relive the trauma and finally be rid of it i know of no other way to do it the imprint is tenacious and it must be because it is there to guide our lives and control our reactions it was lifesaving originally and the system remembers and carries it on it is clear that stress and its handmaiden , cortisol , the stress hormone does shorten telomeres or beginning patients were high in cortisol until one year of therapy then it reduced significantly we assume that since cortisol and telomeres work in see saw fashion cortisol high , telomeres short cortisol low , telomeres longer that is why we will do this research because i am convinced that since we lower cortisol we may also lengthen telomeres or at least keep them from shortening when telomeres get too short so do our lives there is an article by elizabeth blackburn and elissa apel about all this in nature oct see a short preview http www readcube com articles a worth a read they report on a number of studies of telomeres in that compared white blood cells of mothers with chronically ill children with those mothers with healthy children clearly , mothers of ill children had shorter telomeres again , stress is a factor and that means increased cortisol levels and that means shorter telomeres it is not short term stress that is the culprit but enduring stress and what could be more enduring than the imprint ? if only that could be accepted by the scientific community what cortisol may do , inter alia , is increase the action of telomerase which affects the function of telomeres to be clear what that enzyme may do is get busy fighting deterioration taking place with the input of primal pain this , it seems , is happening to prevent further neuro biologic damage to the system a research team led by owen wolkowitz of the university of california , san francisco , has been studying telomeres and depression may , , depression linked to telomere enzyme see for example http www sciencedaily com releases htm what telomerase does ordinarily is help maintain the length of the telomeres , even lengthen them they are protective and they go up when depressives take antidepressants they also go up in animals where it is associated with increased nerve cells in the hippocampus it appears that the hippocampus deals with the facts of feeling and the memory of it it is seriously affected by depression the longer the depression the shorter the telomeres , and it becomes a life or death matter they have found , for example , the very serious pancreatic cancer , is associated with shorter telomeres in blood cells these people were also studied before the onset of cancer so we cannot say that telomeres shortened because of shorter telomeres telomeres maintain the stability of genes my view is unstable individuals , unstable telomeres there are other cancers associated with shorter telomeres we do indeed plan to study them in our therapy the point is made , but not by the researchers imprinted pain has a lot to do with depression and with later serious illness we need to study this among our patient population much of the research on telomeres seems to confirm our hypothesis , that it is the very early experience that stamps in the most forceful and enduring imprints the work quoted above found that stress in infancy and even before erodes telomeres children who spent a lengthy time in orphanages had shorter telomeres telomeres are shorter in chronic depressives , and that fact is crucial why ? we have to assume that there is an imprint of early trauma to set up the depression , in the first place that means pain there is a great amount of imprinted pain in depressives , something we have seen over and over again in our patients and we see depression lift as patients relive very early pain this seems to be also true with immune disorders , as depression affects the immune system adversely chronic depressives have shorter telomeres that can mean premature serious illness and early death i believe that our therapy is life saving , and we are beginning to see why one problem we have is that when patients get to earlier imprints the pain is painful but if they stay with it , it does not last , and makes for great changes throughout the system it is indeed tempting to want to quit when pain arrives but for every pain experienced there is that much less to feel and when cortisol is chronically high and telomeres short , there is a much greater chance of suffering from certain cancers , including the deadly pancreatic cancer what causes this cancer ? early trauma that is imprinted and endures another effect is the appearance of dementia in those with shorter telomeres again , we need to look at very early trauma , even in gestation , to find the answer to the question , what causes cancer ? what causes dementia ? doesn t this make sense ? when you have a constant pressure and tension on the organs due to the imprint it makes sense that they will give in and break down , the organs are saying , i can t hold on any more it is more than i can handle , all too much it is surprising to me that they do continue to hold their integrity as long as they do there is an article in july issue of brigham and women s hospital , boston , mass , that underlines the importance of anxiety to damaging the telomeres see http www plosone org article info adoi f fjournal pone it is an important study in which they took blood samples from women ages it is known as the woman s health study they analyzed telomere length among them those who reported frequent anxiety attacks phobias had significantly shorter telomeres they implied that it would deduct six years from their lives they conclude that chronic anxiety in childhood leads to premature aging and , of course , a shorter life anxiety will kill us which is why it is so important not to leave the imprint untouched in psychotherapy telomeres will soon be the key marker for not only how how long we live but how many years a key psychotherapy can add to our lives if we leave it untouched and unchanged the therapy is a failure stress erodes telomeres very early on , according to late research so children who spent time in orphanages from birth on had shorter telomeres i think the evidence is there in so many dimensions early trauma damages the system in every way possible we need to pay attention when we carry a baby in the womb and we need to pay real attention to our birth practices which are deleterious too often the research emphasizes that the early stress carries on into adulthood those women in a study in england who had early abuse also had shorter telomeres we can run but cannot hide from our imprint it follows us everywhere and anywhere until we acknowledge it and relive the damage here is supporting evidence for the imprint even if not stated why else does it endure and shorten telomeres ? why cannot they make the equation that early trauma stays fixed in the system and drives behavior while shortening our lives ? i believe that the earlier the stress , the carrying mother smoking early in pregnancy , the more harmful it will be later on let s teach about pregnancy in school so that adolescents understand what pregnancy means for a human life
