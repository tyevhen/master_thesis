while cleaning my basement yesterday i found an old notebook tucked away in an ancient runner 's world magazine on my way to the recycle bin i realized the notebook contained some journaling dated from late through mid , the entries were all about my early struggles with this illness the magazine went in the recycle bin while the notebook and i sat down i began feeling like something was wrong , or a bit off , in november , my words reflect the confusion and concern i experienced as i tried to figure out what was happening with me many entries sound like this one i feel there is something wrong something wrong with me how else can i make sense of these overwhelming , powerful , intimidating feelings racing through my head ? that was from february , those early months , powerlessness is reflected over and over in what i said it appears i did n't have an understanding of depression 's wide ranging symptoms i did n't know what was happening my early depression was apparently dominated by racing , intrusive thoughts , distractibility , and profound confusion i was disturbed by my brain 's errant path and exasperated by my inability to control it or cope feeling like an impostor in my own body was a constant theme it appears those early months were very scary , unsettled times it 's interesting to see the difference between then and now while my depression still unsettles and exasperates me sometimes , i now have the benefit of previous experience i have a label for the restlessness , intrusive thoughts , sadness , and fatigue it 's depression and based on previous experience , i know that whatever crap i am feeling will eventually pass i guess that 's one benefit of an eight year battle today i have acceptance , knowledge , and support those are three things i did n't have in reading my old writings , it 's obvious those are three things which keep me battling today without them , i 'd be dead
