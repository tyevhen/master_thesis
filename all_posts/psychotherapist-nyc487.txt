how many times did you hear these words from your father , you 'll understand after you have children ? at the time when your father told you this , you probably felt annoyed and frustrated with him

contentious relationship with their fathers being neither a young child nor an adult , being a teenager can be confusing and frustrating for the teenage boy as well as his father it can be a time when the father son relationship becomes strained often , after men get married and have their own children , they gain a new perspective about what it means to be a father and , the same men who rebelled against their fathers when they were teens often come to have a new appreciation for the complexities of fatherhood they usually develop more of a sense of compassion for their fathers than they had
