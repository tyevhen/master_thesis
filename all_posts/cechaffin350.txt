i have found that more traditional love poems are frowned upon by most editors , that anti love poems are preferred nowadays when i say traditional , i do not mean maudlin or derivative , rather something from the heart that respects line breaks and rhythm i think rhythm very important in a love poem , for obvious reasons , and i do n't mean that as a freudian aside it seems that when i'm not depressed , i blog about literature or post poetry , and when depressed , i write about myself likely whatever readership i have alternates between those who come here to read about mood disorders and those who come for poetry when i am not depressed , my concerns involve others and the world when depressed , i am absolutely cut off from the world and exiled to the bell jar of which sylvia plath wrote so eloquently , when this blog becomes a method for survival in general , however , depression is an aberrant state for me , so the necessity for posting about it , i hope , will not return for many years after this last tortuous year , except in brief dips but with this unpredictable disease , one never knows i'm still feeling fragile kathleen is my steadying force should i turn manic , however , i usually end up in jail , so i would have to blog about that after the fact i disobey my own rule in posting this love poem the same day i wrote it i asked kathleen if i should , and she said , go ahead make the other women jealous in as it 's addressed to her , she is the last one to be relied upon as a critic but not to follow her advice is a risk i'm unwilling to take at this point in my recovery have a wonderful day , ce aubade ii we wake to the alarm , i turn and palm your breasts , softer than tulip petals , and feel your nipples straighten in response before your breathing heaves you back to sleep like cargo meant for heaven i stay awake , gently compress your breasts each time you must inhale your moon fits in the hollow of my groin , your thighs repeat my thighs , my knees fit in the hollows of your knees i would envelop you like a shell around a seed and let my body break to further yours scatter me beneath the walnut tree i watch the sunlight shafting through the firs , i hear our old dog rearrange himself on his brown blanket and green pillow he will not rise until you rise , i will not leave your body until you wake we are both prisoners of our adoration we cannot move until you speak
