as we enter summer vacation , my main focus has been on finding places for the boys to be while i work , making sure they 're taken care of , and trying to afford it all i am revisiting some old supplements that i do n't feel like i tried for long enough and reading about some new ones my autism book stack is getting higher by the day i read and read and pray that one day i am going to find that magical solution for nate that some day he is just going to open up his mouth and start talking that the stimming will calm and i 'll be able to talk to him like any other kid there is so much going on in there , it just feels like everything he wants to say is trapped i do n't know what more i can do for him right now so i guess i am feeling trapped too and inadequate as usual i am watching babies born almost two years after him pass him by verbally and while it hurts , i marvel at their development i know their parents are thankful for it , but do they get just how much of a miracle it is ? it 's something i appreciate seeing more than i can express i am trying to rally myself for another round of searching and implementing sometimes i am just so damned tired with just what we are already doing and yet i feel that same sense of panic creeping in that i am not figuring this out i mean , what if there is nothing to figure out ? what if this is just the way it 's going to be ? that thought terrifies me and it 's one that i am trying to reconcile myself to , just in case in the meantime , i guess we really are just treading water surviving , doing a lot of running around , going to appointments , smiling and saying the kids are doing well , and coming home at the end of the day , collapsing , and feeling discouraged it 's a dance we have honed over time , we are getting pretty good at it
