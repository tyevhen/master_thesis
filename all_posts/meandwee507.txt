hello ! as my post title says , today i am weeks pregnant wow , those words astound me ! i remember thinking weeks was a big deal ! all is going well here i'm still waiting to feel some baby movement i think i 've maybe felt a flutter here or there , but nothing is for sure yet i figure in another week or i 'll start to feel something i 'll be more sure about i hope ! chris and i went out to dinner on friday night and when we got to the waiting area a lovely woman and her two young children jumped up off the couch as she proclaimed let 's go guys , this lady needs the seat more than us ! woa that was the first time a stranger had acknowledged my condition ! and gave me her seat , at that ! i told her she did n't have to , but she very much insisted saying i remember what it was like and i chuckled and stated that i was n't very far along but , i took a seat and and sat there kind of stunned i'm just glad i am pregnant what if i 'd just had a few too many cheeseburgers ? she made a lucky guess or maybe i look more pregnant than i think ? today i went to the dentist , and when i walked in , the receptionist after i took off my coat said oh ! i guess that answers our question of if you are or are n't ! again , i was called out believe me , i'm not complaining i guess i'm just amazed at how fast time goes and that it 's me they are talking to ! how many times do i need to pinch myself to believe this is truly happening ? save you might also like weeks pregnant weeks pregnant weeks linkwithin
