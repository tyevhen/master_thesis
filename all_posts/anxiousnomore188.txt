today was my first day of travel on my business trip and i have sooo much to say from what worked and what did n't that i thought it might be best if i broke it up into parts so here is part don't assume you are in a good enough place to not properly prepare your mind beforehand you would think i would have learned my lesson from my last trip to hawaii but when my business trip that was scheduled in few weeks suddenly turned into a few days , all i could think about was packing , scheduling , finances , etc i figured i would bring my medication and my mp player with my recordings of positive affirmations and that would be enough wrong ! unfortunately on the way to the airport i had my first full blown panic attack in months i am not sad about it because i know that every setback has a valuable lesson to be learned , even if it has to be shoved down your throat in my case i think the second time is a charm , and i wo n't forget it for the next time i should have properly prepared myself mentally no matter how good i thought i would be i should have made time to plan things out in my head , tackle all of my fears and what if statements no matter how small or insignificant they may seem i ended up throwing up on the side of the road on the way to the airport then i could n't stop shaking for about an hour i felt nauseas and tired all through my first flight and did n't start feeling normal until i was almost to san jose all i ate before now was a couple peanuts , a juice box , a bite of a granola bar and some gum then as soon as i got in i had to go to work and did n't get back until pm i am emotionally and physically exhausted , and i am lonely in my hotel room today overall sucked stay tuned for parts and on if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like do 's and do n'ts when traveling with anxiety part do 's and do n'ts of traveling with anxiety part celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip miami travel followup linkwithin
