i got a letter today from a patient asking me to explain why i 've billed him roughly more than medicare allows he included a statement from ? medicare or it 's administrators saying that this lower amount is the medicare allowed amount and that if his doctor charged more , a refund is due every year , in december , i try to figure out the medicare fees mostly i call a shrink friend who is in the same jurisdiction who is also a non participating medicare provider , which is different then someone who opts out i have to charge the medicare amount , but it 's always this funny challenge to figure it out just how much that is at one point , i could n't even figure out where i practice in maryland there are two districts , and , and my office appeared to be located in neither so now i think i know where i am no one else i asked was completely certain either for the record , it 's not easy to find the fees , they vary by district and by procedure and by whether you are a facility or non facility , participating , or non participating , and there is the limiting fee and caps , and it gets mailed to me as a cd that does n't open , and it 's not on a website that i can find and the psychiatric society does n't always have any better luck , and some of my friends are participating and have different fees , and most have opted out and one just ca n't deal so he does n't charge any medicare patient any fee and he does n't submit easier to work for free okay , so every year for the past couple of years , medicare is cutting fees by or but at some point , congress changes their minds and undoes the cut , so i 've taken to keeping my fees the same , with the idea that it will be easier to reimburse patients or credit their accounts then it will be to tell patients that i was wrong to drop my fees and they now owe me money and every year , congress votes , after a period of ranting and uncertainty , to undo the fee cut this year , congress seems to vote to delay the cut multiple times every few weeks i called a friend , he got a similar letter from a patient the tone of the letters imply that we are purposely overcharging or willfully committing medicare fraud the executive director of our state medical society got pulled in he sent out a newsletter from the medicare folks it states on april , , president obama signed into law the continuing extension act of this law extends through may , , the zero percent update to the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs that was in effect for claims with dates of service january , through march , the law is retroactive to april , consequently , effective immediately , claims with dates of service april , and later , which were being held by medicare contractors , have been released for processing and payment please keep in mind that the statutory payment floors still apply and , therefore , clean electronic claims cannot be paid before calendar days after the date they are received by medicare contractors calendar days for clean paper claims given the uncertainty regarding mpfs claims with dates of service june , , and later , please watch your listservs and your contractor s website for more information so medicare is saying there is no decrease , at least not for the next weeks , at which point we can again try to figure out what to charge but cms is telling patients that the fees we are charging are illegally high whistle blowers and medicare fraud publicity and fines , leave me wishing it was easy for everyone to simply know the correct fees
