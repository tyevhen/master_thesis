it 's am , i 've been trying to sleep since pm i think i 've slept a bit but i 've now go the point where i am frustrated , my hands are itching this is a weird thing that keeps happening when i ca n't sleep and my mind is full of crap i'm down at the caravan on the east coast with a bunch of my parents friends and family members we 're celebrating their th wedding anniversary it 's been quite a big deal , mums been planning it for months tomorrow we 're all going out for a three course fancy lunch , we 've all been instructed to wear our finest , my sister even had her hair done ! i'm not sleeping great at the moment i think it 's because my holiday is looming and i'm doing the typical rush of getting work sorted , worrying about getting all those holiday prep bits done i'm worrying about leaving my cats for goodness sake ! there is also lack of boy on my horizon sometimes they 're good for a distraction , a feel good , a sense that maybe someone out there will eventually be a good one i duno , feeling a little confused by it all my mind has been swarming full of wild thoughts , dreams and anxiety i have n't seen my councillor in a while due to holidays etc and i wo n't be seeing her for a few more weeks either right now i'm thinking i could do with a chat i'm feeling a lot of pressure right now pressure to find someone , pressure to get into a committed relationship , to have the wedding , the kids i feel like i'm not able to do that , as much as i want it all i just do n't think i can i feel like my circle is small , like really small i only really have my parents i keep thinking how much of an awful person i must be not to have a family of my own ok , today has been a down day this moment in time particularly bad i blame the booze i 've had drinks the last days ! it 's really not good for me how many times do i say this but i continue to drink ? ! i 've also eaten crap my body feels gross , i feel sick from all the indulgence and my mind is all over the place a few days ago i was feeling strong , i was channeling my inner beyonce and i felt good i felt great ! but right now i'm feeling really low , really on the brink , bleurgh i hate this i hate my fucking crazy mind i ca n't make sense of it at all i'm trying my hardest to , every single day feels like a losing battle today
