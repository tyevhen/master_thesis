first more of chapter is up on double billing if you have n't visited lately , please do chapter one has been voted out and replaced , the story is moving along so i'm finishing up a session with a patient today and he suddenly asks , what kind of psychiatrist are you ? the question caught me off guard as all sorts of things rushed through my head oh the usual kind of psychiatrist the kind who writes a blog what do you mean ? i asked i was n't sure what he was looking for like , oh you know , freudian , jungian like that i rambled a bit inarticulately , still not sure what the question was i told him where i did my residency if you 're a local psychiatrist that means a lot and i could get plugged into a neat little stereotype the patient is in car sales and does n't know about ideological difference between the different programs in our fine city i'm a general adult psychiatrist , i said i do n't see kids so there , something i'm not i'm still left with wondering what i am i'm not a psychoanalyst , and i do n't even know any jungians okay , i was babbling it was n't the first time if you listen to our podcasts , you know that really , i was trying to guess at the question , what did the patient really want to know , what was the wish , the fear , the concern here ? he 'd only seen one other psychiatrist , and only for a few visits i knew he did n't like her did he want reassurance that i was different ? he knew that already , after the first appointment he 'd commented about how different i was than dr evilshrink figuring dr evilshrink was his only frame of reference and woody allan , of course , i babbled some more dr evilshrink sees patients for medications and sends them to see other professionals for therapy i do both therapy and medication management then i recalled how patient was really not very interested in psychotherapy , or so he said talking was a chore and he just wanted to feel better not everyone has to talk , i take 'em as they come patient made an appointment and left i never did figure out what he was asking or what he wanted to know maybe he just wanted to hear me babble , so hopefully i obliged and roy , you 've inspired me to hit spellcheck i just do n't have proofreading in me it 's good i have you
