i finished my selected manuscript today and sent it to the publisher i can still hardly believe someone approached me to publish a book of my poems on the other hand , should i be surprised ? i 've worked hard on what lou rawls called the chitlin circuit , those middling journals who publish me while the august journals look down their collective noses i like to characterize those journals with the three 'p 's poetry , ploughshares and the paris review yet recently i noted that a journal in which i appeared , the alaska quarterly review , had an acceptance rate of or less then again , the only reason i appeared in that journal was because a guest editor somehow had read and liked my stuff and solicited me directly i pride myself on the fact that i filled as many pages as billy collins in that issue but without the favoritism of the editor , without the ad hominem knowledge she possessed of my work , i would n't have stood a chance thus serendipitous connections count more than talent in many respects this is old news to the cognoscenti my volume will have the simple title c e chaffin , selected poems and love poems , that is , unless , the publisher thinks i should change it for marketing purposes but that would be a mistake my name is the most marketable thing about me , for better or worse it 's my branding , and branding is everything in marketing think of beer and if you do n't think of budweiser , i 'll be surprised meanwhile after completing my ms and idea for a poem came to me , below , from the pov of a snail snails night is good for the slow , with our green gray skirts of suction we like smooth surfaces windows , painted wood , plastic and steel do you know how long it takes to near a promising plant ? bricks slow us down our mouths wo n't bite a human , out teeth are internalized to trim leaves with precision and no waste the poisons you throw at us only make us stronger as your philosopher said in the moonlight , our slick glistening behind us , we approach the worship of the green with an appreciation beyond your fondest religions we honor what we eat with feats of climbing , our weight balancing on tenuous stems not ruminants , our harvest must be fresher than hay and we always leave some behind , not like the locusts deer feed down to the nub indiscriminately they 'll savage every flower , especially roses i'm not saying we leave roses alone , but in general we leave more than enough for another bloom our cuts are n't fatal , we are not gluttons we feed with wisdom and it 's slow going our shells are little protection against you , unlike the birds when a human heaves us at a wall , we do n't recover and magically turn into slugs , our lesser brethren we die have pity on us have you never admired the spiral patterns of our shells , the beauty of our long necks with our eyes on slender stalks ? the delicacy of our approach ? if we were horses it would be different a belly walking gastropod cannot compete in sympathies with animals who have legs like you it 's more an honor to be eaten , steamed in butter and garlic in an oval of bread than wasted against a wall give and it shall be given we yield ourselves without complaint your garden will survive us ca n't we come to some slow compromise ? truly , the deer and our own cats have damaged my garden much more than snails this year a little pr for gastropods is not out of order i continue in great physical pain or if not great , significant i fear the pain medication i'm taking may be bad for my mood , so i walk a tight wire between physical pain and depression if i had no medicines for physical pain , i fear i might stay in bed the whole day given my nature , this is not probable , but my first hour after awakening is always a trial maybe if i had a protective shell and moved slowly at night i 'd do better kilorat , ce
