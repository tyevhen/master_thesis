virginia is a funny state they like their guns and they like their civil rights well , not for sex offenders who get to serve life terms in treatment facilities after their prison terms are finished , but that 's for another day if you 've been paying attention to the news , you know that former virginia state senator and gubernatorial candidate creigh deeds was stabbed in the chest and face by his year old son on tuesday after the altercation , the son died of a gun shot wound , at this point his death was believed to be a suicide the son was a student at william and mary college , one of virginia 's top institutions if that 's not upsetting enough , it seems that the late gus deeds was brought to the emergency room by police the day before for a psychiatric evaluation virginia has a law that a bed must be located within a few hours for some reason , possibly because no bed was available in that time frame , gus deeds was released it was a fatal mistake i 'd also like to send you to pete earley blog post to read his take on the case deeds' stabbing and suicide expose bed shortage but will anyone care tomorrow ? in what 's keeping people from mental health help , jennie coughlin and calvin trice write in newsleader com the process tucker said the vscb looks to about hospitals , as time allows , for patient placement when a psychiatric emergency occurs once there is an emergency , a step by step process kicks in tucker said that a magistrate can issue an emergency custody order , or an eco , if someone reports that a person is in crisis the state of virginia then requires that the person in crisis be able to talk to someone tucker called a pre admission screener , or pre screener for short the pre screener comes from the local csb he said that once an order is issued , the pre screener has four hours to find an institution with the possibility of a two hour extension if needed they ve got to have a specific plan before the magistrate can act , said david deering , the executive director of the vcsb during that period , only the pre screener has authority to stop the process if the pre screener determines that the person meets the statutory requirements for commitment , then he or she must find a facility willing to take the person the magistrate then can issue a temporary detaining order , or a tdo , allowing the person to be committed to the facility once placed , patients may qualify for state payment of up to four days of treatment , if they have no third party insurance the process is more difficult to execute than it used to be since there are fewer available beds , deering said the number of available site beds has been continuously going down across the commonwealth for year , he said people are getting out of the business , because it s a difficult and demanding business , and also the revenues to offset the costs are frequently not sufficient that s part of why you re seeing a declining number of beds so regardless of how dangerous someone is , there 's a ticking clock to finding a bed somewhere in the state of virginia what 's amazing is that they do it most of the time things have gotten faster since i last worked in an emergency room i believes this includes the transportation time from when the magistrate signs , the police find the patient , bring them to the er , register them to the er , get them seen , and locate a bed it 's a lot to cram into hours this policy is bad for several reasons first off , many people brought by the police for psychiatric evaluations in our state are let go there may be one professional in the er seeing patients , there may be many patients , there may be a situation that needs to be verified , consultation with other doctors to be had in maryland , two doctors must examine the patient to agree on commitment often spending a little time talking with the patient , bringing in family , setting up aftercare , letting drugs and alcohol wear off , clarifying if there was a real threat to begin with , getting medical clearance and labs back , a brain scan if needed , administering a medication these take a number of hours and sometimes actually roughly half the time enough bandaids are put on in the er to make it safe to send someone home but if a time clock is running , there is no time for bandaids and the patient is more likely staying which might not be bad , a hour period to assess , clarify , treat , may be a good starting point and the inpatient unit can always opt to discharge sooner if that time is n't needed but more beds will get filled with a running time clock the other issue is that there are n't enough beds , so people who may well be dangerous are sometimes let go tragically , this did not go well for the deeds family i had never heard of the hour beat the clock to make a medical decision do they have to do that with medical or surgical patients ? i know , i know , they are all there voluntarily , but actually , that may not be the case if they are refusing care and bleeding to death , or need care but wish to flee an accusation of a crime , came in while unconscious , or are objecting to life saving care because of the money even med surg patients may end up being held for hours longer than they 'd like and to je suis , note that viriginia pays for days of involuntary treatment okay , if you have n't please already , please do check out pete earley 's article
