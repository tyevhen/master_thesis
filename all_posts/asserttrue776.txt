i 've been involved in a number of performance tuning efforts over the years , and one thing i 've noticed over and over again is how hard it is to get anyone to notice a x speed increase i mentioned this to an acquaintance once , a programmer of great skill whose opinion i value he nodded and said matter of factly a twofold speedup is not a worthwhile performance gain i was struck by the finality of his statement in fact , i questioned it he challenged me back what 's something you do every day on the computer that takes a significant amount of time ? he quizzed me well , rotating a large image in photoshop takes a long time , i said bear in mind , this was in the early s , when most macs ran at mhz how long does that take ? john asked it can easily take seconds , i said okay , so if it took seconds , would it change your life ? i stopped and thought i could see where he was going he was right , of course reducing a second job to seconds , or even ten a speedup of more than four fold , would not materially affect my productivity or my quality of life i would still be spending way too much time babysitting the machine , waiting for it to finish a fairly simple operation my friend made the case that when people have to spend more than five seconds waiting for the machine to finish doing something , it becomes an issue he cited some research by hp ? i ca n't remember to the effect that if more than five seconds elapses with no visual indication of anything changing , most people start to worry that the machine might be locking up mind you , this was back when desktop computers were single tasking and most applications lacked a progress bar for lengthy operations photoshop was an exception you could n't switch contexts and go do something else in another open program you had to wait patiently and hope the operation finished normally on the mac , you had the spinning beachball cursor , which you hoped would eventually stop spinning sometimes it did n't i asked my friend what kind of performance improvement he considered worthwhile he said an order of magnitude i thought about it he was right the lengthy operations that drove me crazy on a regular basis tended to be under a minute in length anything longer than that meant taking a coffee break , and obviously , shortening a second operation to seconds would be a quality of life boon it would positively impact productivity , whereas shortening it to seconds would make little difference in the late s , i bought an aftermarket cpu upgrade for one of my macs it boosted overall processing speed by a factor of two and a half i hardly noticed my pagemaker file saves went from two minutes to one my photoshop image rotates that previously took seconds , took about the misery factor went down but i was still miserable so nowadays , when i hear someone like sun , with its zfs file system bragging about a speedup of this or that operation because of realtime compression or whatever , i just snicker in this business , a two fold speedup of nearly anything buys you months in moore time then you 're back where you started do n't delude yourself in very few cases will your life be changed by a two fold speedup of anything computer related if your business plan for a new technology is predicated on speed , and the promised performance boost is less than a factor of ten a full order of magnitude , rethink what you 're doing twice as fast is not a competitive advantage not by a long shot
