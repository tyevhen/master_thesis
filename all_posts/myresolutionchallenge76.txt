my life has taken an unexpected detour over the past couple of weeks in fact this detour is more of a sharp swerve around a hairpin bend on two wheels , however , as i m always up for a challenge , i am trying to take everything in my stride the house is in need of a damn good clean , and the ironing pile is so high i think i spotted a mountain goat teetering on the top as well as this , my inbox is bulging at its electronic seams my kids have been incredibly helpful and have occasionally thrown the vacuum around in a haphazard motion they have also flicked the yellow duster lightly over the furniture regardless of if it was wooden or not they are helping i must not complain ! doing anything at the moment is exhausting unfortunately , my brain is still ticking over at two hundred miles an hour frustration has set in and yet i am still able to find suitable ways to procrastinate i mentioned my inbox i won t embarrass myself by telling you how many emails i have in there , but i will tell you that kate was probably expecting baby number one when i last sorted my folders does anyone else break out in a cold sweat when they think about the overwhelming task of organising emails ? i potter around on facebook , i might add a pin or two to my pinterest account , and then i ll finish off with a quick twitter roundup , all of this i do on my laptop the email icon is right next to the internet icon on my home screen , yet i still fail to swish the mouse an inch to the left when i started to wake up in the middle of the night after dreaming about drowning in a sea of little white envelopes , i realised it might be time to set myself free it s time to organise my brain and dump all the overwhelming drainage that is bringing me down and now , invading my sleep armed with a large mug of tea and a hobnob no other biscuit is up to this challenge , i clicked the email icon and set about de cluttering my inbox it took me just over an hour to sort out my folders , respond to queries and file the emails appropriately by the end , i was feeling elated the relief that this task was behind me filled me with a huge sense of calm my shoulders returned to their original position instead of being up by my ears my jaw began to unclench and i started to feel that smug pride sweep over me i made a vow never to let my emails overload again i made another vow to organise one area of my life every day for the next month tomorrow i m starting on the cupboard under the sink i love my rock n roll lifestyle ! coping with email overload admit you have a problem ! allocate an hour to de clutter your inbox use the 'manage folders' tool and sort your mail appropriately it will make finding something so much easier set up an auto responder if this helps you can set it to tell the recipient that you will reply within a day week etc only check your messages once or twice and day and sort delegate them as soon as you can remember that feeling of smug pride and relaxed shoulders so you do n't get in such a mess again ! what s your favourite organisational tip to rid yourself of overloaded emails , or other day to day issues ? road image via wikapedia feet in bed image via frameangel at freedigitalphotos net
