okay , i 've truly lost it i 've just spent the last half hour on the phone calling a couple of pharmacies to find out the cost of antidepressants , all for shrink rap you see , as a doctor , i 've never learned what this stuff costs i know vaguely that the older stuff is cheap , and the latest greatest is expensive , sometimes really expensive i actually started my research yesterday i thought i 'd compare the prices at a local independent boutique pharmacist in a ritzy neighborhood where home delivery is offered , to a chain , to walmart or sams club with the assumption that walmart would be the cheapest though really , i'm not sure of this my quest was limited , however by the time i really sat down to do this , it was so late i was limited to hour pharmacies , so no walmart in the comparison with my gratitude to the pharmacists who humored me , here 's what i found the local independent pharmacy informed me that our system does n't allow us to look it up without a prescription huh ? i asked again several times , they could n't tell me what a medication cost okay cvs a large chain store i got a pleasant sales person on the phone similarly at walgreens pharmacists are generally nice people , i 've found so all prices are for pills , i aimed at the usual antidepressant doses a little bit of confusion around elavil amitryptiline , one of the older tricyclic antidepressants which i just about never use , but it 's cheap i asked about a mg dose and cvs told me it came as mg while walgreens said they had it as mg i only asked for a few prices at walgreens , mostly to see if there was variation there was zoloft , lexapro , and trazodone are scored pills , so if you take half the listed dose , this will last you two months many people , however , are on mg of zoloft , and since the largest pill is the mg tablet , double the price for high doses these are the cash prices , in us dollars , and i called pharmacies in maryland i tried to set this up as a table spreadsheet , but blogger ate that format paxil , mg generic paxil mg generic prozac , mg walgreens zoloft , mg generic zoloft , mg celexa , mg generic celexa , mg cymbalta , mg walgreens nortryptiltine , generic , mg lexapro , mg walgreens elavil , mg generic elavil , mg , , , , , , , , , , , walgreens trazodone , mg , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , wellbutrin xl , mg generic wellbutrin xl , mg walgreens from roy do n't forget about walmart 's list you can buy pills of any of these for , whether you have insurance or not in the hospital , we frequently choose meds for uninsured pts based on this list eg , prozac mg mo elavil , paxil , trazodone and doxepin are other choices for antidepressants
