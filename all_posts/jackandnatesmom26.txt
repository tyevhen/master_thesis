it doesn t matter how long you have been preparing yourself , how many times you have told yourself that it will be fine and you are prepared for what is to come , that you are doing what is best for your child when the time comes to confront your child s challenges yet again , it hurts i remember jack s kindergarten transition , how nervous i was , how concerned i was that he didn t have the services he needed he didn t and that he would struggle a lot because of it he did and now i know that relatively speaking , it was child s play that experience was merely the training wheels for now the training wheels are off , and i find myself having a very difficult time coping bottom line i want my son to go to kindergarten i know that he can t go not to traditional kindergarten but right now , i am mourning this loss even though i thought i had prepared myself i am angry , and i am devastated i am disappointed in myself , and all of the interventions and therapies that we have employed to help nate we couldn t get him there and god knows we tried i feel like a buzzer is going off buzz ! time s up ! early intervention time is over , time to move on you had your chance and you blew it that s not what it is , but right now , that s what it feels like it s hard to accept that these years of early intervention , these years that i was assured would be effective and i wouldn t even recognize my child in a year , were unable to get him where he needed to be my kid is obviously not the only one , and we are super lucky to have the options that we do , but honestly , that doesn t make it hurt any less i hurt for him , for what he doesn t even know he s missing i hurt for my husband , who would love to be able to coach a team for him and likely never will and yes , i feel sorry for myself i avoid moms who have kids nate s age , even friends who had babies at the same time i had nate , especially when their kids are with them it is so incredibly painful even if their child just interrupts a conversation mommy , can i have this ? i can t take it anymore it s so incredibly , beautifully normal these kiddos are going to go to kindergarten and my beautiful perfect son will not they will be getting on a bus of their peers for the first time my son has been taking a bus every single day since he was i ran into someone in the grocery store last week , her older son was in jack s preschool class when he was she has a daughter nate s age she was talking about the preschool , where her son continued to go , that her daughter is about to graduate from this weird feeling came over me it s like i forgot it existed i forgot that world kept going when we had to bow out nate never got to go to preschool i guess those other kids did why this didn t occur to me is beyond my comprehension we are living in an alternate universe over here we will be fine , i will be fine we will find a good program for nate none of those things are in question at this point i just need to go through the process of letting this happen of reacquainting myself yet again with what will be our normal i know that i would never want to subject nate to typical kindergarten it would be absolute torture for him at this point in his life but letting go of that dream , it s just really hard no one will ever know what it s like until they experience it see , there i go , trying to try to wrap a nice little bow around this post and end on a positive note you know what ? i m not gonna do it this sucks
