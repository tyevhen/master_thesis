erwin chargaff , working with sea urchin sperm in the s , observed that within double stranded dna , the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine a t and guanine equals cytosine g c , which we now know is the basis of complementarity in dna but chargaff later went on to observe the same thing in studies of single stranded dna , causing him to postulate that a t and g c more generally within as well as across strands of dna the more general postulation is known as chargaff 's second parity rule it says that a t and g c within a single strand of dna the second parity rule seemed to make sense , because there was and is no a priori reason to think that dna or rna , whether single stranded or double stranded , should contain more purines than pyrimidines nor vice versa all other factors being equal , nature should not favor one class of nucleotide over another therefore , across evolutionary times frames , one would expect purine and pyrimidine prevalences in nucleic acids to equalize what we instead find , if we look at real world dna and rna , is that individual strands seldom contain equal amounts of purines and pyrimidines szybalski was the first to note that viruses which usually contain single stranded nucleic acids often contain more purines than pyrimidines others have since verified what szybalski found , namely that in many organisms , dna is purine heavy on the sense strand of coding regions , such that messenger rna ends up richer in purines than pyrimidines this is called szybalski 's rule in a previous post , i presented evidence from analysis of the sequenced genomes of bacterial genera that szybalski 's rule not only is more often true than chargaff 's second parity rule , but in fact purine loading of coding region message strands occurs in direct proportion to the amount of a t or in inverse propoertion to the amount of g c in the genome at g c contents below about , dna becomes heavier and heavier with purines on the message strand at g c contents above , we find organisms in which the message strand is actually pyrimidine heavy instead of purine heavy i now present evidence that purine loading of message strands in proportion to a t content is a universal phenomenon , applying to a wide variety of eukaryotic higher life forms as well as bacteria according to chargaff 's second parity rule , all points on this graph should fall on a horizontal line at y instead , we see that chargaff 's rule is violated for all but a statistically insignificant subset of organisms pink orange points represent eukaryotic species dark green data points represent bacterial genera see text for discussion permission to reproduce this graph with attribution is granted to create the accompanying graph , i did frequency analysis of codons for eukaryotic life forms pink data points and prokaryotes dark green data points in order to derive prevalences of the four bases a , g , c , t in coding regions of dna eukaryotes that were studied included yeast , molds , protists , warm and cold blooded animals , flowering and non flowering plants , alga , and insects and crustaceans the complete list of organisms is shown in a table further below it can now be stated definitively that chargaff 's second parity rule is , in general , violated across all major forms of life not only that , it is violated in a regular fashion , such that purine loading of mrna increases with genome a t content significantly , some organisms with very low a t content high g c content actually have pyrimidine loaded mrna , but they are in a small minority purine loading is both common and extreme for about of organisms , the purine pyrimidine ratio is above for some organisms , the purine excess is more than , which is striking indeed why should purines migrate to one strand of dna while pyrimidines line up on the other strand ? one possibility is that it minimizes spontaneous self annealing of separated strands into secondary structures unrestrained kissing of intrastrand regions during transcription might lead to deleterious excisions , inversions , or other events poly purine runs would allow the formation of many loops but few stems in general , secondary structures would be rare the significance of purine loading remains to be elucidated but in the meantime , there can be no doubt that purine enrichment of message strands is indeed widespread and strongly correlates to genome a t content chargaff 's second parity rule is invalid , except in a trivial minority of cases the prokaryotic organisms used in this study were presented in a table previously the eukaryotic organisms are shown in the following table organism comment g c purine ratio chlorella variabilis strain nca endosymbiont of paramecium chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain cc cw mt unicellular alga micromonas pusilla strain ccmp unicellular alga ectocarpus siliculosus strain ec alga sporisorium reilianum srz smut fungus leishmania major strain friedlin protozoan oryza sativa japonica group rice takifugu rubripes torafugu fish aspergillus fumigatus strain a fungus sus scrofa pig pig drosophila melanogaster fruit fly brachypodium distachyon line bd grass selaginella moellendorffii spikemoss moss equus caballus horse horse pongo abelii sumatran orangutan orangutan homo sapiens human mus musculus house mouse strain mixed mouse tuber melanosporum perigord truffle strain mel truffle phaeodactylum tricornutum strain ccap diatom arthroderma benhamiae strain cbs fungus ornithorhynchus anatinus platypus platypus taeniopygia guttata zebra finch bird trypanosoma brucei treu sleeping sickness protozoan danio rerio zebrafish strain tuebingen fish gallus gallus chicken monodelphis domestica gray short tailed opossum opossum sorghum bicolor sorghum sorghum thalassiosira pseudonana strain ccmp diatom hyaloperonospora arabidopsis mildew daphnia pulex common water flea water flea physcomitrella patens subsp patens moss anolis carolinensis green anole lizard brassica rapa flowering plant fragaria vesca woodland strawberry strawberry amborella trichopoda flowering shrub citrullus lanatus var lanatus watermelon watermelon capsella rubella mustard family plant arabidopsis thaliana thale cress cress lotus japonicus lotus populus trichocarpa populus balsamifera subsp trichocarpa tree cucumis sativus cucumber cucumber caenorhabditis elegans strain bristol n worm vitis vinifera grape grape ciona intestinalis tunicate solanum lycopersicum tomato tomato theobroma cacao chocolate chocolate medicago truncatula barrel medic strain a flowering plant apis mellifera honey bee strain dh honey bee saccharomyces cerevisiae bakers yeast strain sc yeast acyrthosiphon pisum pea aphid strain lsr aphid debaryomyces hansenii strain cbs yeast pediculus humanus corporis human body louse strain usda louse schistosoma mansoni strain puerto rico trematode candida albicans strain wo yeast tetrapisispora phaffii cbs strain type cbs yeast paramecium tetraurelia strain d protist nucleomorph guillardia theta endosymbiont plasmodium falciparum d malaria parasite
