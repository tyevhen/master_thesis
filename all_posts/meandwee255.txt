hi friends ! just wanted to check in and say hello not too much new going on around here i found this cool mobile here the large version and it says it 's paper but the patterns look to be fabric glued onto paper ? and chris installed it in p 's playroom the whole thing swings in circles and it creates a cool effect of fluttering butterflies around the sky paige is busy reading about important topics and she 's been brushing up on her hygiene basics otherwise , we 've been busy with her occupational therapy and developmental therapy appointments it 's been raining almost every day which is causing us great cabin fever ! i'm looking forward to june and its stable weather all is well here and we are so grateful save
