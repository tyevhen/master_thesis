this poem was inspired by my wife 's visit to her sister in maine , one spring , told to me one morning at breakfast spring breaking by charles cot springtime freeze and thaw in the state of maine meant skating over black cracks in ice that moaned an eerie strain on the lake it followed my edges sometimes i d see green frozen bubbles think a leviathan had come to life , yawning hungry for me after all that time asleep on the lake i imagined loose chunks of ice would i fall headlong over these tombs to an icy grave ? i looked through the glaze and saw what was thawing the dreams of my lake life published in blueline , volume xviii ,
