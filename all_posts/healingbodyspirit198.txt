it has been several weeks since david returned from india , where he visited six cities the last was mumbai , and yes , he stayed in the elegant taj mahal hotel where a beautiful beaded water fountain flowed from a pool in the foyer to the roof top fortunately he came home before the terroist attack inside the hotel , but our heart goes out to those who lost their lives or were injured tis the season of peace on earth , good will to men , and we pray that it may be so sometimes we can have so little to do with what is going on in the world , but we can and do have peace in our home , and in our neighbrohoods and perhaps that is where it can begin with each of us
