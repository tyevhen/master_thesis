i'm still glowing in the aftermath of sunday 's marathon i'm recovering well my left calf is the most sore , causing me a slight hitch in my step , but otherwise i'm feeling really good i planned to swim today , but i rather enjoyed doing nothing for the first tuesday in an awful long time tuesday 's are usually my speed work day instead of running hard , i practiced napping hard it worked i think i took three naps today ! it was quite nice i will begin some active recovery tomorrow i have to get back at it , as i am running the new york city marathon in weeks on sunday , november th , i get to do it all over again i'm really looking forward to new york i 've only been there once in my life , and i 've never run the marathon there my mom is coming with me , and we 're staying for days financially it 's going to be a little tough for both of us , but it 's a once in a lifetime event , so we 're going for it i ca n't wait to trot through the streets of new york city with , other runners ! i expect it will be amazing !
