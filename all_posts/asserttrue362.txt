today marks a full year since i gave up alcohol and i'm glad i gave it up , because the risk reward ratio had long since deteriorated far past the point of being able to justify the continued , never ending expense , not only in terms of pocket money but in terms of mental and physical health it 's like when you continue to own that clapped out school graduation car beyond the point where it needs brakes and belts , beyond the point of needing shocks and a muffler and new rear speakers and a little body work , and wait a minute , why is the heat not coming on now ? i was getting so little benefit from alcohol compared to the down side no amount of beer gave me that elusive hey howya doin' social effusiveness , that tickly giddy reach up and touch the moon buzz i once got , way back when , exactly ? high school ? college ? heck , i had n't gotten a decent high from beer or any other alcoholic beverage in decades intoxication ? sure numbness ? lots clumsiness ? puffy nose ? eye baggage ? a beer belly ? i got a lot of things from beer but a buzz worth talking about ? i ca n't remember when that last happened let me tell you what i do remember i remember the many mornings waking up sideways on the bed two hours late , fully dressed in yesterday 's clothes , not recollecting having gone to bed i remember the beer cans , everywhere in the recycling bin on the floor atop the fridge in and next to the kitchen garbage on the water closet the back porch the kitchen sink my desk i remember the panicky midnight trips to the local mini mart to replenish my stock of bud ice which i had been sure , just two hours before , i had a plenty big supply of , on hand always hoping i would n't get pulled over yet always sure i could walk a better line , drunk , than the average person could , sober i remember the time i staggered into the back bedroom at one in the morning looking for a paper clip , i think it was and somehow i ended up on my back , on the carpet , with an office chair on my face , the plastic arm of the chair having neatly scraped away a half inch wide swath of epidermis from my forehead it was just a surface wound , but there was a ridiculous amount of blood from it i laughed at the preposterousness of the whole scene then i explained it away as a freak accident i could go on and on but i wo n't mind you , i had originaly planned a much longer post today on this subject , and i got about halfway through the writing of it before i found myself bored to tears i have a firm rule , which is i never write anything that bores me so i may or may not return to that piece later , when and if i think of something suitably upbeat to say about the whole thirty years of beer guzzling thing except , there 's nothing fun or glamorous or upbeat or profound about it i drank anywhere from two to twelve beers a day less in the beginning more as the years wore on for almost forty years the first ten years or so were sweet the second ten were tolerable the last twenty were stupid , and embarrassing , and overall hellishly unsatisfying i can honestly say i do n't miss alcohol i'm one of the lucky ones i never had withdrawal symptoms i did n't have , and still do n't have , cravings i can go out to eat and enjoy a non alcoholic beck 's with dinner and not wish it were the real thing i can be at a party and see other people happily trading sips of this or that merlot or shiraz and not give a rat 's rectum alcohol is for other people now it no longer interests me when i see people making jokes involving alcohol on twitter , i smile wistfully and nod , thinking yeah , i remember when it was like that it was fun for a while especially in the beginning first high best high it 's fun until it is n't and then it 's time to just move on
