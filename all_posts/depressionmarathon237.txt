i do n't know about you , but i hate losing an hour of sleep springing ahead every spring i feel like it takes me until fall to adapt to that lost hour it 's already late afternoon , too soon , and my body is confused sure it 's nice to stay sunny later in the day , but i'm a morning person i like seeing the sun when i get out of bed , too some states do n't bother changing their clocks i wish my state was one of them that being said , it is a beautiful , sunny , warmer day today we are finally climbing out of the deep freeze up here in the north i ran outside with jet and soaked in the warm , brilliant rays this morning unfortunately , that was about the only good thing that came out of my run today i was scheduled to go miles but barely made it , slowly , to six my legs were dead it 's okay , though the other four runs this week were quite good i'm not surprised my legs did n't respond today i challenged myself this week with a lot of faster miles i was on the treadmill for the previous four runs , and i generally pushed it i'm still taking walk breaks , but my pace has increased fairly dramatically , and my walk breaks have been fewer i even did some half mile repeats one day speed work ! how fun ! even yesterday , after working all day , i was motivated and energetic enough to get a quick miler done so the dead legs this morning actually made perfect sense i'm accepting it , looking forward to a rest day , and moving on one thing i'm struggling to accept , however , is my weight i do n't like feeling so heavy when i run i 've been working hard to monitor and control my intake , while exercising regularly and strenuously , for almost days now , and i 've only lost pounds i was hoping for a more dramatic response to my behavior changes i have pounds yet to lose , and at this rate , it will be racing season before i drop those last few pounds , if at all ! my jeans are fitting better , which is nice , but i'm still too self conscious to squeeze into my running attire i'm not giving up on the process it 's just taking a lot longer than i had hoped my mood remains good my life continues on its pleasantly boring track , just the way i like it i 've taken the opportunity to apply for a regular , benefited , physical therapy position , rather than working on call without benefits as i currently do , at a new senior facility i expect i will hear back from them soon , as i have the experience for which they are advertising it 's always exciting to pursue something new i 'll let you know if anything comes of my application spring forward and carry on , friends
