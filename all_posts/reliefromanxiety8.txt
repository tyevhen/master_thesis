ever since i started my blog , i have done a year in review basically where i look back at this past year this year has had some big periods of change back in january i was in my final year of university and president of my university 's mental health society at that time too , my mum got the news that they had found a kidney for her and that she was to go ahead for her second kidney transplant this was two days before my first exam ! it was a period of high stress for obvious reasons , but safe to say both mum and i made it through , even though we had to be miles apart during this time i continued to study for my exams throughout the year and as a result i graduated with first class honours in law i cried when i saw this result and so did mum ! i was so proud of myself and all of the hard work i put in graduation day was one of the best day i have experienced too now , i'm onto another course to help me advance in my career i got my second paid job over the summer , in a customer facing role which i am still in now , whilst i go through the process of my dream career soon to be revealed ! it 's not exactly where i want to be in terms of a job , but it is a process i must go through whilst i advance in my career it has broken down many anxiety barriers too , which i am grateful for my new job has allowed me to move into my first flat with my partner , which is an entirely new experience bills , council tax , food shopping , sharing a small space it 's all a learning experience , but i'm glad i made the decision as i wanted to be independent amongst other small achievements , family issues and mental health blips , it 's been a pretty good year as i grow older , the better i feel i can handle past life events it has n't been a year without depression and anxiety and other mental health issues , but it has n't been one of the most severe in terms of this either next year is full of uncertainty and that is why i am taking it one day at a time because if i think too far ahead , then my brain goes into meltdown ! i just want to end this post by wishing you all a lovely christmas and the best in your recovery mental health can be extremely tough at times , especially at this time of year , but please hold on to the mystery that is life and the wonderful things that can happen remember that you do have the strength to get through the hard times you 've survived every bad day yet i know these words may be fluffy , but i too have experienced the darkest depths and know that it 's possible to be on the road to recovery , so hold on ! what are your big moments of this year ? merry christmas and a happy new year ! amy xx
