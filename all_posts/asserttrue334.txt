in terms of basic twitter philosophy , understanding twitter as a medium , managing your followers , etc , jonha revesencio be sure to follow her has written the best article i 've ever seen on the subject , and it sums up a lot of what i 've found to be true , in far fewer and better words than i could ever sum it up be sure to read her post it 's the best introduction to this post how did i get that many followers ? people always want to know this the answer is really simple you do n't have to promote your account buy exposure , you do n't have to use one of the cheesy services that sends thousands of sock puppets phony users to your follower list and just to be clear i have never purchased any followers nor should anyone , ever the secret is this follow lots of other people but at the same time , be selective about who you follow if you follow a bunch of like minded people , anywhere from to will follow you back within hours try it follow people , wait hours , and see how many followed you back i use tweepi com for this , but there are other good tools as well if you 're not getting at least a followback rate , it could be that you 're following inactive users you want to follow people who tweet daily , not monthly , or your bio needs work , or your content is not appealing for one reason or another find out which it is , and fix it again , see jonha revesencio 's article link above with tweepi com , you can scan up to user bios in one web page , select just those people you want to follow , and click the mouse once to follow all of them the free version supports only tweeps per page i pay the a month fee to use the premium service , because it 's worth it if you 're starting from a small base , understand that twitter will limit the number of people you can follow to total , initially do n't bump up against this limit right away grow your list gradually as you grow your list to and beyond , twitter will gradually keep upping your daily follow limit eventually twitter will allow you to follow as many as , people a day which is a hard limit no exceptions twitter can and will lower your follow limit on a sliding basis based on the ratio between your followers and followees but unfortunately , they do n't make the algorithm public , so there 's no telling exactly when where twitter 's restrictions kick in a typical day in the twitterverse dec screenshot pm local who the heck are all these people ? ? for that , see tomorrow 's post the recipe once again follow a bunch of people every day make sure they 're the kind of people you want to interact with in my case , that would be writers , actors , comedians , filmmakers , journalists , and interesting funny smart people in the arts and sciences wait hours then unfollow any inglourious basterds who do n't follow back soon you 'll have more followers than you know what to do with at which point , you need to start managing followers in categorized lists but that 's another story how to know who to follow let me tell you from personal experience the wrong way to grow your list when i first got on twitter , i thought a good way to gain followers was to follow anyone with followback in their bio i discovered that certain users keep curated lists of such people i also found that some twitter personalities with large followings had have primarily followback types in their follower lists i started following those followers big mistake what happens is , you soon find that your follower list has grown , all right , but it 's full of bots , sock puppets , scam artists , people who tweet in japanese or some other language you do n't know , and sundry undesirables i 've long since removed such followers from my list although some creep back in , unsolicited , from time to time i also periodically cull people who have n't tweeted in , say , two months or more , to get rid of dead accounts which are legion , on twitter my strong advice is think long and hard about who you want to have as followers these are people you 'll interact with , read the tweets of , and share your insights with do you want your twitterstream to be a jumble of random i fed my cat just now messages and get rich quick ads ? would n't you prefer to follow , say , , pro and semi pro comedians , and have your twitterstream be full of hilarious , off the wall , often edifying but often twisted wisecracks , jokes , and personal takes on the day 's news ? if you 're a writer , would n't you like to know what other writers are doing ? if you 're a journalist , would n't you want to be plugged in to what other journalists are saying ? tip want to follow some funky people ? comedienne sue funke follows around a thousand sitcom writers , standup comedy types , sit down misery types , and miscellaneous interesting people you can explore her colorful followee list here some basic analytics i devote of my tweets per day according to twitonomy com to curated links another of my tweets are personal laments , observations , opinions , tourette like outbursts , etc the rest of my tweets are interactions shout outs , replies , reach outs , thank yous , follow friday recommendations the following stats are from twitonomy com and reflect the period feb to dec of my tweets get retweeted of my tweets get favorited just under , of my tweets got retweeted people retweeting me posted , individual retweets i was listed in , twitter lists comment when you have a lot of followers , you can tell right away whether a given tweet is engaging the majority of my tweets get retweeted when i tweet something , and five minutes later i see that no one has retweeted it , it means whatever i tweeted just bombed if i tweet a useful link , on the other hand , i can more or less count on seeing or retweets in five minutes the instantaneous feedback is immensely useful it 's helped me understand what works , what does n't , what people are expecting from me how to provide value follow friday there 's a tradition on twitter whereby people make follow recommendations on friday , using the ff hashtag friday is when you tell everyone else on twitter about that great , fantastic twitterer you discovered on tuesday or whenever every friday , about people mention me in ff tweets whenever someone ffs me , i thank the person in a tweet sometimes i thank them individually sometimes i gang thank them the net effect of the ffs is that i get free exposure to an extra , or so people each friday , because each person that mentions me in a ff tweet is exposing me to an average of , followers note that if you institute a policy of thanking people , in public , every time you get a ff mention , many people will start ff ing you every friday in expectation of the free mention give it to them soon enough , you 'll have a ton of free recurring publicity every friday tweets that get retweeted what kinds of things can you say that will get you retweeted ? just about anything , if you have enough followers but i suggest you avoid the obvious , avoid the irrelevant i just went to the bathroom , be authentic , be yourself , and add value if i tweet a news story , i check to be sure it 's the best version available believe it or not , sometimes the huffpost version is n't the best i try never to send people to sites that have popup windows of any kind if it 's a science story , i try to dig up the original paper if it 's not paywalled and post the url if the news item sounds rumorish paul is dead , i check it out first a lot of times , i just tweet silly nonsense thoughts that come into my head here are my top five most retweeted tweets of the past months the top one got rts april , , am let 's see if boston bomber is white , he 'll be mentally ill black , a criminal foreign student , terrorist mediaprofiling pickastereotype september , , pm my whole life , i 've never wanted to own a gun then i bought this dell laptop september , , pm ca n't decide which is worse , the fact that youtube lets people post public executions , or that they embed marriott ads in them first december , , pm this is the domino 's pizza delivery test drone , for real via richdownie http t co negvksk september , , pm caps lock does not make an idiotic point more valid not even with hashtags tweets most favorited november , , pm miss america https t co lvbztly august , , pm the stages of grief , as i understand them , are artist , writer , waiter , student , deadbeat , drunkard , corpse september , , pm just added not killing myself as a linkedin skill april , , am let 's see if boston bomber is white , he 'll be mentally ill black , a criminal foreign student , terrorist mediaprofiling pickastereotype september , , pm dear literary agent , i regret that i am unable to respond personally to your rejection note , which is not right for me at this time
