baby it s am , pitch black and cold i spoon against your body wishing there were no cotton to separate us , not even skin i want to crawl up your tunnel and hide deep in your belly before the sun exposes me let me re gestate , please maybe this time it will be better , maybe this time i won t end up clinging to you like an ice floe in the middle of the night , forty and terrified if you should wake and want to make love , i warn you i may stay inside forever published in crescent moon journal won first prize in a contest sponsored by desert moon review , jim corner and christopher t george , editors
