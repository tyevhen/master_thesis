photo by tal bright i want to base as many posts as possible on real questions from readers so the question box is open this posting is going straight to my sidebar as an ongoing conversation it is my question box , where anyone at anytime can ask me a question about anxiety or stress or anything related to mental health although i am not a physician , i will do my best to help you with whatever questions you have on the subject , or otherwise find someone who is better qualified to answer it for me maybe its medication related , or ways to reduce stress , you name it ask away i will respond here in the comments section but will also do posts on the topic if appropriate any topic is fine but i ll of course give priority to those that are on topic to this blog so fire away , i am looking forward to seeing what the reality of anxiety community comes up with note if you don t want your name blog to be linked to your question feel free to ask it anonymously please submit the questions in comments below enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like q a time to take or not to take , that is the question blog against abuse day what to do when feeling overwhelmed linkwithin
