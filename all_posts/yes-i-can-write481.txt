today , our guest for the week had to go home things are so much quieter without her ! drama seems to hang around her in an ever present cloud , so things are very rarely boring or restful when around her ! it 's official now everyone thinks knows i'm a hippie and teases me since hippies are amazingly cool though , i'm not exactly insulted i had an interesting discussion on marijuana , dealing , using , culture of use etc just a note , although i may be a hippie , i personally do n't do drugs of any sort i do find the culture surrounding drug use interesting , however we also ran around in the rain , dancing and singing , drawing on the wet car , eating edible plants , making flower chains , talking and , of course , getting very wet i'm sure we appeared to all passers by to be using some type of mind altering substance ! great fun this evening , i picked up my copy of the teenage liberation handbook and continued reading i find that whenever i start feeling hopeless , listless , and inadequate , reading grace llewellyn 's ever optimistic words always helps instill me with enthusiasm once again i will always keep that book close at hand for whenever i need a pick me up about education , or really , life in general i'm greatly looking forward to meeting her for myself this coming fall ! the news was interesting today there was a segment on musical education in elementary schools , and i found myself feeling sorry for all the poor kids trapped in school and even more interestingly , a segment on the clothing industry in quebec , and it 's problems with outsourcing to asian countries the more i know about our world culture , the more i think our entire system needs a complete overhaul i'm still searching for ways i can be instrumental in that oh , and i discovered an amazing artist today ! his name is josh woodward and he plays acoustic rock , and gives away all of his music for free yes , you read that right you can download mp 's of all his songs from his site for free , or buy the hard copy 's of his cd 's for anywhere between and , you choose pretty darn cool in my opinion his music really is awesome you can check him out at www joshwoodward com listening to today to lose the war , i want to break something beautiful , and josephine by josh woodward reading tlh again you might also like problems letter writing and grandma 's once again ! a trip to grandma 's , much conversation , and some good old tlh review of the teenage liberation handbook linkwithin
