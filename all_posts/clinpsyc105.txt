since the zyprexa trial is ongoing in alaska , i thought i should return to the wonderful world of zyprexa i encourage readers to follow the zyprexa coverage at furious seasons , pharmalot , and pharmagossip today , i will discuss the link between key opinion leaders and the marketing of zyprexa to preface , a coveted golden goblet nomination could be handed out to several individuals based on their involvement in zyprexa marketing in march , zyprexa received fda approval for treatment of manic episodes one document laid out the multipronged marketing maneuvers that lilly utilized to move zyprexa shortly after its approval some of the details of this document have been well covered in a terrific piece of investigative journalism at furious seasons this post will provide some coverage of the link between zyprexa and the key opinion leaders who helped popularize the drug across the nation once approved for bipolar disorder , lilly utilized several tactics to market zyprexa for bipolar disorder , including a satellite conference beamed to about physicians , and treatment team members in facilities the faculty providing this educational service included many of the big names in academic psychiatry , including paul keck , jan fawcett , hagop akiskal , and alan schatzberg alan schatzberg , you say ? yes , the same alan schatzberg who is set to become president of the american psychiatric association some have been less than pleased with his election as apa president , considering his background as a physician marketer , a key opinion leader with large conflicts of interest the same alan schatzberg who has been involved in marketing passing itself off as continuing medical education lilly also bankrolled dinner meetings , anticipated to draw physicians per sitting dr schatzberg was also listed as a speaker for such dinners one mental health service provider was impressed enough with receiving such excellent medical education that you can find it on his cv in the document outlining zypexa 's big marketing launch , paul keck 's name appears in the following contexts satellite symposium provider trainer of local speakers i believe this means he would train local physicians in various markets to then discuss zyprexa with their colleagues faculty for bipolar weekend symposia faculty for audio conferences faculty for a satellite cme workshop faculty for dissemination of bipolar information to , customers faculty on a closed symposium resulting in a cme newsletter and a cme audiotape , both of which were mailed to , individuals author of two journal supplement articles paul keck was also a member of a task force chartered by the american psychiatric association that served to revise the organization 's guidelines to provide a more favorable view of atypical antipsychotics including zyprexa in the treatment of bipolar disorder no conflict of interest there , eh ? keck said in a interview that often , keck said , patients with bipolar disorder require complex treatment regimens to manage all phases of their illness , creating a compliance challenge for patients and a management challenge for clinicians these studies suggest that physicians may be able to use olanzapine as a foundation to simplify patients treatment regimens , and the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine could be an effective treatment choice it is likely that keck was not performing all of his educational functions for lilly in exchange for lollipops he was likely receiving a healthy dose of cold , hard cash yet in the article , nothing is written about his financial links to lilly keck has also appeared in press releases saying nice things about symbyax fluoxetine olanzapine combination to be fair , keck has also stumped for pfizer 's geodon in press releases oh , and he also said nice things about abilify in a press release i suppose that if one is going to be a true key opinion leader , a real mover and shaker , one should be prepared to say nice things about whatever new drug is released , since each new drug naturally represents an important treatment option keck , like alan schatzberg and charles nemeroff , is also currently listed as a member of the clinical advisory board for neuroscience cme , a for profit entity awash in drug industry money dr daniel carlat has previously written that the educational content produced by this organization is biased , and i find that easy to believe it 's not hard to find examples of poorly done industry funded cme in fact , you might be interested in reading about a cme activity in which nemeroff seems to have pulled data out of thin air in sum , the usual fun and games were in play when zyprexa was initially being pushed for bipolar disorder some of the biggest names in psychiatry left their fingerprints all over the marketing of zyprexa and one of these key opinion leaders recently won the presidential election for the american psychiatric association i suppose , then , that american psychiatrists are generally either unaware of conflicts of interest or do n't care about them the beautiful thing about being a key opinion leader is that one 's name recognition is huge among psychiatrists , i bet that schatzberg 's name is better known than that of bill clinton , since schatzberg 's byline appears on journal supplements and cme so frequently that ca n't hurt when running for president of the national professional organization i will be very interested to see how schatzberg handles questions about conflicts of interest and drug industry influence on his profession do n't be expecting any major efforts at reform in the near future
