okay , i'm still talking about this tv show , the blog post is a response to comments on yesterday 's in treatment episode on sophie please , remember it 's fiction in maryland , the law is that mental health professionals must report any child abuse issues it does n't matter if it happened years ago , if it happened in another state , if the perpetrator is dead , this is either the law , or the attorney general 's interpretation of it , and it 's how mental health professionals operate okay , it can be silly , i'm not a detective , i'm just telling you law and on the information sheet i give patients , it has a line that says that there are laws regarding confidentiality and issues of child abuse the sophie issue is more clearcut this is recent sexual activity of an adult with a child and the adult continues to have contact with her and with other children no issue legally i wo n't comment on the therapeutic ramifications about trust , because , well , there 's no legal ambivalence here for those who are n't watching the show sophie lived with her gymnastics coach for a while , for months his wife was out of state , she cared for their child , had a relationship with coach , slept with him mentioned that before they had sex , everyone assumed they were , and after the session , paul calls her mother to ask her to come in throughout the session , sophie looks childlike and younger than her stated age i believe the tv folks did this on purpose here are my thoughts paul should have told sophie that he 's obligated to report this yup , given that she loves the coach , this probably would have ended the therapeutic relationship , but preserving the therapeutic relationship is not the most important thing in the world remember , this is the coach who picked her up from her last therapy session paul should not have called mom without discussing it with sophie do we believe this ? kid lives with coach , her parents allow this , his wife is away for months , everyone thinks they 've been having sex , which they do , and coach the pedophile criminal transport kid to therapy where she may snitch on him and get him locked up for years ? it would be interesting to see what sophie said when paul told her he had to report it next week , perhaps ? and i have wondered if the show is taking place in the dc suburbs i'm still thinking about my response to clinkshrink 's last post
