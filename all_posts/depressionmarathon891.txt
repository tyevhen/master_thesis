i 've now missed a week and a half of work due to this pneumonia i thought i 'd go back yesterday , but after showering and getting ready , i was having a hard time breathing and feeling lightheaded i called my doctor , and she asked me to come in turns out i still had a slight fever , and i was n't getting oxygen into my lower lungs we took a chest x ray , which was essentially normal , but my oxygen saturation the amount of oxygen in my blood was only i'm normally at percent my doctor had me do a nebulizer treatment and added another antibiotic to the one i'm already taking the nebulizer opened up my lungs , although it made me even more lightheaded , and i was able to breathe a lot better within a few hours i feel guilty about missing so much work i am the only pt at my rural facility , and it 's challenging for my boss to find a substitute when i'm gone i'm also concerned because i have a patient who is dying he 's a very special man who has grabbed a piece of my heart i want to spend some time with him before he dies i 'd be very sad if he passed before i could make it back to work i'm planning to return to work tomorrow i really hope i feel well enough to do so besides work , my life is suffering because of this damn pneumonia ! it 's been so cold that i have n't dared walk outside with puck both for his sake and mine i know my lungs could n't handle it , and i'm not sure about puck 's feet , either my inability to exercise has caused my weight to shoot upward i'm now heavier than i 've ever been , again it was only one month ago that i was shedding pounds ugh ! it 's going to take a lot of work to regain my fitness and my shape my house has also suffered it is a mess i'm going to try to work on that problem today i was able to do a couple loads of laundry yesterday that helped a little bit hopefully , i 'll find enough energy to do a little cleaning between naps today i know i 'll feel better if my house is in order the bottom line ? do n't get pneumonia ! seriously , i do feel better today i hope i am finally on the mend i 'd really like to get my life back !
