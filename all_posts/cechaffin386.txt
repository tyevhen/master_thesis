i recently opined that there were only two divisions in post modern poetry , beatniks vs academics there is another division that has occurred to me , which i think much more important , since it stretches across ages deductive poetry originates from within , based on internal projections on the page , imagined scenarios , monologues of imagination , twisting facts and experience to accord with its production shakespeare subjugates poetry to character , for instance coleridge makes up the rime internally and uses his experience only to fill it out eliot , for the most part , tries to establish a stand from which all else is gradually deduced strand , as well , creates an internal world of imagination for which the outer world is only employed to propel the poem and i , for the most part , also confess to being an deductive poet this means that the poet does not merely respond to reality , but establishes his own reality about which he arranges images and scenes of the world as ornaments , but not for definition inductive poetry rules the present age , and is based on real experiences recited in poetic form , whether pigeons resting on a statue or the experience of nearly being run over by a taxi inductive poetry builds from experience towards an emotional conclusion it does not establish an imaginative subject to be enlarged , rather submits itself to an experience to be described hence it inducts a poem from experience instead of using experience to support a subject determined by the poet 's internal projection i do not claim one form is better than the other clearly , the inductive poem rules the art today , and the deductive poem is in decline , often dismissed as rhetoric , as not having the juice of the apple in your teeth are you a deductive or inductive poet ? certainly i have written both types my first book of poems is more inductive than deductive yet i feel this is a dichotomy i have never read about and now seems obvious in this sketch my generalities are insufficient for the subject , why i naturally welcome comments on the idea thine , ce
