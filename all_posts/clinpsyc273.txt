not long ago , i invented the sarcastic golden goblet award as an honor for researchers whose conflicts of interest were of truly epic proportions peter rost has the story of an independent academic dr stephen freedland at duke university who , according to an internal astrazeneca document , gave marketing speeches for az 's cancer drug , casodex in speeches in one year rost estimates that he got , , for each speech i think the number could have been as low as , in some cases but at bare bones and this is unlikely minimum , it seems likely he pulled in at least k , and a more reasonable estimate is well past k , with a high estimate of over k apparently duke university medical center pays pretty poorly if this much moonlighting as a salesman is required to make ends meet i was less than shocked to also discover that dr freedland is a member of an advisory board for az i'm not an expert in cancer by any means and i do n't know much about freedland 's research and or clinical practice he may be the world 's best oncologist i do n't know but when an independent academic lends his academic stamp of approval via speeches for one drug times in one year , that 's worthy of a nomination for a golden goblet though still relatively early in his career , he 's got key opinion leader written all over him !
