i drew this today i thought it was really funny i showed it to boyfriend , and he looked at it for an awkwardly long time before looking up at me and making a sound that was too tainted with confusion to be considered laughter so i was like get it ? boyfriend no ? me it 's funny because those triangles only look fun to hang out with because i drew them that way boyfriend me i could have drawn mean triangles , but i drew happy , fun looking ones boyfriend yes you did me and that 's why it 's funny i'm sure not all triangles are fun to hang out with just the ones i made boyfriend what is wrong with you ? me i do n't get why you are having such a hard time with this ! triangles do n't have personalities i am projecting personalities onto the triangles ! and then i'm making a blanket generalization about all triangles based upon my own arbitrary projection ! boyfriend okay me no , you still do n't get it ! boyfriend i get it it 's just really weird me you do n't understand what a burden it is to have such an advanced sense of humor boyfriend i'm sorry it must be terrible me i bet this is exactly how beethoven felt boyfriend beethoven played the piano me i know that i was making an analogy someday i'm going to be a famous genius and you 're still going to be a hobo ! boyfriend still ? me yeah and i wo n't give you any money because you were such an asshole to me before i was a famous genius boyfriend well , in that case , can i make you some waffles or something ? me nope sorry too late i'm going to go draw more pictures that you are n't evolved enough to understand and then i drew these after about minutes , boyfriend was like what are you doing ? me drawing boyfriend what are you drawing ? me you would n't understand boyfriend maybe i would so then i showed the pictures to boyfriend and he was like the speed bump one is kind of funny i bet even beethoven did n't have to deal with this kind of adversity
