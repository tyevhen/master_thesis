it 's been raining for hours seven hours it 's cold , wet and gray outside unfortunately , it 's not much better inside i'm still feeling under the weather the virus which began with a sore throat last sunday has now settled in my chest i 've been trying to rest and take care of myself , but i ca n't seem to shake the fatigue with my next marathon only days away , i'm concerned in addition to the virus , i had major oral surgery on thursday after years my braces are finally off , and i had implant surgery for two missing teeth , the right canine and an upper left molar , about hours ago i'm not in a lot of pain , but my face is quite swollen the doc told me to lay low , so that 's what i 've been doing laying low , however , is not great for my mood in addition to the virus and the surgery , i also managed to pull a muscle in my back earlier this week of the three issues , my back is actually causing the most difficulty it hurts like hell , and i can hardly move without aggravating it dressing , laundry , and even putting on my shoes are painful and challenging so i'm moving very little fatigue , lying low , and forced rest combined with cold , wet , gray weather , has me feeling a bit off worry thoughts have been madly swirling in my head all week i'm a little anxious about having just finished my last tms treatment i'm worried about feeling sore , swollen , and congested one week before a marathon and i'm concerned about this lingering fatigue affecting everything from my running to my work to my mood it 's hard not to be worried and scared coming off such a horrendous depression relapse , but i 've got to do better i'm not helping myself by being anxious and impatient i 've got to get out of my head and work on my patience everything i'm experiencing is temporary the congestion will resolve , the swelling will subside , the muscle will heal , and the weather , for sure , will change it will all happen in its time i have to remember that i get in trouble when i want it all to happen right now trying to control things i ca n't control is not good for my mood either for the rest of today , i think i 'll work on acceptance and letting go
