it seems so strange now , in the evening when i'm feeling great , to remember how earlier in the day and especially before dawn when i woke up several times , i was hit and hit and hit by the agony of depression truly , it is almost hard to believe that i felt so bad right now the possibility of depression seems terribly remote why would i ever be depressed ? you would think , at the very least , that i could get rid of depression instantly , just because of all i know about it but the truth is i ca n't just turn it off this morning it still took work , and the dumb exercises , and absolute determination to ignore it and then , in a short while , it was gone again and all today , five minutes after i got up and got out to do some gardening , i felt fine there might have been a few left over tendrils of weak depression but i simply ignored it and concentrated on what i was doing and the depression just faded into nothing by the time i went for my swim one thing that may help is that the water in my pool is now only degrees , and in my barest of swim suits it is terrifying to jump in and swim for minutes i remember i even joked to myself this morning that maybe this was as good as a shock treatment for any left over depression lingering on during the night , whenever i woke up i used the yes , we have no bananas song as i walked to the bathroom and back to get back to sleep i used counting , , , over and over i keep wondering , like now when i'm feeling perfectly okay , how can i still get hit like that ? it ca n't be that agonizing how come i still take it seriously when depression hits me how do i still get sucked into believing that depression is some kind of reality ? well , it 's not entirely a belief it used to be a belief that depression was my reality and i simply succumbed to it and suffered for as long as it lasted but now there is some residual awareness that i am just depressed and some part of me can still carry on i do n't have to cave the feeling is that everything is hopeless and futile evidently this is the depressive syndrome that makes it all work but , in addition to the hopeless and futile syndrome , comes the little tag line i have made into a learned association that , thank goodness , always pops up at the same time any depression hits me but instead of thinking all this horribleness , i can just do the exercises , ca n't i ? maybe dumb exercises is not the best use of my brain , but it 's got to be better than using my brain to suffer depression i do make a stand against depression every single time in retrospect i realize i am encountering it , i realize that i feel hopeless and that everything is futile but there is something else i also realize that i can carry on i can actually suspend my depression to carry on a very pleasant chat with my husband then , when the chat is over , the depression returns but then i can do the exercises then i do the exercises , i get to work , i get interested in what i am doing and the depression always goes away in about twenty minutes lately i have two kinds of depression the five minute variety and the minute variety tonight , though , in retrospect , i wonder how i can still be so reduced to such agony tonight , i'm in such a great mood tonight , depression makes no sense why would i ever be depressed again ? tomorrow i will probably get hit again if i do i 'll try to write my blog while i'm depressed and see if i can discover anything helpful , a b curtiss
