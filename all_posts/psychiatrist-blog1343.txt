in psychiatry , we talk a lot about the treatment of mental illness sometimes we talk about the treatment of disordered behavior , but often that discussion falls into the realm of other specialists such as psychologists , social workers , or lay support people is that what i should call them ? members of self help groups , personal coaches , and others just to be clear , i'm talking about addictions and motivated behaviors people who ca n't stop doing what they 're doing and seem to be driven by something other than logic so the alcoholic who keeps drinking despite horrible repercussions , the smoker , the drug addict who keeps using when he 's lost so much , the over eating overweight person who grabs the next chocolate cupcake , the bulimic , the gambler , the internet sex addict , the pedophile , oh , name your addiction illness or choice ? the owners of such problems struggle , and often unsuccessfully this is what 's frustrating about treating disordered behavior we 're not very good at it it 's really hard to get people to just say no actually , almost no one just says no sometimes people seem to have their own epiphanies something clicks and they change sometimes they hit bottom and they turn around some people just live in their ditches so how hard is it to change behavior ? i think it depends on the person and on the addiction many people stop smoking for some it 's harder than for others the stats are that something like of people regain lost weight within years i do n't quite believe that , seems like i know people who 've lost weight and kept it off , though not most in the course of taking many psychiatric histories , i 've heard of many people who 've gained better control over a variety of behaviors the most desperate often seek help , sometimes more than once , sometimes in a variety of places here 's my caveat i'm not very good at getting people to change behaviors they do n't want to change i 've made some observations , i 've tried to change some of my own behaviors have you seen the chocolate ? , i 've watched lots of people struggle with big things and small things support helps a lot and accountability helps perhaps it 's essential meetings in days , the mantra of starting in a step program and having a sponsor , or a therapist , or a coach someone to be accountable to , helps are there things about a sponsor or therapist or doctor that increase the success of the person trying to change ? i believe at some level , the coach i just need a term here , let 's go for this one has to be someone the patient respects it helps if the coach is not judgmental , is optimistic , encouraging , and believes in the patient 's ability to meet their goal it helps if the patient wants to please the coach , but is n't so worried about a negative reaction that he the patient lies and says he 's meeting goals when he is n't if the coach is a forbidding character , the patient may simply never return frequency of accountability helps whether by checking in or by face to face having reasonable goals helps oh , i'm rambling you tell me what helps a patient change
