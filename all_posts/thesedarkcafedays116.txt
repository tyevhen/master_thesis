since i 've withdrawn from college after this spring semester , i 've mostly occupied my time with trying my hand at different art and craft projects i 've redecorate my room , painted furniture , scrapbooked half a decade of my life , brushed off my sewing machine from high school , build bookshelves , you name it i 've always enjoyed a good project and i 've been proud of how all my projects have turned out , but i ca n't seem to escape this gnawing need to do more , to have some goal i am working towards , some accomplishment i can contribute to the world this is a driving need i have felt most of my life it 's good to an extent in that it pushes me to work hard and to correct mistakes , but it also is somewhat torturous i ca n't seem to enjoy the things i 've made because i'm constantly thinking about what i need to do next that 's better i feel unsatisfied with myself i am never good enough and i even feel afraid to do things i love , like write , because i feel such an immense pressure for it to be perfect i was thinking a lot this weekend about my experience in religion over the years , and as my dissatisfaction with my work as an artist has culminated this evening , i realized that this drive towards perfection played a significant part in my religious experience as well as i helped with a church event this weekend , i reflected a lot on how alienated i feel from god this is a place i never really thought i would be in starting in sixth grade , i became very passionate about being a christian and having a relationship with god i read an memorized my bible and became very involved in my church , leading bible studies and teaching younger youth about the faith i went to a christian college , hoping to have my faith further nurtured always i was propelled by a drive to be a more virtuous person , to grow closer to god , to do what i knew was best i felt an immense pressure from within to pray enough , read my bible enough , identify shortcomings in my life , identify a lesson i could learn in each sermon , find a way to use my gifts to serve god sound familiar ? for years i have felt so frustrated with my inability to be disciplined enough to have a focused devotional time each day i ca n't seem to follow a schedule i set for myself every semester of college , i committed at the beginning to this time spend time each day reading my bible and then panicked and felt so ashamed of myself when i did n't follow through same with my commitments to be better about procrastinating on writing papers or keeping up with textbook reading i do n't have much of a point for this post , but i guess i wanted to process this realization because i think it may be a crucial one and maybe it 's a first step to accept that i can write something that has no point to it i 've always tried to figure out a purpose for things that happen or try to justify the way i spend my time or money , but i know it will be more freeing just to let go and enjoy the process of each thing otherwise i 'll always be holding back from doing things maybe it 's time to take a breath and tell myself it 's okay to just be not everything has to have a purpose some things can just be for enjoyment
