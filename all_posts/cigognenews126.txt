one of the great mysteries escapes most of us why is this child so anxious and out of control , so incapable of doing school work , and mostly hangs out with the wrong people ? gets in trouble all the time , several auto accidents , takes drugs and cannot be counted on recognize him ? he is you neighbor , the guy down the street or the person who works next to you he is unstable and cannot do anything , any project or task , for any length of time he is anxious and skittish and very unreliable he , and less often he , flits around and cannot be pinned down often leaves a trail of destruction everywhere he goes he can be charming on the surface but when it gets deeper he is a mess cannot keep a relationship for any length of time never count on him cause his word means nothing yet he had stable loving parents who blame themselves so what is wrong ? he suffers from ineffable damage so early as to be unimaginable his mind is a cesspool of inputs that drive him hither and yon what inputs ? the damage inflicted by an unsuspecting mother who drinks many cups of coffee a day , or is highly anxious , keeps on an unhealthy diet , drinks alcohol , etc each piece of damage is imprinted and sends its message through the system that there is impairment there it keeps the mind busy dealing with all that information , which is ultimately distracting and plays into add , attention deficit disorder it is like a phone operator sending the top level brain unending messages which overwhelm its possibilities for integration he is often labeled a psychopath because on the way in the womb towards life on the planet , his limbic feeling system has been damaged and he no long can feel for others nor empathize the imprint impairs the limbic feeling system from keeping feelings alive and expressive because it too is flooded with damage information it keeps him from being stable and being able to maintain a long term emotional relationship the damaged limbic system won t allow long term emotional commitment and the developing brain begins to lose its adaptability and plasticity in infancy so that the earlier damage cannot be changed any intervention to be effective at all must occur during the brain s most dynamic growth , just after a trauma occurs after that not much can change even with his parents , who soon learn that they have little influence on him or his emotions we may blame his parents as they may blame themselves but the damage is done before he was born , and they could even touch him he is behaving as though his parents made him suffer constantly , which they did , only inadvertently they certainly did not mean to but their own pain made them act in deleterious ways toward the baby taking drugs , or drinking or smoking and it happened during the critical period when the damage from an anxious mother , or one who smokes and drinks or fights with her spouse , is deeply embedded , inaccessible and practically irreversible the imprint therein lies the mystery an arcane memory lying in the antipodes of the mind out of reach and out of touch , so it is a mystery so we therapists have been taught to reassure our patient that it is not her fault relieving her of any blame but maybe it is maybe it is by default not in her control , at least not in her awareness it happened when the baby could not scream , or complain , just silent suffering which shows up in force later on when he can behave and he does do not try to control him because he is not in control , or rather , he is controlled by powerful forces sending out messages of constant pain it continues to drive him in every direction possible he cannot pay attention what do we do ? we drug him , not for what we think is wrong but to cool the imprint which has gone awry what is controlling him is far more powerful than any control by teachers or parents , who complain that he is out of control we drug his neuro biologic reactions to calm him down sometimes it works for a short time , but not for long my god ! what is the solution ? to attack the origins of it all i know of nothing else to do but to relive the trauma fully , as painful as it might be to relive in small feel able bits over many months that , for me , is the only solution otherwise , we have to keep pushing it back , an endless affair and we cannot just approach the imprint quickly we have to feel many other feel able memories first , and over months before we can approach the deep imprint there is where the deep pain lies , we have measured it in many ways , much higher blood pressure and heart rate and changes in brain frequency and amplitude that level of pain won t let us attack it directly we need to approach it with great caution if we don t we will get the effects of rebirthing greater damage and more irreversible pain this happens because we dredge up great pain which arises out of sequence and is overwhelming and can never be properly integrated the unconscious is no place for charlatans who decide they know to do and they don t
