today i put in a feature request for a new feature for the next dot release of adobe acrobat x what i requested is a white list black list of urls capability for web capture you may already know about acrobat 's incredibly useful control shift o open url functionality , which does just what you think it should it captures a web page as a pdf document the built in functionality is already plenty powerful it walks all the links in a web page and captures all linked to pages and their linked to pages , etc , however many levels deep you want , creating appropriate links and bookmarks inside the finished pdf document and you can specify stay on the same server if you want , to be sure the web capture session does n't inadvertently pull in content from a partner 's or competitor 's site , say which is all pretty neat i ran into a situation the other day , though , where i wanted to capture all the web content from a site , but i did n't want to pull down any content from urls containing javadoc it would have been neat if acrobat 's ctrl shft o feature had an advanced configuration dialog in which i could have specified certain urls which either must always white list or must not black list be followed in the course of a traversal neater still would be if you could supply white listed or black listed urls as regular expressions follow this pattern , do n't follow that pattern i do n't hold out much hope that this kind of feature will make it into a dot release , but i figured i would submit it anyway as they say , no squeaky , no greasy
