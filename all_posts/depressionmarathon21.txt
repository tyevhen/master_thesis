i'm happy to report things are going well here as a result , i do n't have much to report work has been a bit stressful , as we have some challenging patients right now , but i 've been managing i'm still paying for the extra hours , and extra stress , with increased fatigue , but i feel like i'm managing that fairly well , too i'm working hard to fit in my exercise i now have a routine of a few exercises , focused on increasing my core and leg strength , which i do daily they only take about minutes to do , but it 's still difficult to motivate myself to begin them after a long day at work so far , i 've been able to motivate , and i know that 's going to help me in the long run i'm still running on the alter g treadmill i'm up to running for minutes , but i'm a little frustrated i 've not been able to decrease the level of assistance i get from the treadmill i'm running at of my body weight if i try to increase that percentage , which decreases the buoyancy provided by the treadmill , my left leg does n't tolerate it that 's frustrating the left leg weakness is still there , but i think maybe , just maybe , my leg is getting stronger it 's hard to tell , but i think i'm seeing a few signs that my strength is improving it 's going to be long , long road back but as long as i keep moving in the direction of getting all the way back , i'm hopeful hope is a good thing i like hope when i'm suffering with low mood , my hope disappears that 's a horrible place to be i'm so happy to report i'm not there now i still feel well life is good
