back in the s , kansas passed a law that could prevent people with mental illness from voting the law was never used , but advocates were successful in getting an amendment passed that revoked that law this law was passed at a time when stigma against mental illness was much higher than now i'm guessing it was presumed that folks with a mental illness could not reason enough to exercise an informed vote , which is not true , of course if outta have a psychiatric illness , including anxiety , depression , and substance abuse , then there could have been a huge swath of disenfranchised voters and there already exists , to a degree , a basic cognitive test for voting navigating the whole ballot process in maryland , ours was electronic and no harder to use than an ipad , but i could still imaging some with severe dementia unable to navigate the system but there should never be a cognitive bar one must pass to vote the challenge would be where you draw the line
