winter sun the winter sun is weak , light without heat it doesn t warm the ravens or the gulls they sit on rocks , feathers over feet they accept the sun but still , summer pulls the sea lions are immune to such decrease their blubber warms them better than a fire while mice shiver in holes for a surcease from this icy sun they deem a liar sun should warm , sun should power the earth with juice splashed fields and a riot of grass but the winter sun spawns only a stillbirth why bears sleep in caves to let it pass still , a sterile globe is better than none the cruel disk is , after all , the sun i want to thank all of you who have shared my journey and , for the last three months , my deluge of formal verse after church yesterday i think i went down a notch i didn t know if i was ready to attend and i wasn t my mind keeps circling money for some reason you re , why don t you own a home ? you have no retirement plan your disability income could be cancelled in a new york minute if you managed your income better you could save for the future you don t even have life insurance for kathleen to be fair , it s not that i haven t tried i have been declared uninsurable as soon as they read i m a manic depressive whose father committed suicide , it s all over what will happen in a major illness ? kathleen may need a hip replacement , her hips have been so bad how are you going to pay for that without health insurance ? you should be giving more money to charity you re impractical and will never get a hand on reality no way your social security , if it s still available , will be enough to live on maybe you could get one of those cheap trailers in a mobile home park someday if you re lucky now some of these thoughts are wise and necessary what isn t is to have them circling in my head every time my mind is not occupied with something else in my natural , non depressed state , i don t worry about money in my depressed state i can t keep it out of my head and there s nothing to do about it now this is christmas month , after all i don t want to share more than one obsession a day so i ll quit here kathleen is suffering terribly from a degenerating disk in her back she spends most of her time in bed to relieve the pressure other than securing pain medicines for her , there s nothing i can do i know the disease oh so well but it doesn t help my mood to watch her suffering at kilorat , maybe more , i m confused that s a one on the mood scale for any who haven t read that portion of my blog concerning roger dier and for most people it would be more like a or my ratings are higher because of all the depressions i ve endured thine as ever , craig erick
