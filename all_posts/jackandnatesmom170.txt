i really really do n't need any help at all those of you who read my blog regularly are aware of just how much mommy guilt i walk around with on a day to day basis not enough , time , resources , money , etc i do make an effort to go to as many of the kids' school activities as possible i volunteered in the classroom during the year when i know for a fact some parents who do n't work outside of the house did not i went to every holiday party and even did the stinking craft at one of them i chaperoned the field trip i attended buzillion iep meetings i went to jack 's tea earlier this week and i went to nate 's school for the end of year party today problem is , the party is monday awesome i'm ok with it , and did n't beat myself up over getting dates mixed up life is crazy and this gave me a chance to really observe nate in class , he pays more attention that i was expecting , so that was nice to see the teacher and i had a little laugh over me being there , but they are happy for any parental involvement so i just stayed the smile on nate 's face when he saw me was priceless i stayed for the rest of his class and then walked him to his bus , which takes him to cisco center , as i had to go back to work like any working parent so why , pray tell , did the bus driver shame me ? you mean you 're not taking him home with you ? ? why not ? well , probably for the same reason your grandchild does n't ride on your bus route with you i'm thinking i get the feeling she thinks i am not very involved in nate 's life i mean my mom picks him up from the bus mondays and then cisco employees the rest of the week so she does n't see me but i am working and she has known that for awhile so why question it again ? the same thing has happened with the morning bus driver aide why does nate need to go to cisco center when you 're right here ? because i have a full time job i work out of the house sure you do wink wink , nudge nudge ummm , no really i do ! i recognize that i do not look the part of a working mom that is one of the perks of working from home i wear sweats , or jeans , my hair is in a ponytail that does not decrease the value of what i do or the demands i have made approximately phone calls today and authorized organ transplants some on very small children i have called and reassured families , ditto to impatient providers i have worked on palliative care for another person , and called countless others so there i do n't need anyone to call me out on the fact that i am not with my kids all of the time i am well aware of it , and most of the time i hate it we need the money in order to provide them with the care they deserve , oh , and that roof over their heads as well and i most certainly do not need to be shamed when i have taken my lunch break to come try to convince nathan to say more pops at school , but then have to return to work i do not need someone else to judge me i judge myself plenty thanks
