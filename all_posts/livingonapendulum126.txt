what makes people have aversions ? remember that show fear factor ? some days , like today actually , i would rather be sitting at that table , sharing that meal rather than go to work trust me that meal grosses me out , i am nauseous just looking at this video , yet i get just as nauseous with the idea of going to work is n't that awful ? is n't that just horrible ? i think so i do i very much do what makes work so difficult is all the negative people i have to deal with , either over the phone or in my work environment i do n't do strong emotions well i have an extreme aversion to strong emotions in others oppositional and confrontational situations make me sick physically sick i ca n't stand up for myself , i just feel like throwing up the fight or flight reaction gets enabled , and i do n't fight , i flight , but i ca n't flight it was n't always like this sure i used to get uncomfortable around strong emotions but not like this i definitely used to be a fighter , not the scardy cat in the corner afraid of my own shadow i could not only stand up for myself , but i could stand up for others and inspire them to stand up too what happened ? what the f happened ? ? ? ? you have to give it to me , to go to work , day after day , to face these types of situations day in day out , to get this stuff at home too that 's takes a lot of courage i have to give myself that some would not i also have always been ill in crowed situations , but now crowd is very few people , again i face that every day those therapies that make people face their aversions to cure them not working it just seems to get worst as time goes by i ca n't keep going like this , a solution must be found i figure the gerd , the constant heartburns , reflux , probably related to this what do i do , what do i do , i just don t know anymore well thanks for reading !
