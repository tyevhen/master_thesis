for over years , i have struggled with varying degrees of depression , anxiety , and an eating disorder each one of these problems is intertwined with the others in college , i got a little help for my eating disorder , but i didn t admit that i had a problem the bigger problem was that i didn t want to change anxiety runs in my family and i was aware of it at an early age i have always searched for ways to self soothe and calm my anxieties , but i didn t think i was worthy of any real help it was my struggle with a deep depression that eventually caused me to raise the white flag and in doing so , i began to recover from all three just like one of the steps of the step program for aa , admitting that there is a problem is the first step toward recovery from anything i did not admit that i had a real problem until about a year ago since then , i have made huge strides more like leaps and bounds i am really thankful that i made that first step i compare it to getting glasses i finally went to the eye doctor and i got glasses when i was a junior in college i admitted that i could not will myself to see better by just trying harder i admitted that i couldn t eat enough carrots to improve my vision on my own therefore , i made an appointment after i started wearing the glasses , i could not believe all the wonderful things i could see i could see definition in the tree branches , i could see the man on the moon , and i could see across campus and wave to my friends after i got used to wearing them , when i took them off , i could believe how blind i was everything was so blurry ! how could i have possibly lived that way for so many years ? how much have i missed because i couldn t see clearly ? why did i put off going to the doctor for so long ? why didn t i get glasses ten years ago ? i wanted to return to europe and revisit all the cathedrals and museums i had visited in the semester before i shudder at the thought of all the beautiful artwork i missed in a way , that is what it was like when i finally asked for help for my depression i finally admitted that i couldn t do it on my own i admitted that i could not will myself out of my depression i admitted that i needed to get help after i started seeing a counselor and taking medicine , i could not believe how much better i started to feel i could see beauty in my life again i could see a life worth living and a purpose to fulfill not at first , but eventually , i started to become less depressed after almost a year of receiving treatment , i cannot believe the difference i can see how could i have possibly lived that way for so long ? why didn t i get help ten years ago ? i wanted to re live the last ten years of my life again because of all the things i might have missed but honestly , i wasn t ready to do it two years ago , let alone , ten years ago i have to remember that everything that happened in the past has shaped me into the person i am today i cannot dwell on the past or worry about the future i can only make decisions for the present instead of glasses , i wear contacts now every morning when i put them in my eyes , i am reminded of the past and i say a prayer i say a prayer of thanksgiving in one eye , i thank god that he has given me this wonderful gift of sight in the other eye , i thank him for the gift of insight i realize now that my life has value because i am a human being , not because i say it has value i am created in the image and likeness of god , just like every other human being in the world my life is beautiful , and i am worthy and deserving because he created me i am worthy and deserving of getting help and trying to recover from these illnesses
