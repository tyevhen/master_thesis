post traumatic stress disorder from kate white treating anxiety blog on the basics of treating anxiety disorders commonly question about the basics of treating anxiety disorders question does my father abuse us ? hi i ll try to type out my situation unbiased and as accurate as possible , sorry if it s a little long i decided to go out of state to college i m years old i m independent i have a job , i help around the house , and try to be as nice as possible i know i m not perfect , but i know i m a decent kid no drugs or alcohol or major trouble ever i received a decent amount of scholarships and grants so price isn t a huge issue however , my father has a huge problem with me leaving i think it s because he feels abandoned , because he lives alone away from me and my sister he couldn t approach his concerns reasonably or calmly instead he would send me and my mom emails about how much i m messing up my life , with threats to take her to court if she signs for my loans , he called me a stupid punk , a pig , told me to f ck off , and today , topped it off with saying he doesn t love us anymore this has been going on for months , and all my life he s been so mean to my mom , cursing at her and calling her names i know he has ruined her life she is so depressed every time i would see him , it would turn into a huge fight with him yelling at me and i ll admit , me yelling back i did not hold back anything i told him that he is controlling and mean and full of himself and that he s turned me against him , that i want nothing to do with him but he claims this is normal for families he swears that all dads insult their daughters and get into huge fights he says my mom is an idiot and has forced me and my sister to turn against him , and that he has done nothing and that everyone attacks him he calls her a stupid puerto rican , a stupid civil servant because she is a teacher , and says she can t support us and is a failure i remember as a little girl , they would get into a huge arguments and he would throw food and call her names my old therapist said this developed my eating disorder , anxiety , and depression that i ve dealt with for years i know i m not the nicest person to him i say what s on my mind because i just can t take it anymore i tried to give him a chance by going on vacation with him this summer , but i just can t he s so hard to deal with these are only the basics and it would take me years to type out everything but does this sound like emotional abuse ? he s only been physical when he punches walls and throws things , once he slapped my mother only once though does anyone know what i can do he blames me for everything and inside i believe that this is all my fault , he says i need help and that i treat him bad and don t love him i love him , but i hate him as a person thank you answer i personally think you expressed yourself as well as the situation you re in thoroughly you should of course continue your education no matter what it seems as if you re a bright girl and you have several great opportunities to go to a great college however , the relationship you have with your father is a stressful one and perhaps it would be best to have a somewhat deep conversation with your mother especially since he wants to bring legal matters into your school situation i personally would hold off on a vacation with someone like your father , it only seems like a disaster waiting to happen try to continue calling him often , but keep it short he definitely has caused years of abuse on your family it s touching how much you care and the effort your struggling with , but there needs to be a point in your life where if he never changes or gets the help he needs for his anger you need to either walk away or just tough it out every time you two come in contact with each other overall just realize that you did your best to try and keep in touch and show that you care , but if it s never acknowledged or appreciated there s not much more you can do
