hi ab i tried posting to your blog under the comment section , but it takes me to a page that asks if i want to be a blogger anyway , here 's a response to taking our space yes you did publish the second paragraph some time ago we had a discussion about fear i posed a question wondering about where my fear had come from i indicated that my parents were gentle people and yet somehow i was always fearful of most things starting in grade one and on into grade seven , it was like i had 'come bully me' stamped on my forehead by then , i had had enough it took only once of standing up for myself and people did n't bother me again taking my place space has taken a very long time i always thought that depression was my main problem but using the techniques and gathered wisdom from your books i 've had new insight green frog has allowed me to drop the stress level so much that i was able to see i was struggling with something beyond depression i ca n't say specifically how it all fell into place a continuous focus and confrontation of my fears was part of it i have become more socially at ease it the social unease , still gets away from me every once in a while , but a quick refocus at the moment , usually helps that it is a very good feeling to be able to walk into a room full of people and be able to watch the room , engage with people , and not be overwhelmed with a feeling of wanting to run away thanks again for writing your books it has become so obvious to me with the help of your books that i can change my life without medication just taking that first step to break the cycle of depression is so important thanks , a dear a , thanks so much for your letter i m sure it will inspire others to risk the fear of taking their space a b curtiss
