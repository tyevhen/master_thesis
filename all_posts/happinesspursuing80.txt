my interview yesterday went pretty well i wasn t really even that nervous although i have to admit that i knocked back a healthy slug of bourbon when my palms started sweating about thirty minutes beforehand maybe not the best option but it did help my wife gets impatient with my fear of interviewing people it s something that i have to do professionally and so far i ve wound up friends and mutual admirers with the every subject but i still become a basket case before each one the worst part about all of this silliness is that , though it s virtually required for my job , these interviews are never assigned i have to seek them out i hated dating in my life i ve probably only asked two or three women out sometime in my twentieth year i decided that that would be quite enough of that nonsense and i haven t asked anyone for a date since i got set up a few times but that always sucked eventually i met my wife and that part of my life has been without want since i ve been very lucky there my point is i hate social situations i always have my sister and i used to call ourselves socially awkward then a counselor put a formal name to it for me social anxiety and it is this social anxiety , she told me , that causes my depression so , you see , interviews are tough for me setting up interviews is ten times worse it feels like asking for a date i am so grateful for email ! the funny thing is that once the interviews have started i become very comfortable because i m fluent in the subject matter and it always becomes a very easy conversation no matter how much i tell myself that this will happen , i m still a nervous wreck but i survived yesterday and got that out of the way just in time i m trying to get another interview for saturday so now i ve got plenty of time to get unreasonably worked up about that
