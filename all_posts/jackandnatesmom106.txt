nathan so we all want him to talk right ? i know that any type of communication is a positive thing , especially at this point , but i selfishly continue to want this communication to be speech i am picky i received an email yesterday from nate s speech therapist at school that really upset me i don t think that it technically should have , but as our marriage counselor says , there s really no reason to should all over myself , i feel what i feel anyway , it was a fairly routine correspondence , nate s next set of evaluations and iep meeting are coming up oh goody and she was requesting permission to have an assistive technology evaluation done basically , the school would provide him , if it is determined to be necessary , with a type of computer device to assist with communication i know that for many people this type of assistance doesn t just fall into their laps like this although truly we have done a ton of work to get to this point i should be and am grateful for all of the help we receive i will take anything they are willing to give him i try to keep in mind that it is much easier to keep services that are given when a child is small than it is to obtain them as the child gets older jack is a prime example of that so what the heck is my problem ? this email made me cry well duh , it s just another step another step towards accepting that nate may not talk now , in my response to the speech therapist , i broached the subject of still working on actual speech and she stated that using this device in no way means that they we will not keep working on speech , and that this would hopefully actually be a bridge to him speaking but i know he has little friends with autism , the same age and older they are not whipping this device out for them just my nate and i refuse to accept it not the device itself but the possibility of no speech i think that i will likely consult the advocate we used with jack last year , who is wonderful , not because i think that nate is being denied services that he needs , but because i want to make sure all of the bases are covered it s worth the small investment to have that peace of mind this revelation has kicked me into high gear maybe i needed it , who knows i feel like i am working hard , but there is always something i m forgetting for the past two years i have wanted nathan in private speech therapy we have been unable to do it our insurance covers visits a year of pt ot and speech combined , and i have chosen to make his severe sensory issues the priority as i really do think that they interfere with his ability to do the work that speech therapy requires he is just too distracted but enough i am tired of allowing these restrictions drive my son s therapies he is not getting all that he needs and i plan to change that i am calling a private speech therapist in the morning i am getting an evaluation we should have enough visits left after his once a week ot visits to cover at least two months of speech this year , and we will have to make that work in terms of next year , i am looking into enrolling the boys in both my and john s insurance plans so they have dual coverage i have never used my benefits because of the sky high deductible , but if there is dual coverage , the other plan will take care of that and my coverage , i discovered today , allows for ot pt visits per year and speech visits per year that would be just wonderful , but i still have to figure out the monthly costs once our open enrollment information for next year is available but at least i have a plan , and that feels good this boy will talk , i know he wants to and i know that he can
