as a psychotherapist in nyc who works with individual adults and couples , one of the most common complaints i hear from people in relationships is that they feel unappreciated by their spouses or partners they talk about how they feel taken for granted because their partners do n't express their gratitude for the many big and little things they do this occurs in many relationships , especially long term relationships it 's easy to take your spouse for granted over time it 's easy to see how this can occur over time when we 're dating , we 're on our best behavior the relationship is new and exciting we 're learning new things all the time about the other person we 're more likely , at that point , to express gratitude and appreciation relationships the importance of expressing gratitude to your spouse it 's easy to take your spouse for granted over time but as time goes on and we settle into a long term relationship and our lives become somewhat more routine , we often forget the kindness and gratitude we expressed early on often , it 's not even that we do n't feel grateful it 's more that we forget to say it do n't assume that your spouse knows how you feel during couples counseling , when one of the people in the relationship raises this issue , the other person will usually say , of course , i'm grateful for everything she does but why do i need to say it ? she should know take the time to express and show your gratitude to your spouse and , while it 's true that the partner might know on some level , it 's important to actually say it we usually express gratitude to other people in our lives the importance of expressing gratitude to your spouse take the time to express and show your gratitude why would n't we express gratitude to the person we care about most ? it takes so little time and effort to let our loved ones know that who they are to us and the things they do are meaningful to us taking this time to express gratitude can make such a difference to your spouse and to the well being of your relationship i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr therapist , and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individuals and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or send me an email josephineolivia aol com photo credit subnet via photopin cc photo credit emery co photo via photopin cc
