hi friends ! it 's finally starting to seem like spring around these parts ! phew ! it was getting depressing all the cold and darkness and snow and whatnot i'm now staring at some budding trees and a blue sky jiggety jig ! i 've been fielding questions as of late the when are you going to have another kid question to be exact i wish i had a firm answer i just have no idea i get pangs now and again the pang that says that babies are so cute and cuddly and warm then i get another pang that reminds me of the work , the elusive sleep , the commitment not that i'm not already committed , but you know what i mean two is more than one and all that jazz the truth is , a big part of me is terrified to go into trying to have another baby i mean , paige was our fifth pregnancy i spent the first trimester in terror and fear i spent every day shaking , sweating , nearly crying and i thought i could never go through that daily fear again i was so grateful to be pregnant , but so terrified of something going wrong i barely slept and did n't really relax until about my th month it did n't help that i bled alot from a hematoma in there early on nothing like bleeding to calm a pregnant woman 's nerves anyway , it was a lot to go through and i'm not exactly chomping at the bit to go through all that again i wo n't even go into all the feelings i have with all the time and energy that little p needs right now as we learn about what we can do to help her developmentally a baby thrown in the mix would certainly add another level of chaos i wonder what if i have another loss ? and another ? can i really go through it again ? deep down , i know the answer is a resounding yes paige has proven to me that every scary step is well worth it paige , when she was an angel , tried many times to get to me her future body was just having a hard time forming and when it finally did , she came to be with us and we will forever be linked as mama and daughter how can i not give her a brother or sister to romp with here on earth ? another angel waiting in the wings for an earthly body i'm scared , but i know i can do it i may not know our next angel personally yet , but i know i love him or her and want to give them a home to come to soon , dear angel soon please know that i will try my best but i have no control that i am scared that it may take a while that i just need a little more bravery to come my way in the meantime , i hope you are enjoying your heavenly garden in all its splendor save you might also like workin' for a livin' before and now the freak out linkwithin
