i was reading the newspaper this morning and stumbled on the story of a young boy , who suffered cardiac arrest while playing a game he loved family , friends and teammates are grieving after a year old richmond teen suffered cardiac arrest at a minor hockey game sunday night and died several hours later this comment from a paramedic struck me in the article paramedics say sometimes young people don t pay attention to symptoms the way older adults do , writing them off as stress , athletic strain or even just too much cola or energy drinks i do n't agree with that statement i think that as a society , we do n't tend to think that children can be seriously ill i have witnessed numerous times children complaining about some symptoms that could be construed as something quite serious , only to be brushed off by the adults around them i may have been guilty of that once or twice , maybe more myself i saw a child complain of chest pain , of blurred vision , severe headaches , difficulty walking sudden and these symptoms have been ignored another child was complaining of tummy aches , turned out she had twisted bowels another child complained of nausea , and turned out to have hn initially these kids complaints were ignored many of these symptoms , if mentioned by an adult would have that adult rushed to the emergency , but a child ? sure it 's nothing , let 's not bother , they will feel better tomorrow kids learn to dismiss many of their symptoms because the people around them have taught them to dismiss their symptoms a kids tells his mom , he is out of breath , mom says honey it 's normal , you are active maybe it 's not normal , maybe it 's a sign of cardiac problems kids can have health problems too kids can die , just like older people can do n't take for granted that because they are young , they are fine get them checked out thanks for reading you might also like parenting tricks what is worst than one depressed person ? keeping myself busy linkwithin
