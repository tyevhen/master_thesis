rest assured , you 're not alone procrastination is a common psychological defense to avoid dealing with certain tasks , people , or situations i'm sure that we can all think of many examples , whether they 're related to ourselves or to someone that we know waiting until christmas eve to go christmas shopping , putting off doing taxes until april th , receiving credit card bills and shoving them in a drawer and not paying until after the due date , avoiding having an important discussion with a spouse or partner , putting off going to the dentist , and so on what is procrastination ? in our rational minds , we know that avoiding the unpleasant task will only make it worse but , somehow , we trick ourselves into believing otherwise i'm too tired to do that now i 'll do it tomorrow or this can wait until after i watch my favorite tv show or i'm hungry let me me have something to eat first all the while , there 's that wise part of us that is urging us to go ahead and take care of whatever needs to be done but how often we ignore that wise part usually to our detriment how to overcome procrastination so what can we do about this ?

but if you think about it for a moment , you 'll realize that it 's not unusual for all of us to have mixed and competing feelings about many situations where we have to make decisions about what to do usually , we 'll weigh the pros and cons in our minds to come up with a decision when we make decisions that are not good for us , we usually know on some level because the wise part of us is gentling nudging us to take another course of action but how easy it is to ignore that wise part so , i'm suggesting that , rather than giving in to those well meaning parts that urge us to avoid , invite them to step back and take a vacation in your mind 's eye , send them to tahiti for a much needed rest and while they 're sunning themselves on the beach and having pina coladas , allow the wise part of yourself to have a stronger voice in your decisions the well meaning parts will be back soon enough to challenge the wise part and you might need to send them on another vacation for a while in the meantime , listening to the wise part of yourself , take a large task and break it down into smaller , more manageable subtasks write it down be specific now , talk to a friend about the task and make a commitment to your friend as to when you will complete each of these subtasks ask him or her to write it down overcoming procrastination make a commitment now , a word about how to choose the person who will be holding you accountable choose someone who will be supportive but firm do n't choose your friend who is very nice but who wo n't challenge you a little if you need it also , do n't choose someone who will be a nazi about it either extreme is n't good once you 've chosen a friend , offer to help your friend with something that he or she might be avoiding plan in advance when you and your friend will have your check in session by phone or in person to talk about how you fared in terms of completing the subtasks also , plan to give yourself a small reward for each subtask that you complete if you do n't complete the subtask , no reward if you do n't complete the subtask or if you completed part of it but not all of it , do n't berate yourself or give up just make a new agreement with your friend and stick with it often , starting is the hardest part , so once you 're on a roll , you may find yourself on an upward spiral , creating new and healthy habits by tackling situations that you used to avoid when procrastination is a sign of deeper issues sometimes , procrastination is not just avoidance but a sign of more complex problems like depression or anxiety getting help if you follow the tips offered above , but you find that you continue to have an ingrained and persistent pattern of procrastination with detrimental consequences in your personal or work life , you could benefit from dealing with these issues with a licensed mental health professional to understand and work through them i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , please visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com also see my article overcoming procrastination and the need for certainty in an uncertain world
