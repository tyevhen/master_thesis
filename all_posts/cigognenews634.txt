there is an article in today s paper about a dj who overdosed and died many different kinds of painkillers were found in his system it seems like a repetitious story everyday brings another article about painkillers and overdose this is to say nothing about michael jackson so what is it ? why so much drugs ? let s first ask , why so much pain ? no one takes painkillers who is not in pain it may be done unconsciously but pain is there , nevertheless so who or what put it there ? and what can we do about it ? having treated any number of addicts to all kinds of drugs let me state at the outset that the heaviest load of pain behind addiction is set down during what i call first line that is , during gestation , birth and the first weeks afterwards these are largely irreversible pains that are often a matter of life and death but that is not the whole story then comes a childhood without being touched , the number one index of unloved added to that neglect , indifference , not listening and not caring those are the ingredients of pain not show business , not agents and producers , not the business the question is , what drives individuals with such ferocity and determination to show business to be well known and famous ? the pain why else the need to be applauded , appreciated by thousands ? it should be enough to be loved by a partner , not a thousand of them but that need is deadly , early and unfulfilled the rest is an act out but even that is not enough hence the pills and painkillers that does not mean that acting is a neurotic endeavor it does mean that those who seek it out are often the unloved and uncared for it is such a tough business full of constant rejection it requires the drive to succeed and those driven are often driven to feel loved one actor i treated would become depressed when not on scene and deeply depressed when not at work he came alive on set , when he was someone else i will be anything or anyone i have to be in order to feel loved , he found having treated a number of actors i can attest to the fact of their pain but again i may be treating a special group of the unloved the common thread of many of them is narcissism everything is related to them and what happened to them any story eventually redounds to their lives they cannot give because they are too busy getting they cannot relate to other s needs and pain because they are too busy trying to ease their own even with all the success there is the need for drugs all in the service of the cover up there is a saying that politicians are ugly actors what is true is that they are also in show business they too act out their needs they rarely come to therapy because they are in the struggle , to feel loved they do not put themselves and their lives in question whatever goes wrong is their fault when we do measurements of pain we find that the very early pains are always high on the measurements of brainwaves , vital functions and biochemistry it is therefore not a guess as to what causes problems later on yes , later circumstances do exacerbate matters but rarely cause them when in a business where almost everyone is desperately trying to get their needs fulfilled , there is bound to be cheating and deception the exception is the exception it is my experience that no one who was loved early on is desperate for fame they want success , often as a result of effort it is not other s opinion that is primary it is their own , because they count
