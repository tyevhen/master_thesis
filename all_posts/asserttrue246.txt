for some time now , i 've been puzzling over a fairly big riddle , and i think an answer is becoming clear the riddle is why , in so many organisms , do codons turn up at a rate approximately equal to the rate of usage of reverse complement codons ? take a good look at the symmetry of the following graph of codon usage rates in frankia alni , a bacterium that causes nitrogen fixing nodules to appear on the roots of alder plants codon usage in frankia alni notice that a given codon 's usage corresponds , roughly , to the rate of usage of the corresponding reverse complement codon this graph of codon freequencies in f alni shows the strange correspondence which i 've commented on before between codons and their reverse complements if ggc occurs at a high frequency which it does , in this organism 's protein coding genes , the reverse complement codon gcc is also high in frequency if a codon say taa is low , its reverse complement tta is also low i 've seen this relationship in many organisms hundreds , by now too often to be by chance the question is why codons so often occur in direct proportion to the rate of occurrence of corresponding reverse complements it does n't make sense the notion of base pairing should not come into play when an organism or natural selection chooses codons , because all of a protein gene 's codons are collinear , on one and the same strand of dna base pairing rules do not play a role in choosing codons or do they ? i think , in fact , base pairing does a play a role the answer is obvious , when you think about it we know that single stranded rna , if properly constructed , will fold back on itself to form loops and stems complementary regions will base pair with each other certainly , if secondary structure in mrna is widespread , it will have consequences for codon selection codons in stem regions will complement each other and so it 's fairly obvious , it seems to me , that a reasonable explanation for the riddle of reverse complement codon selection is that secondary structure of mrna or possibly single stranded dna is far more pervasive than any of us might have suspected it 's pervasive enough to affect codon usage in the way shown in the graph above is there any evidence that secondary structure is widespread ? i think there is if you go looking for complementary sequences inside protein coding genes in f alni , for example , you find many as a probe , i had a script check for intragenic complementing length sequences mers in all , protein coding genes of f alni i presented pseudocode for the script in an earlier post based on the known base composition stats of the organism , i expected to find , such mer pairs by chance what i found was , such pairs located in , genes when i looked for complementing mers , i expected to find , occurring by chance , but instead found , such pairs in , genes in a previous post , i showed similar results for sorangium cellulosum a bacterium with an enormous genome previous to that , i showed similar results for mycoplasma genitalium which has one of the tiniest genomes of any free living microbe but do these regions of internal complementarity affect codon choice ? indeed they do when i looked at the top of f alni genes in terms of the number of internal complementing mers , i found a pearson correlation between codons and reverse complement codons of looking at the bottom of genes , i found the correlation to be lower these numbers , moreover , were virtually unchanged and when i re calculated the pearson coefficients using expectation adjusted codon frequencies that is to say , i used base composition stats to predict the frequencies of each codon , then i subtracted the predicted number from the actual number , for each codon example the frequency of occurrence of guanine , in f alni protein genes , is , and the frequency of cytosine is , hence the expected frequency of gcc is , or the actual frequency is the correlation still existed , practically unchanged , after adjusting for expected rates of occurrence of codons the bottom line is that the correlation between the frequency of occurrence of a given codon and the frequency of its reverse complement codon , which is otherwise very hard to explain , is quite readily explained by the presence , in protein coding genes , of a significant amount of single strand complementarity of the type that could be expected to give rise to secondary structure in mrna on this basis , it 's reasonable to suppose that conserved secondary structure is actually a major driver of codon usage bias please show this post to your biogeek friends thanks !
