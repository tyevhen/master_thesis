in my earlier post on the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae , i showed some colorful graphs of dna base composition , and i showed how the compositional statistics vary non randomly according to codon base position if you 're not a biogeek , what you need to know here is the following bioinformatics in sixty seconds genes encode information in a linear sequence of the four dna bases a , g , c , and t adenine , guanine , cytosine , and thymine a and g are purines c and t are pyrimidines the sequence on one strand of dna is complementary to the sequence on the opposite strand of dna g pairs with c and a pairs with t , so that if one stand contains the message ggtca , the opposite strand will contain ccagt the fact that g pairs with c and a pairs with t was figured out by erwin chargaff in the early s watson and crick deduced the double helix structure of dna shortly thereafter genes are said to have a message strand and a complementary transcribed strand the transcribed strand is used as a template to create rna with the same sequence as the message strand , except thymine t is replaced by uracil u in rna if a gene encodes a protein as most genes do , the associated rna will ultimately be parsed three bases at a time to determine how to encode the protein the three base words in dna rna are called codons there are possible codons they map to amino acids some amino acids have as many as six synonymous codons others have just one in my leprosy post , i happened to mention and show data for the fact that most codons begin with a purine a or g that 's true not just for the leprosy bacterium but for almost all genes in all organisms this fact is n't widely acknowledged in the literature although geoffrey zubay mentions it in passing on page of origins of life the first base in a codon tends to be a or g about of the time this is true whether the genome is rich in g c or poor in g c the g c content of genomes varies widely it 's often used as a taxonomic criterion an example of an organism with very high g c content in its genome is the common soil bacterium streptomyces griseus , with g c in bacteria , genome g c content correlates loosely r with genome size , and sure enough , the genome of s griseus is on the portly side , with genes encoded in million base pairs of dna just for fun , i created a graph below that shows how dna base content varies according to codon base position relative purine content a g is plotted on the y axis g c content is on the x axis each dot represents one gene 's statistics for every gene , i tallied the average purine usage in all the gene 's codons , and the average g c content , at each codon base position red dots are for the first base in a codon gold dots are for base two blue dots are for base three base composition by codon position for genes in s griseus strain xylebkg each point represents statistics for one gene notice the extremely high g c content in base click to enlarge see text for discussion notice how the blue dots representing base three slam up against the right edge of the graph the data points look as if they 're cut off or something , but they 're not ! the jammed up appearance is the result of base three having an extremely high g c content in streptomyes , coming very close to the theoretical maximum of in many genes this is nothing unusual in organisms with high gc genomes , the third codon position is usually very , very high in g c , while in organisms with low gc genomes , the wobble base as it 's sometimes called is usually extraordinarily rich in a t the third codon position is , to a large extent , informationally redundant due to codon degeneracy and so the choice of base here usually corresponds to g or c if the genome is characteristically gc rich , or a or t if the genome is at rich unlike position three , the first base in a codon is highly significant , informationally , and is subject to strong selection pressure notice how the red dots cluster fairly high on the graph median y , plus or minus sd it means most codons begin with a purine a or g do n't ask me how or why nature made this choice the choice is pretty clear , though sixty percent of the time , you 'll find a or g in position one in some genes , it 's more like very few are under base two gold dots shows a relaxation of g c preference median x and a reduced tendency for purine usage median y , but you 'll notice , if you look closely , that there 's a secondary cloud of gold points under the main cloud this secondary cloud of points has a special significance , which i 'll talk about in my next post to complement the above graph , i thought it might be fun to do the same sort of analysis on a genome containing conspicuously low g c content for this , i chose clostridium botulinum hall strain , which has a genomic g c content of just the botulinum genome encodes genes in million base pairs of dna like s griseus , c botulinum can be found in soil , but unlike streptomyces which is aerobic , members of the clostridiales are famously anaerobic and find oxygen downright intolerable not that it matters for this analysis , however when we look at base compositions in various codon positions for the coding regions of c botulinum dna , we get the following graph here , notice that the blue dots are way over to the left , reflecting the organism 's preference for a very low overall genomic g c content base two gold points is not quite as gc extreme but notice where the red dots are clustering they 're quite high on the graph , at a median y value of , with very few data points falling below the preference for a purine in codon position one is very strong in c botulinum if you look carefully , you can see once again a tiny breakaway group of gold dots underneath the main cloud of gold base two data points this has a special significance i 'll explain it in my next post in sum two features of codon base composition are highly general and apply across organisms and across domains of life first the third wobble base has the most extreme g c content , biased toward high g c if the organism has characteristically high genomic gc content or toward low g c if the organism has a low gc genome second the base in codon position one tends to be a purine in most codons , in most proteins , in most organisms , most of the time the first rule is easy to explain low information content and low selection pressure allow an organism to put whatever base is most convenient whatever 's lying around handy , you might say in the wobble position the second rule is harder to explain nature simply prefers a purine in the first position of a codon genomes from the national center for biotechnology information were downloaded from http genomevolution org on april , data processing was done with custom scripts written in javascript graphs and statistics were generated using the excellent service at zunzun com
