to recap my desktop science experiments of the last month or so , i 've found strandwise dna asymmetry across domains , which is to say in bacteria , archaea , eukaryotes , viruses , and mitochondrial dna in every case except mitochondria , the message or rna synonymous strand of dna in coding regions tends to be purine rich the opposite strand tends to be pyrimidine rich moreover , in all domains , including mitochondria , message strand purine content increases in proportion to genome a t content a t content is a phylogenetic signature some genomes are inherently high in a t content or low in g c content while others are not related organisms tend to have similar a t or g c contents mitochondrial genes tend to be pyrmidine rich on the message strand , seemingly in violation of the finding that in all other domains , message strands are purine rich the mitochondrial anomaly is actually very easy to understand although it took me weeks to realize the explanation in a nutshell mitochondrial dna is pyrimidine rich on message strands because mtdna encodes only a few proteins , usually , all of them membrane associated membrane associated proteins are unusual because they tend to incorporate mostly non polar amino acids such as leucine , isoleucine , valine , proline , alanine , or phenylalanine all of which are specified by pyrimidine rich codons the mitochondrion it seems to me mitochondrial dna should n't be thought of as a genome , because well over of mitochondrial associated gene products are encoded by genes in the host nucleus in humans , there may be as many as nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes this point is worth repeating , so let me quote patrick chinnery , trends in genetics , the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins estimated at are synthesized in the cytosol from nuclear gene transcripts the circular mitochondrial chromosome if it can be called that is the vestigial remnant of a much larger genome that long ago migrated to the host nucleus , no doubt to avoid oxidative attack the mitochondrion simply is not a safe place to store dna would you set up a sperm bank in a rocket fuel factory ? it 's teeming with molecular oxygen , superoxides , peroxides , free protons , and other hazardous materials the human mitochondrial chromosome human mitochondrial dna which is typical of a lot of mtdna encodes just a handful of multi subnit transmembrane proteins , namely cytochrome c oxidase , nadh dehydrogenase , cytochrome b , and an atpase that 's it there are no other protein genes in human mtdna all other mitochondrial proteins are encoded somewhere else that includes out of subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase complex the dna polymerase that replicates mitochondrial dna the mitochondrial rna polymerase about ribosomal proteins so called mitochondrial catalase and hundreds of other mitochondrial proteins all are encoded in the nucleus bottom line mitochondrial dna encodes a very small ensemble of highly specialized membrane associated proteins we should n't expect this small ensemble to be representative of other genes found in other genomes and it 's not that , in a nutshell , is why mtdna is not particularly purine rich in message strands but we should test this hypothesis , if possible and it is , in fact , possible most bacteria are aerobic , which means most bacterial species have genes for cytochrome c oxidase , nadh dehydrogenase , etc the dna for those genes should be similar to mtdna with respect to strand asymmetric purine content if we analyze bacterial dna , we should find that genes for cytochrome c oxidase , nadh dehydrogenase , etc are pyrimidine rich on the message strand , just as in mtdna in tomorrow 's post the data
