i seem to have come down with something post marathon sunday evening , one day after the race , my throat began getting sore it 's only gotten worse , though not terrible , since then it feels like a lingering , low grade cold or flu i'm glad it 's not worse than it is , but it 's still no fun i have n't done a lick of exercise since the marathon , which is actually okay i needed a break i have made it to work both days this week , but i spent my off day yesterday down and out i'm hoping to wake up tomorrow feeling better my parents are in town for one week , and i 'd really like to spend some quality time with them hmmm that 's the second thing i 've written that i never would have written prior to my growth and change , which has been a direct result of sobriety and surviving this illness prior to this illness and prior to getting sober , i would have stayed home from work for a stubbed toe ! likewise , i doubt i ever would have expressed an interest in spending quality time with my parents but i 've grown up over the last years dealing with depression has changed my life i 've lost a lot this illness is relentless in its consumption it 's been no picnic my life looks nothing like it used to yet , i am a better person because of it it sounds so cliche , but in my case it actually is true i am a kinder , gentler , more forgiving , more responsible , grateful soul go figure something positive has come out of the darkness i'm grateful for that
