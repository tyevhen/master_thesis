i have tried very hard to make my home my sanctuary a place that i can rely on as a safe haven from my anxiety a place that promotes peace and love however lately i have noticed that delicate balance shifting as my sweet little baby girl has been growing up and turning into a full blown whining , tantrum throwing two year old , i find myself struggling with discipline specifically , the balance with myself and my spouse as new parents we are both trying to figure out our parenting style and come up with a consistent method of discipline , but it gets difficult when you feel like you have no idea what you are doing , or feel like you do n't know what you should do , and the whining and crying does n't stop , it can be frustrating when i am alone with her i can handle the time outs and there are no anxiety related problems but when my husband is disciplining her , i get very uneasy i do n't like feeling out of control and i do n't like seeing mr t frustrated even if he is n't frustrated , i am worried that he will be we do n't spank and we try our best to keep our cool and not raise our voices but i am still worried about losing that peaceful spirit we have whenever a tantrum erupts or maybe when the th tantrum of the day erupts we 'll take turns when we 've had it to get refreshed sometimes i will even walk outside and take a few deep breaths so i am not sure where to go from here i guess this is more of an observation post about new triggers in my life as my life is changing and i overcome old triggers , new ones are developing i 've noticed that any disruption of the peace in my home is a cause for me to feel anxious , not just discipline but this particular instance is a daily occurrence right now looking at the bigger picture , i feel that i need to learn how to better deal with confrontation in general anyone else have any suggestions or any stories of similar triggers ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like teaching our children to think positively what to do when feeling overwhelmed celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip they 're here linkwithin
