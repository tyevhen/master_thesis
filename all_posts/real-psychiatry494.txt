this post was inspired by a post on the neuroskeptic the impression i get from that blog is that the average reader thinks that psychiatrists are a bunch of chuckleheads who know very little and that is probably why they are so ignorant of science the neuroskeptic himself seems to be slighlty more tolerant but like most bloggers he has to stir the pot the focus of this post was to take a look at kappa statistics given in the article by freedman on dsm field trials and a graphic supplied by the boringoldman blog and conclude that dsm reliabilities were not good , they were not as good as dsm iv , and thankfully psychiatrists could just ignore the dsm if they wanted to on the face of it all this seems like damning criticism is there any defense from the neuroscientific opinion ? it turns out that there is and it comes from two sources the first is the common experience that most people have had who have any medical diagnosis in their lifetime were you ever misdiagnosed ? did you ever get a second opinion and find that the diagnoses by both doctors were so far apart that it was difficult to make a plan to address the problem ? i can give you one of many examples from my lifetime when i was a second year medical student i had several incidents of ankle pain i was assessed and ended up at an orthopedics clinic i had my ankle casted a couple of times , even though i had no history of trauma i finally woke up one night with excruciating left ankle pain and went to the emergency department i saw orthopedics again and they aspirated the joint they also asked my wife to leave and asked me if i had possibly contracted gonorrhea somewhere i was given acetaminophen with codeine and discharged after about hours a couple more weeks of pain and i finally got in to see one of the top experts in rheumatology who finally made the diagnosis of gout at that point i had seen or other doctors and none of them had been able to correctly diagnose the cause of my ankle pain calculating a kappa statistic for a comparison between the expert and the previous physicians would have resulted in a very low number but the story does n't end there as anyone with gout knows , it has varied presentations including inflammation that often seems to extend outside of the joint during my residency training a few years later i had acute right wrist pain the internist i saw decided he needed to aspirate my wrist joint and ended up aspirating a piece of the wrist joint into the syringe no diagnosis despite this procedure i demanded treatment for gout and of course it worked several recurrences of wrist pain have resulted in misdiagnoses of cellulitis keep in mind that i am not testing these doctors i am presenting to them and telling them i have gout and i think my wrist pain is an acute gout attack they are saying well gout does n't usually affect the wrist i think this is cellulitis i have walked out of clinics and thrown the prescription for antibiotic away as i walked out the door i finally just got a supply of the anti inflammatory medication that i need and treat these episodes myself rather than risk misdiagnosis by a physician who does not know much about gout you could say this is all anecdotal i have more anecdotes about how i have been personally misdiagnosed and the anecdotes of an additional thousand people at this time i heard ben stein say at some point the anecdotal becomes the statistical and this is a good example from medicine but what does the literature say about the reliability of diagnoses the diagnostic criteria for gout have been around longer than the dsm another frequent criticism of psychiatric diagnosis is that there are no confirmatory tests for the diagnosis numerous confirmatory tests for gout did not prevent misdiagnosis in my case that brings us to the second line of defense kappa values that are documented in the medical literature let me preface that by saying that compared to psychiatry , there are literally a smattering of kappas from other specialties the following table is a sample from this literature search observation kappa reference scaphoid bone fractures diagnosed by radiologists de zwart ad , et al interobserver variability among radiologists for diagnosis of scaphoid fractures by computed tomography j hand surg am nov reproducibility of serrated polyp diagnosis by pathologists ensari a , et al serrated polyps of the colon how reproducible is their classification ?

clin j sport med may what jumps out at you from the table ? the kappas from other specialties are widely variable and certainly no better than criticized values from psychiatry the fact that some of these kappas are based on interpretations of more uniform test data radiology images or pathology specimens seems to make little difference low interobserver consensus seems to be the rule rather than the exception in medicine psychiatry is the only specialty that openly admits this misdiagnosis is a universal phenomenon and i would argue that it is a basic element in the process of medical diagnosis some have referred to it as the art of medicine , but i prefer a more scientific explanation from a neurobiological standpoint there is certainly the phenomenon of significant variability between people medicine from the outset has always presented itself to practitioners as a field where rational analysis produces a logical result with the degrees of freedom inherent in biological systems that degree of certainty is an illusion at best pretending that psychiatry is less reliable than any other field is an equally problematic illusion , but i guess it makes for good rhetoric george dawson , md , dfapa freedman r , lewis da , michels r , pine ds , schultz sk , tamminga ca , gabbard go , gau ss , javitt dc , oquendo ma , shrout pe , vieta e , yager j the initial field trials of dsm new blooms and old thorns am j psychiatry jan maclure m , willett wc misinterpretation and misuse of the kappa statistic am j epidemiol aug review pubmed pmid yoshizawa cn , le marchand l re misinterpretation and misuse of the kappa statistic am j epidemiol nov pubmed pmid singh h , giardina t , meyer ad , forjuoh sn , reis md , thomas ej types and origins of diagnostic errors in primary care settings jama intern med doi jamainternmed
