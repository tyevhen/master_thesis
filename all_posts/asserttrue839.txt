from adobe technical evangelist ben forta comes word that the linkedin flex developers group is now full to capacity and can accept no more members apparently , linkedin groups can have a maximum of members , and that 's how many the flex dev group now has i wonder who the genius was that hard coded that limit ? forta says he is sitting on some odd requests to join , and ca n't approve them moreover , he pinged linkedin customer services to ask if there was a way to raise that limit he was told he ca n't approve any more requests if the limit gets raised , forta says , i 'll let you know and will approve those in the queue
