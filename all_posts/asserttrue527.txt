i want to talk about some tips for streamlining your writing and giving it more impact as well as making it more correct , grammatically these tips address problems that even competent writers have i catch myself making some of these mistakes but afterward , i always discipline myself appropriately , for example by withholding extra servings of gruel subject pronoun agreement is a problem for many native speakers of english i'm not sure why it 's easy enough to avoid an example of what not to do when you ask a person to help you , they will often refuse why is this wrong ? the pronoun they is a plural form , yet here it refers to a singular person it 's correct to say when you ask a person to help you , he or she will often refuse or , if you prefer the plural when you ask people to help you , they will often refuse do one or the other do n't mix they or them with a singular subject avoid the word very instead , use a higher impact and or more descriptive word like extremely , exceedingly , hugely , remarkably , astoundingly , astonishingly , massively , etc the word very is overused and thus has little impact it 's supposed to magnify the impact of whatever it 's modifying , but you ca n't increase the impact of something by modifying it with a low impact word so just avoid very altogether think up something more imaginative imaginative words improve almost anybody 's writing eliminate unnecessary uses of that he knew that it was wrong can be improved by saying he knew it was wrong this may not sound like such a big deal , but if you use that needlessly throughout a lengthy piece of writing , you 'll find it tends to bog things down if you 're looking for a super easy way to streamline your writing , start by finding and removing unnecessary thats stay away from there is that constructions do n't do this there are many cars that are n't reliable instead say many cars are n't reliable why would you want to use seven words to say something that can be said in four words ? do n't put an ing word at the start of a sentence , unless you really know what you 're doing in english , an ing word is grammatically speaking either a present participle or a gerund the difference between a participle and a gerund is that a participle is a verb form used as an adjective , whereas a gerund is an ing verb that serves as a noun either way , the brain rebels your brain does n't want to see verbs used as adjectives nor as nouns so avoid ing verbs wherever you can sometimes you ca n't avoid them , of course revolving door uses the participle revolving to modify door , which is fine the meaning is clear interrupting is rude uses the gerund interrupting as the subject of the sentence not bad it 's short , and the brain can parse it okay but consider paying attention to grammar eliminates mistakes that 's a poor sentence what 's the subject ? , as is being thin avoids heart disease later in life stay with nouns as the subjects of sentences and you 'll find that sentences are easier to write , as well as easier for the reader to understand be careful about decoupling the object of a sentence from the predicate example of what not to do throw the horse over the fence some hay the subject of this sentence is an implied you , the object is hay , and the predicate is throw but that 's not how the sentence reads it reads as if horse is the object , which is wrong presumably , you want to throw hay , not a horse , over the fence if you were to say throw hay to the horse over the fence , that 's still not good , because you 're implying that the horse is over the fence rather than that you need to throw hay over the fence if you actually want somebody to throw hay over the fence , say so throw hay over the fence , to or for the horse do n't let ambiguity creep into your writing the ability to read quickly made him smarter does quickly modify made quickly made ? or does it modify read read quickly ? it 's ambiguous completely reword the sentence if necessary try something like he became smarter because of his ability to read quickly , or if quickly applies to made he quickly became smarter because of his ability to read say things in the most unambiguous way possible , even if it means making sentences longer and by the way much of the time , you can ignore the old rule about not allowing a sentence to end with a preposition examples that 's a subject i know nothing about it 's nothing to cry over that 's what the dog sat on do it that way , if you have to no one but the most pedantic schoolmarm would consider such sentences wrong tomorrow , i want to talk about certain words and usages that cause trouble yet are easily made right the words in question are like land mines waiting to blow big craters in your writing ignore them at your own peril
