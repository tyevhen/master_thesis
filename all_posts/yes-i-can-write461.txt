well , i knew it had been a long time since i 'd written here , but i did n't know it had been this long i wo n't bother telling you everything that 's happened since i last wrote , especially considering there 's no way i could remember everything that 's happened ! so i 'll simply say what 's going on now i find myself feeling very melancholy tonight haunted by i'm not quite sure what i think it will be awhile before i get to sleep part of the reason is probably because i'm the only one awake right now my sister is away at a friends cottage for the weekend , and my parents decided to go to bed early although i 've been called a loner before , i'm not really i do n't like large groups all that much , but neither do i like being entirely alone since someone in my home is almost always up to all hours with me , it feels exceedingly lonely being the only one awake another reason is probably that i learned that one of my favorite authors of all time has early onset alzheimer 's if you know anything about that disease , you 'll know that is a very bad thing you lose your memories , your mind usually it happens only to those who are quite old , terry pratchett is not even yet , as far as i know i doubt he will be writing for much longer , and i will greatly miss his satirical , wise , and eye opening words , as well as grieving for someone i feel i know , since i 've read so many of his words just to add to everything else , i 've progressed through much of derrick jensen 's amazing book the culture of make believe the atrocities our culture has perpetrated , the lives lost , the destruction wrought his prose is beautiful , fascinating , and impossible to ignore , but at times also heartbreaking i 've actually been in tears during parts , which is something that very rarely happens to me while reading a non fiction book a quote i like from him , although not from the book i am currently reading , it is the first paragraph from his book endgame it reads as follows as a longtime grassroots environmental activist , and as a creature living in the thrashing endgame of civilization , i am intimately acquainted with the landscape of loss , and have grown accustomed to carrying the daily weight of despair i have walked clearcuts that wrap around mountains , drop into valleys , then climb ridges to fragment watershed after watershed , and i ve sat silent near empty streams that two generations ago were lashed into whiteness by uncountable salmon coming home to spawn and die as a creature living in the thrashing endgame of civilization , i am intimately acquainted with the landscape of loss , and have grown accustomed to carrying the daily weight of despair those words haunt me , and feel very true to me tonight , perhaps even more so than when i first heard them in the online video of a talk he gave a couple of years ago he is a brilliant speaker and writer , his passion , hope , and despair come through unfailingly clear surprisingly , usually when i read his book it does not depress me make me sad , yes depress , no more than anything , it makes me fucking angry and determined to change things , to not let our culture destroy all that is good and beautiful in the world because like it or not , whether you blind yourself and pretend nothing is happening , it is our world is dying our home it 's our only one but instead of living in peace , we 're destroying it utterly species go extinct daily thanks to us so many are already gone , never to return so much land is polluted beyond saving water made undrinkable for the foreseeable future how can we do this ? it 's suicide on a grand scale , since we can no more live on a polluted planet than can all the animals who no longer do live i want to help no i need to help need to change things i'm going to find a way , and i'm going to in any way i can because you know what ? i do hope i'm eternally an optimist i have to have hope , hold it close and nurse it , keep it strong that 's what we all need , hope and determination determination to make a difference , to change the world , and not let our consumerist culture consume our very lives , as well as every other life on this planet we all call home i hope http video google com videosearch ? q derrick jensen sitesearch you might also like one very well written novel melancholy and beautiful books why i'm an anarchist derrick jensen quotes linkwithin
