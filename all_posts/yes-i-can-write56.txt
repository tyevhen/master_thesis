after not reading any non fiction books in quite a while , i picked up better than college by blake boles this afternoon and started reading instantly , something sparked a blog post idea blake writes instead of working on homework , papers , and presentations destined to be seen once and tossed into a trashcan , self directed learners turn much of their hard work into useful products for other people i do n't know about products , per se , but definitely something useful and appreciated reading that , i had a thought that somehow had never occurred to me before most young people view non fiction writing as something primarily done to get good grades , something that is only useful insofar as it pleases a teacher or professor and thus leads to good marks i 've never written a five paragraph essay count paragraphs , you say ? construct an essay based on a rigid outline ? why would i do that ? i 've worked within word or space or time constraints numerous times , writing articles for magazines or talks for conferences but i 've never written an essay expected to adhere so closely to a specific outline , nor have i ever written something designed to please just one specific person i learned to write for an audience i started writing before i even started reading , dictating silly stories for my mother to write down creating with words is something i 've been doing since i was a small child but when i really started writing in my teens , i first started writing book reviews for a homeschooling magazine , and then i started blogging and it was through blogging that i became good at writing an idzie writing i think blogging has been helpful for me in developing good writing skills for several reasons , and i think it 's helpful for other people for the same reasons your content is personally meaningful you 're writing about things that are actually important to you , things you 're interested in , things that are relevant to your life this is n't something boring you 're forced to do , it 's something you actually want to be doing , so you 're going to care more about it and invest a lot more effort you get feedback that 's supposed to be the point of teachers grading papers , but blogging does that much more effectively , both because the audience is wider , and because feedback is n't the main point the point is whatever you 're writing about politics or stories of daily life or unschooling philosophy getting feedback on your writing , directly through comments and emails and indirectly through which posts are more and less popular , allows you to improve your writing in a much more organic and meaningful way you learn to write accessibly i'm generally considered a decent writer , with a good vocabulary yet when i read an academic paper written at a university level , or listen to a couple of academics discuss something suitably academic , often as not i'm left understanding only half of what 's being said , and encountering a whole bunch of unfamiliar vocabulary and i do n't mean vocabulary related to a specific field , just academic jargon it 's a form of gate keeping , separating people into those who have had access to ivory towers and those who have not blogging breaks that down no matter your subject , you 're likely writing for a wider audience , and so you want a large number of people to be able to understand what you 're saying you get better at communicating i ca n't count the number of times someone has misinterpreted something i 've written that has happened less though as i 've been pushed to be ever clearer in my writing expressing yourself clearly and concisely is a good skill , and blogging is a platform very conducive to improving that skill you focus on the content , not the mechanics of writing schools often emphasize writing first as a technical process , teaching proper grammar and structure , with content coming second in reality , it works so much better if you instead focus on things that feel like they have more meaning , on the actual content , and let skills be built naturally through the practice of creating meaningful content you have something exciting to strive for having people interact with your writing , commenting on it and sharing it and sending you emails about it , is super rewarding knowing people value your voice , value what you have to share , feels wonderful a blog is also something that feels like it can grow , not only as more and more people discover it , but also in content and style , as your perspective and experiences change it can also lead to a lot of other cool things having your work published in magazines and books getting your own books published making money or getting a job all of that is likely to be a lot more exciting than just writing to get a good grade ! writing can certainly be meaningful in both high school and university settings if you like the topic you 're studying , you might be quite happy to be writing about it i just think blogging can provide an excellent self directed way to grow as a writer through blogging i 've created a bunch of content i'm really proud of i 've had my work published in magazines and books i 've gone to conferences i never would have gotten to go to otherwise i 've made many friends received many free books and discovered a bunch of great content created by other people through it all , even when it 's been difficult , writing has felt like something good important something that has meaning i may have never written a five paragraph essay , but i have learned to write , and write well , for an audience of people who really care about what i have to say and that seems like a much better way to learn
