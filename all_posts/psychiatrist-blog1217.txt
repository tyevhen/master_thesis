in our prison system we get blast emails dinah recently has listened to me rant about how much i hate random blast emails from the many organizations i belong to i get blast email from my professional organizations two of them , the local symphony , my car dealership , two academic institutions and any company i 've ever done business with i spend more time deleting email than i do reading and responding to email i really want but anyway , i get blast email from prison the majority of it are press releases about various and sundry governer or secretary initiatives , but for some reason they also send out emails about deaths in the system not prisoner deaths , not anything work related , but the deaths of anybody who works in the system or is related to a doc employee these are called family passing notices , after the subject heading of the email today i got three family passing blast emails i do n't know any of the people who died and all of them were relatives of doc employees , and i did n't know the employees they work in institutions on the opposite end of the state from where i am and it 's unlikely i 'll ever meet them i'm not sure why doc officials decided i needed to know about these deaths i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do with this information i do n't understand how they think it will help morale to know that people are dropping like flies right and left i wonder if they realize that for most people this just reinforces the idea that when you die the majority of people will have no clue that you ever even existed i have my email rules set up now to automatically delete any message with family passing in the subject heading i suppose i could send in a request to be taken off the notification list but in the bureaucratic world i live in , i know that would only last until the next employee comes in and takes over the death notification job i'm sure i 'll get a blast email to let me know when that happens
