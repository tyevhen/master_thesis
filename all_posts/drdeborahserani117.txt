into the wild is the true story of christopher mccandless a twenty two year old man , who decided to leave everything and everyone behind to travel across the united states to live in the alaskan wilderness many saw his story as an idealistic journey but i wondered if something more was going on i wondered if some of his behaviors were similar to individuals experiencing schizophrenia schizophrenia frequently surfaces in late adolescence , often making its impact in college age individuals it is an illness that distorts the ability to think clearly , and is often accompanied by hallucinations or delusions , among other symptoms schizophrenia is generally stereotyped versions of maniacal people cringing in paranoia or hiding in shadows are never accurate depictions i could n't help but wonder if christopher mccandless was experiencing schizophrenia or something along those lines , and not an unbridled zest for an unencumbered life if you saw the movie or read the book , tell me what you think
