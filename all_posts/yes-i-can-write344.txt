i feel a little bit intimidated to be writing about this topic , since i feel it 's a fairly big one , and something that many people feel very strongly about , and wonder about how unschoolers handle them it does n't really help that it 's really late , and i'm not sure i can do the topic justice right now however , i can always add more , edit things , or write whole new posts later on , so i do n't really need to worry if i'm not entirely happy with what i write now ! a while back on facebook , i was tagged in a note from a mother asking for advice on how to have the talk with her year old daughter i thought about that a lot , but never answered , because my family never did have that much talked about talk when i was under two my mother became pregnant with my little sister , so of course i wanted to know how ! her answer was that papa puts the sperm in her then a baby starts growing after mulling that over for a while , again , i 'd ask how ? and get a more in depth answer my mom never glossed over things , but neither did she push unwanted information on me when i asked a question , she 'd simply answer honestly and so i learned about the very basics of sex at a young age ! it also helped that when i was young we had an , erm , very sexually explicit dog , so i got a bit more of an idea from that , as funny and slightly embarrassing as it is to say it ! p when i was older , in my preteen years , my mom simply took a huge stack of books on sex ed out from the library , and i 'd surreptitiously flip through them whenever i felt like it i went through a stage where i found talking about such things incredibly embarrassing , and would have completely flipped out had my mom attempted to teach me sex ed as it was i learned from books , peers and since i was always smart , i double checked peer learned information with much more reliable sources p , the internet as much as the net is filled with pornography and bad information about sex , there is some good info if you look for it , and my mom as a last resort ! the only kind of information i remember her kind of trying to force on me was about birth control at that point , i already knew about everything she was telling me , and was quite peeved at her for embarrassing me by bringing up the subject ! suffice it to say , i learned sex ed naturally , through books and conversations and life , just like an unschooler learns everything else ! in terms of menstruation , that was just normal we never had closed doors in our house when i was young , and i simply learned about that through living with a grown woman ! again , i was embarrassed about such things , but my mom made it clear i just had to ask for supplies if i needed them , and other the that , i did n't need to talk about it unless i wanted to i really was a very embarrassed child in many ways , looking back on things ! nowadays in my family , sex is n't nearly as taboo a subject because , well , neither my sister nor i are really embarrassed anymore ! my mother , sister , and i have had multiple really good conversations about various aspects of sexuality , both physical and emotional , and i think that 's wonderful ! there 's absolutely no feeling of my mom teaching or instructing or the conversation in any way not being equal between us , because , well , it is equal ! we 're all just discussing something that is relevant and interesting to us , and although the three of us have had vastly different experiences in the matter , that does n't change how we discuss things it 's a free sharing of ideas , opinions , and experiences , like all of our good conversations , and that 's a wonderful thing also , my parents have never been advocates of abstinence the only thing they 've been forceful about is safety be safe ! is the most my mom has ever said to me in terms of whether or not i should have sex my parents trust that both my sister and i own our own bodies , respect ourselves , and know what we do or do not want to do with our bodies i wo n't necessarily be happy and have n't necessarily been happy with every decision i make , but it 's always my decision and no one elses i actually find it rather amusing , if exasperating , that some people seem to think that un homeschoolers will have inferior sex ed knowledge , because my sister and i have actually been in the position of giving accurate info to schooled friends , who have very limited knowledge and a shit load of bad information ! our local high school does n't even teach anatomy properly , because i know several guys who go to that school and have absolutely no grasp of female anatomy ! alcohol consumption was never made into a big issue in my household , either from the time i was young , i was always offered alcohol when my parents would have a glass of wine or similar neither of my parents are big drinkers , and i 've never seen either of them drunk drinking alcohol was , and is , something consumed for the enjoyment of the drink , not to get drunk , in my family i tried multiple different types of alcohol as they became available at different family functions and similar , decided what i liked and did n't like and to this date , i have never been drunk i 've been slightly tipsy emphasis on 'slightly' twice in my entire life and honestly , i never plan on getting drunk the thought does not appeal to me in the slightest , probably in large part because i really do n't like being around people who are drunk i have a strong sense of personal space , and one of the first thing people seem to lose when drinking is a sense of personal boundaries and other people 's space that , and i just find it gross ! in terms of drugs , i do n't remember any do n't do drugs type talk i have a cutesy sticker stuck on my bookshelf in my room that says say neigh to drugs with a picture of a horse , but i'm not even sure i knew what they were referring to when i got the sticker , and the main motivation in sticking it to my bookshelf was that i liked horses ! p so really , my opinions on drugs have been formed by myself and unsurprisingly if you 've read my blog for any length of time , i do not believe that drugs should be illegal i believe that every person has an absolute right to decide what they do or do not do to their bodies , as long as they do n't infringe on another person 's absolute right to do or not do whatever they want with their own bodies ! it has n't really been much of an issue so far , since neither my sister nor i have ever done drugs however , i 've made it clear to my mom at least possibly both parents , but i'm not sure i 've made it quite as clear to my dad , since he 's more anti drugs than my mother is that i will try marijuana at some point i do n't feel it 's something i need to keep absolutely secret the reason i have n't yet , although i 've certainly had the opportunity , is because there are several factors affecting my decision i need to trust that what i'm taking into my body comes from a reliable source , and is not contaminated in any way , and i need to trust the people i'm with , because i want to be surrounded by people who will take care of me when my judgment is impaired i'm not even that worried about what i 'll do in terms of safety , because from what i 've seen , marijuana does n't really affect you to an extant that you 're likely to do anything particularly dangerous , unless you 're driving or similar i just do n't want to even do lesser things , embarrassing things , or anything i 'll regret , really the main thing is that before i'm willing to tamper with my state of consciousness , i want to feel that i'm in a comfortable and safe environment i think that 's good for now i may want to elaborate on some points in later posts , or talk about some points i 've forgotten , but this will do for now also , i 'd love to hear from other unschoolers on how you handle the issues of sex and drugs you can either leave your answer in the comments below , or write a whole post of your own on it ! if you do decide to do a post , please leave the link in the comments , and i 'll add them to a list at the bottom of this post i actually decided to write this post after seeing a comment and her subsequent post on michele 's blog , so i 'll start by adding that link !
