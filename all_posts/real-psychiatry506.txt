the apa released a statement about the nra 's comments , probably mr lapierre 's statements on meet the press on sunday and a separate nra release there are several problems with the apa statement the american psychiatric association expressed disappointment today in the comments from wayne lapierre why would the apa be disappointed in a predictable statement from a gun lobbyist ? i really found nothing surprising in mr lapierre 's presentation or the specific content as i previously posted , the nra predictably sees guns as the solution to gun violence the concept more guns less crime has been a driving force behind their nationwide campaign for concealed carry laws the concealed weapons that are being carried are handguns and handguns are responsible for the largest percentage of gun homicides in the united states it is probably a good idea to come up with a solution rather than reacting to a predictable statement the person involved in the shooting is named although it is controversial , there is some evidence that media coverage is one factor that can lead predispose individuals to copy a particular crime although this press release is a minimal amount of information relative to other news coverage , it does represent an opportunity for modeling techniques for more appropriate media coverage and that might include anonymity of the perpetrator the nra release makes the same mistake in addition , he conflated mental illness with evil at several points in his talk and suggested that those who commit heinous gun crimes are so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can ever possibly comprehend them , a description that leads to the further stigmatization of people with mental illnesses it is always difficult to tell how rhetorical a person is being when they use terms like evil and demons if they are considered to be descriptive terms for a supernatural force that suggests an etiology of mental illness that was popular in the dark ages evil on the other hand does have a more generic definition of morally wrong or bad immoral wicked in this case it is important to know if the speaker is referring to a definition that is based on evil as a supernatural force or a more common description this is another educational point people who experience voices and irrational thoughts involving homicide can be understood psychiatrists can understand them and can help them to come up with a plan to avoid acting on those thoughts and impulses and getting rid of them the nra release is basically an indication of a high degree of na vet in thinking about the unique conscious state of individuals the apa release should correct that the apa notes that people with mental illnesses are rarely violent and that they are far more likely to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators the actual numbers here are irrelevant psychiatric epidemiology cannot be casually understood and the media generally has the population whipped up about the notion of psychiatric overdiagnosis of everything anyway the idea that some mentally ill persons are dangerous is common sense and forms the basis of civil commitment and emergency detention laws in every state of the union advocates need to step away from the notion that recognizing this fact is stigmatizing the apa needs to recognize that their members in acute care settings are dealing with this problem every day and need support it is an undeniable fact that some persons with mental illness are dangerous and it is an undeniable fact that most of the dangerous people do not have mental illness trying to parse that sentence usually results in inertia that prevents any progress toward solutions the apa seems to have missed a golden opportunity to suggest a plan to address the current problem the problem will not be addressed by responding to predictable nra rhetoric there several other nonstarters in terms of a productive dialogue on this issue including the specifics of the second amendment and specific gun control regulations the moderator of meet the press made an excellent point in the interview on sunday when he asked about closing the loophole that of gun purchases occur at gun shows where there are no background checks it was clear that the nra was not interested in closing that loophole the main problem is that the apa has no standing in that argument second nonstarter is the whole issue of predictability any news outlet can find a psychiatrist somewhere who will comment that psychiatrists cannot predict anything that usually ends the story if your cardiologist cannot predict when you will have a heart attack , why would anyone think that a psychiatrist could predict a rare event happening in a much more complicated organ ? psychiatrists need to be focused on public health interventions to reduce the incidence of violence and aggression in the general population and where it is associated with psychiatric disorders what about mr lapierre s criticism of the mental health system ? they did n't want mentally ill in institutions so they put them all back on the streets and then nobody thought what happens when you put all these mentally ill people back on the streets , and what happens when they start taking their medicine we have a completely cracked mentally ill system that 's got these monsters walking the streets and we 've got to deal with the underlying causes and connections if we 're ever going to get to the truth in this country and stop this is it an accurate global description of what has happened to the mental health system in this country ? he certainly is not using the language of a mental health professional or a person with any sensitivity toward people with mental illness there are numerous pages on this blog documenting how the mental health system has been decimated over the past years and some of the factors responsible for that just yesterday i was advised of a school social worker who not only was unable to get a child hospitalized but could not get them an outpatient appointment to see a psychiatrist the government and the managed care industry have spent years denying people access to mental health care and psychiatrists they have also spent years denying people access to quality mental health care that psychiatrists are trained to provide we have minimal infrastructure to help people with the most severe forms of illness and many hospital inpatient units do discharge people to the street even though they are unchanged since they were admitted any serious dialogue about the mental health aspects of aggression and violence needs to address that problem that is where the apa s voice should be the loudest george dawson , md , dfapa supplementary material quotes from and locations of transcripts feel free to double check my work mtp transcript http www msnbc msn com id ns meet the press transcripts t december wayne lapierre chuck schumer lindsey graham jason chaffetz harold ford jr andrea mitchell chuck todd unlaj rqyrv i'm telling you what i think will make people safe and what every mom and dad will make them feel better when they drop their kid off at school in january , is if we have a police officer in that school , a good guy , that if some horrible monster tries to do something , they 'll be there to protect them p look at the facts at columbine they 've changed every police procedure since columbine i mean i do n't understand why you ca n't , just for a minute , imagine that when that horrible monster tried to shoot his way into sandy hook school , that if a good guy with a gun had been there , he might have been able to stop p there are so many different ways he could have done it and there 's an endless amount of ways a monster p i do n't think it will i keep saying it , and you just wo n't accept it it 's not going to work it has n't worked dianne feinstein had her ban , and columbine occurred it 's not going to work i 'll tell you what would work we have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed we have no national database of these lunatics p states , my unintel however long ago was virginia tech ? states are still putting only a small number of records into the system and a lot of states are putting none so , when they go through the national instant check system , and they go to try to screen out one of those lunatics , the p i talked to a police officer the other day he said , wayne , he said , let me tell you this every police officer walking the street knows s lunatic that 's out there , some mentally disturbed person that ought to be in an institution , is out walking the street because they dealt with the institutional side they did n't want mentally ill in institutions so they put them all back on the streets and then nobody thought what happens when you put all these mentally ill people back on the streets , and what happens when they start taking their medicine we have a completely cracked mentally ill system that 's got these monsters walking the streets and we 've got to deal with the underlying causes and connections if we 're ever going to get to the truth in this country and stop this p nra transcript http home nra org pdf transcript pdf pdf the truth is that our society is populated by an unknown number of genuine monsters people so deranged , so evil , so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can possibly ever comprehend them p yet when it comes to the most beloved , innocent and vulnerable members of the american family our children we as a society leave them utterly defenseless , and the monsters and predators of this world know it and exploit it that must change now ! p as parents , we do everything we can to keep our children safe it is now time for us to assume responsibility for their safety at school the only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun would you rather have your call bring a good guy with a gun from a mile away or a minute away ? p now , i can imagine the shocking headlines you 'll print tomorrow morning more guns , you 'll claim , are the nra 's answer to everything ! your implication will be that guns are evil and have no place in society , much less in our schools but since when did the word gun automatically become a bad word ? p is the press and political class here in washington so consumed by fear and hatred of the nra and america s gun owners that you 're willing to accept a world where real resistance to evil monsters is a lone , unarmed school principal left to surrender her life to shield the children in her care ?
