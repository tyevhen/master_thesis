she did n't want to wait much longer she was afraid that if she waited , she would n't be able to have a baby due to her age she also wanted to have a life where she felt settled and comfortable and not always worried about her partner 's ambivalence about the relationship bill looked embarrassed and told the therapist that he felt ina was being too judgmental and pressuring him too much he said he loved ina , but he just did n't feel ready to get married he could n't understand why they could n't just keep living together , what 's the big deal about getting married ? ina said that she did n't want to have a baby without being married it was against her core values , and would n't compromise on something that was so important to her bill said he liked children , and he hoped that he and ina would have children one day , but he was n't ready to have children now after several couples therapy sessions where they felt they were both getting nowhere , they decided to leave couples counseling and each go into their own individual therapy once she began individual therapy , ina told her therapist that she loved bill very much , but she did n't want to stay in the relationship if it was n't going to lead to marriage she was clear about this she just was n't sure how much more time she should give bill to figure things out in bill 's individual therapy , he acknowledged that he was ambivalent about getting married , even though he loved ina very much and did n't want to lose her as he continued to work with his therapist , bill realized that he had a lot of fears about getting married he had never known anyone who had a good marriage , especially not his parents see my article you ca n't change the past , but you can change how the past affects you on the one hand ,

n't agree to get married soon after several months of being in individual therapy and with her th birthday soon approaching , ina told bill that she thought it was better for them to end their relationship she told him that she hoped he would find someone who would be willing to just live together and she hoped that she would find a loving relationship where her partner would be willing to get married and have children as ina began packing her things , bill had his first panic attack , and he called his therapist to set up an appointment for that evening after he got off the phone with his therapist , bill was a little calmer and he persuaded ina not to move out just yet he asked her to give him more time to work on his ambivalence and the fears that he had about being married reluctantly , ina agreed to stay three more months , but she said she would leave if there was no change after that during his therapy session that evening , bill told his therapist that the thought of ina moving out and leaving him was much more painful than the thought of getting married , and he wanted to work on his fears and ambivalence bill and his therapist worked on the root of his fears , which had more to do with his family history than it did with his relationship with ina see my article healing old emotional childhood wounds that are affecting your current relationship over time ,

three months , bill still had some ambivalence and fear , but he was much clearer that he wanted to marry ina , so they started planning their wedding conclusion the vignette above illustrates how ambivalence and underlying fear can ruin a relationship in this particular example , as is the case in many relationships where one or both people are ambivalent , the ambivalence was related to a dysfunctional family history one of the goals in therapy is to help clients to separate their feelings about the past from the present when you can make a distinction between the past and what 's happening in your relationship in the present , you 're more likely to make better decisions working through a history of family trauma can free you from that history so that you can lead a more fulfilling life getting help in therapy ongoing ambivalence in a relationship tends to erode the relationship after a while , whatever good feelings there were between the two people can be lost when the ambivalence is chronic for one or both people if you 're in a relationship where you 're either the one who is ambivalent or the one who is trying to deal with your partner 's ambivalence , it can be very painful to deal with on your own rather than continuing to suffer alone , you owe it to yourself to get help from a licensed mental health professional , who can help you to identify the problems related to the ambivalence and work through the issues so that you can make better decisions about the relationship see my articles the benefits of psychotherapy and how to choose a
