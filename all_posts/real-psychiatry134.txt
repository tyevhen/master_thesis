the standard drink http rethinkingdrinking niaaa nih gov how much is too much what counts as a drink whats a standard drink aspx one of my main tasks during an interview is assessing the medical condition of the patient that is important in determining associated comorbidity , potential causes of psychiatric symptoms , factors that might affect how any medications i assess or prescribe are metabolized , medical tests that i need to order and follow , the insight and functional capacity of the patient are they aware of the physical problem and doing something about it , and any referrals that i need to suggest and make to primary care physicians or specialists when i see people who are using significant amounts of alcohol alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis are high on that list in many cases they are seeing me and already have a diagnosis of cirrhosis , but nobody else in the current system of care seems to know that continuity of care is really not an administrative priority in american health care we all practice in administrative silos defined by electronic health records ehrs that do n't talk to one another and produce very low quality printouts just recently i reviewed an ehr printout that was pages long as usual the hospital and dates of service were not evident about of those pages was a consultant 's report that pulled in every lab the person across their lifetime spread in uneven columns across the pages how to get to these important but obscured diagnoses ? it is always important to ask about hepatitis and cirrhosis i also ask about infectious and alcoholic types some standard review of systems include questions about jaundice and that is a good one to ask non standard question include asking about seeing a gastroenterologist or liver specialist i will ask about specific imaging like hepatic ultrasounds , cts , and mris i will ask if there has ever been upper gi endoscopy or colonoscopy , the indications , and what they were told about the findings i will ask about whether a doctor has ever told my patient to stop drinking and why ? in the population of moderate to heavy drinkers that i see , it is rare to find all of a person 's care provided at one location there are typically emergency department visits and hospitalizations that the primary care md is not aware of there may be attempts to treat the alcohol use problem and there is often not a very strong medical component associated with that treatment the patient may be actively avoiding contact with medical care out of fear of what might happen with the illness all of these factors make it extremely important not to miss the diagnosis and at the minimum recommend optimal care for that person from a strictly historical standpoint , the key question is whether there are some historical markers that allow for the stratification of risk can you tell whether your patient might have cirrhosis just based on their drinking history ? moderate to heavy drinkers vary considerably in their veracity on reporting alcohol use it may depend on the phase of treatment a reliable description of consumption may occur early in treatment after a conscious decision to come clean about it there will be a number of people who are not ready to stop drinking irrespective of the quantity they are drinking and the problems that it has caused they might be in the assessment because of external factors like family members who are upset by their drinking there are also the limits of memory if a person acknowledges years of moderate to heavy drinking and multiple dwis in their early s they are unlikely to provide a detailed description of their progression of drinking and may only hit a few of the high points like when they started experiencing blackouts on a daily basis in my experience , most moderate to heavy drinkers focus on the last or years of drinking that can create the impression that they have not been drinking long enough to cause significant damage part of the problem in taking the clinical history of drinking is that there can be a bewildering array of drinks and measures often to the point that the clinician is not sure about absolute quantities or alcohol concentrations the literature on cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease often requires a conversion to standard drinks or grams those drink sizes especially the ones that are culturally determined there are definitely drinking subcultures in the us or self determined can lead to wide variation in the amount of alcohol actually consumed collateral information is always very useful from the graphic at the top of this page fluid ounces of proof alcohol or the equivalent in any one of those drinks is considered a standard drink in the us that is grams or ounces of pure alcohol the amounts that i hear about being consumed include a mini bottles ml , a pint ml , a fifth ml , a liter ml , and a handle ml consuming the entire container of these beverages is the equivalent of taking , , , , and ounce standard drinks respectively in the literature the standard drink size in australia is grams of alcohol or ml of alcohol rather than the grams specified in the us that results in more drinks per beverage or container the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa has several definitions that are based on consumption that are useful binge drinking is defined as or more drinks on a single occasion for men or more more drinks on a single occasion for women usually in less than hours heavy drinking is defined as or more drinks per week for men and or more drinks per week for women of the us population exceeds both the single day and weekly consumption limits of these definitions of the us population will exceed either the single day limit or the weekly limit always drink within low risk limits and never drink those results are based on a sample of , americans years of age and older what are the estimates of alcohol use that cause cirrhosis ? the first time i encountered this concept was in a medical clinics of north america reference that suggested pint years of drinking a pint of whiskey per day for years the american college of gastroenterology makes a different estimate of grams of alcohol daily will result in liver damage in most women they go on to specify that grams of alcohol per day will lead to cirrhosis in men in years and the same amount of daily alcohol consumption will lead to cirrhosis in women in years they also specify that in their use , drinks is ounces of distilled spirits so the standard drink size is less than the usual definitions converting all of those numbers into standard drinks grams standard drinks grams standard drinks grams standard drinks in other words standard drinks per day will result in cirrhosis in men in years or cirrhosis in women in years on a clinical basis , i have seen very young people with alcoholic cirrhosis and the youngest were women in their late s so the range for cirrhosis in the literature ranges from a low of about pint of proof alcohol per day for or years to pint of proof alcohol per day for years the australian national health and medical research council nh mrc recommends that the maximum standard drinks per day for men is and for women is the range between the high and low estimates of toxicity is considerable given the fact that a pint of distilled spirits contains standard drinks the pint a day drinker exceeds both the niaaa maximum recommended single day and weekly consumption there are a number of variables that affect the individual pharmacokinetics of alcohol and ultimate toxicity patterns of consumption are also important knowing the range of alcohol consumption that may have already impacted the patient is useful in terms of deciding if the history is accurate and how the treatment plan may need to be modified it is also useful to know from a public health perspective , especially in the current era of liberalizing policies and attitudes about intoxicants george dawson , md , dfapa references lefton hb , rosa a , cohen m diagnosis and epidemiology of cirrhosis med clin north am jul , vii doi j mcna review pubmed pmid supplementary the dose of alcohol that is associated with pancreatitis is or drinks daily for a period of or more years forsmark ce , vege ss , wilcox cm acute pancreatitis n engl j med supplementary british national health service guidelines based on a standard drink of ml of alcohol attribution graphic at the top of this post is from the niaaa we site rethinking drinking and is in the public domain at the references url
