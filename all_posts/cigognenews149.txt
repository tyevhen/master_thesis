i have been thinking a lot lately about abreaction i think it is the scourge of primal therapy it is what is happening in almost every mock primal therapy i know , which is why we have such a hard time helping patients once they have abreacted over time patients get grooved into false pistes and we cannot get them out of it and they sicker and sicker and never know it why ? because they get some kind of relief with the discharge of the energy of feeling but never ever resolve anything the feelings remains suspended in time , unchanged and unresolved and then what happens ? the feelings on every line triggered en masse , become impacted , first , second and third lines as a block they then become impenetrable and cannot be felt and liberated the result is overload that means that the energy of all levels of consciousness surge forward due their incredible load they become too weighted to feel and experience the excess , now stays in the system ceasing spillways for the energy that means it goes where there is least resistance the result is the system does its best to integrate overload but it fails specific symptoms result depression , anxiety , hopelessness , migraines , high blood pressure , epilepsy , and a multitude of other afflictions how high reflects the power and energy of the overload the symptoms are most difficult to control because all levels are involved not any specific feeling hence no resolution why not a feeling that could liberate ? in bad therapy no single feeling is addressed and relived at a time with resolution the therapist takes charge and directs the whole process out of his own unconscious and his deep unfulfilled need so , instead of going all the way with hopelessness , for example , the therapists offers hope and destroys the resolution of the feeling or does not know how deep the feeling is and cuts it off prematurely , when it has deep roots that need reliving , too i have been trying to figure how what to do about the treatment of this overload old patients from other therapies come in and try to feel but nothing changes all the three lines of therapy are consolidated and untouchable the groove remains it is much worse than a single neurosis it is like three at once i have come up on a solution which we shall try with no proof at all if it will work try a week or more of primal therapy but add a first line blocker to the mix before therapy thus reducing part of the consolidation overload , and permitting a single lighter feeling at a time that should be more feelable and allows one separate out the levels of consciousness and take away its heavy load we shall try it but no certainty of the result until much time and therapy has gone on which is why we need to have therapy on the right track right away that means therapists who know what they are doing therapists with proper training of how the brain works , as well as how the therapy needs to go and we need to avoid those who love the drama of reliving birth usually done far too early with no preparation it is often a result of helter skelter therapy with no proper organization i think this leads up to the same problem with many other therapies that do not touch a feeling but partially dredge it up unresolved the great problem is that as feelings are elicited but not resolved , they create a reservoir of feeling that produces more depression and anxiety and the patients never know why those feelings adhere to other feelings and almost glue them together it gets more and more difficult to penetrate them as feelings continue on their journey with the effects on the heart , blood system and organs continues on unabated disaster lurks
