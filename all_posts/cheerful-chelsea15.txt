for the past month i have been religiously wearing my fitbit again last summer was a big struggle , but i got a small amount of joy each day from seeing my tracker smile at me and showing how much i moved bare in mind that i would be pretty chuffed if i managed around , steps a day at that time i was n't going out much and struggled to remove my blank stare from the tv and slight comfort of the indent i 'd made in the sofa nowadays i'm moving around a bit more i push myself further each day , even if that 's just from chasing toby our dog around the table or doing one more lap of crazy dancing around the island in the kitchen some days i venture further afield for a medical appointment of which there have been many over the past two months or to pick up some food shopping , walking back and forth along shopping aisles aimlessly and forgetting multiple items , having to loop back really builds up the steps ! i thought it would be an interesting way to keep track of my moods over the months if i translated my daily steps into a graph to post on the blog each month in a line graph you can clearly see the peaks and troughs of my moods towards the end of the month i introduced the magnesium supplements to improve my sleep , which has in turn meant that i 've been getting up earlier and having longer days i always keep track of my day to day activities in a planner diary my mind is like a faucet at the moment , i can barely remember what i did yesterday never mind last week i can use my daily notes alongside the graph to identify which days were really bad , which days i pushed myself despite crying most of the morning and the odd day where i forgot to put my tracker on until pm ! as i said there were days that i cried a lot , i was on my own in the house and was feeling extremely anxious in the past i would have drawn a line under the day and headed back to bed however , i had a few responsibilities as i was looking after to toby and some chickens down the road , the small walk to feed them left me feeling sick , trembling and crying by the time i reached our house again i had a couple of those days and i 'rallied' through to the end until robbie got back from work i often end up baking my way through the depression although that does n't always work in my favour as i 'll try a stupidly hard recipe and be left crying over a failed bake and a kitchen covered in a sticky mess the path to progress is n't always smooth , and you wo n't be seeing me consistently reaching , steps a day anytime soon as you can see towards the end of the month i had some really big days , followed immediately after by a lull or a rest day as good as the victories feel , you need to remember that you are ill and you 'll feel the aftermath of a fantastic day when you wake up in the morning my body usually feels like it has been run down by a bus on my rest days i could n't move far even if i wanted to just remember it 's ok to feel that way and do n't allow anyone to push you beyond a pace that 's comfortable for you
