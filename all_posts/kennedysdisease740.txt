back in october of last year , i wrote an article , thephlegm story at the time , it seemed i was in a never ending battle with phlegm it wasn t just the quantity of phlegm , it was also the thickness of it looking back , i am amazed how the issue affected my daily life and my strength i am pleased to report that for the last two months the phlegm issue is under control let me tell you what i discovered and what i did about the problem note please check with your doctor before trying anything drug related , even if it is over the counter first , i had a good discussion with my doctor about the issue he came up with two potential causes and we discussed what to try initially second , i found that certain foods generate far more phlegm than others do dairy products are now consumed in moderation soy oil products can also be an issue if i am aware of what i m eating and when i eat them , it makes a difference i try to consume phlegm generating products for breakfast or lunch this gives me several hours to clear my system before bedtime third , choking generates an over abundance of phlegm if i am cautious when chewing and swallowing , the choking issue is not an issue or at least an infrequent issue fourth , when i am generating more phlegm , a half teaspoon ml of guaifenesin i e mucinex or a similar generic product in the evening clears the problem right up within a few hours only rarely in the beginning did i have to take a half teaspoon earlier in the day and , remember to drink more water when using guaifenesin i find it helpful to have a glass of water first thing in the morning a side effect of this phlegm issue was the constant clearing of my throat several times an hour recently , i might clear my throat times a day
