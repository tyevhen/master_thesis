i'm home and recovering from my back surgery my surgery on monday went very well the surgeon was able to remove a larger than expected l disc fragment , which had already calcified , without having to cut through the vertebra so i still have all of my vertebral bone intact usually the surgeon needs to cut a small window in the vertebra in order to reach the disc fragment , but my disc fragment had extruded so far laterally , he was able to get at it without having to cut through the bone i think that 's a good thing i woke up in the recovery room relieved i was able to wiggle all my toes paralysis , though only a risk , was possible i was in pain , but the pain was almost all in my back rather than in my left leg , so that was a good thing , too as i sit here right now , my left leg is pain free and the numbness and tingling i had prior to surgery is almost gone i'm thrilled my strength , too , is returning my left quads and hip seem to be back to nearly full function they are less weak than they were prior to surgery i continue to have foot drop , but i knew the foot drop would likely take several weeks to resolve i'm hopeful that 's the case , and anxious to regain that strength foot drop is now the only thing between me and eventually running again i have a ton of movement and lifting restrictions for the next weeks that 's going to be tough , but i'm going to do my best to be a good patient i 've already gained pounds , and things that used to be muscular , like my tummy , have gotten soft as a runner , that 's really difficult to deal with i guess i 'll just have to quit looking in the mirror for a few months the only exercise i'm allowed right now is taking very short walks multiple times per day sounds easy , but so far , it has n't been i get really tired and really stiff after walking just half a block jet , too , is going a bit nuts i feel really bad , as there 's nothing i can do to relieve his boredom i ca n't even take him on my short walks if he pulled suddenly , i 'd be screwed i guess we 're both going to be soft , heavy and stir crazy by the time i heal it 's going to be a long road , but at least i'm on my way to healing now i'm moving in the right direction , and there is an end in sight that 's way better than what was happening over the past weeks i'm grateful for that , and i'm looking forward to eventually getting back to my life despite everything , my life is good and i'm hopeful it will only get better from here
