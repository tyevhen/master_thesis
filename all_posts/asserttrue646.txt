every once in a while , i persist a web page to disk maybe it 's an airline itinerary , or whatever , and i like to make notes to myself in the page before saving it i have a mozilla jetpack script that lets me edit the web page directly in firefox before saving it it works by setting the document property designmode to on if you 're not familiar with this technique , i blogged about it previously here the jetpack script puts a menu command in the right mouse context menu for the page , called edit this page see screenshot below the menu command is at the bottom it would have been simple to just have the script set designmode to on and then have another script , with a menu command of disable editing , that sets it to off , and perhaps have the menu command label toggle back and forth depending on the mode the page is in but i decided that would be a poor ui decision when a page is in edit mode , there should be some sort of always visible indication of that fact otherwise you could forget why the page 's links are n't working , for example also , there needs to be a quicker , easier way to turn off page editing than to go back to a menu command hence , i decided not to do a disable editing menu command instead , i put a bright red design mode flag at the top of the page and make it non scrollable so it 's always in view to exit design mode , you just have to click anywhere in the red design mode label the label immediately goes away and you 're back to a normal non editable page the red design mode indicator is a little obnoxious , but it 's that way by design in any event , the code for doing all this is fairly short and self explanatory the only non obvious part , i think , is obtaining a reference to the current page 's or tab 's document , which in jetpack you have to access via jetpack tabs focused contentdocument aside from that , the code is pretty straightforward jetpack future import menu jetpack menu context page add label edit this page , command function enabledesignmode get a reference to the current page 's dom document jetpack tabs focused contentdocument var indicator text design mode var indicator style 'position fixed ' 'top px left px z index ' 'font color black ' 'background color red padding px ' var modeindicator createindicator indicator text , indicator style document body insertbefore modeindicator , document body firstchild function stopdesignmode document body removechild modeindicator document designmode off exit design mode when the indicator takes a click modeindicator addeventlistener click , stopdesignmode , false this line makes the page editable document designmode on function createindicator text , style var span document createelement span span setattribute style , style span innerhtml text bold return span end enabledesignmode the code is public domain do with it as you will no warranties of any kind are made , blah cubed
