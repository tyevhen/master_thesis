among the creationists dispatches from the anti evolutionists front line by jason rosenhouse , narrated by george orlando this is the story of rosenhouse 's exploration of creationism rosenhouse is an intelligent , rational mathematician and declared atheist though the way he describes his beliefs i 'd put him in the agnostic category myself he decided in college to explore the seemingly irrational views of ultra conservative christians to try to understand how they can possibly deny evolution this book describes his journey through conferences , museums , and personal conversations it also has a light smattering of history of the creationist evolutionist debate this was a surprisingly considerate and fair book considering the fact that it was coming from an atheist talking about creationists from the beginning , rosenhouse insisted that although he was well known as that atheist guy who goes to creationist conferences , he was almost always treated with respect and kindness this is possibly because his main goal was to educate himself rather than to change anyone 's mind he did , of course , make public comments questions to the speakers at the conferences , but they always were polite and seemed to be answered politely as well despite this even handedness , there were a few times that i cringed while reading this book for instance , he lumped intelligent design , theistic evolution , christian science and and other lesser known ideologies all in with creationism he even said that they were pretty much the same thing they 're really not , though denying the possibility of evolution is not the same as saying that god directed evolution yes , i can see where an atheist might think the second option was n't sensible either but the basic difference remains one set denies evolution altogether the other does not to me , and i would imagine to many atheists as well , an all out denial of the evidence for evolution is less sensible than saying god directed the evolution another lapse in his even handedness was when he criticized the creationists as being name callers as if that does n't go both ways trust me , i 've been disappointed in interviews and essays by prominent evolutionary theorists like stephen jay gould and richard dawkins scientists can disparage and name call too from what i could tell of his book , the conferences were all about getting together with people who totally agree with you to say here 's what we agree on , now how can we get others to see the light ? then they 'd have the requisite book signings and other gatherings so rosenhouse had plenty of time to hobnob in his book , he related several interesting conversations between himself and creationist individuals most of these conversations seemed to include teenagers he 'd give information about which authors to read if they wanted to learn more about evolution , or just have an interesting discussion about the points of each argument i imagine he had a lot of conversations with teenagers because they 're less jaded about trying to convince people of their points of view this was an interesting book , and i'm glad i read it it had some shortcomings noted above , but listening to this book actually educated me on certain things for instance , years ago i was turned off by richard dawkins when i heard an npr interview in which he disregarded a question from a creationist this question could have been easily answered it was the old how could evolution be scientifically possible when entropy chaos is always increasing ? this is the second law of thermodynamics the answer is entropy always increases in a closed system a closed system is one that does n't have any exchange of energy with the outside like the entire universe there 's only one universe there 's nothing that it can exchange energy with on the other hand , earth is not a closed system it 's always losing atmosphere to the space surrounding it it 's always getting light and heat from the sun that 's called an open system animals are open systems too we breathe , we eat , we poop that 's energy exchange evolution took place in an open system , therefore the second law of thermodynamics does n't apply and there is no contradiction ok , maybe that was n't easy to explain point is , dawkins could have answered the question politely instead of rudely disregarding it although i still think dawkins was in the wrong , after reading this book i now understand how frustrating it might be to be constantly answering exactly the same question over and over and people ignoring my answer
