if you told me on the day that i could n't leave the house , that i was to move up country and to become independent , i would have thought you were out of your mind because back then when my legs would n't even allow me to walk towards the front door , when i could n't even step inside my therapists' office without completely losing control , and seventeen year old amy had to start from the very beginning , the possibility of even living a full life seemed a day that i would never be able to experience but what i did n't realise , was that as time went on i would slowly improve with hours of counselling , cbt and medication , i would slowly be rebuilding my life i would slowly begin to leave the house and walk to the shop at the end of the road i would be able to catch public transport with friends , then alone , then without panic attacks the ability to ask for something would become easier and going to the doctors would n't be as scary getting on a train and taxi by myself , would be something that i could cope with and going to school would eventually be something i could just about handle my opportunities would grow alongside my achievements and after years i would be able live some sort of a life right now , is a day i never ever thought i 'd see , but only only ever dream of when depression and anxiety were eating me up , i did n't see there ever being a way out i just want you to understand that you can get there it 's not easy and you may not take any notice of this , because i know i would have thought that it would have been impossible for any of this to ever happen but it does get better i am slowly getting there , even though i once thought there was no point in living a life in such a way but , i 've figured after all of this that although this journey takes away opportunities , it gives you so much that you can learn from please keep going , amy xx
