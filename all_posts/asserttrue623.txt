i note with interest that the apache lucene community has recently decided to merge the development of two of its best known sub projects lucene java and lucene solr as a result , both code bases now sit under the same trunk in svn and solr runs off the latest lucene code at all times release artifacts will remain separate lucene remains a core search engine java library and solr will remain a search server built on top of lucene so why the change ? the way things worked in the past , with many overlapping committers , quite a few features that could have benefitted lucene ended up being placed in solr such features may have belonged in lucene , but due to dev issues , it was often best for solr to keep certain features that were contributed by solr developers under solr s control if some of this code were moved to lucene it could mean that a solr committer who wrote and committed the code might actually lose the ability to maintain it without the assistance of a lucene committer , and meanwhile , there could be long waits for lucene bug fixes to be available in solr trunk with merged dev , there is now a single set of committers across both projects everyone in both communities can now drive releases so when solr releases , lucene will also release , hence no more concerns about having to sometimes release solr on a development version of lucene now solr will always be on the latest trunk version of lucene also , lucene benefits from greater test coverage , as now a developer can make a single change in lucene and run tests for both projects no matter how you look at it , it 's a win win situation one that probably should have happened sooner but hey , better late than never
