i saw it in a posting on pinterest i had read it elsewhere before , but today it resonated life is n't about waiting for the storm to pass it 's about learning to dance in the rain why did it resonate today ? it was n't just about the gathering monsoon storm that is darkening the skies , making the air thick and the desert fragrant with the lingering scent of creosote it 's what i see and hear and feel around me complicated lives with a mix of love and pain and tears and laughter there is the close and dear friend whose husband is about to go into hospice another beloved friend , having survived the pain of uncoupling after many years of marriage , is re awakening to the joy he had nearly forgotten there are friends experiencing serious health concerns and new physical limitations lives are forever changed by the storms we encounter as we age even in the absence of major losses and challenges , many of us experience some life turbulence office politics , misunderstandings with friends or family , struggles with troublesome personal traits and flaws i'm still engaged in my lifelong struggle to find a healthy balance between the work i love , self care and being present and supportive of loved ones while the challenges of my work life balance issues pale next to some of the life storms my friends are experiencing , i'm increasingly aware of my longtime tendency to defer fun or leisure or time with beloved others until the work is done , the project finished what is that ? i'm in my seventies , for heaven 's sake if i ca n't embrace all the pleasure and love and moments of happiness now , when will i ? while not everyone has my scrambled life work priority problem , many of us have a tendency to say i 'll be happy when and then name some distant event or goal it may be that you imagine happiness when you lose that stubborn pounds or when your daughter finally gets married or when , at long last , you take that exotic vacation or when you 're able to retire but we can be happy now if we see happiness not as the ultimate goal but as something that happens as our lives happen in warm memories during times of grief , in joking with co workers to ease the tension of a difficult team project , in pausing on a busy day to cuddle a sleeping baby or a delighted pet happiness happens in a glance , a touch , a moment of quiet intimacy on a perfectly ordinary day especially when one is experiencing a major life crisis or transition , it 's understandable when the shock or grief or fear overwhelms everything else in our lives at least for a time but whether one is caught up in life changing crises or simply trying to get through an ordinary day that is definitely a mixed bag of emotions , it 's possible to know happiness if you can dance in the rain this may mean laughing between the waves of pain in the present the ability to laugh between the pain , to dance in the rain , can make us stronger for the next wave of pain , the next storm , to come this may mean treasuring good times , shared love and warm memories even more , newly aware of how finite life can be this may mean finding ways to be happy or simply content in between the moments of grieving or of fear and frustration when facing a life changing health problem or between times of setting and reaching a goal there is joy in the journey as well as as well as the destination for example , i 've learned to celebrate all the numbers on the scale as i continue with my very long weight loss effort it makes me smile when i think how slender and energetic i feel as the numbers go down and remember how fat and terrible i felt at the same weight when i was in the process of gaining those pounds this also may mean taming the habit of perpetual busyness re ordering priorities to make room in our lives for fun and love and the beauty around us it can mean smelling the roses , cheering another person on , listening instead of planning a response , paying attention to what matters most to those we love my friend with the ailing husband cuddles beside him , reading him the mysteries and thrillers he has always loved from time to time , there is a moment when they pause , smile at each other , and whisper love you and love you more and in their eyes is a heartfelt celebration of all they have shared over the years my friend beginning a new life alone after many years of marriage has been through so much pain but , as his new life evolves , there is so much to celebrate as well a stomach no longer tied in knots , a place entirely his own for the first time in his life , a loving family supportive both of him and of his former wife , dramatically improved health , a sense of freedom and quiet contentment there are so many ways and so many reasons to dance in the rain
