i find it interesting to consider what life must have been like for my mother s brother he was the first known case of kennedy s disease in our family at that time , he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy because doctors didn t know about spinal bulbar muscular atrophy his family lived on a farm in south dakota i ve seen pictures of him in a wheelchair next to a two story farmhouse with five steps leading up to the porch all the bedrooms were on the second floor outhouses were often the only facilities available , especially in the winter when pipes froze up if you were wealthy , you might have a bathroom in the house there was no such thing as handicapped accessible around the farm or in town no ramps , steps everywhere , few sidewalks and plenty of gravel or dirt roads wheelchairs did not appear to be very comfortable and many didn t even fold up the first commercially offered electric powered chairs didn t appear until the s i envision the term caregiver taking on an entirely different perspective in those days somehow my uncle managed to maintain a reasonable and meaningful life today , it is easy to complain about a business not handicap accessible , or , one just modified to the minimum guidelines of the law and , it is frustrating when no handicap parking is available i have written about adapting in earlier posts we adapt as the motor neurons die and the muscles atrophy we don t like what is happening we often complain yet , if we are to maintain a meaningful life , we still must adapt i am just thankful that i live in a time where being handicapped is far less restrictive if interested , below are several posts on adapting http kennedysdisease blogspot com clinging to what was html http kennedysdisease blogspot com then realization sets in html http kennedysdisease blogspot com life just isnt fair html http kennedysdisease blogspot com maturing process html http kennedysdisease blogspot com coping is another form of acceptance html http kennedysdisease blogspot com compensation another good word html http kennedysdisease blogspot com coping skills mind heart and life html
