raising children with reactive attachment disorder can be emotionally draining for the mom we can feel like failures we feel unloved and sometimes unlovable we say things we regret we regret we do n't say things we do not feel understood we feel alone our homes have been physically destroyed we worry about what we have done to our other children , to our spouses , to ourselves do any of those thoughts sound familiar ? at one point they sounded like me sure there are times when one of the thoughts pops into my head but not for long i went to attachment therapy where i did feel understood and heard there i also learned about caring for myself one of my problems was emotional eating this has been a battle for a long time but it became much worse after the boys came and we began to deal with rad i figured out that i ate when i was sad , when i was stressed , when i was angry rather than deal with my ugly feelings i ate them of course , the good feeling was only for a moment and then i felt even worse so would eat more to make the feeling go away again first of all , acknowledge that you are eating your feelings rather than dealing with them then start talking find a friends , a therapist , a pastor , but start talking you need to learn to let it out and deal with what is going on inside find an alternative once you have started talking find something else to do with those feelings exercise , prayer , prayer while you exercise , a hobby , a place in your room where you can go to read down load books from online at your local library for free on to your mp player and go listen take care of yourself , your body , soul and spirit when i started taking care of my body i found that i felt better good food gives energy , junk food drains it being overweight made me sluggish , being in better shape not as good as i want gives me energy and widens the number of activities i can do feeling physically strong also makes me emotionally stronger because i do n't get so tired realize that food is not your friend it is merely nutrition , fuel to get the job done would you put junk food in the gas tank of your car ? hardly our job is tough take care of the machine god gave you to do it with have a healing day for you !
