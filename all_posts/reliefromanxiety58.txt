i cannot stress this enough early intervention is so important as people say 'old habits die hard' and this true in terms of mental illness as years go by , the more you will reinforce your actions , thought patterns and reactions this in turn , makes it harder for you to break them i know that this is true for myself i had been using the same safety behaviours for many years and i had the same thought patterns , kind of being stuck at at young age whilst growing older in this way , i had felt too young and anxious to drive , to have a job , to catch a bus and so on but , with proper counselling and cbt i am finally getting to a point where i have almost retrained my thought patterns , so that i think and react in different ways i know that this would have been easier many years earlier , but i did n't know i had a problem with my mental health for many years for those that do , it 's so important that you get help as early as possible do n't get me wrong , the mental health services we have here in the uk are pretty poor , but that does n't mean that you should be put off by a doctor who does n't understand or a long waiting list i have been there the longer you rely on your old ways , the more ingrained it becomes and the harder it is to get out of it that does n't mean that you wo n't , it just might take you longer i so wish that there better mental health services , so we could nip the problem in the bud before it even begins to grow imagine , if even children could be taught about mental health and have access to someone who they could talk to at such a young age i feel the problems could be lessened , so that it would n't necessarily be as of a big problem as they got older even though the mental health services are n't amazing , talking , doing your own cbt , and even going down to your local gp are all steps in the right direction and i strongly encourage those struggling to take a stand and take a step towards their recovery it 's not easy , but it 's definitely worth it you can get there best wishes , amy xx
