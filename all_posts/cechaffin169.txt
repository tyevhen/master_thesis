this is the th post on my blog , begun in july of , which means my next post must be triumphant , apopleptic , egregious and all encompassing or a mildly entertaining read i thought i 'd use today 's numerically less significant post to compose a spontaneous poem here goes halloween i carved a cat face shadow in a pumpkin our teeth are always breaking down dentists prepare the perfect crown after the candle the display was passable protect your temporary crown do not chew up , do not chew down light leered through lens of feline eyes , my knife work softened by the glow the cat did not appear a threat dentists carve the dead stuff out , that burning smell you know the drill the pumpkin looked respectable i sat in an orange volkswagen convertible of leather and chrome and wished the ragtop were my own i love the new car smell of it , like cinderella in her coach goddamn my tooth ! it hurts like shit ! day by day the pumpkin turned more hideous , frosted with mold in dangling white or speckled black i 've always driven convertibles , ah the smell of eucalyptus groves ! furry white fungus hung from feline eyes soon its mien began to look like satan the light along its ears turned into horns the temporary crown must be respected sans chew , sans gum , sans mints , sans everything if the gourd turned evil in my care the candlelight would guard against despair soon after i employed this course of action the jack o lantern fell into the garden , a humpty dumpty wannabe from hell if it was evil i will never know but as for toothaches , pain is pain pain writes the history of the body well , that was fun ! comments appreciated much to report but the poem wore me out long day in court i wore a tie for the first time since august at rachel 's memorial i think i might have won my case our former landlord is a lightly gilded though not gelded asshole kilobunnies , ce
