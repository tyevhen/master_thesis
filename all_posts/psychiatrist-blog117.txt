in today 's edition of usatoday , there is an article titled mental health spending is up , new medicare data shows the article notes medicare providers got more for mental health and specialty care including sports and sleep medicine in , according to new payment data released monday that shows which healthcare providers received the most money among the biggest changes spending on psychiatry was up , to million okay , so i want to point out that in , psychiatry changed how we code and there was the introduction of new cpt codes at the time , the complexity and absurdity of breaking down minute by minute break down of each session into psychotherapy versus evaluation management seemed absurd , but we all eventually fell into breaking our appointments down into a set of codes that captures what we do it meant that bills sent to medicare reflected an e m portion plus a psychotherapy portion , and the result was a much higher amount that could be billed charged then under the old minute psychotherapy with medication management code so if you suddenly increase the amount that a service is compensated , why is it surprising that mental health spending went up ? just sayin'
