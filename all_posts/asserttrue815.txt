opencalais is one of the most innovative and potentially disruptive online services to hit the web in recent memory to understand its importance , you have to be a bit of a geek , preferably a text analytics or computational linguistics geek , maybe an information access or search geek , or a reasonably technical content technology freak who understands the potential uses of metadata it 's not easy to sum up opencalais in a few words suffice it to say , though , if you have n't heard of opencalais before , you should visit http www opencalais com it 's an interesting undertaking , to be sure one of the services opencalais exposes is automatic extraction of entity metadata from text if you call the opencalais service using the proper arguments , you can essentially pass it any kind of text content you want an article , a blog , a wikipedia entry , an obama speech , whatever and the service will hand you back an itemized list of the entities it detected in the text entities means things like names of persons , cities , states or provinces , countries , prices , e mail addresses , industry terms almost anything that would qualify as a proper noun or a term with special significance not just keywords the opencalais service brings back more than a list of terms it also reports the number of occurrences of the terms and a relevancy score for each term the latter is a measure of the relative semantic importance of the term in question to the text in question this score can help in determining cut offs for automatic tagging , ordering of metadata in tag clouds , and other purposes it 's a way to get at the aboutness of a document opencalais does many , many things beyond entity extraction but you should already be able to imagine the many downstream disruptions that could occur , for example , in enterprise search if text analytics as a service or heaven forbid , machine learning as a service were to catch on bigtime the opencalais api is still growing and evolving it 's at an early stage , but it 's already amazingly powerful , yet easy to use writing a semantic ajax app is a piece of cake my first experiment with opencalais involved openoffice i use openoffice intensively as a direct replacement for the microsoft office line of shovelware , and although openoffice like office has more than its fair share of annoyances , it also has some features that are just plain crazy useful , such as support for macros written in any of four languages python , basic , beanshell , and javascript the javascript binding is particularly useful , since it 's implemented in java and allows you to tap the power of the jre but i'm getting ahead of myself what i decided to try to do is create an openoffice macro that would let me push a button and have instant entity extraction here 's the use case i 've just finished writing a long business document using openoffice , and now i want to develop entity metadata for the document so that it 's easier to feed into my company 's lucene based search system and shows up properly categorized on the company intranet to make it happen , i want as a user to be able to highlight select any portion of the document 's text , or all of it , then click a button and have openoffice make a silent ajax call to the opencalais service two seconds later , the metadata i want appears , as if by magic , at the bottom of the last page of the document , as xml ideally , after reviewing the xml , i would be able to click an accept button and have the xml vanish into the guts of the odf file i wrote a line script that does this the source code is posted at http sites google com site snippetry home opencalais macro for openoffice please note that the code wo n't work for you until you get your own opencalais license key and plug it into the script at line no for space reasons , i'm not going to explain how to install an openoffice macro or create a toolbar button for it after it 's installed that 's all standard openoffice stuff the key to understanding the opencalais macro is that all we 're doing is performing an http post programmatically using java called from javascript remember that the javascript engine in openoffice is actually the same rhino based engine that 's part of the jre this means you can instantiate a java object using syntax like var url new java net url http www whatever url opening a connection and posting data to a remote site over the wire is straightforward , using standard java conventions the only tricky part is crafting the parameters expected by opencalais it 's all well documented on the opencalais site , fortunately lines of the source code show how to query opencalais for entity data you have to send a slightly ungainly chunk of xml in your post no big deal for testing purposes , i ran my script against text that i cut and pasted into openoffice from an associated press news story about bernard madoff 's customer list the investment advisor who showed his clients how to make a small fortune out of a large one opencalais generated the following metadata in roughly three seconds ! use of the calais web service is governed by the

text in a word processor can generate semantically rich metadata in real time without leaving the word processor environment , using no it resources and at no cost opencalais is free to all with very little work , the entire process could be made to happen transparently the author does n't even have to know anything 's happening over the wire at check in time , his or her document is already a good semantic citizen , by magic this is just one tiny example of what can be done with the technology maybe you can come up with others ? if so , please keep me in the loop i'm interested in knowing
