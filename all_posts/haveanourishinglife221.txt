photo taken by the one and only , craig ! writing has opened doors and windows for me i have kept a journal since i was a girl blogging is way different than i thought it would be i have to have a point i have to make each entry polished and clean in my journaling experience , i would ramble and either feed my anger or wallow in my sadness when writing a post , i have discovered that i can give purpose to my daily scribbles the more i write in this way , the more honest i want to be i have already experience numerous vulnerability hangovers some days , i can easily express my soul and the words on the page seem to take on a different life of their own sometimes , a piece that i think might be dumb , ends up being someone s fav those moments are grand today is not one of those moments ever since i started posting , i ve tried to write from where i am now sometimes , all i can do is say it in a prayer , a poem , or a bunch of silly quotes sometimes , i ca n't say write anything at all for days and sometimes , the lyrics to a song can say it better than i ever could this is today s song , well , really just today 's line you were made to fill a purpose that only you can do you can listen to the mystery song here
