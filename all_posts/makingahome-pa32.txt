looking through her daddy 's picks , trying to find the oh so perfect one daddy getting everything tuned lily is going to be starting guitar lessons she 's been asking for at least the last year , but we 've always told her no , not now however , considering that she 's still interested , still asking , and was so interested that she was willing to buy the guitar with her own money she had saved up , we decided to go ahead and go with it you never know until you try , right ? brad picked her guitar up yesterday she found out he was picking it up around lunchtime , and so began the incessant questioning , is daddy going to be home soon ? ? ? ! ! ! she was very excited i can relate i know how exciting it is to wait in anticipation for something you really want and , of course , our dinner sat on the table untouched for about minutes after brad got home and delivered the guitar into her hands she just had to play on it for a bit and brad taught her a chord or something i do n't know anything , really , about guitars and told her to keep practicing that over and over until she had it down brad took about a year or so of formal guitar lessons so he knows enough to teach her some basics , but the plan is to find her a guitar teacher i have some possibilities that i'm waiting to hear back from before we get rolling in the meantime , she 'll learn what she can from her daddy it was really rather sweet last night watching the two of them sitting across from one another , strumming on the strings a memory etched in my heart and mind
