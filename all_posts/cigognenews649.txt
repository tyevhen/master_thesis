with connection , feelings have found a home , and the system can rest the person no longer has to engage in compulsive hand washing because she unconsciously feels dirty remember , that the higher pre frontal regulatory systems have connections with the brainstem limbic areas with information going in both directions we can feel our feelings , and we can block those feelings when they are too hurtful with a weaker pre frontal cortex to handle input , we have amygdala driven feelings that impact our higher centers directly , possibly driving us into unceasing mental activity if there were ever a universal affliction , it is that unceasing activity people cannot sit still and relax movement as an imprint may have meant life at birth , and it does so now as a memory reconnecting the brain there is more and more evidence that brain tissue at the extreme anterior front part of the pre frontal cortex is responsible for integration of emotional states the recent work of a yale team , patricia goldman rakic and pasco rakic , focused on the corpus callosum the bridge between right and left brains in which they developed a model of symmetry in the brain what they state is that cells in the corpus callosum are marked so as to attach to mirror image cells on both sides of the brain there may be either a certain resonating frequency that helps each side recognize each other or there may be a chemical affinity that allows cells on one side to join up connect with cells on the other side or both as i mentioned , unproved connected memory may exist when lower level imprints resonate with the same frequencies higher up in the brain when the pre fontal cortex and sub cortex meet , there seems to be a pattern of recognition it s kind of like finding a soul mate more possibly , the lower level imprints rise to seek out their other half higher in the nervous system once joined , they form an integrated , unified circuit it would seem that brain cells know when they have arrived at connection because the receptors on axons are found only on the correct target nerve cell there is some evidence now that even in the womb , the brain is preparing itself for life in our world so the fetus has recapitulated life in ancient history and is now preparing for life on the planet where each new level broadens our conscious awareness each new level is an elaboration of the previous lower level until we arrive at full consciousness critical here is the concept of connection the merging together of related neural networks there is a unity of nature that happens only with connection neuro psychologic laws do exist it is up to us to find them very early feelings exist in a sensory only language have , in the past , been impossible to access and resolve the lower levels talk to us all of the time in their own language racing heart , highs blood pressure , but we never listen and have lost the ability to communicate with them we don t talk their language , and yet we must for survival otherwise , we fall sick early in life and our lifespan is much , much shorter because though the language is a one way street we continue to drive on the wrong side of the nervous system the left intellectual and lose our orientation we try to get to the right feeling side with the left , and we can t get there from here we know that early events even before birth are imprinted throughout the system and largely onto the right brain these events can occur before there is a functioning left pre frontal cortex to make sense out of them and by the time we do have that portion of the cerebral cortex the pain on the right , severe because it involves matters of life and death at birth and before , is repressed and results in a disconnection between the two sides and from lower to higher brain centers moreover , the connecting links are not as yet matured this process is called repression or gating or , as it is often called in the scientific literature , dissociation remember , it is the very early prebirth traumas that find their way onto the right brain the right brain , then , becomes the repository of the unconscious becoming conscious means reconnecting the pain to conscious awareness connection means awareness even when the event has no words or scenes we can be aware of a lack of oxygen during birth or of the agony of being twisted around due to breech presentation that awareness is every bit as crucial as an awareness of events at the age of six even though there are no words to explain it sensing experiencing the pain is awareness it doesn t need words
