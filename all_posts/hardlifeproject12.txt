wordpress geeks are practically cumming in their pants over the release of wp thelonious , named after thelonious monk and being touted as the most exciting release to date of course , wp and were also the most exciting releases to date , so excuse me if i'm a bit skeptical but , the new feature list does look pretty cool if , like me , you use wp more for cms purposes than for straight blogging , the new menu functions and the ability to create your own content types could be handy they 've also merged wp and wp multi user into one package , so you can create multiple blogs from one installation think huffington post style i just got a new client who 's going to be my guinea pig for muuahahaha ! i guess it 's called thelonious because it allows for greater improvisation and freedom , but geeks are known for being a bit self aggrandizing , so we 'll see now i have to go update all my old installations of wp grrrrrrr !
