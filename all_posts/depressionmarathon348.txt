i apologize for the delay in posting things have been very busy in the etta sphere lately i had my employee holiday party saturday night and an outing with a friend on sunday night on one of the coldest nights on record ! add several scattered appointments over the last couple days , some running and weight lifting , and keeping up with friends , and you 've got a fairly decent picture of my life lately i 've been busy the employee party saturday was extremely fun ! i work with a wonderful group of people as i mentioned in my previous post , i was a bit concerned about crashing after the party , but i'm happy to report i did n't i was so tired after all the conversation , game playing , and laughter i went straight to bed when i got home i did n't really have time for my mood to crash before i fell asleep i guess that 's one way to prevent a crash my running is getting a little easier i 've dropped a few of the pounds i gained during this last depression episode , which has certainly helped neither my legs nor my lungs are anywhere near ready to handle high mileage yet , but i 've felt less muscle fatigue , and i 've breathed easier during my recent runs that 's encouraging i 've got miles scheduled for this weekend , so we 'll see if that trend continues the biggest news is that i began my two week , intensive , outpatient , mood disorder treatment program today it was a looong day ! the program runs am to pm with minute groups and minute breaks throughout the day i'm a napper i need a lot of sleep i knew going in that staying alert throughout the day would be tough , and it was ! my hope is that it will get easier as my body adapts to the new schedule if i do n't adapt , it 's going to be a long two weeks ! despite the long day , however , i was impressed with the program i think i will learn some new skills to manage this chronic , life altering condition so many of us share i have struggled lately with feelings that the depression was winning our battle , but today gave me some hope that i will stand atop the mountain in the end and that 's what i wish for all of you , too hope carry on , friends
