ahhh , yes the holidays nothing brings out one 's long stuffed anxieties and resentments with more alacrity than the holidays this morning , the resentment gurgled in my mother 's voice , as she explained how difficult it is to schedule our christmas meal around the family gatherings of each of my brothers' wives i had to bite my lip i wanted to remind her how long it had been since she had any scheduling worries , as i ca n't remember the last time all of us got together ! i just listened instead it 's been a long , long time since all of us have been together for a holiday sure , we live all over the place , but the reality is we just do n't care enough to get together just because we are family does n't mean we like each other ! it took a long time for me to be okay with that my family gets along much better when we each live at least a toll call apart ! getting together , when you come from a terribly dysfunctional family , is not usually a joyous occasion we do n't yell , or drink , or beat each other up , but it 's just not fun there 's tension there 's sarcasm there 's back handed compliments , which are really put downs in disguise sounds fun , does n't it ? fun fun is not what comes to mind when i think of gathering with my family for christmas my long lost i thought they were lost anxieties and resentments have been tapping my shoulder all week seriously , i can almost hear them ! tap , tap , tap peek a boo , remember me ? for example , i have no desire to see the brother who lambasted me with sharp , hurtful sarcasm and anger , without cause , over one year ago as i wrote in april , despite apologizing for my part , i do not expect he will ever do the same he does n't know how we 've not spoken since his last hurtful e mail i typically do n't think about him nor the entire scenario , but faced with possibly spending two days with him changed that tap , tap , tap yoooooou hoooooo despite praying about it my sponsor 's suggestion and working to let go of my resentment , i am still hurt so hurt that i actually changed my plans he and his family will be the only absent family members when i join everyone at another brother 's house part of me thinks changing plans to avoid him is wrong i should be bigger , somehow but i do n't know depression has taught me to pick my battles i 've learned to conserve my energy and to expend it judiciously the tension and awkwardness of sharing space with my family is stressful enough , i think perhaps adding the hurtful brother to the mix would have been too , too much i think it would have , and the risk to my mood and energy was n't worth the risk holidays tear apart normal people i'm just emerging from a very difficult , hopeless period even on my best days , i'm not normal i did n't think it was worth the risk to my mental health to subject myself to more than i needed but i'm still not sure
