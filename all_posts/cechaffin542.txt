poetry thursday has requested sexy poems this week here 's mine beside the sleeping tiger come with me , love across this field of crimson poppies to a bed of rushes where the old tiger sleeps we will not wake him do not bring your purse or make up , shed your jeans and bra let your creamy legs part the scarlet meadow let the great pearls of your cheeks tease me as you glide ahead then lay your head down on the heaving stripes of this old killer 's belly and be at ease because he no longer dreams of violence but generation sleep that i may admire your vessel at my leisure softly you ll stir as i lick your pebbly areolas and tongue your nipples until you wake with that infantile , angelic smile of the truly loved aroused you 'll straddle me , breasts grazing my chest your moistness is better than cheating death flex your magnificent thighs quietly , as if in prayer we will not wake the tiger as for my mood , are n't you tired of reading about it ? yet the good news is , after increasing my zyprexa to mg at night always under the supervision of a physician , i have n't cried for two days and nature looks beautiful again and i can hug my wife naturally but i have come here before in this depression only to relapse for today , however , it is truly a miracle criticize the pharmaceutical industry if you will , but i praise them for their innovations that can save folks like me thine in hope , ce
