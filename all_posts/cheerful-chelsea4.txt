some people might question my commitment to being a mental health writer as i was silent across all platforms during mental health week a lot of people i follow on instagram and youtube utilised the time to spread messages that support the movement against stigma and silence of mental illnesses it surely was the perfect opportunity for me to do the same , particularly as the occasion coincided with my usual blog upload day unfortunately my illness does n't care for what day or week it is , even if it might be the perfect opportunity to post a true account of the pain i experience during a low period i can begin a week with a seemingly great plan for writing , filming and exercising only to end up diving head first into my duvet a week spent editing my video on my breast reduction surgery see it here that occurred last summer has put me into a strange head space of course the operation was a fantastic moment for me , i was finally taking the steps towards boosting my body confidence and self esteem after feeling trapped in a body i was n't comfortable with it 's allowed me to push my body beyond what i thought it was capable of in terms of fitness however , as i was editing the video i could n't help but think that i have n't progressed much further since the operation a week after the operation we were having a party , i was reunited with friends from university and we talked of work and my plans for my book i 've previously said that i would kick myself if i had n't got everything together by this summer it might not be here just yet but it is looming and i 've barely touched the pages in my desk draw i 've spent years working through events that transpired long ago , coming to conclusions on how they impacted my mental health and actions writing it all down comes easily enough to me , but reading over it all and attempting to put it all into chapters is incredibly overwhelming many people who attempt to write their memoirs often fail because it ends up being so damaging to their emotional and mental health so imagine attempting to do so when your mental health is already in tatters despite the pain and frustration of it all , i know that it 's something i desperately want other people to see one day creating things is what keeps me going and makes me excited there will always be days when my head goes down , but it will pop up again when i'm ready i seem to be constantly battling against society 's ideas of what progress looks like and what i 've learnt that it takes many forms check back in two weeks time for a post on how i track my progress
