in the latest journal of clinical psychiatry , there is a trial of divalproex depakote er for mania these patients were all hospitalized , so we re talking about a relatively severe group of patients the day study used the following measures mania rating scale mrs , manic syndrome scale mss , and behavior and ideations scale bis the authors noted that there was a statistically significant difference found between depakote and placebo on all three measures but wait , how much of an effect are we talking about ? did depakote outshine placebo by a large margin ? one is left wondering about this point , as the authors did not report the effect size of the difference between groups i calculated the effect sizes d and here is what i found for each measure mrs mss bis remember that the generally used criteria are d small , d medium , d large according to conventional standards , then , we re talking small beans here an advantage for depakote that was very small in size depakote also resulted in a significant increase in body weight kg compared to placebo kg kg in three weeks ? keep gaining weight at that rate over a year and you re looking at zyprexa ! the authors acknowledged no ghostwriters , but considering that four of the authors work for abbott the maker of depakote , i suppose they didn t need to hire out to find a friendly writer how else do you explain that there is no discussion of the wimpy gains in comparison to placebo ? ahhhh , when industry and science collide
