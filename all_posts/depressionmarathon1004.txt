the marathon is a unique challenge no matter how hard you 've trained , no matter how excellent your condition , no matter the forecast for the day , anything can happen another unique oddity of marathon training is pre race heaviness , which is what i'm experiencing now you 'd think a person would feel light and free and fast these final days after all , i'm running many fewer miles at increasingly relaxed paces yet , rather than a speeding cheetah , i feel more like a beached , pregnant whale how 's that for a visual ? ? heavy slow foggy this is not a pleasant feeling even in the best of times feeling this way prior to a race is hardly conducive to rising confidence i feel more like taking up my bed than stepping to a starting line ! alas , i should be used to the heaviness by now it 's happened previously yet , i ca n't help but worry i should n't worry i know it 's actually common to feel sloth like prior to a marathon the sudden decrease of hard training leads to a build up of energy stores , a good thing that makes one feel like lead at least that 's what i 've read but i'm never too sure when i feel like lead how can feeling heavy and slow be a good thing ? i'm worried unfortunately , there is nothing more for me to do now i ca n't go out and run bunches of miles , decreasing my energy stores and thereby lightening my load i ca n't go on a crash diet and lose ten pounds i ca n't change any of what 's already been done i'm either prepared , or i'm not , and right now that 's tough to accept regardless , i must accept i must accept the heaviness , stop the worry thoughts , and try to relax before the run if i do n't , i'm going to drive myself crazy before i ever step to that starting line !
