this photo was taken quite some time ago when paige was very small ! a few years ago i read an article somewhere that discussed chemicals that permeate our daily lives whether we want them to or not how , no matter how diligent , we are exposed to countless chemicals in our environment that are breathed , absorbed in our skin , etc many of these chemicals will never leave our bodies they stay in our systems we all have different levels of different toxins in our bodies and i guess we learn to live with them is n't that creepy ? it was a sort of you just live with it and go on sort of message i buried the sentiment deep inside , hoping to forget the entire topic and its creepiness some time ago , paige was on her changing pad as i prepared her for her nap at that particular moment , she was looking forlorn and a bit panicked at the prospect of separating from me for hours she 'd managed to accumulate a big fat tear , which i wiped away with my own lips in the form of a kiss on her cheek i then kissed each hand in the center of each palm and closed her fingers around them i remember saying here are my kisses , they will always be with you to remind you how much i love you see ? this is how you 'll carry my love with you no matter where you go forever and ever she seemed to calm and the nap began without a hitch in the weeks since , i tell her similar things whether it 's bedtime or nap time sometimes i 'll kiss her arms and act like i'm rubbing the kiss in as if it 's lotion i like to say let 's rub it in good , so it stays in there for always ! i was then reminded of that article about the chemicals and figure that i 'd much rather have kisses build up in my system i thought of all the kisses from my own mom and dad i 've been given throughout my life it 's a wonder i'm not swelled to a thousand pounds of weight in carrying those kisses it 's a comforting thought , to know that i carry the love in the form of kisses even my grandparents gave me as a small child even though they have been gone for many , many years i still carry their kisses as part of me it 's an idea that i treasure i find it so soothing i hope paige likes it too , and knows that no matter how far apart we are , i am always a part of her not just in dna , but in all the kisses i have given just for her i hope they will cloak her in love so she will always feel safe and warm the way i feel from all the kisses my parents have cloaked me in i carry them safely happy grandparent 's day a day late mom and dad and to my own grandparents who i believe are with me whenever i'm thinking of them which is often ! save you might also like happy paige happy holidays part birthday recap linkwithin
