this song came to mind last night as i was sitting in the emergency room waiting to see a doctor it had already been a long day i was stepping out of the shower , and even with my wife s help , when both knees buckled and i collapsed went straight down not forward or back my feet and legs were caught underneath me i kept on saying repeatedly , please , let nothing be broken i couldn t stand up , so we had to enlist the help of a neighbor to lift me into my wheelchair i was sore , but didn t notice any pain except for my two small left toes when i tried to stand , however , pain ! i ve heard the word crippling pain used before , and now i have a better idea what that feels like over the last years , i broke my tibia , fibula , ankle , and toes several times while living with kennedy s disease even the worst pain from these fractures couldn t hold a candle to this pain at one point in my attempt , i almost passed out on the pain chart , i would give it a solid , perhaps even a my left leg was worse than the right , but both were bad after several attempts , i realized we needed to see a doctor it was now dinnertime and everything was closed so , off to the emergency room at the hospital fortunately , the doctor knew about kennedy 's disease and this made the visit and diagnosis easier diagnosis both knees had hyperflexed hyperflexion and the left one was worse plus one broken toe and a sprained foot treatment a non steroidal injection worked very fast and some pain pills which i haven t t taken yet prognosis weeks to recover most likely case no exercises for several days and then only very light ones where i do not put excess pressure on the knees physical therapy might be needed today yesterday , i went free falling and today i am cautiously optimistic and more stable much less pain or on the scale and it is manageable broken toes still hurt , however , but you really can t treat them i have transferred four times this morning and it is acceptable and manageable a special thanks to my wife , neighbors and family for their help , thoughts and prayers they were needed and still are
