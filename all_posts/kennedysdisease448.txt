the question is not about giving birth it is about the kind , gentle , nurturing and loving person who is was always there for us my mother made me hot chocolate every morning because i loved it when she baked , she always made a little extra pie crust sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar because it was my favorite my mom always found a way to make each of the holidays special especially christmas she quizzed me every day for a week so i was ready for my confirmation exam my mother stayed up all night to support me while i finished my thesis because i procrastinated for a week ahead of time she waited up for me when i was out late to make certain i made it home safe my mom took in my wife and child to make certain they had a loving home while i was overseas serving my country she wrote me every week while i was in vietnam and sent care packages once a month i could go on , but you get the idea while growing up , we often took our mom s for granted , but fortunately they never took us for granted and , we always knew we were loved no matter what
