i do n't feel very verbal but these sonnets leak out of me i ca n't judge their worth for two reasons i'm depressed and i'm the author think of them as therapy no one could do a dark sonnet better than gerard manley hopkins i'm just toddling in his wake v put down the knife , lady , the candle s done you could not see to strike where is the blood ? it s in your mind violence is outdone by guilt s black bile trickling where you stood queen melancholy with your steel blue blade , whom did you try to murder but myself ? you d add another trophy to your shelf but i resist i will not be unmade depression sounds as common as a cold its remedies are legion as the dirt the soul killer is worse than we were told its black advance outflanks the deepest hurt still i d rather swallow pills in hope than to change my necktie for a rope vi hopkins said it best , no worst there is none but isn t it hubristic to declare that one has reached the limit of despair as in a total eclipse of the sun ? in that event a wild corona glows around the edges of the blackened moon , a fiery nimbus that as yet allows more than pure darkness in the afternoon what if there is a worst ? how will you deal if what despair you ve reached is christened hell before the devil gets in his appeal to drag you down to regions still more fell ? it s premature to label something worst unless the lord himself pronounce you cursed vii ah suicide , your beauty exceeds all , a blinding gown , a face so lightly veiled that i can see your black glass eyes enthrall an unsuspecting mark until inhaled your hands , so fine , as if made for the harp cannot be clasped without making an end you strum a dirge irreverently sharp designed to cut deeper than we can mend , sharp as addiction or the death of love , hard as affliction , colder than hate s hold the sickest kneel to you as if to move your soul to pity and die as they grow bold i hold back beauty is as beauty does why not give in ? i only know because kilorats , ce
