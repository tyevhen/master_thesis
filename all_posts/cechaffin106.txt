it 's hilarious to watch homer simpson google himself in his childllike narcissism , and no doubt many of us do it it 's amazing how google constantly pares references down for redundancy until they build up again when i google myself i find it much work i find published poems whose web pages i never bothered to save , comments about me at forums that i sometimes reply to , references from lists of which i'm not aware and it becomes work , and slightly unmanageable at that it 's like eavesdropping on oneself in the cyberworld but not oneself , rather the objectified self of one 's work since my metier is poetry , most of the references concern it , excepting my essays and contributions from my blog my music is starting to pop up since i added it to my website , and that 's gratifying but these objectified representations of me are not me nor are they celebrity even billy collins could walk through a supermarket unrecognized , one of the benefits or our arcane art no one wants to know the size of my underwear at least yet i do n't wear it as p d james wrote , privacy is the last luxury and through media overload , privacy is sacrificed for promotion , though in my case it 's the work and not me still i am horrified to see my address and phone number listed at various poets' lists in all of this i remind myself it 's the work , the process of the work , that counts , not the result or the resultant attention still , the web invites us to objectify ourselves in a way not heretofore seen i think the four greatest inventions in human history are fire , language spoken then written recorded history does not begin until about b c , the gutenburg press , and the internet think of that the most transforming technological advance in the last years has been within our lifetime the implications of big brother 's spying in this context are immense , but on the other hand , the sheer volume of information makes it somewhat unmanageable what search algorithms are for spit out into the ether and it will find a wall to dry on the convenience of the net is also incredible last night i wondered if moles were really blind , and i found that some can sense light and motion now i have to look into bats to make sure the trope , blind as a bat , is not undermined as well i read a new book by anny ballardini that is truly unique ghost dance in movements , essentially her master 's thesis for a mfa it chronicles avante garde movies in verse and quotations , trying to reproduce the experience of film in symbols a noble attempt , and one that spurs the reader to investigate the films she has chosen , which can be referenced through ubuweb it 's published by otoliths , whose journal i 've been lucky enough to appear in given the miracle of the web , i could write anny immediately through facebook and get a reply the world is shrinking , shrinking , shrinking , and you are part of it the objectification of humans is proceeding apace , and any yahoo can put up a website or start a magazine or put a movie out on u tube it 's amazing , this universal forum , and i think the greatest enemy of totalitarianism the world has ever seen imagine if the jews had had the internet during the beginning of their persecution in nazi germany the whole world would have known of it , and powers would have been summoned to their defense if the pen is mightier than the sword , then the internet is the most powerful engine to date in changing history , and we are a part of it as the exponential explosion of information proceeds , there will be little that is not known anymore , much less not available to anyone who wants to stick their nose in it when i think about my first computer and the dot matrix printer and the early manifestations of the internet and compare it to the canvas we now have , its evolution is also astounding and here i am , typing into the ether again i do n't know if i 've mentioned some new publications for your perusal so far two reviews are out about my book , one at the hobble creek review blog see feb th 's post and one in the new issue of centrifugal eye see pg i also have two poems in the issue moreover , ambush arts has featured me with a poem , an interview , an artist 's statment and myriad links john thomas treats his authors well , though it was difficult to qualify i first sent him five poems and he liked one , then asked me to send more he finally chose my recent , with my dog in the rain , from the second batch , which i posted here , though he had an editorial suggestion to which i submitted a demanding and discerning editor meanwhile i need to stop these literary activities and concentrate on my garden , which i 've avoided because of the recent weeks of rain this year i plan to plant only deer resistant flowers those of you who follow this blog will remember last year 's war with the deer , which i lost i do n't want any vegetables tempting them this time around false spring continues on the mendocino coast daffodils and hyacinths are blooming , even blackberry brambles all too early for our normal timeline even rhododendrons have begun it 's spring in february i 've also begun a theological correspondence with the christian editor of rose and thorn , a magazine that will soon feature another review of my book they have nominated me for a pushcart prize in the past , but i do n't think pushcart gives much credence to net publications so far the reviews are distinctly encouraging i may be a poet after all ! and have i spoken recently of the joy my dog , j alfred prufrock , gives me ? he walks me daily , and to see his diminutive form leap over the tall grass like a gazelle in pursuit of deer gives me unspeakable pleasure , pure joy in his athleticism and indomitable hunting instincts i love the daily experiences that transport me beyond language at kilobunny , ce
