alright well i have been feeling that i have bipolar disorder since i was , and i am now and it s getting worse my parents don t believe me at all when i tell them i think i have bipolar disorder they think i m jealous of the attention my brother gets because he has asperger s autism , which is a lie let me tell you about my symptoms i am so emotional and have major mood swings in fact , today was extremely moody for me today i was in absolutely the best mood ever this morning and was very hyper , then i became extremely depressed at school i became hyper again at school , then depressed again i came home and became hyper again , and recently just became depressed again i have almost committed suicide a few times as well i have different variations of my depression emotionless depression i literally feel absolutely no emotion , emotional depression emotionally unstable , lazy lethargic depression all i want to do is sleep and lay down all day i can literally think one minute wow , so many people love me and i have so many friends ! then the very next minute i am so depressed thinking i have absolutely nobody another thing you should know is that i have a very lustful mind i used to be addicted to cybersex having sex with people online , and i used it as an anti depressant drug so , i don t just use perverted things for perverted reasons , but also to get rid of the sadness another thing , but i don t know if this has anything to do with bipolar disorder , in fact it sounds more like something like autism , but i am absolutely terrible at connecting with people i am socially not there , i hardly ever talk , so people think i m shy i m not shy , i just never know what to do or say to make a connection and or relationship with someone ! and in case this plays an important role , my biggest fear in life is to have absolutely no friends or family or any relationship with anybody in my life , so i really wish i could connect with people more easily another thing , i feel very beside myself on this whole thing i know many people are going to think that it s just my hormones since i m , but trust me it s more than that i ve different since i was young , and as bipolar disorder is , it has been getting worse over the years i have a bad temper as well , i got it from my dad i m very sensitive and take hurtful things to heart and hold onto them for days or weeks i am also very very insecure and have a low self esteem i have a few weird things i obsess about too for one , i absolutely can t stand being in a room with no clocks almost every minutes i have to look at a clock to see what time it is could this be from stress or anxiety ? which brings me to another thing , i have extreme anxiety although i do find it hard to get close to people , the people i do get close to i get wayyy attached to i have many ridiculous fears as well like heights i also have the fear of going somewhere in public alone i feel very unsafe if i am alone in public i find myself playing the what if game , always saying to myself what if i get murdered or molested if i m somewhere alone ! ? i know that it s ridiculous but it s very scary to me i have diferent sides of me as well there s the side of me who loves everybody and wants to be their friend , and there s the side of me who hates everybody and think they all hate me since i have few close friends , the close friends i do have i feel like i burden them with my problems and stuff i ll stop now since i know you re getting very bored an answer would greatly be appreciated ! please don t put a link to a website , because i ve visited many bipolar sites also , don t say i should get diagnosed i ll do that when i turn my parents would never take me answer there are at least other common disorders that mimic bipolar including adhd , hormones , borderline personality disorder which is what yoru description really sounds like get yoru parents to tak you to a doctor do not try to tell your parents that you have bipolar or some other thing tell them the symptoms you have been living with and leave it up to the doctor to do the diagnosing people confuse mood with emotion mood affects everything about you your energy level , sleep patterns , appetite , emotional response which emotions you feel and how strongly , your judgment , sexual appetite , etc bipolar is not about being happy one minute then sad the next then mad , that is just having emotions the mood swings in bipolar last a very long time , weeks to months to years and the average bipolar only swings once or twice a year people never never understand the true severity of bipolar disorder they also do not understand that for an episode to be considered bipolar it has to last all day every day for a week that s the minimum , in reality the episodes last for weeks or months or even years there are cases where a person can have more than one or two episodes a year but it is really rare there is such a thing as ultradian cycling in which you cycle multiple times in a day but it is exceptionally rare and there are questiona about whether it is actually bipolar but instead borderline pd also you have to have the mania or hypomania for it to be bipolar without mania it is just recurring depression the mood swings in bipolar do not usually have a trigger they come and go very randomly if someone with bipolar is depressed or manic there is nothing you can do to bring them out of their mood short of medication this is what bipolar is like for me depression to tired to get out of bed , shower , brush your teeth lie in bed and stare at the ceiling for days at a time , crying a lot , feelings of guilt , and self loathing , may be suicidal but are too tired to even consider planning it , sleep hours a day or more , eating too much or not enough i get very paranoid and think that people are staring at me and laughing i feel like people know what i m thinking manic over the moon happy or filled with uncontrollable rage , hypersexual like masturbating times a day or sleeping with numerous men , strangers , your cousin decide you are bi because then there are twice as many people to have sex with , decide you are into bdsm and contract to be someones slave for a week , spending your mortgage money on african violets or some other useless things , driving your car mph , grandiose thoughts like thinking you can put a new furnace in your house by yourself , or thinking that you can be the president , quitting your job because you are buying lottery tickets with your last paycheck and you know you will win only sleep or hours a night and feel completely rested , can t concentrate , racing thoughts it sounds like people in your head all talking at the same time , talk really fast and loud because your mouth can t keep up with our mind drug or alcohol abuse is common again , this has to last for a minimum of a week to be considered a bipolar episode everyone with bipolar is a little different and at the severe end it includes hallucinations and delusions question bipolar no escape , how do i know what s real ? ok , this is really annoying i was just almost finished writing a question then deleted the whole thing ! so , i ll start again i was diagnosed with bipolar almost a year ago , although i ve probably known a lot longer basically , i ve tried lamictal which i was allergic to , lithium which numbed me out and now i m on seroquel to help me sleep the seroquel is no longer working as it should and my psychiatrist won t increase it because for some strange reason every now and then i get an allergic reaction to it makes no sense to me anyway , that s the medication side of it now , this last year or probably longer i have been trying to lose weight the lithium put weight on so i ve been pretty much starting and stopping with exercise , losing and then gaining the weight back these last few weeks i have maintained exercising every day for about hours i know myself well enough to know that it won t last and it will all come crashing down around me as it did yesterday i was fine one minute doing an aerobic workout from a dvd , then i was curled up in a ball on the bathroom floor strangely though i bounced back from that rather quickly and today managed to be relatively normal well as normal as it gets for me anyway my mood going up and down doesn t really bother or worry me because even though it sneeks up on me i still know what to expect the rest is really frustrating and heartbreaking along with the huge amount of energy i have been kind of living my own little reality out in my head i m not sure really how to explain it but i find myself pretty much all hours of the day , and when im dreaming , pretending that i m famous and have certain celebrities as friends it s pathetic i know but it is what it is sounds strange but it is so real that sometimes when i come back to reality i guess i feel as if i ve been taken from paradise and thrown into hell my world crashes around me as i realise none of it is real and it is so heartbreaking i wish i was dead this isn t the first time it s happened and i ve been trying really hard to find the pattern but it s not just when my mood is elevated either my question is , to all the other people out their with bipolar , is this a normal part of bipolar disorder ? because i realise a huge part is the mood swings and the paranoia which the seroquel has actually helped with but i find the hardest part is giving up that dream in my head the feeling that i was meant to be something more than i am i ve never wanted to be normal and i guess that s because i never have been a part of me likes the fact that i m bipolar because i experience the world on a completely different level to the average person and i loathe and fear desperately having to conform to a life of simplicity getting up every day to go to the same boring job , getting married and having a family all those things feel foreign and wrong to me quite honestly , and i realise how egotistic this sounds , i have always felt i was born to be someone important that my destiny was to become a famous actress author musician and use that power to help save the world through charity what i don t know is if that s the bipolar or just some really narcissistic part of me that should be dealt with or , if it s true and it is my destiny no matter how hard i try i can shake that feeling and it digs a hole deeper and deeper every time i realise that it will never happen i ve spent half of my years in therapy just trying to figure out what s wrong with me i have no job skills , i have never had any sort of acting lessons other than highschool drama and i m with a disability employment agency because i can t keep a simple job but despite all that i still have this gut wrenching feeling that my life is supposed to be something more i think the little world i ve built inside my head is part of that anyway , i know this is long and i m just rambling and have probably repeated myself over and over i m sorry , but i would really appreciate someone taking the time to read it and just giving me some insight i know everyone has a dream they wanted for their lives , but i can t just ignore it and be ok i think it will literally kill me and as awful as it sounds , i would rather be dead than be stuck in a meaningless life answer what you are describing sounds a bit like what i have , which is called maladaptive daydreaming it s a condition that causes excessive , obsessive daydreaming the daydreaming is often elaborate and detailed , like a book or movie take a look at this website to learn more http daydreamingdisorder webs com however , i m certainly not an expert by any means i don t know if your symptoms simply reflect your bipolar disorder that is a question that you really need to ask your doctor if no , then perhaps you could have both bipolar and md too also , keep in mind that maladaptive daydreaming is not an official disorder since it is just starting to be studied very few doctors will have heard of it hope this helps here are some forums for maladaptive daydreaming http health groups yahoo com group mal http wildminds ning com question risperdal question help please ? have you ever taken it known someone who has ? hhas it caused any difficulties with memory and concentration ? over the past few weeks my memory has gone to absolute hell and i don t know what to do about it it is ridiculous i am forgetting important meetings and decisions and facts that are imperative to my everyday functioning ! i started the risperidal about a month ago , mg for bipolar disorder i , after a rather elaborate mania and the recognition for the need of a antipsychotic alongside my antidepressants and mood stabilizers help , please ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! answer poor concentration isn t a usual side effect , so i m wondering if its what s left of the manic episode you recently experienced ? if that s the case things should settle down as you feel a bit better you need to talk to your psychiatrist about it if things don t improve as you may need to try different medication that ll help with your concentration a little more for the moment , try carrying a notebook with you to write down stuff you need to remember i hope you feel better soon sources mental health nurse
