i read today in businessweek about an l a startup called therapick com , that makes short videos of therapists being interviewed about their practice and style , and allows people to search for therapists based not only on the usual location , insurance , and gender , but also on those intangible qualities best gleaned from a video here 's their pitch finding a therapist is a personal experience on therapick , you can search videos , read profiles , and email therapists you might want to work with if you do n't like the vibe of a psychologist , counselor , or psychiatrist , move on to the next one it 's that simple our videos let you choose we 've interviewed hundreds of licensed psychotherapists in los angeles , chicago , new york , the bay area , and many other popular cities to give you the best selection for individual , couples , and family counseling in the united states whether you 're looking for psychotherapy , marriage counseling , or even hypnosis , therapick 's videos give you a better sense of who a therapist is before going in for your first visit sounds like an interesting idea what do you all think ?
