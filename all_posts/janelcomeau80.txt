ladies and gentlemen , if you direct your eyes to the sidebar on the right of the page , you 'll see a bright green button clashing with the rest of the page if you 're functionally literate in the english language , you might even notice that it says follow on feedly on it so what is feedly ? it 's the name of the unicorn you can follow me around on feedly is a news aggregator , which in real people terms means it 's an application that will gather up all the new blog posts and news stories from your favourite sites and put them in one place for you , so that you do n't have to strain your delicate finger muscles by typing in all the urls each day to get feedly up and running , all you need to do is download it for free on your android or apple device and set up an account if you have a pathological fear of smartphones , you can just go to the website and use the browser version and if you 've got rich parents and a pathological fear of sunlight , you can dig out every electronic you own and have a blog party just make sure you follow janelcomeau ca , so you can get my new blog posts sent to you no matter where you are there is no escape so in other words , it 's now easier to read my blog posts on the toilet enjoy
