so , i'm sick and miserable and i had my last cold only months ago , which makes me think my immune system is not as strong as it should be i was thinking about that yesterday , and realized that i only started showing symptoms a few days after i stopped being vegan , which makes me strongly suspect that dairy has something to do with it i was lactose intolerant when i was young , and for a while now i 've been wondering if i am again i 've been feeling sick from drinking milk if i'm right and i am , i figure that could certainly weaken my ability to fight off colds so , it looks like i'm going back to being vegan , at least for a little while , and seeing if that makes a difference ! sighs i just put a new poll up , about new years resolutions i always make them , but , like many people it seems , i rarely manage to keep them i guess i 'll be trying again this year though ! speaking of new years resolutions , i want to tell you about a ritual with that , that my family started a few years ago we take a blank sheet of paper , and write all of our resolutions , hopes , and plans for the coming year , then , after we watch the ball drop on tv , we burn the papers in the wood stove it feels good to do , and somehow makes it more real , more important and binding , then just thinking of what we want and hope for in the new year i also added a new post to my trash hunting blog full of lovely cuddly second hand finds wishing everyone lots of good health and warmth watches the snow falling outside and shivers , peace , idzie you might also like cold blues stillness sickness , sushi , graphic novels , and what 's been going on avoiding bio hazards at all cost linkwithin
