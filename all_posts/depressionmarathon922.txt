i know i know i said i was n't going to run on my injured leg before the marathon this saturday but it was such a gorgeous , warm , sunny day again today , i could n't stand the thought of swimming inside ! so i tested my leg i had another reason to get out and test my leg i was feeling really heavy i needed some time on my feet to build confidence for the weekend i ran miles , including x at k pace i had discomfort with every step , but it was a tightness in my calf rather than the sharp pain i had last week the swimming , biking and rest did make a difference , i think as i hoped , running fast felt good i worked out some cobwebs i'm feeling lighter and more confident now i'm also feeling a bit more nervous hard to believe the marathon is only a few days away it 's frustrating to be injured after excellent training for all but the last two of these past weeks but it is what it is that 's what makes the marathon special if it was easy , everyone would run one ! hopefully , i 'll find the comfort and speed i need on marathon day
