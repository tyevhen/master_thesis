a trial has recently appeared in the american journal of geriatric psychiatry this study claims that aripiprazole abilify is safe and effective in treating alzheimer s patients who presented signs of psychosis as i will demonstrate , anyone with an ounce of common sense and certainly anyone who passed a basic statistics course can see these claims especially the claims regarding efficacy are bordering on hilarious efficacy here s what the authors said apripiprazole mg day was efficacious , and safe for psychosis associated with ad , significantly improving psychotic symptoms , agitation , and clinical global impression quickie stats lesson in determining if there is a statistically significant difference between two groups , a large factor is the size of the sample just because a difference is statistically significant does not imply that the difference actually means anything of value with a large sample size as was seen in the present study , very small effects can become statistically significant next , let 's discuss the size of these treatment effects how helpful was abilify ? mean change on the neuopsychiatric inventory nursing home version was points for the mg day abilify group and points for the placebo group with the knowledge of the mean change and the standard deviations from both groups , one can easily calculate the effect size , which indicates the magnitude of the treatment effect i e , did people get a little better or a lot better ? the effect size using cohen s d was the general guideline is that d is a small effect , so less than small i guess you could call it miniscule how about other measures used in the study ? here are a few neuropsychiatric inventory nursing home version psychosis subscale effect size clinical global impressions severity effect size clinical global impressions improvement effect size brief psychiatric rating scale effect size cohen mansfield agitation inventory effect size no matter how you slice it , the effects were all very small let s also do a common sense test the clinical global impressions improvement scale asks one question the wording may vary slightly across studies , but one example is rate total improvement whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment compared to his her condition at admission to the project , how much has he she changed ? in the current abilify study , the average advantage for people taking abilify mg day versus placebo was points there are seven points on the rating scale for example , at one point on the rating scale is minimally improved and the next point is moderately improved so the average patient on abilify was points closer to moderately improved compared to minimally improved relative to someone on a placebo can you say ooooh , big deal ? anyone who has taken a basic course in statistics should be either laughing or crying your choice at this point what makes this particularly egregious is that the first two authors are academic researchers who absolutely must have received this lesson dozens of times during their research training , so there is no pleading ignorance on their part statistical significance okay , maybe this is a smaller point but when i plug their numbers means , sd , n into a t test , i find that some of the differences they labeled as statistically significant are no longer statistically significant yes , they used a different statistic , which was apparently useful to them , but i thought i d at least mention that if someone chose to use a different analysis , the data may have turned out as not statistically significant in any case , the benefits of abilify as shown in this study are minimal at best safety okay , so abilify does not work very well , but at least it won t kill you , right ? people died across the course of the study , including of the placebo group and of the abilify mg day group cerebrovascular adverse events were reported for four patients in the mg abilify group and zero people in the placebo group as has become nearly an essential disclaimer in studies these days , the authors write eighteen deaths occurred during the study , none of which were considered to be related to study medication my emphasis of course not the study is funded by a bristol myers squibb , and the company and its independent academic investigators determine if the drug could have caused any deaths the fox is policing the henhouse discussion the best part of any article is the discussion , because it is a marketing exhibit the results of this placebo controlled fixed dose study indicate that aripiprazole impacts beneficially on psychotic symptoms in institutionalized patients suffering from psychosis associated with ad this is the first such study to report improvement in both primary and secondary outcome measures in this patient population aripiprazole also produced significant improvement in other aspects of psychological and behavioral symptoms , as evident from changes in secondary outcome scores thus , the results indicate that the use of aripiprazole cannot only alleviate the specific symptoms of psychosis , but can also reduce the overall psychological and behavioral burden of ad interestingly , the and mg day doses of aripiprazole show robust efficacy to improve the cmai scores from baseline to endpoint , reinforcing the evidence that atypical antipsychotics are efficacious in the treatment of agitation apparently robust efficacy means having a miniscule impact relative to placebo again , see above commentary about the extremely small extent to which abilify impacts beneficially upon participants in this study to the authors credit , they mention that elderly patients with dementia related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo right , kind of like what happened in this study , at least for the patients who took mg of abilify i realize it may have been a chance occurrence that the abilify mg patients died at a higher rate , but when you combine minimal treatment benefit with doubling the risk of death , why the hell would anyone choose to prescribe abilify based on results from this study ? believe it or not , there are a couple of other points about the study that i could prattle on about , but i think the point has been made journal policies if you wander over to the american journal of geriatric psychiatry s instructions for authors , you can see the following provide measures of effect size liberally give cautions when statistical significance has doubtful clinical or practical significance what i have done in this post is provide the measures of effect size since the authors did not provide a single measure of effect size not a single one but wait , if this paper clearly violates one of the main principles listed under statistic guidelines for the instructions to authors , how did it get published ? good question and that takes me right back to my earlier posts on peer review and how the experts who review papers sometimes do so in a slipshod , lazy , biased , and or incompetent fashion , , , and the editor ? did he even skim this manuscript to see if it conformed to the guidelines of the journal ? so a paper that flouts the journal s own policies is published , a paper in which statements regarding a product s efficacy are far overblown perhaps drug reps will be disseminating this wonderful piece of science nationwide or even internationally to help get patients onto abilify because now their marketing is based on science will physicians see through this sort of ruse and laugh the reps out of the office , or will they briefly scan the abstract , conclude the drug is effective , and then whip out their prescription pads ? you tell me last , but not least , i present a golden goblet award to the academic authors of the study as well as to the coauthors at bristol myers squibb your ability to present teeny treatment effects as robust and get away with it is notable great work you deserve a good cut of however many are added to bms 's coffers from unneeded prescriptions of abilify for dementia
