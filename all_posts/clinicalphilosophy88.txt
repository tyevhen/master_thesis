spring in a couple of months it will be spring again waking i think 'is it really nearly a year since last spring ? must time march on so ? my end draws nearer yet ' i feel despair here i'm clinging onto life , try to take a portion of it for myself it 's me against time , me against fate or i wake and think 'how wonderful spring will soon be here yet another chance to experience its joys ' i feel happy , grateful here i'm alive to grace life now is 'gift' i arise and pass within time how good to have this repeated glimpse at all these two visions of spring are , in the facts they survey , precisely equivalent and now imagine what you would want to say to someone who voiced the banal 'that 's just the difference between a glass half empty and a glass half full '
