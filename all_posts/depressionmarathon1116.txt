i'm in that space where everything is difficult getting out of bed , going to bed , sleeping , staying awake , exercising , or sitting around no matter what i do , it 's hard , and slow , and confusing this morning , i awoke early and could n't get back to sleep , so i thought i 'd swim i made it to the pool , but by the time i swam a couple laps , i knew it was n't going to happen today and it did n't i had a plan i had to revise the plan again , and again , and again before finally giving in to the breathlessness and fatigue breathlessness , fatigue everything takes longer in this icky space showering , laundry , deciding it 's like my brain has to swim thru a morass of molasses before a thought is released writing this is a chore tears no reason just tears every emotion is heightened every irritation more irritating every stressor more stressful every comment or reaction more personal i ca n't seem to seperate myself from the world it 's all coming in all the time i ca n't filter or sort i'm overwhelmed because everything gets in every input initiates reaction , and it 's all personal to me i'm not routinely aware of how much stimuli i filter just to move thru my day i'm aware now , because my filters are gone there is no gate there is no halt it 's all in all the time , and i'm extremely overwhelmed breathlessness , fatigue , and noise it 's loud without filters i ca n't make a decision , because i ca n't sort the true from the false , the important from the unimportant it all gets thru so my brain treats every bit as necessary information but it 's not it 's not all necessary a lot of it is just noise it 's loud in my head without filters , and the noise wears me out i'm so tired i'm so tired of the noise i'm so tired of the confusion i do n't know where to go i do n't know what to do i ca n't even explain how i feel , because it 's too loud it 's too loud in my head i'm tired and discouraged and i do n't want to go on like this
