quick what species of life on earth is the most abundant ? which species has more living members than any other species ? hint if an alien probe lands in a random location on earth , chances are better than that the probe will encounter this organism if you 're thinking in terms of the ocean , you 're on the right track what may surprise you is the connection between the world 's most populous organism to be revealed shortly and the mosquitoes that 've been dive bombing your neck all week equally amazing is the link between the mosquitoes in your back yard and hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor the hundreds of bright little particles at the narrow end of this wasp egg are wolbachia cells i was n't thinking about marine biology or deep sea hydrothermal vents when i went online at http genomevolution org the other day to do a little nosing around into the genome of wolbachia pipientis , the ultra tiny bacterial parasite carried by nearly every mosquito on earth caution do n't attempt the following dna analysis tricks on your own unless you want to become thoroughly addicted to desktop omics i'm a microbiologist by training i can do these stunts safely parasite is actually the wrong word our tiny friend wolbachia does n't just parasitize the mosquito it 's an integral part of the mosquito wolbachia ca n't live outside its insect host and guess what ? the host frequently ca n't live without wolbachia the two provide essential services for each other , an arrangement known as mutualism i would argue that wolbachia is more than a mutualistic symbiont it 's a proto organelle , something very close to what lynn margulis had in mind as the ancestor of today 's mitochondrion wolbachia ca n't live on its own in the outside world as far as anybody knows it needs to live inside a host generally an arthropod , although filarial worms also carry wolbachia inside its host it occupies a very special niche it lives in the nursery cells of the insect 's ovary the cells that will go on to become egg cells this is no ordinary symbiosis i mentioned in an earlier post that wolbachia carries with it genes for reverse transcriptases , resolvases , recombinases , transposases , translocases , dna polymerases , rna polymerases , and phage integrases a complete suite of retroviral machinery , designed for export of foreign dna into host dna and indeed , researchers have found that wolbachia dna is quite often embedded in the host 's own nuclear dna one group , looking at four insect hosts and four nematode hosts , found anywhere from base pairs to over a million base pairs of wolbachia dna residing in the nucleus another group found wolbachia genes incorporated in a fruit fly host 's nuclear dna the situation with wolbachia thus parallels the situation with mitochondria , where we know that of the gene products that go to make up a mitochondrion are actually encoded in nuclear dna , not mitochondrial dna when you encounter an organism as baffling as wolbachia , oftentimes you want to know what its relatives are what it 's most closely related to when a new or poorly understood organism has a close relative that 's already well studied , sometimes you learn a lot in a hurry that 's particularly true of pathogens not that wolbachia is a pathogen per se pathogens have virulence strategies of various kinds maybe wolbachia has symbiosis strategies that it learned from a relative ? the problem with a lot of the super tiny microbes which wolbachia definitely is , with only a quarter as much dna as e coli is that their relatedness is not always well understood organisms are assigned a taxonomic slot , then the assignment changes a few years later , after they 're better studied so for example , cowdria ruminantium was eventually renamed ehrlichia ruminantium , and a bunch of former ehrlichias are now neorickettsias , except the ones that attack red blood cells , which are now anaplasmas taxonomy at this end of the evolutionary tree is definitely a work in progress deep sea thermal vents like this one are home to organisms like thiomicrospira that can grow on sulfide , co , and basic salts fortunately , it 's easy nowadays what with so many organisms' dna sequences available online to go on the web and compare genomes directly , using a tool like synmap , which is what i started doing with wolbachia i started going down the list of mini microorganisms and began running dna similarity tests of wolbachia against ehrlichia , neorickettsia , anaplasma , chlamydia , and the usual suspects at the ultra small chromosome end of the tree of life what i found surprised me a bizarre little bacterium called thiomicrospira kept showing up in my blast searches as having many genes in common with wolbachia based on sequence matches in large numbers of genes none of the taxonomy charts showed the two to be related but dna does n't lie i kept coming up with matches across hundreds of genes bear in mind , wolbachia has only about genes to begin with , which is very small , even for a bacterium what 's bizarre about thiomicrospira is that it 's one of those fairly newly discovered microbes that lives on sulfur , heat , and co at the bottom of the ocean , in total darkness , in the vicinity of thermal vents thiomicrospira is the kind of life form nasa takes a great interest in , because it could be a prototype for exactly the type of survive in the dark co using organism that might live under the ice crust of europa saturn 's moon in theory , there could be geothermal vents on the floor of the large ocean of liquid water that nasa is pretty sure exists under europa 's ice if there 's life down there , it could very well look like thiomicrospira but why should thiomicrospira have so many genes in common with a mosquito symbiont ? thiomicrospira organism lives at the bottom of the ocean wolbachia lives inside arthropod eggs one obtains its carbon in the form of co the other produces co as a waste product one is adapted to live in warm salt water the other lives in cold blooded insects in theory , these two germs could n't be further apart and yet , oddly enough , they not only have hundreds of genes in common , the genes are well matched from a dna sequence similarity standpoint thiomicrospira 's dna even incorporates a prophage module , and some of its phage genes show a high percentage base pair similarity with the phage genes of wolbachia see screen shot below remarkably , thiomicrospira and wolbachia share certain phage genes in common , as shown here the genes have a dna sequence identity of about after doing a little more detective work , i found an organism that might very well form a missing link between the mosquito symbiont and the thermal vent dweller this organism kept showing up in my analyses as having a high degree of dna similarity with both thiomicrospira and wolbachia the organism in question is pelagibacter ubique now known as candidatus pelagibacter , although some might question this taxonomic assignment since all other candidatus members are obligate intracellular symbionts , and it 's an astonishing organism in two ways first , it 's the smallest non parasitic free living bacterium known to science , with only million base pairs in its dna making it slightly smaller than wolbachia and its tiny cousins secondly , it 's the most numerous living thing on earth it 's present in large amounts in every one of earth 's oceans pelagibacter was placed in the candidatus clade in due to its small genome and cell size and certain ribosomal markers it has a very mitochondria like genetic profile , and in fact some people think pelagibacter is the ancestor of today 's mitochondrion , a theory that 's all the more satisfying when you consider that pelagibacter is both ancient and tied to the sea my analysis using synmap found that pelagibacter and its thermal vent dwelling cousin thiomicrospira share about genes out of or so for pelagibacter , whereas wolbachia and pelagibacter share around , and thiomicrospira and wolbachia share around these are so called non syntenous point matches between genes instances where the same gene occurs in both organisms , with a high percentage of base pair matching synteny is a concept that takes gene matching one step further and says that clusters of similar genes are what count synteny at the level of higher plants and animals is one thing , but at the level of a mini microbe it tends to lack meaning , because the genes of bugs like wolbachia are notoriously mobile they find new positions on the chromosome over time probably because of the large number of transposases , nucleases , and integrases in the genome even so , i decided to carry out a bit of syntenic analysis to see what i could find out for purposes of my analysis i defined a syntenon as three or more co proximal genes that match three or more genes on the other organism 's genome but to be part of a syntenon , all three genes in a triplet have to occur within a gene span and match genes in a gene span on the other organism 's dna plus the genes have to be in the same order in both organisms a planet spanning waterworld is thought to exist under europa 's icy outer crust if thermal vents exist at the bottom , any life that exists may look a lot like thiomicrospira using synmap , i found that whereas wolbachia and pelagibacter share around syntenic genes , and thiomicrospira and wolbachia share around , thiomicrospira and pelagibacter share which makes sense in that both are ocean dwellers for comparison and control purposes , i did a triplet match of thiomicrospira against another chemoautotroph an organism that gets energy from inorganic chemicals , and carbon from co , namely methanothermobacter marburgensis there were only syntenic triplets in common between the two chemoautotrophs between wolbachia and methanothermobacter , on the other hand , there were only triplet matches doing a match between two wolbachia species a mosquito dwelling variety and a fruit fly dwelling cousin produced gene matches in syntenic triplets it seems reasonable to me , based not just on the previous sorts of analysis but also direct inspection of the genomes in terms of their respective protein products , that thiomicrospira evolved from pelagibacter pelagibacter is the most abundant life form in the ocean , and perhaps the oldest pelagibacter is also very mitochondria like , and so is thiomicrospira , which has rhodanese like proteins , the full cytochrome system , redox enzymes , citric acid cycle enzymes , plus certain characteristic membrane and sensor proteins , flippases , etc for what it 's worth , thiomicrospira has the highest signal transduction profile i 've ever seen at http mistdb com , again making it very mitochondrial feeling i'm tempted to say , similarly , that thiomicrospira and wolbachia are related they have phage proteins in common they both have genes for patatin proteins they share multiple drug resistance genes that 's not so strange antibiotics occur naturally in the environment they share genes for flp type pilins plus many more coincidences , big and small at first blush , a deep sea thermal vent seems pretty far removed , environmentally , from the egg cell of a mosquito how to reconcile the difference ? actually , i see similarities thiomicrospira thrives at temperatures of to degrees celsius which is also true of mosquitoes , although they prefer the degree end of the scale and blood the preferred food source for mosquitoes is comparable in ph and salinity to seawater also , mosquitoes have an aquatic lifecycle they require brackish water in which to lay eggs mosquitoes and salt marshes go back millions of years it 's even possible that wolbachia might live in deep sea vent dwelling host organisms in fact , i predict they will be found there why ? because in addition to inhabiting flying insects , spiders , mites , and ticks and filarial worms , wolbachia have also been found in a very high percentage of crustaceans we know that crustaceans are often found living near deep sea thermal vents and many crustaceans show the characteristic feminization of genetic males that 's so often the tipoff to a massive wolbachia presence in insect populations insects and crustaceans represent two of the oldest , most successful , and most widely distributed life forms of the animal kingdom would it really be so surprising if the bacteria that colonize these life forms are closely related to the most common marine bacteria on the planet ? i do n't think so stranger things have happened
