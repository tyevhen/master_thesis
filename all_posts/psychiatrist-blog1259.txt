may i suggest that part of psychotherapy is giving people feedback about themselves they may not want to hear ? one of the many reasons why therapy is something different than talking with a friend , or simply 'conversation , ' is that the therapist may point out to the patient certain things that in friendly conversation might seem hurtful , unkind , or downright mean and why ? well , if you do n't notice you 're doing something , how can you change ? or maybe you do n't want to change , but how do you come to make peace with it ? sometimes , it helps to know you 're doing distasteful things some days i feel like i spend my days insulting people the thing is , people do n't get offended the do n't meltdown , and there are reasons why this is there 's something about the therapeutic relationship that makes it safe to say things that are n't safe to say elsewhere something about the trust the patient holds makes it okay to point out their flaws sometimes , it takes a little bit of easing into and sometimes it takes a little bit of building up at the same time to make it so someone is comfortable hearing something they do n't necessarily want to hear screaming you did what ? ! does n't tend to offer room for examination saying , that 's interesting , you 're the type of person who is usually so in tune to other people 's feelings compliment that it 's funny to hear that you were so mean to harry insult and of course , sometimes the therapist misjudges and the patient clearly feels badly and then it 's time to step back hammering someone with something they are n't ready to hear is n't usually all that helpful
