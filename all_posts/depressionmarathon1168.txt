it was supposed to be , but everyone else was doing i did last week , but everyone else was doing now , today oh all right i did , too wait , actually , i did yup , that 's right i ran miles yesterday that was n't exactly the plan , but i 've never been really fond of plans anyway i planned to run yesterday i planned to run my last miler next week plans are overrated i 've never run more than miles in training before , and even after i changed the plan and became a conformist , i still was n't planning on only but , like i said , plans are overrated the course was a bit off , therefore everyone ran or even miles i guess someone else had trouble planning , too in the end , my gps read miles allow me to round up , please i'm going with not bad the marathon is weeks from today despite my shortened training program , i 've got both milers done with time to spare i can now taper for the next three weeks , which is my typical taper time frame i'm feeling okay , too it 's good it 's all good right now that 's a nice change of pace
