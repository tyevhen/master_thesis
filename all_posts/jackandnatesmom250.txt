all new supplements are on board as of last night we started transdermal glutathione for both boys last night , which is the last one for now anyway it 's just a cream , but glutathione is one of the newer and supposedly , more effective treatments for kids with autism some info http www tacanow org family resources detoxification glutathione autism detoxification , glutathione autism tweet july th , home family resources detoxification , glutathione autism disclaimer talk about curing autism taca provides general information of interest to the autism community the information comes from a variety of sources , and taca does not independently verify any of it the views expressed herein are not necessarily taca s nothing in this document should be construed as medical advice always consult your child s doctor regarding his or her individual needs introduction in the autism community over the past few years , glutathione , detoxification , and all related methylation issues have been the hot topics at many of the defeat autism now ! dan ! conferences , other conferences like autism one , and with many of the current medical practitioners treating autism there are also some recent , excellent studies by drs jill james and richard deth on this highly debated and important topic as possible treatments for children on the spectrum the process of the methylation and detoxification are highly complex processes and still require more research treating children with autism with glutathione to promote detoxification is not a perfect solution or cure for autism it could be an important piece of what may not be functioning properly in children with autism spectrum disorders this document attempts to provide some basic information about glutathione , reading sources , and options available for your review it has been written by a mom of a child with autism with no credentials or medical training i have simply provided reading materials that have helped me , research references , and personal experiences with my child please work with your doctor on proper testing and the unique needs of your loved one overview glutathione and its potential uses www

hypoglycemia kidney disease liver disease liver cancer lungs mercury poisoning parkinson s disease respiratory problems smoking tuberculosis glutathione helps defend the body against damage from cigarette smoking , exposure to radiation , cancer chemotherapy , and toxins such as alcohol as a detoxifier of heavy metals and drugs , it aids in the treatment of blood and liver disorders glutathione protects cells in several ways it neutralizes oxygen molecules before they can harm cells together with selenium , it forms the enzyme glutathione peroxidase , which neutralizes hydrogen peroxide it is also a component of another antioxidant enzyme , glutathione s transferase , which is a broad spectrum liver detoxifying enzyme glutathione protects not only individual cells but also the tissues of the arteries , brain , heart , immune cells , kidneys , lenses of the eyes , liver , lungs , and skin against oxidant damage it plays a role in preventing cancer , especially liver cancer , and may also have an anti aging effect glutathione can be taken in supplement form the production of glutathione by the body can be boosted by taking supplemental n acetylcysteine or l cysteine plus l methionine studies suggest that taking glutathione combined with another boosting supplement may be a better way of raising glutathione levels rather than taking glutathione by itself glutathione is not technically an amino acid however , due to its close relationship is normally grouped with the amino acids most glutathione is found in the liver where it detoxifies many harmful compounds to be excreted thru the bile some glutathione is released directly by the liver into the bloodstream where it helps to maintain the strength of your red blood cells and also protecting your white blood cells glutathione can also be found in the lungs and in your body s intestinal tract system it is required for carbohydrate metabolism glutathione also appears to have anti aging effects by aiding in the breakdown of oxidized fats that may contribute to atherosclerosis as we get , older glutathione levels in the body decrease and this can speed up the aging process thus , glutathione supplementation is useful in preventing this from occurring glutathione deficiency maybe indicated by coordination problems , mental disorder , tremors , twitching , nervous system disorder , and difficulty in balancing currently , the deficiency is believed to be caused by lesions in the brain latest research on glutathione neurotoxicology volume , issue , january , pages thimerosal neurotoxicity is associated with glutathione depletion protection with glutathione precursors s j james , william slikker iii , stepan melnyk , elizabeth new , marta pogribna and stefanie jernigan department of pediatrics , university of arkansas for medical sciences and arkansas children s hospital research institute , little rock , ar , usa division of biochemical toxicology , national center for toxicological research , jefferson , ar , usa abstract thimerosol is an antiseptic containing ethyl mercury that has been used for years as a preservative in many infant vaccines and in flu vaccines environmental methyl mercury has been shown to be highly neurotoxic , especially to the developing brain because mercury has a high affinity for thiol sulfhydryl single bondsh groups , the thiol containing antioxidant , glutathione gsh , provides the major intracellular defense against mercury induced neurotoxicity cultured neuroblastoma cells were found to have lower levels of gsh and increased sensitivity to thimerosol toxicity compared to glioblastoma cells that have higher basal levels of intracellular gsh thimerosal induced cytotoxicity was associated with depletion of intracellular gsh in both cell lines pretreatment with ? m glutathione ethyl ester or n acetylcysteine nac , but not methionine , resulted in a significant increase in intracellular gsh in both cell types further , pretreatment of the cells with glutathione ethyl ester or nac prevented cytotoxicity with exposure to ? m thimerosal although thimerosal has been recently removed from most children s vaccines , it is still present in flu vaccines given to pregnant women , the elderly , and to children in developing countries the potential protective effect of gsh or nac against mercury toxicity warrants further research as possible adjunct therapy to individuals still receiving thimerosal containing vaccinations note i am sure there are many more sources for glutathione and similar products these are the products i am familiar with it is important to find sources that meet dietary restrictions gluten free , casein free , dye free , additives free , etc sometimes these additives can mask any benefits of glutathione supplementation ok , so i have been waiting to start this for awhile we needed some lab results back jack has unusually high mercury levels and they both show deficits in their bloodwork related to some of the information above i have also been looking forward to the transdermal nature of the supplement no begging a kid to swallow it , no shots for now good stuff st dose with pj 's last night why oh why does everything cause sleep disturbances for jack if it 's an option as a side effect , you can bet he 's gonna have it he did not just have sleep disturbances last night , he was talking in his sleep , not in english , combative , running into the hallway , sitting down and screaming at nothing it was scary yet , i do n't want to give up after one dose , this is something that could truly help him so i gave him another dose this am and have noticed nothing out of the ordinary during the day i guess my next step is to try it again tonight , see if we have the same problem if we do , i guess i could try applying the second dose several hours earlier , or if need be , double dosing in the morning i just hope we see something positive come out of this the person who wrote the article for taca also stated this about their personal experiences some personal experiences with glutathione for one child my son s medical tests demonstrated over several years along with many types of tests that he had a glutathione deficiency and other issues over the past four years , we have found that glutathione treatments have greatly assisted him i have attempted to outline some of our findings for one case my son s what we tried we tried oral glutathione it resulted in a tremendous yeast outbreak we also found studies that glutathione supplementation did not survive the digestive process to yield results we tried topical glutathione it caused a bad rash and undesired behaviors this is an understatement ! at the time , there was only a soy based topical glutathione today you can acquire cr me without soy or other allergens we tried an initial dose of iv glutathione mg really an iv push minutes some hints we brought a portable dvd player along , and prepared his arm with a big glob of emla cream prior to infusions at the time , jeff was years old and around lbs the first treatment was in fall another type of glutathione administration is through a nebulizer i would love to know what her child 's undesired behaviors were i really would
