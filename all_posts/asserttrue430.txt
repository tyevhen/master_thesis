the catalase test is simple add a drop of hydrogen peroxide to a sample of bacteria on a microscope slide and see if it fizzes anaerobes even aerotolerant ones , such as streptococcus pyogenes wo n't fizz because they lack catalase aerobic bacteria produce oxygen bubbles , as on the right i remember the first time i was introduced as a young bacteriology student to the catalase test you scrape a colony of bacteria off the surface of an agar dish , rub it onto a microscope slide , then take an ordinary eyedropper filled with hydrogen peroxide and drop a big fat drop of liquid onto the little slimy smudge of bacteria if the smudge begins to fizz vigorously , like alka seltzer , the bacteria are catalase positive if no fizzing happens , they 're catalase negative the fizzing happens because of an enzyme called catalase that promotes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen ho ho o for the last hundred years , every student of bacteriology has been taught that the reason aerobic bacteria and indeed all aerobic life forms , up to and including humans have catalase is that hydrogen peroxide is severely toxic and must be gotten rid of , lest it form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho oh oh the oh radicals , being extremely reactive chemically , will attack just about anything dna , rna , proteins , lipids , mucopolysaccharides , what have you hydroxyl radicals are toxic catalase provides a way of neutralizing peroxides so that no radicals can form anaerobic organisms , the story goes , lack catalase because they live in oxygen poor environments where things like peroxides do n't form so called strict anaerobes are actually killed by exposure to air the reason they die when they come in contact with air supposedly is that in the presence of oxygen they experience an endogenous buildup of peroxides that in the absence of catalase go on to form toxic free radicals that , in turn , eventually cause damage to dna , proteins , lipids , and other macromolecules that 's the official dogma on peroxides , free radicals , and catalase the only trouble is , as with so much other dogma in this world , it 's completely wrong and it would all be harmless prattle if it just applied to bacteria but unfortunately , this bit of assumption laden dogma about peroxides and free radicals leads to some rather fanciful notions about the role of oxidative stress in ordinary metabolism the notion that peroxides and free radicals so called reactive oxygen species are harmful has led to the spending of billions of research dollars on oxidative stress and ways to stave off oxidative damage to dna , proteins , etc it has led to billions of dollars of misleading advertising around foods rich in antioxidants and it has actually led to clinical trials of antioxidants like beta carotene and vitamin e in which people died needlessly , something i 'll discuss in more detail in a future post for now , you might want to refer to this paper suppose that , rather than accepting the catalase as detoxifier peroxides as evil theory at face value , we ask some fundamental questions such as what 's the evidence that anaerobes exposed to air actually die of peroxide poisoning ? if peroxides are poisonous , why are there no anaerobes that have catalase ? if there 's survival value for aerobes to have catalase , surely there 's even more survival value for an anaerobe to have it ? if catalase exists to protect aerobic cells from peroxide poisoning , then we should expect catalase knockout mutations to be lethal , or at least gravely deleterious , yes ? let 's review some basic facts first , hydrogen peroxide is not toxic at low concentrations it is , in the words of one researcher , poorly reactive it does not oxidize most biological molecules including lipids , dna , and proteins halliwell et al , hydrogen peroxide ubiquitous in cell culture and in vivo ? , iubmb life , , , pdf here concentrated hydrogen peroxide is toxic it 's a disinfectant , but at the dilute concentrations found in living cells , hydrogen peroxide is n't doing anything harmful to dna , proteins , or lipids the situation is analogous to that of hydrochloric acid at high concentrations , hcl will eat through skin put a couple liters into an , liter swimming pool , though , and you can drink the stuff so it is with peroxide secondly , peroxides are ubiquitous in living systems again see the halliwell paper in higher life forms ho is produced in vivo by monoamine oxidase , xanthine oxidases , various dismutases , and other enzymes , under homeostatic control there 's substantial evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a widely used signalling molecule see references to in the halliwell paper and recent work has shown a role for hydrogen peroxide in reparative neovascularization recruitment of immune cells to wounds likewise appears to require hydrogen peroxide far from being toxic , hydrogen peroxide is an important biomolecule , essential to ordinary metabolic processes there is zero evidence that hydrogen peroxide does anything harmful in living tissues , at the concentrations normally found in vivo if hydrogen peroxide were toxic , we 'd expect that a mutation that knocks out catalase would mean certain death for the host organism after all , with no catalase to break down ho to oxygen and water , hydrogen peroxide would simply accumulate until reaching toxic levels but it turns out , naturally occurring catalase negative mutants of staphylococcus aureas have been reported laboratory created catalase negative mutant strains of e coli and other organisms are known as well catalase knockout mice have been created , and they develop normally humans lacking normal catalase were first identified in the early s when a japanese doctor found that pouring hydrogen peroxide onto a patient 's infected gums caused no foaming the catalase negative condition in humans is known as acatalasemia or acatalasia it results in no pathology except an increased tendency toward periodontal infection catalase does serve an important function in aerobic organisms having nothing to do with detoxification with catalase , the oxygen in hydrogen peroxide can be scavenged for reuse in respiration this is important because every oxygen molecule is worth atp molecules in the aerobic breakdown of glucose atp , adenosine triphosphate , is the high energy molecule that powers the chemical machinery of cells without atp , metabolism grinds to a halt by comparison , anaerobic breakdown of glucose which is to say , fermentative breakdown yields only atp molecules per sugar molecule it 's very much in the cell 's interest to recycle the oxygen from hydrogen peroxide rather than let it go to waste catalase makes that reuse possible anaerobic bacteria obtain energy solely from fermentation they have no use for oxygen therefore they have no use for catalase a catalase gene would simply be extra genetic baggage for an anaerobe it would confer no survival value it 's astonishing to me that the catalase myth the version of the myth that says catalase exists to detoxify hydrogen peroxide so as to keep the cell from dying of free radical induced damage has survived for well over a hundred years without anyone questioning it i see the myth repeated all over the internet as if it 's gospel never do i see any substantiating research referenced in support of it it 's just propagated from one unquestioning drone to another why ? why do myths like this take hold in science ? why do otherwise intelligent scientists cling to them and perpetuate them , regurgitating them in textbooks and handing them down to new generations of students ? i think the answer is , because it makes a good story , and as human beings we value a good story more than we value checking out the story to see if it 's true providing it 's a suitably satisfying story before there was science , stories were all the human race had as a way of trying to understand the universe if someone told a good enough story , and the story provided a satisfying enough explanation of something , the story endured some of humankind 's most cherished stories have survived for thousands of years they survive , in many cases , even if they 're not verifiably true with science , the theory is the unit of storytelling if a theory seems to fit the facts , it 's accepted if , on closer inspection , a story is found not to fit the facts , it will still be accepted by many people , if it 's a satisfying enough story the ancient greeks knew the earth was not flat according to diogenes laertius , pythagoras was the first who called the earth round though theophrastus attributes this to parmenides , and zeno to hesiod nevertheless it took centuries for flat earth theory to fall into disrepute , and even to this day there are people who find flat earth theory satisfying so it is with scientific theories good stories and that 's all scientific theories are stories have staying power even when they 're wrong for more on the oxidative stress theory of aging and why it 's wrong , see my blog at big think
