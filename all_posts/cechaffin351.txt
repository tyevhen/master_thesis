below are two poems that have suffered multiple rejections , now transformed by the comments other writers posted here to help me having implemented most of the suggestions , i went back and changed them to my liking given the general unimportance of poetry , and my endless fussing with an art that has such a small following , i feel like apologizing for putting the reader through this if indeed , there are any readers left i promise my next post will be scintillating , titillating and positively addictive let 's put this poetry thing aside for now , though i remain grateful for all the comments while knowing i shall carry my silly poetic perfectionism to my grave chico creek for my late quadriplegic student , jill standing on the footbridge beneath the huge black oaks i thought of how trees grow gigantic by a river , though i never knew oaks could bear so much water water is what i remember peering down , my eyes were forced to choose between the rounded bottom stones trailing green algae and the surface twisting like saran wrap one can t see both just as self pity makes laughter impossible stolen something is missing , something important not your wallet or keys or the knowledge of whether the burner was left on or the fan left running near your dog 's silken paws , but as if the slightest amperage had been siphoned from your body without your notice i don t know when or how you were diminished but your head no longer fits the bronze helmet of the colossus you thought you were revised per your comments , ce
