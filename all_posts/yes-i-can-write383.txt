when we were away at the uwwg , my mom attended both of kelly lovejoy 's talks one of them was a kind of 'ask kelly anything' one , and my mother brought up the issue of finding an unschooling community my mom said how as far as we know , there are virtually no unschoolers in our area ! kelly 's response montreal ? ? there 's tons of unschoolers there ! start a group , and i guarantee you 'll have at least family 's well , what could we say to that ? so we 're starting a montreal unschooling group ! it may not be a success , but at least we 'll know we tried so for now , we 're simply gathering info finding what other people did do with their groups , thinking of how we can publicize it , what activities to do , where to meet if anyone has experience with an unschooling group , or even if you have no experience but ideas , i 'd love to hear them ! d i'm very excited about this , and hoping it works out peace , idzie p s i'm still looking for unschooling articles for homeschooling horizons ! if anyone who unschools is interested in writing something , i 'd love to know ! thanks a bunch d you might also like going to the uwwg ! unschooling gatherings unschooling support group the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering linkwithin
