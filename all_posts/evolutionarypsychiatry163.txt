the cause of obesity has been a hot topic in the paleoblogosphere lately let me be the first to tell you that i am no obesity researcher or expert there , first point goes to itsthewooo all i know is that a few percentage of folks have been obese for thousands of years and back in the late s , here 's a picture of my great great great etc grandfather 's funeral you might have to click on it to enlarge and squint a bit , but i really do n't see any obese people there fast forward to here 's my grandmother , her mother , and her mother babies were chubby cheeked as was my great great grandmother they lived in the same area and were of the same socioeconomic class as many of the people in the first photograph and now my father is the baby in this next picture as you can see , the children and young or middle aged adults including the middle aged women who have had children are lean , whereas the older folks have some extra adipose , especially around the middle again , same area of the country and then this picture is a tour of the uss constitution in charlestown , ma as you can see , middle aged folks and even the kids are starting to be chubby , especially around the middle these pictures do n't tell us much about what we do n't already know obesity is a th and st century disease , that came upon us younger and younger as the decades rolled along , accelerating since or so what caused it ? video games ? captain crunch commercials ? environmental toxins ? i do n't know , but my money is still on the food somewhere between the diets of the kitavans and the sioux and most of the people in the world before and our current diets is the cause of obesity dr pendergrass of the university of kansas had a great poster presentation up at ahs about the neuroregulation of appetite he painstakingly cobbled together a fantastic diagram that detailed the communications between different organ systems , adipose tissue , and the brain he highly recommended this paper if you are interested stress , eating , and the reward system dr pendergrass' diagram was highly technical , inclusive , and awesome , though he warned me that he left out about known hormonal signals between the gi tract and the brain his also had a great deal of detail regarding the brain and different areas of it , along with specific hormonal and molecular signals and feedback there here is my layperson 's version , which leaves out all the crushing detail i ca n't promise all the arrows are leading the right direction a graphic designer i am not it 's complicated yeah , leptin , insulin , amylin , cck , glucose , fat , etc are all involved yes , once you have metabolic syndrome , dropping the carbohydrate will likely help how low for how long ? beats me if you have advanced types of certain kinds of neurologic disease , there 's evidence a ketogenic diet can be helpful make sure your micronutrient status is tip top and eliminate food toxins real , evolutionary medicine inspired food is the easiest way to do that sort of thing but anyone who says he or she completely understands obesity is probably lying
