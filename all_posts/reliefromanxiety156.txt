in everyday life , it 's so easy to find yourself lost among routine most of the time , we do n't even realise we are doing it matters that once would 've been so small , can turn into something that is life and death within a matter of moments it 's always important to look at the bigger picture i always used to get caught up in my education getting so stressed until it made me ill i used to get to a point where i thought of it as a life or death situation as i 've gotten older however , i 've become more relaxed in that aspect and understood that there is much more to life and there are more options too if i took a step back from the situation , i could 've realised that there is much more to life and this is the case there is much more to life , and it 's important to notice it too often we get swallowed by the pressure of everyday life and often forget ourselves , our friends and our family what really is important by taking a step back we are reducing the size of the problem , into something which is more realistic remember to look at the world from the outside in , rather than the inside out ! best wishes , amy xx
