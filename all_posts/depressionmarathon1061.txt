slogging through a lonely , cold miler this morning i reflected upon why i was continuing to do something which , at that moment , felt so difficult it was earlier than i needed to be up i was tired i was winded i was alone and cold my legs felt heavy there were patches of dangerously slippery ice underfoot , and i still had over an hour to go it was not a pleasant place to be with such thoughts and feelings it would have been so easy to say , screw it ! it would have been much easier to stop than to continue slogging on i could have given in to the crummy feelings and negative thoughts instead , i had another thought , running makes me tough ! immediately , and to my amusement , a mini gatorade commercial began playing in my head cue the inspirational music here comes a slow motion etta , resplendant in the morning mist the sun peeks over the horizon , and her steamy breath flows as she gracefully , but not without grit , ascends a hill you know the commercial so , i did n't quit my mind whirred , and i slogged on maybe i needed that tongue in cheek thinking to jolt me out of my negativity my whirring brain settled on that thought , running makes a girl tough it was true running had made me tougher i was obviously tougher physically , but thinking about the mental toughness kept my brain 's attention running requires mental toughness similarly , surviving depression is all about mental toughness perhaps without these long , lonely , cold runs i would n't have been able to negotiate the long , lonely , cold nights of depression perhaps dipping into the hole of despair during difficult workouts or races helped when i needed a boost out of depression 's black hole running when i felt slow , heavy and tired may have encouraged me to hoist out of bed on those dark days when i felt the same it made perfect sense running , in some ways , is practice for surviving depression thank god i'm a runner
