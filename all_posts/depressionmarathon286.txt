as we say in minnesota , uff da ! life got difficult yesterday it happened in mere moments depression slammed me to the ground it slammed me so violently , there must be a deep etta shaped divot in the earth i do n't know what happened it was awful on monday , i felt a little low , but it was no big deal it happens but tuesday i could barely get out of bed yesterday i did n't do anything all day i tried several times to get moving , but i failed each time from my bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the bed , that 's as far as i got i slept and slept and slept but no matter how much i slept , it was n't enough my mood was low , and the less i moved the lower it got it was a vicious cycle i became more distressed as the day went along i was distressed about how distressed i was but being distressed did n't change the reality my body was heavy it was difficult to move i was so , so low and i could do nothing to stop the free fall depression got the best of me yesterday i'm still not great today , but i was able to get up and go for a very short run i missed my scheduled miles yesterday , so i was hoping for before work this morning i was pretty proud of myself for getting out of bed , getting dressed , and making it outside but it became very clear very quickly that i was not going to get very far i struggled through two miles and immediately went back to bed i got out again to go to work , and that went okay , but it was n't easy i 've been home for several hours now , and i just got out of bed again i think things are improving i never could have worked yesterday i was hoping to run a little tonight , but now i'm focusing more on a walk i have a half marathon this weekend feeling so heavy and low , and missing all these scheduled miles is n't making me feel very optimistic about the race i'm trying not to panic about my missed miles or my mood i'm trying to be patient i know this will pass , and i'm hoping for sooner rather than later i ca n't continue like this i have things to do , miles to run , work to perform being cooped up in my house feeling like crap is n't working for me
