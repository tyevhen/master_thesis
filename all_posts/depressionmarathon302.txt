i ran another race this morning it was a mile trail race at a local park most of the race was in the woods the footing was tricky and the trail had many , many hills , as most trails do my legs were already tired from my am weight lifting class yesterday , and as expected the hills really challenged those tired muscles but i held my own , i'm happy to say i 've done this race several times , and i always wonder what the hell i'm doing in the middle of it it is as mentally challenging as it is physically there are hills interspersed throughout , some very steep , including one just before mile five , at the top of which i could n't imagine running another one while realizing i still had five more miles to go before long i dreaded running down the steep descents as much as the ascents because my thighs were jelly by mile eight it takes a lot of muscle control to run downhill i'm happy i did n't fall on my face i did n't stick around for the final results , so i do n't know if i received an age group award , but i finished just under that 's about an minute , second average per mile it 's not the average i ran a couple years ago , but i was quite happy with it based on my last two slow performances at the boston and med city marathons , i had no idea what to expect of myself today to run pace on this difficult trail was a pleasant surprise my legs held up better than i thought they would that gives me a bit of confidence going into grandmas marathon , which is now just two weeks from today i start tapering for grandmas in earnest now i 've decided i'm going to take a short break from training after grandmas i 'll still run , but i wo n't train i 'll just run some short distances a few days per week , for fun , for a couple of weeks i think i need the break , mentally and physically , and i'm looking forward to running for the pure joy of it for a bit after all , i do enjoy and appreciate running , and i do n't want it to ever become a chore while not a chore , today was hard work , but i'm glad i made the effort it was a good race
