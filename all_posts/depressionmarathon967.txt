unusual day today i went golfing , which was unusual i had n't golfed in two years but even more unusual , i went golfing with three other women i do n't generally spend time with other people it was strange to be out of my house all day , and even stranger to be out of my house with others you see , i'm a bit of a loner i'm okay being by myself do n't get me wrong , i like people , but people are complicated people are social people are exhausting people require energy expenditure since my depression began , i 've typically decided to expend my limited energy elsewhere it 's easier in so many ways to be alone but today i was n't alone , and it was nice maybe this is another sign things are going well i made plans i did n't end up dreading the plans i followed through with my plans , and i had fun hmmm interesting
