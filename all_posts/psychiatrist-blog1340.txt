my favorite commenter , anonymous , asks once a person is diagnosed as , say bipolar ii , do they keep that designation for the rest of their lives ? oh , gosh , i think we all wished we knew more about the exact course these illnesses would take and that we could tell each individual what to expect we do n't i like the part of the question that asks if one keeps a diagnosis for life it left me thinking about what a diagnosis actually is i know what a piece of chocolate cake is , and i could give a pretty good guess as to the fate of that cake if it 's put near me i know what a diamond is and that it is likely to last for a very long time unlike a piece of chocolate cake or a diamond ring , a diagnosis is a hypothetical construct it is n't a real thing , it is n't tangible , and the only meaning it has is the meaning we give it diagnosis is n't even an illness , which is slightly more concrete for certain diseases say broken bones or the presence of a tumor because one can have an illness without ever having a diagnosis simply by avoiding contact with physicians while mostly we agree that certain symptoms for example , having hallucinations or delusions are likely the cause of a yet to be fully elucidated pathological process , some diagnoses are a matter of spectrum the somewhat random designation of when sadness or grief is depression , when personality is disordered , or the precise reading at which we deem blood pressure to be hypertensive the meaning of diagnosis is left to each person some people advertise their diagnoses , others live in fear of stigma sometimes , diagnosis is used to protect a member of society from suffering from the consequences of their behavior not criminally responsible or to justify financial support from the government disabled in the negative , diagnosis alone seems to be held in the greatest regard by insurance companies the implications for a diagnosis of aids are profound when one wants insurance the same person , undiagnosed and undesignated , might find it easier to get insurance there 's a blood test for aids , there is n't one for schizophrenia we talk about carrying a diagnosis whatever that means i think , if one suffered from episodes of an illness many years ago , and one has remained symptom free for a long time with no treatment , the issue of designation for purposes of a medical history , or perhaps for government security clearance when applying for the vice presidency in any party is best left to an honest recount of history if it were cancer , one might say they were diagnosed with cancer years ago , treated for a period of time , and have been disease free since i'm not sure psychiatric illnesses are any different
