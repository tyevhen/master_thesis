if you 've read my anxiety story , you 'll know that i have had a close relationship with paracetamol in the past paracetamol used to be one of my many safety blankets for my anxiety i used to take it almost every single day , which of course is n't good for my health , but irrationally , i thought that it would stop me from getting ill and that was a way bigger importance than the issues long term use of paracetamol would cause me i remember a specific time when i was in london for the olympics and i was watching a netball match it was such a big stadium in which i felt really trapped and began to feel ill today , i can correlate the sickness i was feeling to anxiety , but back in i could n't i took paracetamol to make me feel better and in a strange way it made me believe that i would n't be ill in front of all of the people in the stadium , which i know is completely untrue because paracetamol does n't cure nausea , and sometimes it does n't help with stomach aches i would n't even listen to my dad who is a paramedic that 's how strong the irrational brain can be it slowly became a placebo , where if i took it i began to feel better , which of course was all in my mind over time , i managed to get out of this habit because deep down i knew it was ruining my health i also began to be better at self control over the paracetamol as i went further into my recovery i now do n't use paracetamol in this way , apart from the odd occasion but , i'm glad to say that i do n't go through this any more and for any of you that do , it is possible to get through to the other side amy xx
