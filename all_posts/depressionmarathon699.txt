the last post was very difficult for me to write i guess i felt an obligation to stay positive even though life was difficult to feel so poorly , and to write about it so honestly , was quite frightening after submitting my last post , i fretted about it all day i seriously contemplated removing it that post still makes me nervous here 's the thing , i do n't want to feel so bad i do n't want anyone to know i feel so bad and i do n't want to discourage those who land on my site looking for encouragement as difficult as it was to write , and as nerve wracking as it 's been to have it posted , i 've gone against my fears , and left the post in place for all to see i certainly do n't know the impact of that post on most of you it scared the hell out of me , but maybe it was no big deal to many of you maybe some poor soul came and left because they could n't relate maybe some of my friends freaked out at the level of my dysfunction i do n't know how it read to most of you but some of you were kind enough to comment , and your comments literally brought me to my knees i 've been surprised by the number of you who 've written to say my blog has made a difference in your life i am so grateful you took the time to let me know , especially as i struggle through this low , dark place and i am incredibly , gratefully , humbled by those comments i ca n't believe it to hear that i 've made a difference , or inspired , or simply connected with someone outside this little screen is absolutely overwhelming to me i ca n't thank you readers enough you humble me with your honesty and graciousness thank you
