yes , i 've done the unthinkable i 've started yet another blog i think i have four now , each one themed poetry blog , one page story blog which i have n't added anything to in ages blushes , this general blog , and the newest one is all about the acquiring of secondhand yet still totally usable stuff i love shopping at thrift stores , and have n't bought anything new in months my grandma has bought me a few things that i could n't really turn down i 've told her i do n't need new cloths , but she loves shopping ! i also love driving or walking around on garbage day , and seeing what awesome stuff people have put out in the trash i 've found some truly beautiful , often useful things that way ! i also occasionally go to garage sales , bazaar 's , flea markets , or other places where previously owned items can be acquired my idea with my newest blog is to post erratically , just when i feel like it photo 's and the stories attached to them of all my cool secondhand finds www trashhunter blogspot com in other news , i found a quote that i love today when injustice becomes law , rebellion becomes duty which made me think of this quote those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable jfk i wish i knew who the first quote was attributed to in even more news , i heard about couchsurfing com a while back , but i just checked out the site for myself today it seems like a totally awesome way to travel , and i plan on seriously looking into it sometime when i'm not so tired and my brain is working better ! peace , idzie memories of slightly warmer times
