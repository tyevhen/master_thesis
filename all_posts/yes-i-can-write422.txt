the poll that has been open for what feels like forever has now ended ! the results are as follows vegetarian vegan small amount of meat meat lover erm , actually , i voted twice by accident i figured it was ok to vote once , because really , i proofread my blog so that counts as being a reader of this blog , right ? it glitched and said i had n't voted but after i voted again i was like 'wait a minute ? ' anyway , moving on in blogger buzz they talked about the ilike gadget , and since i already have it on facebook and like it , i decided i 'd add a playlist to my blog as well ! so you can now listen to clips of my favorite songs if you so wish something else i should probably make my readers aware of is that i'm no longer vegan i had a war with myself , trying to decide if i should wait out the entire month as i 'd originally planned , or go back to being vegetarian after only two weeks since i 'd decided i did n't want to stay vegan finally , the lure of cheese made up my mind ! so i'm now back to being vegetarian , but i'm no longer drinking straight milk even after adding a tiny bit of milk to my water and hot chocolate powder i felt sick , and no longer eating eggs i am eating baked goods tht contain milk and or eggs , and i'm also as i may have mentioned earlier eating cheese ! i love cheese i'm now off to a friends house i do n't think i 've posted pictures in a while , so i 'll try and get that done soon peace , idzie you might also like montreal vegan for a month , at least slight changes vegetarianism linkwithin
