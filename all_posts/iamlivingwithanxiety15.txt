once upon a time , i was scared of a toaster my fear was that if i left the toaster plugged in , there was a chance that the toaster could start on its own , that this strange but true automatic starting toaster would catch on fire , that the toaster would start a conflagration , that the entire house would burn down therefore , i always checked , double checked , and rechecked that the toaster was unplugged i might put the toaster in my car when i went shopping just to ensure it was n't plugged in my mind buzzed with the possibilities , however unlikely , and a simple household appliance caused me much misery for nervous people , this probably does n't sound too bizarre , as anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders often lead us to do some pretty strange things in retrospect recovery helped me through these feelings i learned to become a realist dr low taught me that anticipation is often worse than realization and , especially , that feelings are not facts i spotted my reaction as distressing but not dangerous i decided i would no longer unplug the toaster , thereby doing the thing i feared and hated to do , as we say in recovery language over time the urge to unplug the toaster decreased and , when i felt the need to check it , i relied on my recovery training in fact , the other day i noticed that my roommate had unplugged the toaster , and i promptly plugged it back in at this moment i realized how much progress i have made since i started this blog in and my recovery training and , and for that i'm giving myself a hearty endorsement
