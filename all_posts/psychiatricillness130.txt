my first attempt to reduce my sertraline did not work i started well but kept getting sharp anxiety attacks which just make my whole body shudder they are short lived though my whole body jumps when i realise i have done something wrong for example , i said my friend 's daughter was in month old clothes in front of my friends husband the child 's father i said this to my parents and their friend later on i remembered she was in to month old clothes as friend 's husband had not said anything i start the thinking he knows i was wrong , i should have let him answer , he was laughing at me , why did n't he say anything the fact that i was just wrong in front of him made me shudder instances such as this made me decide to increase the sertraline again on top of this i have decided to stop eating large amounts of chocalate and biscuits the sugar rush then the withdrawal from the sugar is not helping my moods i have relapsed once in the days i have been doing this and that was only about biscuits , not a whole pack the problem was that i had them for dinner i had two days off work last week as i was feeling quite low anyway in the last week or so i have felt a lot better , i have been eating healthily and lost a few pounds i joined the gym again and have been twice i'm feeling a lot better the last two evenings i have only taken mg of sertraline so far no shudders ! then again no big mistakes i'm having a new sofa delivered tomorrow , i had a new tv delivered last friday so this weekend will be a lazy one sitting on my new sofa and watching my new tv as i am working from home in the morning i am going to try and sort my broardband out o i'm travelling for work for three days next week , i always find those things challenging that is not concerning me too much but at the end of may i am going to a conference in barcellona , that one is really worrying me as it will not be with anyone i know very well and also there will be a lot of external people to meet the main purpose for me will be networking so loads of pressure there o still , if i can keep the anxiety under control it should be really good
