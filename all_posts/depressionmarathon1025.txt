i attended an art show associated with mental health awareness month tonight it was at our local art center , and the art was created by people affected by mental illness three of the six pieces i entered made it into the show it was humbling to see my work hanging among beautiful pieces created by others affected with mental illness standing in a room filled with art created by people like me was amazing we are a creative bunch ! some of the art was profound in it 's simplicity other pieces were telling for their cacophony of shapes and colors there were depictions of journeys through pain and isolation as well as healing and celebration our artwork was as variable as our symptoms can be it was powerful i hope many people will get to see it this is one of my pieces , called winter waterfall , which made it into the show
