in this post i mean to review the basic neurobiology of compulsive behavior uh oh , of you just turned off your computers and started watching past episodes of top chef , just desserts and how could morgan not have won , anyway ? , and also figure out why dr garner 's presumably serotonin deficient , hair pulling mice began scratching and removing hair more on a serotonin promoting mouse chow diet with added glucose and tryptophan to understand what might be happening , we have to back up and talk about obsessions and compulsions and where they exist in the brain for everything we are has a place in the brain right click in new tab for a song compulsions mean performing unpleasantly repetitive or seemingly unnecessary acts in order to prevent perceived negative consequences step on a crack , break your mother 's back scratching , hair pulling and twisting do fit under that definition , as people often perform the behavior to stave off anxiety impulsivity is the predisposition toward rapid , thoughtless acts without regard for the eventual negative consequences such as gambling or uncontrolled aggression , and hair pulling trichotillomania and picking may also fall under this category at first glance , compulsion and impulsivity may seem opposites , but they run in parallel neuronal tracts , and people with symptoms of one will often have symptoms of the other the compulsive and impulsive psychiatric diseases are among the most highly inherited diseases in psychiatry obsessive compulsive disorder , adhd , tourette 's , autism , and substance abuse disorders indisputably run in families , suggesting more even than for other psychiatric disorders physical brain differences between those susceptible to the disorders and those who are not children with autism , for example , are likely to have tics or repetitive physical movements consistent with tourette 's or ocd , or impulsivity consistent with adhd , or both those obsessively driven to drink or gamble are also more likely to be impulsive as well there are all sorts of subcategories of different kinds of obsessive and impulsive behavior that exist along different neuronal tracts the complexity , therefore , is immense however , one can conceptualize the brain as doing two things for impulsive behavior and compulsions on one hand , the brain has tracts that promote these behaviors these tracts generally run from the center , more primal parts of the brain up to the outer civilized cortex the cortex tends to work in the opposite direction , inhibiting compulsions and impulsivity therefore one can become vulnerable to these behaviors via two means either by problems that increase the primal signals from the center of the brain , or by problems that block the civilizing influence of the outer shell of the brain in terms of neurotransmitters , serotonin deficiency is thought to be responsible in part for anxiety driven behaviors , obsessions , skin picking , hair pulling , etc dopamine deficiency in the cortex is responsible for impulsivity such as in adhd however , dopamine excess is thought to be responsible for motor tics , tapping in autism , for example , and other obsessive physical acts but let 's bring it back to garner 's mice they are genetically prone to hair pulling behavior jaminet postulates this is due to a predominant th immune inflammation response to infection , and the hair pulling worsened with increasing serotonin turnover in the brain , despite the general rule that anxiety and picking hair pulling behaviors are due to serotonin deficiency in the mood for more opera ? if so , how about this classic ? but not so fast there may not be as much of a mystery as we like to think in his paper , garner brought up the fact that ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , while used to treat trichotillomania , can also induce skin picking behaviors in some his idea i'm stretching , a bit by the end of the paper was that this particular strain of mice would be a bad candidate for ssri treatment he may be right , but he may be wrong , because increasing serotonin turnover in the brain via diet is not the same as administering an ssri the problem with thinking we know anything about the human brain is that the brain is immensely complex remember a hundred billion neurons with , interconnections each who fire up to times per second and when we strictly limit ourselves to serotonin , we are talking different flavors of receptors , each doing subtly different things garner 's mouse diet increased serotonin turnover overall in the brain , presumably jacking up the general serotonin signal well , there are mouse models for everything , and some have shown that increasing the activation of the serotonin c receptor htc receptor increases compulsive behavior , just like in garner 's mice ssris work a little differently than just blanket administration of serotonin in the brain ssris result in the downregulation of the post synaptic receptors , among them htc therefore they will in general decrease the overall signal away from compulsion , perhaps relieving symptoms ssris will tend to favor serotonin signal to another receptor , the serotonin a receptor activating this receptor tends to reduce anxiety and compulsions more music psychiatrists use a whole host of ssris prozac , paxil , zoloft , celexa , lexapro ect ect yawn yawn but only one serotonin receptor activator buspar , a hta agonist which may well be one of the most useless medicines we have in my experience for better or worse , and for all their limitations , ssris do a better job of modulating the anxiety compulsion symptoms than straight up administration of serotonin via a tryptophan promoting diet or tryptophan supplements again , the medicines are not my interest in this blog , but our knowledge of how they work , and the animal models , give us clues as to how our brains work , and that i find interesting are our brains better off with a diet of whole foods with just enough omega s , not too many omega s , no weird industrial designer pseudofood or toxic plant proteins ? most likely and garner 's mice tell us that straying from the design parameters of the diet our brain likes may well cause major problems and that sugar and tryptophan supplementation may cause major problems , if we share genetic vulnerabilities with his mice that is one theory i also question whether kyurnetic and inflammation in general were escalated with garner 's mice 's experimental diet from my comments on dr jaminet 's post just want to add to my speculation about increasing inflammation which i think is the more likely scenario tryptophan is a precursor for both serotonin and kyrunetic the former helps modulate major brain circuitry communication , the latter seems to encourage excitatory communication , and in excess will be neurotoxic kyurnetic is elevated in cases of inflammation ssris increase serotonin initially , but then after weeks , the post synaptic receptors are down regulated , so the overall effect is not so much to increase serotonergic transmission , but to make what transmission there is go through more efficiently ssris also seem to favor the metabolic pathway of tryptophan to serotonin rather than kyrurnetic it is possible that by massively increasing the tryptophan uptake into the brain in the context of the baseline inflammatory diet and a genetically vulnerable mouse population , there were increases in kyurnetic , leading to neurotoxicity and mouse psychopathology i m not a big fan of l tryptophan and htp for that reason i know you are not a fan due to tryptophan 's role in the infectious theory of neurotoxicity since this scenario probably occurs in the human brain as well , it makes one wonder about our usda diets so , take your pick but there are many plausible methods by which increasing tryptophan can increase picking hair pulling behaviors , and more and more reasons to eat well from the beginning
