following on from last week 's post i can now confirm that the peppermint creams were delicious and gone in two minutes i took a box of them along to a friend 's party and they were gratefully received by the adults as well as the children so as i have one culinary success ! under my belt i thought i would branch out this week and have a go at making chutney my dad loves chutney and as i am hosting the big 'turkey dinner' this year i thought it would be a nice touch to make him a jar of spiced apple chutney i decided to utilise the internet to find a good recipe and during my search i stumbled across the history of chutney until that moment i had n't even given the origin much thought , but it made for an interesting read so i thought i would share my findings with you before we all rush off to soak our apples legend has it that a british army officer by the name of major grey , who lived in colonial india in the th century , loved curries so much he made his own chutney using mango , raisins , vinegar , lime , onion , tamarind and spices this is where some believe the classic mango chutney originates of course , prior to major grey , chutney was a regular guest at any dinner table in india and the exotic spices were brought back by traders in the th century usually made as a relish of fresh fruit and spices , chutney can be made from almost any combination of vegetables , fruits , herbs and spices there are plenty of varieties out there the word 'chutney' is hindustani and as far as i can ascertain , means either 'crushed' or 'lick' both are quite apt ! if you are looking for a perfect chutney recipe then you ca n't go wrong with a good old delia smith variety , however , delia does recommend potting and sealing your chutney for months before eating this causes me a slight problem as christmas day is sleeps away ! fear not i managed to tweak a recipe for a 'no cook spiced apple' variety which only needs to rest for days i say 'tweaked' with some trepidation as my larder appeared to be missing a couple of core ingredients i opted for the famous 'whatever is left in the cupboard' ingredient list i shall report back after christmas dinner to confirm that my dad is still alive and well ! this is what you need no cook spiced apple chutney large apples , peeled , cored and diced red onion , chopped g sultanas ml red wine vinegar g dark brown soft sugar tsp ground ginger tsp cumin pinch cayenne seasoning mix all the ingredients together , give them a good stir and season well pour into a sterilised jar and leave in the fridge for days shake once a day shake before eating keep for up to a week once open so there you have it , quick and easy chutney ready for christmas day do you have a chutney recipe you would like to share ? maybe you prefer to make something else at this time of year a family tradition of your own ? i hope you have enjoyed my december challenge i would like to thank everyone for the wonderful comments and feedback i receive on the blog , by email and on my resolution challenge facebook page i love to hear what you think so please do keep in touch merry christmas everyone x
