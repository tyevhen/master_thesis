photo by julsatmidnight for my work i am a manager over approximately people i love what i do i love adding organization to the chaos and being in the know however there are many things about being a manager that i struggle with one quality that i don t have is assertiveness my ceo has told me she wishes i were more assertive i don t know if i ever will be every once in awhile i have to have an extremely awkward conversation with one of my team members if they are not performing the way i know they can i hate doing this and i usually procrastinate doing it until the problem has lingered for far too long i just want everyone to like me and i know that unrealistic but subconsciously i will try to achieve that anyway today i knew i couldn t hold off any longer i practiced several times what i would say to him and then called him in to chat needless to say i was able to say what i had to in a nice way and we were able to talk a bit about it after we were done i didn t feel like he hated me nor had any hard feelings toward me so i am taking that as success i may not be the smoothest manager out there , but i can do what has to be done whether i like it or not that has been the hardest thing about my job once i had to fire someone and i was so nervous i had a panic attack right before hand and threw up everything i think the conversation took about minutes in total afterwards i was shaking i felt so horrible but it had to be done , so i did it so even though i really like my coworker as a person , it s my responsibility to make sure our resources are going to the most qualified people and even though i disagree with about of everything my ceo says , i really like how she said something to the effect of , when you don t say anything about a behavior that is not acceptable , you are ultimately giving them permission that employee deserves to know what they can do better in otherwise they will never grow i know that if i am doing a poor job i would want someone to talk with me about it and give me opportunities to do better before they just decided it wasn t working out and it was time to let me go if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like a year later same scenario , different outcome comfortable in my own skin success exists and i'm on top of the world level panic , but i survived linkwithin
