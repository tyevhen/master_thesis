i was going to blog tonight but fear i expended my energy on this poem with my dog in the rain deer paths , thin passages of hoof flattened grass sometimes widen into creeks dividing the high brush by which we follow , the dog running circles around my plodding subsidy to his energy , down the slope to the stream , riparian gully of sword ferns and stunted birches with puffs of pale lime moss follow to cliff where water threads over , carving through sand to surf swells lift the ocean in a parade of salt explosions liquid tons thundering against the jagged implacable wall of sea resisting rock though wilting in time , soon gravel one cold rain drop splits my forehead like chilled mercury , slips between my eyebrows , sobers meanwhile i continue to labor in the promotion of my book see panels above like a voice crying in the wilderness , subsisting on locusts and honey , like atlas shouldering the world , like sisyphus dueling the boulder up and down the hill it is , btw , for your convenience , now available in paperback at amazon com how they are able to offer it so cheaply and so soon i have no idea but the hardback is a better deal , which you can find at diminuendo press just because i 've had a complete work published does not mean that i'm over poetry and have quit writing it quite the contrary , the closure of the book has released me to write more freely than ever , as this rough draft above may demonstrate i suppose i will always be at heart a nature poet , and i make no apologies about it my relationship to the urban has always been to seek the triumph of the natural within it , as in polished beach glass born of littering or dandelions blooming in asphalt cracks , hawks nesting in glass towers here 's a short example found park downtown in a paved lot ringed by sagging chain link i found a dandelion forest where purple stalks over six feet tall sprouted from asphalt ridges roots buckled for the sun there was n't a trace of dirt their white seed filaments looked tightly bunched inside green trumpets unlike the silver hundred legged spiders that hover over lawns their flowers were deeper yellow , smaller and thicker , plentiful as stars published in terrain in any case , the carved wooden indonesian frog doctor on my desk advises me , with his hooded eye , that it is past my bedtime so be it kilobunny , ce
