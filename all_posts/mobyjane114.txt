dear a b i forgot about the desiderata truly wonderful it has continually amazed me when people want share their worst case scenarios i will try find your blog i have only figured out email but perhaps my husband can help me with the computer he is part hawaiian and talk story is a big part of his cultural heritage my other challenge is that i have been told i m compassionate my mom is in continual pain and can hardly move due osteoporosis i listen and try focus on being present and gently positive but sometimes feel like i am suffering with her if that makes sense i guess it 's a fine line one image i have found helpful is from a love story that starred cher and nicholas cage i believe it was called moonstruck my favorite scene is when nicholas cage professes his love her and she responds by slapping him and yelling snap out of it ! whenever i start going in a downward spiral i imagine that scene only cher is yelling snap out of it ! to me it usually helps break the cycle thanx so much i have appreciated talking story dear s since your husband is hawaiian perhaps he knows of the ooponopono meditation it is quite wonderful i use it often a b curtiss
