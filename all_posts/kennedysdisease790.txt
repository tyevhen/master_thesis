i remember when i was diagnosed with als i could not have been more devastated then , a few years later , when my diagnosis was corrected to spinal bulbar muscular atrophy , it was initially a relief it did not take long , however , for reality to settle in i had kennedy s disease ! my symptoms appeared in the late s i am now when i look back at those first days after finding out i had kd , i have to laugh life did not end with the diagnosis it began after the initial shock , i realized i had control of my thoughts and feelings the diagnosis was also a wake up call i climbed mountains in my s , sailed the san juan islands , explored the reefs in hawaii , hiked hundreds of miles of trails in the mountains and lowlands , and became a licensed pilot i could go on , but all this happened after the symptoms appeared the redeeming feature of kennedy s disease is it progresses slowly i still have good days and bad days , just as i did before kd i still become frustrated and resentful at times i still lash out at others when it is meant for me and , what is interesting about this is that these events would also happen if i did not have kd it is called life i experience , adjust and adapt but , i continue to live the best life possible life is a journey of discovery and , as with any person s life , there are hills and valleys , as well as rivers and deserts , that have to be traversed there will be good times and not so good times , but each will be its own learning experience that is why this blog is called , living with kennedy s disease until there is a cure photo https weheartit com entry
