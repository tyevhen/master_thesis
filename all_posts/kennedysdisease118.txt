i have described those times where i wake up feeling substantially weaker i call it 'the slide' because the day before it happens 'life is good' and everything seems to be going along just fine then i wake up and find it difficult to do almost anything i never know how long i will be in the weaker state or if i will ever come out of it feeling stronger again i call the 'life is good' period 'the plateau' it seems like my strength level has stabilized and i am more comfortable with my current capabilities 'the slide' period is a difficult period for me both physically and emotionally my muscles ache , my daily exercises are more difficult to perform , i just do not have the energy i normally have , just getting up and moving around is more difficult , and i can sense a new weakness that was not there before as depicted in the picture above , the emotional aspect of 'the slide' is difficult i do not know when i will reach the next plateau when the slide will end or where i will end up strength wise fortunately , the plateaus last a lot longer than the slides this break allows me to become comfortable with my new level of capabilities often , through focused exercise , i can come back a little as i become older , the slides seem to be less frequent , but more noticeable when i was younger , the slides often occurred after over doing it i worked , exercised , or played too hard often after these events , i would have to rest for a day or more to recover since i am now substantially weaker , i believe the slides are more noticeable because of my current level of strength when i saw my neurologist last may and explained my most recent slide , he commented that he had never heard of something like this before he questioned whether i was just having some emotional issues that were causing the physical symptoms i convinced him that what i was experiencing was real and nothing to do with anxiety or depression he then wanted to hear more about it i promised to let him know the next time a slide occurs he is a great doctor who listens and learns from my experiences this last sunday was a good , normal day for me monday morning , i noticed that i was having difficulty with some of my exercises monday evening i was having difficulty standing up from my chair this morning i was struggling to stand up and did not feel safe when standing for long is it the beginning of a slide ? i hope not i would be interested to know if i am the only one that experiences these moments then i would think it was psychosomatic when you wake up weaker one day and struggle with the weakened state for several days
