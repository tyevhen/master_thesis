my coworker awoke monday morning with a sore throat , muscle aches , and congestion she came to work for a couple of hours , which is exactly what i would have done because we are so , so busy , but she did go home before lunch apparently that was too late i'm sick and i hate being sick ! i felt it coming on as i was leaving work yesterday now i have a sore throat , muscle aches and congestion , too my coworker , who never misses a day , has been out of work days in a row but unlike my coworker , who as a full time employee has benefits like sick time , i ca n't afford to miss days of work as a part time employee , i do not have the same benefits so besides feeling awful , i'm stressed about the potential of missed income i'm pretty sure getting stressed about something that may happen wo n't help me feel any better today so i'm trying to focus on the things i can actually control in the here and now i have cancelled all of my scheduled appointments and activities for the day i started taking a zinc based product , which in the past has helped me avoid serious illness , but right now i feel like crud i do n't like feeling like crud because it feels too similar to some of my depression symptoms , and that makes me nervous that 's another reason to really try to take care of this today in the past i have had episodes of depression arise out of physical illness , and the longer the physical illness lasts , the more likely the depression it seems everything which occurs in my life comes back to depression , either avoiding it or treating it i wonder if that 's similar for people with other chronic illnesses , like diabetes or ms ? hmm interesting question anyway , that 's all i have for now i do n't want to , but i better crawl back into bed i 've been up for a couple of hours , and i'm already exhausted damn
