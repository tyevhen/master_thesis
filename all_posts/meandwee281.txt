my dearest paige , this letter is a little late this month we 've been away celebrating the holidays we were at nana and grampa 's house in maine for christmas , then we went to grammy and rico 's house in connecticut our final stop was to the carty family house in vermont to celebrate new year 's with lots of friends phew ! now we are home and you are finally adjusting to your old routine after lots of screaming sleepless nights you are months old now out of the teens and drawing nearer to turning i can hardly believe it we 've been so lucky to witness how sweet you are so gentle and easy going you are also a bit shy and seem to open up only when someone is outgoing with you first i think you are best friends with anyone willing to dangle you upside down and twirl you all over the place you seem to love being chased you look back with a sly grin as you begin to run how can we not chase you after you make such a cute face ? but you do cute things a lot , as toddlers do , and today was no exception you did a little dance to the song superfreak as you looked at your new dress up jewelry in the mirror daddy got that one on video that i hope to post soon i hope you do n't mind it 's too cute not to share it was so wonderful to share the holidays with you your daddy and i stared at our stockings all in a row on the mantle and we both got very teary we felt so lucky as we hugged and looked at them his , yours , and mine i 'd never realized i 'd been waiting for that moment all of my life to have a little stocking for santa to fill next to ours yours it was a surreal and unbelievable moment for both of us a reminder of how grateful we are for you and how lucky we are wonderful things are in store for you in the year ahead i wish i could express here how excited i am about them all i love you my little peanut there is only one special you full of wonder , love and life a million hugs and kisses would n't be enough to show you , but i 'll tell you again that i love you forever and always love , mama save
