a while back , one of our readers wrote a comment discussing the distress of being strip searched upon admission to a psychiatric facility the reader felt this was particularly egregious because she had been a victim of sexual abuse and this insensitive treatment , unnecessary in her case , caused her to relive the distress of past sexual abuse and psychiatry should be about healing , not opening wounds and causing pain and suffering i felt badly for our reader in fact , i felt badly for anyone put through such a practice , but i suppose i understand that outrageous and dangerous things happen in psychiatric hospitals and this could be a no win situation what about the person who is assaulted by a patient who had a razor taped to their inner thigh that went undetected would n't that patient feel it was awful that no one had searched the perpetrator ? and staff on psychiatric units are not uncommonly assaulted , should n't they have the right to do what 's necessary to protect themselves ? i'm not sure that includes strip searches , but i suppose if there 's a couple of stories of contraband or weapons or drugs being sneaked in , then policies change one guy has an explosive in his sneakers years ago , and millions of people are taking off their flip flops every day in airports i ca n't say that particular practice ever made me feel safer okay , i also did n't know that psychiatric units strip search patients i have n't worked on an inpatient unit in many years , and if this occurred , i imagine it was done by the nurses , if at all back then , i never heard a patient complain about this or even mention it , and in the years since , i 've never had a patient mention being strip searched during an admission i'm guessing that it 's not a universal phenomena ? actually , i'm guessing that most hospitals do n't strip search psychiatric patients , and really , if they do , i 'd be pressed to know why just psychiatric patients , many people in hospitals have histories of unsavory behavior okay , so just in case i'm not appalled enough , yesterday the supreme court , in florence v bd of chosen freeholders voted that anyone who is arrested , for even the most minor of crimes walking your dog without a leash , jay walking , you name it can be strip searched before being placed in jail the court says that even minor violators can be dangerous , and note that timothy mcveigh was arrested for driving without a license and one of the terrorists was stopped for a traffic violation would strip searching them have stopped their terrorist attacks or prevented any future bad events ? as doctors , we think in terms of risk , evidence based medicine , best practices , statistical events , not anecdote , but i'm convinced that anecdote is much more powerful than science and i do n't think this supreme court decision bodes well for treating psychiatric patients any more humanely if it 's no big deal to strip someone who did n't pay a traffic fine for example , mr florence in the above named case , but oops , he actually did pay the fine years earlier and there was a computer error , oh my , then i ca n't see why there would be sympathy for the dignity of anyone else
