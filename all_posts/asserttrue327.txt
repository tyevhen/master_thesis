my good friend jeff e mailed me the other day to ask how the book is coming i'm , words into a comedic novella he knows i 've run into problems with it here and there i wo n't call it writer 's block as i try to work out the story line and keep numerous balls in the air at the same time he asked what i do when i get bogged down watch a movie , perhaps ? this is what i wrote back to him in stalled writer mode correct , sir to combat blockage , i do resort to movies , books , diversions twitter , linkedin , long e mails to friends , more coffee , a few minutes on the porch while the dogs take their potty break , basically anything but exercise not counting sex as exercise , in this case last night i watched half a movie may or may not watch the rest a story about some people who try to befriend an antisocial dwarf who has inherited a broken down train depot i am not kidding that 's the premise i thought i might get some ideas while watching it but it 's kinda slow yet it got great reviews it 's called the station agent i also continue to read gravity 's rainbow the story is starting to pick up a little p now , near the end of part out of although the book ca n't , in all seriousness , be said to have a plot i do admit to being fascinated by pynchon 's writing style mystified and fascinated how did he get this thing published ? first of all , what english speaking reader is going to know all the french and latin and german terms ? what kind of audience knows even the english words he uses ? words like palimpsest , scombroid , nacreous , velleity who said it 's okay to have a page novel without a plot ? etc etc the reason i read it is that the command of language is unbelievable and the damn fool knows his writing is ace , because he delights in throwing in the occasional sez for says and other irritations just for fun ! reading it is a kind of zen challenge i deconstruct as i go i look at what he 's describing , and compare it with how he 's describing it , and it 's quite educational the dialog is just as infuriating as the narrative characters speaking in half sentences , two chars engaging in parallel soliloquys rather than replying to each other , punctuation all over the place someone in a forum excerpted a word sentence and called it a cluster fuck of words that 's about right still , there 's a certain logic behind it i can see the boeing tech writer in him , and it 's endearing to go from a sadomasochism scene to differential equations in the space of a few pages he actually cites a few equations here and there poisson 's formula , plus an equation for yaw stability of a rocket the love scenes lack passion which i have to conclude must be deliberate on pynchon 's part and the story , overall , lacks heart , but i think not to belabor the obvious there 's a certain attempt here to render the story that way intentionally , yes ? because it 's a war story , and war with its debasement of life and monstrous bureaucracy is a sterile and heartless business by its very nature so again , pynchon gets away with things that would not work in other stories this story if it can be properly so called works well with the kind of approach he uses , whereas i do n't think it would work for a wide range of settings and themes the meta theme here is death , war , destruction , paranoia , the culture of war engineering the quick , quick , mr pynchon , what 's the german word ? sinnlosigkeit , the meaninglessness , of all the above the tale is told in suitably parallel style , aggregating seemingly pointless vignettes into a strenuously lifeless non story about characters who come , go , eat , fuck , talk , all the while never quite interacting with each other in any kind of meaningful way a remarkable synthesis , really reading pynchon , i feel like i'm on a grand journey of some kind , and having been liberated from the tyranny of plot and climax and denouement , i'm at leisure to enjoy the journey for its own sake with no obligation to care about the destination or route if the journey should end with disorienting , unfulfilling suddenness as the war in europe did , hitler vanishing into the aether , i 'll disembark none the worse for wear
