i believe that challenging oneself is always a good thing it helps you to conquer fears , explore previously intimidating ground and hopefully emerge with more experience as a result i thought that painting clear plastic would be challenging in that it would force me to paint with a bit of abstraction it is a paradox really because i am just painting what i see , but the plastic distorts the figure behind it thus when i created each of these paintings over the course of a year i had to stop seeing things in sharp detail and relax my eyes to discern the simple shapes and trust that when i stood back from the piece it would all cohere together it is as close to abstraction that i have ever been it is difficult to paint something that can barely be seen the same goes for lace , gauze , anything translucent or diaphanous i paint in a planar , chunky style anyway so it was even more apparent in these paintings , which was fun i get pretty close to the paintings as i work on them so it was great to step back a good distance and see what came together or did not work to paint something that is there but not there is quite a challenge it really was a treat to paint more organic shapes , with less worry about fingernails and eyelashes as with my other work i wanted to capture laura in a moment of contemplation , perhaps a moment of doubt or reflection again and always , the answer is unclear laura is always amenable to my sometimes strange requests , such as standing in her shower while i clambered about for a good angle she and my friend gayle both live in places where there is a career 's worth of paintings waiting to happen both environments are large and inviting , creativity flourishes there i am very fortunate and appreciative that they let me into their personal spaces the longer you look at an object , the more abstract it becomes , and , ironically , the more real lucian freud
