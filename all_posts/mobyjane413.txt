this is a continuation of correspondence from sunday august dear a b i'm not sure exactly how your classmate felt , but to me it did feel like survival of the fittest type response , that if i do n't get my act together , i wo n't ever get out of depression and make it in life that life is a tough place which was quite frightening when you find yourself often debilitated somehow by this chemical imbalance and struggling to make the switches work every depression and symptoms are different , some can function and be productive on the surface like you seem to do marriage , family , career , and some , like me , just don t have the strength to fight the forces of depression to even have a life outside of depression at the moment but as your professor said , and that can change and that was very powerful to hear what i m finding that my energy level gets depleted with keeping active , attempts at brainswitching , that maybe once a week , i just need to stay in bed and do nothing the more i push myself , which i do currently have to do , the more fatigue physical and mental gets to me is this okay to relax in bed although inactivity does breed negative thoughts y dear y it is my personal opinion that if you get a good night 's sleep then you should get up and get going when morning comes and stick to some regular schedule of morning chores like making your bed , doing some exercises , getting groomed and dressed for the day , and bringing some order to your environment , etc if you do n't feel real peppy , you can move slowly through the day and cut yourself some slack as to what you actually accomplish but taking to one 's bed can become a place to hide from oneself and what is really going on , and can become a bad habit it 's better to live as normal a life as possible , in step with the rest of humanity , and this does n't usually include staying in bed once a week a b curtiss dear a b it makes a lot of sense that it does become a bad habit , and that it 's important to go along with the rest of society humanity thank you always for your precious time and advice of wisdom with infinite gratitude , y
