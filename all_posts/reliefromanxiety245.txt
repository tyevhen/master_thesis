i have always been a shy person throughout the whole of my life i 've hated joining clubs and standing on stage my teachers tried their best in trying to improve my confidence , but it has been little to no help somehow , i think i 've been born shy but , i also believe my mental health issues began to shows signs from the age of years old having to make sure certain things were done before i went to bed and before i got to school because i 've been a shy person throughout my life , it was hard to notice a change in myself with regards to anxiety however , my anxiety story began at the beginning of my exams in , which would have been around march i first noticed that something was odd when i began to feel really ill every day at first i assumed it was a virus , but soon it would n't go away and i constantly felt i needed to leave the classroom whilst in school it was horrible with constant sickness , stomach aches and lack of sleep i assumed it was exam stress , but little did i know it would continue i managed to go through all of my exams and my sickness began to wear off by the time the summer holidays came around it was the best summer i have ever had i went to the olympics and spent long summer days with my friends however , i still had worries in the back of my mind one of the main worries from the summer was sickness in any big event or enclosed space , such as a hall or stadium i felt i needed to get out and felt really ill i began to take paracetamol on a regular basis to try and stop the sickness , even though it had no effect it was like a safety blanket as i begun to develop this fear of being ill in front of people i believe my first panic attack was on results day i was so nervous , i could n't breathe and was crying i just assumed that this was nerves that got out of control but , my panic attacks continued and i remember having several over the last few months of the year when catching public transport , going to school , driving lessons , applying for jobs , school trips and so on i joined the sixth form in september of , and on the first day i felt really , really ill i thought i was going to be sick everywhere i was exhausted but yet again i presumed it was just nerves from starting a new year it continued quite severely for a week or so , until it began to pass off due to my increasing anxiety , i begun to see a hypnotherapist in the last few months of and into , who helped me greatly slowly , but surely my panic attacks decreased i was really enjoying sixth form , until i got to january in january i had a breakdown i got into school one day and completely panicked i explained to my friend that i had to go and i could n't stay from that day in january i could n't leave the house i could n't go to school , so i had to have work sent home i could n't answer the phone to my teachers either i had to cancel my driving lessons and any meetings with friends it was hell on earth everything that i loved was being taken away at that time , people thought i was really ill i had been to the doctors a few times complaining of great stomach pain and generally feeling horrible i had my bloods done and it turned out that there was n't anything wrong with me it was just in my head in a weird way i was hoping for something to be wrong with me just so my problems could be solved as time moved on , i slowly managed to leave my house i remember the first time i walked to the shop at the end of the road and remembering what an amazing feeling it was it was only a quick trip , but i left my house and paid for something as time continued , i managed to catch public transport , including going on the train to london with my dad i had to find some strength to fight the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me school was still a great problem i went very little , and everyday was a physical and mental pain my mum would take me to the school gate and i would have panic attacks every day and be crying with sadness and exhaustion sometimes i could go to school , but other times i would just sit outside the gate it would be true to say that most of my a levels studies were spent outside of school rather than inside nevertheless , hard work and self teaching allowed me to get to university , although it was all a guessing game at the time as to whether i would even make it it got to around march and i began to go back to driving lessons however , school was a great problem i struggled to step inside the building without feeling really ill and exhausted many people hate school and find it boring , but if i could 've just gone to school with ease it would 've been the best thing each day was different some days i did conquer my fears , other days i could n't unfortunately , in june i had a severe panic attack , one of the worst i 've known and it was only a few months ago that i began to take driving lessons once more july around the end of i began to have counselling and cbt on the nhs , which helped me immensely i believe i had to be transferred to three different counselors and took some tests to find out that my most severe anxiety is health , followed by social anxiety and panic attacks as some of you may have read , i left therapy in may , which is an amazing feeling however , in february when my anxiety , depression and suicidal thoughts were at their worst , i began to take a medication called citalopram thanks to my mum and i now never look back it is the best thing that has happened in regards to this condition since that time i have now had two part time jobs , graduated from university with first class honours and am on my way to fulfilling my dream career i am still on medication and continuing to battle my anxiety panic attacks are few and far between and i'm currently seeing a counsellor , which does help i still experience bouts of depression and anxiety , but i 'd go as far to say that i am almost recovered looking back now , i was once in hell a place where i had no capabilities to enjoy any aspect of my life , and now i have moved out and am living independently a day i never thought i would ever see it 's really hard to write about this to the wide world , but i'm doing it with the understanding that it will help others i hope this brief overview of my anxiety story so far , has helped you to come to terms with your own amy xx
