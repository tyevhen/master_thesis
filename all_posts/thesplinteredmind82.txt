the clock read pm i had just enough time to zip across town to make it to my checkup i had been working on this since march i wanted to avoid taking high blood pressure meds , so my doctor asked me to lose pounds i was pounds away from that goal i was exercising regularly and had also changed my diet drastically , so there was a very good chance i was going to beat the system i felt happy and relaxed despite my upcoming tsa experience with a grown man wearing gloves actually , i was trying very hard not to think of that part calm calm i know he 's gonna be checking my prostate , but remain calm ! alright , fine i was relaxed physically , but mentally i was wound tighter than a yo yo that 's probably why i messed up my usual routine put on coat put on shoes walk through door close and lock door pat down for keys whoops so now i'm sitting by my minivan awaiting my sixth grader 's return home i'm locked out of both my minivan and my house fortunately , it is a warm , gently breezy day i 've read some news , looked over my novel , and resisted the urge to delete it all as a pile of hopeless dreck i 've even rescheduled my appointment for next month which gives me some time to get rid of that last pound and ths most of all , i have remained calm and , more importantly , i have planned how i'm going to save face when my daughter returns home , i will duck down , let her open the door , then i 'll show up a few minutes later and pretend i 'd just arrived home it 's a perfect plan , assuming she 's remembered her key and does n't wonder why the minivan was already in the driveway let 's just keep this a secret between you few thousand readers and myself , alright ? you might also like depression and fear tastes great but less filling add you 've just got to laugh adult adhd sometimes it 's your fault , but do n't let it get you down add adhd priorities ? what are those ? linkwithin
