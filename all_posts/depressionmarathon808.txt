i feel like i should say more about the triathlon , but i'm not sure what to say the truth is i have mixed feelings about my performance i know i should be happy to have finished i know i said finishing was my ultimate goal , and it was i did n't drop out of the swim because i wanted to at least finish right there in the lake , i told myself , you started this finish it unfortunately , that was only about yards into the lake hence the mixed feelings the fact is , i am happy i finished , but i'm really disappointed with the swim i knew it was going to be tough i knew i would be scared i knew it would take me longer than swimming yards in the pool what i did n't expect what was truly humbling , was being one of the last people out of the water it took me minutes to get out of the lake like i said , it was humbling i knew the swim would be scary and hard , but it was worse than that and that was the problem i can swim ! ! yet every time i put my face in the water i could n't stand it i ended up either floating on my back or doing the backstroke almost the entire yards i do n't think i did more than yards of freestyle i was so pissed , but i could n't seem to do anything about it maybe i bit off more than i could chew maybe i should n't have started the race maybe i should n't have done the long course maybe , maybe , maybe yet i'm glad i started i'm glad i pushed myself and i am proud of the fact that i finished yet , i'm disappointed , too mixed up i'm not sure what to feel , or what to write , or what to say i guess i'm still digesting the whole experience i'm trying to be humbled , yet grateful i'm trying to focus on the positives i'm trying not to be too hard on myself i know , i know it was my first attempt one thing is for sure disappointment drives me to do better i foresee another triathlon in my future , if for no other reason than that
