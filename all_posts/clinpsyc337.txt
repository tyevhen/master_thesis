it appears that the fda is conducting an investigation of the safety of over the counter cold medications for children apparently , the safety of these medications in children is largely unknown despite their widespread use in kids there are also concerns that in overdose , these meds may be harmful or perhaps fatal i appreciate that the fda is getting off its duff , but stephany at the soulful sepulcher has an even better idea how about the fda investigating the safety of psychiatric medications in kids ? something tells me that zyprexa , seroquel , and depakote might , just maybe , have more safety issues in kids than dimetapp or robitussin hey , maybe there is a problem with the cold meds , but can we at least consider that heavy duty psych meds might also impact the health of youth ? after all , meds such as the atypical antipsychotics are experiencing quite the boom in prescriptions for kids would n't we want to be sure that this boom was not leading to a corresponding increase in health problems ?
