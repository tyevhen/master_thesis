last night i opened a bill which was dated january , do n't panic it was paid on time , i think i point it out because this bill was only one in a pile , and i mean a pile , of mail i had n't opened over the last two months that 's not typical for me i'm usually a bit more on top of things i knew my mail had taken a back seat recently , but i did n't realize i 'd been piling it up since late december ! piling my unopened mail was but one of many things i put off during january and february on top of working a regularly scheduled job for the first time in years , i was cranking out days of yoga once that class ended , i began focusing on training for grandma 's marathon and this highlights another dilemma of my illness i ca n't focus energy on anything extra without pulling energy and focus away from other , even simple , things it 's frustrating piling up my mail , my dirty clothes , or my dishes is frustrating because i feel i'm skipping simple tasks , which i should be able to handle those 'shoulds' always get me in trouble the piles represent my efforts to avoid getting overwhelmed , by judiciously doling out my energy , yet the piles in and of themselves are overwhelming ! worse , they are constant reminders of my continued limitations do n't you hate reminders of your limitations ? but i'm pressing on i'm attempting to cut off feeling overwhelmed by going through my piles i'm finding i can only do a bit at a time , and i'm trying to be okay with that taking credit for what i accomplish , no matter how simple it may seem , is important , too negatively bashing myself certainly would n't help going through my piles may take energy away from running tomorrow , but energy may also be stolen if i do n't go through them so i'm pressing on i 'll let you know how it turns out
