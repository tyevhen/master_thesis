i'm going to try meditating at first , it seemed daunting , as i'm always so busy but i read at the mayo clinic 's site that it does n't have to be a big time commitment to pay off here 's a meditation video i just tried http www mayoclinic com health meditation mm give it a shot it only takes a few minutes , and i found it soothing the real test is whether i can stick with it during the week ! do you have any online meditation videos to share ?
