the confusion of tongues , by gustave dore chapter of how to read the bible discusses the tower of babel in the story , the people were building a city with a tower that reached up to heaven god saw the tower and decided to confuse their speech so that they could n't understand each other anymore ancient interpreters added context they believed that everyone at that time spoke exactly the same language as such , they could accomplish anything when god saw that they had such high aspirations as to reach heaven , he confused them so that they would be unable to ever reach that high again it is a story of human arrogance to ancient interpreters , it is the tower that angered god because it reached so high however , modern scholars question this emphasis on the tower if the tower were the whole point in the story , why mention that they were building a city as well ? in fact , after god confused the language and scattered the people , the bible says and they left off building the city genesis the bible does n't even say a word about the tower 's fate thus , modern scholars are saying that the point of the story is n't human arrogance at all the story is actually an indication of how the biblical israelites thought about babylon babylon 's civilization must have seemed like teeming conglomerations to the sparsely populated israelites the story is about how god does not favor such a living situation god also did not favor the use of metal tools to quarry or shape the stones of an altar , which is something the babylonians were doing if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of hewn stones , for if you wield your tool on it you profane it exodus well into modern times , people believed that all languages were corruptions of the one original language ancient interpreters believed that this original language was hebrew after all , in the bible , god always spoke to himself , and to people , in hebrew there was plenty of aramaic included in the bible , so why have god speak in hebrew rather than aramaic ? because , clearly , hebrew was the original language modern linguists mostly agree that all semitic languages do go back to one root language , but that this language is not hebrew this theoretical language is called proto semitic biblical hebrew is several developmental jumps away from proto semitic in fact , moses could n't have written the bible , modern linguists say , because his hebrew was much older than that used in the bible nor can the pentateuch , or the book of psalms , be the work of one author because the hebrew used is from at least two different periods or regions all bible quotes are from the english standard version this is part of a series of posts for my upcoming bible as literature group read to read the rest of my notes , go here
