time for an appreciation post ! i'm not usually one with words , but this is important as i 've mentioned in my post 'my year in review' , it has been an extremely hard year and it 's made me see many sides to humankind below i have written a little passage to all of the people that have helped me survive this year family this year , i have needed my family more than ever and i am glad to say that they have been here for me not everyone understands or knows about it , but it 's generally been a good response , even if it 's been a task to explain what it 's all about my mum especially , has given every waking moment to me when my anxiety has taken over she has gone over and beyond to help me through i wish i never had to put her through any of it , but as many of you know anxiety can be overwhelming and can affect everyone around you she 's a lifesaver and miracle worker ! ha my auntie has been there on the phone to talk whenever as she suffers with mental health herself , it 's great to to be able to talk to someone who 's been through it too words can never explain how much i appreciate them and the support they have given me i hope they know their worth friends as i 've mentioned before , i have found out who my real friends are even though some may not understand they have n't avoided me i am very lucky to have people who have supported me and listened during the harder times teachers my first assumption was that i 'd have to leave the school i am studying at i thought that they would think that i'm stupid , weak , that i'm skipping school on purpose and that they 'd laugh how wrong i was ! they have been a main part of my recovery and have been so supportive they 've chatted to me about it , sent work home , given me a lot of leeway with times and rooms i will never forget them they have worked so hard , using their spare time to make sure i still continue to stay in school it 's helped immensely and i hope they understand their importance throughout my journey and the changes they can make to people 's lives not having the ability to go to school , has made me realise how important it is and how much i miss it all it 's true to say you do n't know what you 've got until it 's gone you when i started this blog and only had a few views , i was so happy that i had the ability to help a few people now , i am beginning to make some friends in the blogging world and help more people out as the days go by knowing that i can improve someone 's life just a little bit , is a great thing to me in return , the lovely things you write to me , make my day and keep me going i hope that we can continue this journey , and we can fight this battle together be thankful for all of the people that support you and make sure you let them know remember that talking is key i understand that not everyone has someone to talk to and reactions may be different , but it 's important to note that what you think may happen , is n't always the case many will react in a positive manner from experience , i know that not everyone will be understanding or be graceful with words everyone has experienced this in regards to mental health , but it 's important to know that there are people out there who love you and support you try and find someone in your life that you can talk to it takes a lot of courage to talk because of your perceptions , but it will help you a lot there are always charities and i am always here to help i wish you all the best for and let this be the year we win the battle against our mental health ! amy xx
