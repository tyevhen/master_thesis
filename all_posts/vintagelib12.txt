a couple of months ago i took modelled as part of a fundraiser for the canberra endometriosis centre at blue illusion it was a great success we raised ! while the clothes are n't quite my usual style , i still ended up walking away with the blue pinstriped pants and the peach white hat that you can see below it was a great day all of the models were endometriosis sufferers and a lot of the attendees were as well or friends and family it 's great to have some community in what can sometimes be an isolating condition it was pretty fun hamming it up on the catwalk as well hopefully i 'll find some time soon to tell you what else i 've been up to the last few months have been quite exciting with the canberra endometriosis network !
