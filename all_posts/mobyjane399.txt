dear a b curtiss , thank you very much for your reply i'm so grateful for the insight and encouragement you continue to provide if i understand you well , staying on medication for now will not have any effect on the neuroplasticity of the brain , so new thought patterns and positive neuro path ways can still develop with or without medication is that correct ? if that is the case , i will wait until i feel more confident about my ability to get out of depression as i'm paying increasing attention to every thought i have , i am now noticing how for so long i have been engaged in negative thoughts even when not depressed and how it has become so dominant no wonder i 've crumbled to such debilitating depression periodically thank you very much for your encouragements it touches me deeply as i struggle in the course of going in the right direction i pray that the 'someday' will come very soon y dear y yes , your medication cannot prevent you from changing your thinking and behavior and thus your brain
