i just heard back from google regarding the dope who plagiarized , that 's seventy , of my blog posts here 's the google team 's message , hello , thanks for reaching out to us in accordance with the digital millennium copyright act , we have completed processing your infringement notice we are in the process of disabling access to the content in question at the following urls the content will be removed shortly regards , the google team that was certainly good news to receive , but it came with a caveat the process of reporting plagiarism to google requires the complainant to fill out a form with the specific url of the original content followed by the specific url of the copied content i sent them sets of urls and explained that those were just of the posts which were plagiarized i asked that they disable the plagiarist 's entire site based on those examples , as google states they will disable entire accounts of repeat offenders unfortunately , based on their e mail , it appears google is only going to disable access to the urls which i provided therefore , it appears i will have to copy and paste all original urls and then copy and paste all copied urls into another complaint form it is going to be a very time consuming project , and i'm not sure when i will have that kind of time ! it 's really maddening that this jerk copied of my original posts with a couple clicks of his mouse , and i 'll have to spend hours to get it erased ! it 's daunting just thinking about it but if that 's what i have to do , that 's exactly what i 'll do i 'd certainly like to get my hands on the plagiarist , though !
