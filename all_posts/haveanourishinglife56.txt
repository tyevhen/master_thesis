i know i ve written on this topic before , but i recently had an aha moment that cause me to revisit the experience when i had an eating disorder , i wasn t free i was bound to the shackles and chains of counting calories everything that passed my lips not only had to be counted but also accounted for i thought i was free i thought that i was in control my biggest fear was being out of control when it came to food and weight the irony was that i wasn t in control even when i was controlling everything little thing i ate down to a stick of gum , an ibuprofen , or even licking an envelope shut my mind was constantly preoccupied with food , exercise , how many calories does this have , how many miles will i have to run after i eat this , how many pounds will i gain if i don t i could never live in the moment i could never fully let go of the control of food in order to be present in whatever situation i found myself parties were the worst i was so afraid of the food that surrounded me i could not fully participate in conversations because i was either trying to figure out if i could manage a cookie or i was beating myself up for eating some buffalo chicken dip then for days or weeks after , i tried to exercise away all of my eating sins my big turning point in this regard was after i ran a marathon the day of the big event came and i was still counting calories after the race , my husband and i had a celebratory dinner at our favorite restaurant still , even after vigorously training for and then running a marathon , i had to tally up what i was eating i realized then and there that i had a problem it would never end if i was still obsessed with calories after i ran a freaking marathon , then i would never be able to stop i realized then and there that i was not in control my obsession with food , calories , exercise , and weight was in control of me after that day i decided to stop counting calories and stop making up for what i ate through exercise if i am to exercise , then i will do it because it feels good and makes me feel good after not because i need to in order to negate the food i consumed because i had been counting calories for about years , the practice was a deep rooted bad habit its roots had spread over my whole being infiltrating every aspect of my life stopping this routine was very difficult , to say the least it s a lot harder to unlearn than to learn it s not easy to just forget how many calories are in a banana , a granola bar , or a glass of milk containers , boxes , and labels don t help the situation either but since i realized that i had a problem , i had to be committed to giving it up so , i don t look at nutrition labels anymore if i try to tally up calories in my head , i literally make noise , la la la la la , until it passes or until i m distracted by something else the critical moment comes when i try to count how much i ve had to eat in one day i ve been known to hold my head with my eyes tightly squeezed shut saying no no no no no i have to remind myself that i don t want to be controlled by this evil eating disorder anymore i have to remind myself that i want to live life i don t want to be on my death bed counting the calories in my ensure shake or the liquid in my iv so , with a lot of grace from god and continual practice i can say that i no longer count calories most days i don t even remember what i ate anymore , and for me , that s a huge turn around it took about a year to get the information out of my brain occasionally , calories will pop in my head but i dismiss them and move on the other day , i was at my parent s house and almost everyone was home which is a big deal nowadays of course there was plenty of food around only a few years ago , this would have caused me so much anguish , so much anxiety but , during our gathering , i didn t think anything of it i actually didn t even eat any of the snacks because i was full from a delicious dinner earlier that evening and i never thought twice about it well , until the next day when i marveled at how different the experience was for me compared to what it would have been in the past it was an aha moment when i realized later how great it was i laughed , i was fully present in conversation and company , i was relaxed , and , most of all , i thoroughly enjoyed myself had i not changed , had i not given up the control , i would have been miserable i would have been distraught from being surrounded by food i probably would have been hungry because i was afraid to eat or i would have been mentally defeated because i did eat i would not have been able to enjoy myself because i was a slave to my eating disorder i am still working on keeping a positive body image i can t say that i don t still struggle with low self worth but i have to remind myself that i don t want to go back to the way i was , being controlled by the eating disorder when i am tempted to start controlling what i eat i have to remind myself that i would not be in control , but i could be controlled by an evil that i no longer have room for in my life i also have to remind myself how awesome it is not to be obsessed with food and what i did or didn t eat i eat when i m hungry , i eat what i am hungry for , and i don t eat if i m not hungry in the past , when the eating disorder was ruling my life , i thought that i if i didn t control my food , then i would be out of control , like an animal , and not able to stop eating but it s not like that at all i guess the point of this post is to let you know that it is wonderful on the other side ! i rarely use exclamation marks an all caps in my posts , so this sentence should stick out i have a much better relationship with food now that i ve stopped trying to control it i m not saying it s perfect it never will be but , it s a heck of a lot better now if you are teetering on the fence , make the leap of faith it s worth it ! if you are struggling with
