in the paper recently is a story about a female astronaut driving one thousand miles to do away with a perceived rival for the affections of another astronaut all of her amazing education and brilliance could not stop her from doing something absolutely crazy she could not think out this problem and decide on a different course of action she was compelled to follow her deep feelings of past rejection into oblivion could there be a better example of rationality living side by side with irrationality in the brain ? in cerebral terms , it is deep feelings of rejection in the right hemisphere and in the forward top brain the orbito frontal area that sends the message over to the left prefrontal brain and says , stop the rejection by any means possible ! she could not do it as a child helpless before parental neglect and indifference , but now she can do something about it but ay any ay , what she did was nuts so the left advanced brain tried to find symbolic solutions to an old imprinted problem that had only one solution love by the parent at that time and no other so here we have the perennial dilemma the left prefrontal brain always tries to find current solutions to old historical problems and it therefore always fails this seeker gives up everything in exchange for the hope of receiving what was deprived her long ago she becomes an extension of the leader 's will she and the other disciples will kill others or themselves at the leader s behest , turn over their money to him , live by capricious rules he makes , think thoughts he inserts in their minds , eat what and when he allows them to they act like devoted children , and his authoritarian bearing reinforces that childishness women will even give over their bodies to the leader , and their mates will allow it because they have learned obedience to authority that obedience is one of the most dangerous facets of human life all manner of crimes exist in its wake fascist dictators can easily get thugs to do their murderous bidding because those thugs are loyal and obedient to the leader those in war can kill because it is their job they usually don t kill out of anger it is a job like any other , devoid of passion in need of order in a world of chaos , hope and magic instead of confusion and pain , they swallow the ideology the leader dispenses hook , line and sinker in the case of our homegrown cult leaders , women will even submit to the leader 's sexual whims , will leave their husbands , and abandon children in order to please him in the case of one cult leader , the wives mates bunked in a dormitory downstairs while they slept with the guru parents went along with their leader 's penchant for their pubescent daughters but the leader has to have the answer ! and he must exert his ideas with certainty and force beliefs are medicine for the hopeless they attenuate despair , vitiate parental substitute he gives love and can take it away from those who are not obedient for those who were rejected by family , to be again rejected and thrown out by the new family is intolerable some prefer death to this pain loneliness and dissipate helplessness not a despair necessarily arising out of one 's present circumstances , but one that is imprinted physiologically and emotionally in the individual the despair of a baby in the crib who cries her heart out for days hoping someone will come to feed , cuddle , caress and soothe her the despair of a child who sees his mother die in an auto accident or his father leave the family for good a despair long ago forgotten by the mind but not by the body , consigned to the unconscious , covered over by layers of newly constructed hopes and best of all , the hope for a different and better life later on , it is no wonder that person becomes radicalized , looking for a better world , trying to destroy symbols of his current world , becoming a utopian who must find the perfect system or perfect place all because his early life was such hell and so hopeless we need hope more than we need truth hope feels good , but truth often hurts the truth hurts because to feel that my parents don t like me , don t want me around and they never will love me , is intolerable for a youngster if the bible is your bag , you can be born again the medicine of hope dispels the misery of our pre born again life hope 's assurances shield our ears from the child screaming below the surface of consciousness she is screaming yet even she cannot hear it until , we take her back to her childhood and help her cry and scream , at last now she knows what has driven her
