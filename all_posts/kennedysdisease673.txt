use your fear it can take you to a place where you store your courage amelia earhart when i read this quote from ms earhart , i knew i needed to write something about my experiences conquering your fears is something easier said than done yet , there are times when you have to suck it up a simple and useful definition of fear is an anxious feeling , caused by our anticipation of some imagined event or experience karl albrecht , ph d explains that fear , like all other emotions , is information needing processing it offers us knowledge and understanding if we choose to accept it of our psychobiological status according to albrecht , there are five basic forms of fear fear of death fear of mutilation or invasion of your body fear of being paralyzed , restricted , imprisoned by something beyond our control fear of loss , abandonment or rejection fear of humiliation , shame and disapproval three experiences in my life relate to the anticipation or dread of an imagined event or outcome my first firefight in vietnam no matter how much training , nothing prepares you for the first time bullets fly your way it doesn t take long before realizing that they , the vietcong , are trying to kill you fortunately , all that training does pay off when the adrenaline kicks in , you stop thinking , and begin acting i would describe it as going on autopilot it s what , along with a lot of luck , kept me alive when doctors diagnosed my two year old with a malignant brain tumor , total helplessness are the first words that come to mind the fear of losing your child is all consuming yes , you pray a lot , but the worst part is the waiting and wondering i was a wreck during the surgery when the nurse carried him out , i couldn t breathe but , when he saw me and smiled , i melted everything was going to be okay when diagnosed with als , it was crushing news you ve got to be kidding not me i feel fine several years later when correctly diagnosed with sbma kenney s disease , i felt relieved courage means to find strength in the face of pain or grief it is the ability to do something that is frightening in vietnam , as unbelievable as it sounded at the time , it was kill or be killed as a father , i needed to be strong for my son when diagnosed , it meant finding solid ground again after falling into quicksand in each case , there were no viable alternatives i needed to dig deep , deeper than i ever had before , to sail through these uncharted waters there was no way out and giving up wasn t an option
