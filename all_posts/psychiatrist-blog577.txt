before i start , two things if you 'd like to hear our interview with dan rodricks on wypr today , go here if you 've ever been forcibly certified to a psychiatric unit and you have n't taken our poll yet , please do so here and now for our next post over on the new york times opinionator , daniel smith has an article called it 's still the age of anxiety or is it ? smith talks about w h auden 's pulitzer prize winning poem , the age of anxiety , it 's boring , he tells us , as well as 'illusive , allegorical and at times surreal' and he tells us about his own anxiety smith writes , from a sufferer s perspective , anxiety is always and absolutely personal it is an experience a coloration in the way one thinks , feels and acts it is a petty monster able to work such humdrum tricks as paralyzing you over your salad , convincing you that a choice between blue cheese and vinaigrette is as dire as that between life and death when you are on intimate terms with something so monumentally subjective , it is hard to think in terms of epochs and yet it is undeniable that ours is an age in which an enormous and growing number of people suffer from anxiety according to the national institute of mental health , anxiety disorders now affect percent of the adult population of the united states , or about million people by comparison , mood disorders depression and bipolar illness , primarily affect percent that makes anxiety the most common psychiatric complaint by a wide margin , and one for which we are increasingly well medicated last spring , the drug research firm ims health released its annual report on pharmaceutical use in the united states the anti anxiety drug alprazolam better known by its brand name , xanax was the top psychiatric drug on the list , clocking in at million prescriptions in just because our anxiety is heavily diagnosed and medicated , however , doesn t mean that we are more anxious than our forebears it might simply mean that we are better treated that we are , as individuals and a culture , more cognizant of the mind s tendency to spin out of control smith concludes that it 's not the world we live in , and that it 's perhaps dangerous to make that assumption he notes , if you start to believe that anxiety is a foregone conclusion if you start to believe the hype about the times we live in then you risk surrendering the battle before it s begun what do you think ? are we more anxious than we used to be ? and why is that ? is it the world we live in now or in ? or is it just our own personal psyches ? note , the graphic above is from a book by andrea tome
