well my friends , it is not what you did but who you stood next to you mean i could get neurotic just standing next to my father or mother ? yes , yes but allow me to explain people exude who they are from every pore of their being i mean that literally an uptight , tense mother radiates her repression an angry father radiates his anger they do n't have to do anything just be but it is worse than that when their underlying feelings show themselves we sensed we were right to avoid them or be very careful around them they distort our words , detour our natural movements and disapprove almost everything we do , not by words but by those looks and worse , when they show no emotion , a child next door almost drowning , we know that feelings are what we keep to ourselves the point is that even before we have words a child is undergoing a lifetime of experience and the earlier the more impactful it should be obvious those early experiences that directly affect breathing , digestion and elimination are going to do a lot of damage and will last a lifetime secondly , those experiences that lie on the feeling level will certainly inhibit later access to our feelings but now look at this our genes form the matrix of later life that much we agree on but there are epigenes , severe experiences that build a new genetic base called epigenetics and they get imprinted and compounded , change or distort the evolution of our genes they then become inherited we too often distort this with our genetic heritage , but those experiences are long duration and largely impervious to later events they become a meld of genes and epigenes instead of saying , she looks and acts just like her mother , we need to say , her mother was infected with neurosis , which got imprinted into the system of the offspring and now she is just as hyperactive and add as her distracted and hyperactive mother in other words the infant who is being carried has caught what could be a fatal disease neurosis , the same one lying inside the mother the baby will reflect the internal life of the mother and that is what will be imprinted inside him and last a lifetime why ? because this is what had been learned in order to adapt and adjust no words , no reprimands , no social neglect just who she is , does it all look at the work of the association for psychological science feb see http www psychologicalscience org index php news releases for infants stress may be caught not taught html they discuss emotional synchrony the baby is learning how to manage the incoming stress of the mother they did studies of several different mothers who gave a talk with a different audience one approving , one neutral and one not approving guess what ? the month old babies reflected what happened differences in heart rate and a greater stress response in those children of mothers who had disapproval the children learned through some kind of osmosis the were inculcated by the mother s emotional state now imagine that the baby and mother are one , where the baby lives inside the mother the influences are far more impactful you see , you do not need to yell at the child all you need to do as a mother , is be around the child and the damage can be done picked up early that my parents were emotionally removed so i never even thought to tell them that a wave hit me and i almost drowned but someone saved me those vibes get picked up very early in our lives so what gets transmitted ? odor , facial expression lack of feeling , body movements and on and on all of the parent is transmitted to the child and the child never says to himself , i guess that s the way it is , cause that is the way it is too often we are completely unconscious of it all we live as we always have in a state without acknowledgment of that is just the way it is all this to say that our early environment weighs heavily on this and can drive our behavior in an article by the cold spring harbor laboratory , they found that unique experiences in the womb may give a more profound effect on epigenetic factors that influence health later on and though fraternal twins share a womb there is also the difference in the structures of the umbilical cord and placenta which play an important role they found that even in identical twins there can be great differences in the methylation patterns between them see a preview of a scientific american article on this topic http www scientificamerican com article what makes each brain unique so you say to yourself , did i inherit my mother s craziness ? and the answer could be , yes but not in the usual sense of inheritance rather , who she was , hyperactive or depressed and down while carrying , left you with a neurotic inheritance which still shaped your life so is it life long ? i believe we can reverse some of it in our therapy and we shall test it soon , but i also believe that the earlier and stronger the imprint the less likely it can be reversed the best we can do is love and hold the child right after birth and thereafter the best way to reverse the imprint is through the slow , methodical process of therapy where the least pains can be integrated first finally descending to the great early traumas and the measuring the results in other words , we need to trust nature and all its processes chemical reversal is far too general and non specific to each trauma it is a shotgun when we need a scoped rifle we need nature as a reference it is when we leave nature behind that need the reference of statistics never as good as nature itself all those childhood studies that think it is early childhood that is to blame , which it is , in a sense , need to convert their work to earlier times if they want to be accurate
