i'm doing well at my new job i'm getting used to the documentation requirements and the layout of the different buildings my patients , of course , are wonderful primarily i work in little towns surrounding my city they are all farming communities , so most of my patients are farmers they 're used to working hard and are generally willing to do what i suggest i'm working with some lovely women with wonderful personalities right now it 's fun my coworkers have also been great so far maybe physical and occupational therapists are just cool people ! it 's always nice when i enjoy the people with whom i work i 've worked three , four hour days the past two weeks it does n't sound like much , but it 's worn me out , nonetheless i hope and expect that will get better soon next week i'm bumping up to three , six hour days as a new employee , i 've had to fill out tons of paperwork that 's typical , so i was prepared for it however , one of the forms i had to fill out led to this post the questionnaire asked , point blank , if i had a disability i could answer yes , no , or prefer not to answer the question stopped me in my tracks on the one hand , i do have a disability on the other hand , disability questions typically refer to something other than mental illness i was uncomfortable with the question i do n't feel comfortable revealing my mental illness unless it gets in the way of my job duties if i do n't have a relapse , my illness does n't get in the way so should i say yes or no ? what would you say ? i ended up picking , prefer not to answer , as my option i felt like i 'd be lying if i said no but i did n't want the probing follow up questions a yes answer would likely have initiated and really , i'm not sure it 's any of their business unless i ca n't perform my duties but then again , maybe telling them up front would make things easier if i do need accommodations down the road i just do n't know and does n't preferring not to answer say something , too ? like i 've got something to hide i 'd be interested to hear what many of you think have any of you had to answer this question ? what did you say ? and if you have n't had to answer it , how do you think you would ? why ? i did n't necessarily like my answer , but it was the best choice , i thought , of the three options i had so that 's what i picked how about you ?
