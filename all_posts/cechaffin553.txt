good morning in writing about my mood fluctuations , i do not for a minute consider my experience unique and i do n't write primarily for therapy or renown i think , given my training and literary bent , that perhaps , as in poetry , i may be able to capture something in words that other sufferers may lack words for one function of poetry is to say for others what they wish they had words for yesterday i was tearful most of the day if i began to speak to kathleen about how i was feeling , tears would start i did my best to halt them , as in my experience , as a manic depressive , when tearfulness turns into crying jags you 're worse off than before but yesterday was different as i said , i'm at kilorats for those new to this blog , that 's a measure of depression it 's explained in a previous post yet my tearfulness was not from despair it was not the chemical hopelessness depressives know i was still human i was grieving about my past i had objects to be sad about , history , and my life stretched back like a dark road between blasted trees narrowing to a sky pregnant with black bottomed clouds so my life appeared but i was not in despair i was grieving regrets , i 've had a few grieving feels so much better than the black hole of despair , where tears are pointless because they are disconnected from any objects to put it simply , i was feeling sad more than depressed , a distinction many bipolars have trouble making , since our sadness is too often a gate to despair i wrote yesterday about how coming out of a depression is like being born , like having a new personality , indeed being a new person at first it 's a bit frightening and you try to re acquaint yourself with the simplest things in order to get your bearings below , a poem from the second half of sine wave about coming out of a depression after electroconvulsive therapy , where the simple thing is my moustache ect that s me in the corner , losing my religion rem each day for years i sacrificed my heart to god my smile got so tight i had to eat through a straw every sin in my head brought the same familiar sirens until i recognized myself in the silver lenses of a policeman who looked like me it was then i knew all the wanted posters of jesus were meant for me i peeled them off like a bad paint job underneath was a darkness more terrible than a starless , starless sky , the pupil of a salmon s eye staring through display glass , black as hell after the electrodes and the gel and two weeks at hospital hotel it was enough to finger my own face was that my moustache ? will anyone recognize me on the street ? prepare a face to meet the faces you will meet
