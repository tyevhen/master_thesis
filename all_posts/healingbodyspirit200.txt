chronic fatigue is not death , but it takes your life away my journey from chronic fatigue began years ago when i was diagnosed with cfids and fibromyalgia i was so ill my doctor wanted to give me medical disability after four years of agony i said to my doctor , i either want to get better or i want to die i was n't suicidal , i just did n't have the energy to live since then , i have recovered even though the center for disease control says there is no cure i drastically changed my diet from the typical sad standard american diet to an alkaline diet it includes lots green vegetables , finished a degree in holistic nutrition and have more energy than i did years ago my passion now is to educate others and give them hope for recovery my doctoral dissertation explored the results of an alkaline diet on patients who had significant disability and pain from cfids fms after they were on the diet for a period of three months or more , all of them experienced significant improvement in their symptoms and were able to resume normal activities they had outstanding improvment in decreased muscle and joint pain a hundred percent of partcipants had improvment in out of symptoms according to several doctors , and dr robert young , yeast candida , fungus and mold , are major players in chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia ph is also a very significant factor in these diseases the more alkaline your blood and tissues , the less pain you will have an article in the journal of medical hypothesis proposed that glutathione , an antioxidant essential for lymphocyte function , may be depleted in cfids patients glutathione is needed for both the immune system and for aerobic muscular contraction depletion of the supplement could cause the muscular fatigue and myalgia associated with cfids fms scroll down to older post on chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia
