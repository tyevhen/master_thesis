i have discussed the importance of evolution in primal therapy now i want to address revolution , the overturning of the basic structure of psychotherapy as it has been for about one hundred years it is my belief that profound change cannot take please within a reformist attitude , making the system work better the problem is the system just take the minute hour it is based on the comfort and profit of the therapist , not the healing of the patient our patients stay as long as necessary no time constraints or take the fine furniture and well appointed drapes it is designed to not getting at the deep unconscious our patients are in a therapy room with mattresses , relatively sound proof and somewhat darkened all to encourage the descent into the unconscious you cannot get there in a well lighted therapy room with a sit up chair , ashtray and fine paintings on the wall early on , i tried that with primal and soon i had holes in the walls and broken furniture i learned the theory and the therapy have to be revolutionary and not egocentric in cognitive insight therapy the doctor is the last word he she knows more than the patient and they even know what is in the patient s deep unconscious which is nonsense , but we all hope there is some godlike human out there who really knows us and will direct us properly , like a good daddy the theory has to put the patient first and foremost she knows best and she knows when to come for a session and when not to she knows when she has had enough therapy , period no one has to tell her that she needs three times a week therapy when that is a profit decision not usually a therapeutic one and no one has to tell her that her time is up for the day can you imagine a patient crying deeply and then ushered out of the room ? what magic is there in coming twice a week instead of three times ? remember in every domain including the political , reform will never get us there we can tinker and tweak all day long and still be dealing with a flawed system that turns out bad techniques and faulty logic just like in neurosis where almost every bit of behavior is neurosis generated so we go on changing behavior and change not at all the basic problem yes , overthrow by force and violence is disturbing and unsettling but necessary , and neurosis will not yield its arms easily after all , it is there to protect us and keep us from feeling but we are feeling human beings and need our feelings to guide us we do not appeal to the patient s good sense to help us overthrow the neurotic structure we appeal to her feelings to her unconscious , to the subtext to surplant that devilish prefrontal neocortex that is the revolution feelings over thoughts and beliefs insights will never get us well they just help us rationalize how we behave our problem is not the lack of insights it is the lack of feelings a therapy of feelings will humanize us what more could we ask for ?
