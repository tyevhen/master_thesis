i was a bit melancholy today , maybe at kilorat or a little more of depression there has been a push in psychiatry of late to determine the success of treating depression by complete remission , not merely improvement i am not in remission depression always hits me like a ton of bricks i wake up one day and the world has gone black and white and my core has been removed luckily , for years i 've been warned by depressive dreams to increase or augment my medication a number of times this time i ca n't remember a warning , and i 've been struggling for over three months although for me the onset of depression seems instantaneous , coming out of it can be very gradual for those who have not experienced it , being depressed is like a being hollowed out afterwards nothing remains between the dead walls of the log that encircle what never was with treatment , the log has to imagine it 's being filled with wood again but that wood now has a ghostly quality , because bipolars and serious unipolars , though they regain their lives , can never forget how their lives were so easily snatched from them life never has the same solidity again which makes one 's personality feel very much like a construct even when one 's mood returns to normal a bad depression is a death and a birth , for example , as i improve i'm trying to get to know my wife again and why i love her so much what it feels like to love her instead of acting intellectually as if i did that 's how i survive depressions , by the way , having to construct something to hope upon pretending pretending in my chemical despair until my neurotransmitters recalibrate and life becomes real again i write this today because it 's rarely talked about there 's much more to say about it , but i'm done for now thine in kilorats or kilobunnies , c e chaffin
