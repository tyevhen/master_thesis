do you have an addiction or way of doing something that harms yourself rather than helping you heal ? you may not know other ways to cope in life , or you may have been shown other ways to cope but do n't know if you can walk through the process of healing i know i was this way during my times of depression and deep down struggles for years in my life , i used cutting on myself to numb my pain , but you may use something else like alcohol , sex , anorexia , bulimia , overeating , drugs , violence , pornography , etc to numb your pain all these are self harmful behaviors that we need healing from it is hard , and we do n't always want to be healed or escape from our prison that is why i have included this entry from my journal in in which i pondered these thoughts of healing and the resistance in my mind maybe you can relate oh , to be free april journal entry re am i willing to commit to strive toward healing of my addiction to self harmful behavior ? feeling of resistance that arise when i imagine myself completely free and healed from my self harm behavior i ca n't do it i do n't want to be healed i will always want to hurt myself there is too much pain to sit with when i do n't hurt myself it is hard to imagine not wanting to hurt myself i am angry that things do not go the way i want , and i need a way to express that i resent that god did not let me have what i wanted the man i loved , the future life and career that i wanted , etc i will be sad to lose my known way of coping with pain self harm it feels like i need a time to grieve the loss of something which has brought me comfort in unbearable times i do not want to have to feel uncomfortable , to have to feel hurt , anger , incompetence , sadness , loneliness , helplessness , hopelessness , rejection , etc i do not want to let go of the feeling of control , of focused attention , of forgetting , of getting what i deserve , of a high through the pain what might be stopping me from being healed of my addiction to self harm harming myself is familiar having a problem gives me a reason to seek help with this life that i do n't know how to handle when people are concerned about my wellbeing it makes me feel cared for if i am well , people wo n't have a reason to love me i like feeling different from everyone else i like having the physical scars to show the pain i 've been through to get me to where i am today and to make me who i am now i like having a side to me that most people do n't know about i like feeling like i am one breath or step away from leaving this life and being with jesus and knowing complete love and acceptance i like having a way of understanding and sharing the struggles hang ups of others and relating on a deeper level am i committed to healing ? i think i am ready to be healed of self harmful behavior i am at least ready to try it for a while and see how i handle life to be honest , i have lots of doubts and i would like to keep the option of self harm in my back pocket as a back up the people that are closest to me are supportive , though i do n't let most of them know when i am struggling or when i do cut on the one hand , the approval of those closest to me is important , which is why i hide my self harm on the other hand , i do n't care if they approve of what i do or not do as long as i feel that i am being true to myself and my feelings i feel that my loved ones can not possible understand what i do and why i do it it feels like they look down on me , and so i do n't feel supported i have never really talked with my loved ones and asked them for their support , and i do n't know if i want to i would feel , and do feel , condemned by them , whether perceived or otherwise i do n't think i am trying to change my loved ones in any way , though i would like it if they would be more understanding of my struggles and also willing to admit to and share their own struggles with me i am waiting for them to change for me before i am willing to change for them and for myself after looking back over my healing process , i am writing today in august , the following section about how healing from self harm applied to me can i put off the resistance , push through the barriers , and be committed to healing for my own sake ? that is the question it is not easy i need help it is here thank you jesus i will try you will hold my hand it may take time i will be free cindy
