hello everyone ! we are almost at the end of august and this means it 's the end of a few things for one thing , the way the weather has been going lately in my part of the world , it looks like summer will be ending a little earlier than usual this year the nights are already quite a bit cooler , which is great for sleeping ! unfortunately , even though i sleep better , i am still tired i do n't understand it another thing that is ending sorta is my working part time as of september , my hours will be slowly increasing so that by winter i will be working full time i am of two minds reegarding this on one hand , i ca n't help but see this as a good thing as i will have more time to do my work i have honestly been feeling a little overwhelmed but the quantity of work that i have been doing you see i am trying to fit in a full day of work in half the time and sometimes , that is a little bit much for me also , since i have trouble focussing and staying on track , i have to do my work a little slower , well a lot slower on some days so having more time to do my work has to be a good thing on the other hand , i am still tired and still get some really bad days like yesterday for example i do n't know how being at work for longer periods of time will affect me will i be able to take care of my home , i barely can do it now the thing is this part time gig is all about my depression , which has gotten better and none of it is about my fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome , which seems to have gotten worst over the last couple of months so bases soley on my depression , i am quite ready to take on more work for sure my therapies have also come to a close they have not been as helpful as i was hoping i have been participating full on but i think my depression has more to do than my thought patterns , they are situational too the meds i have been taking , especially since the last increase have been helping the depression more than the therapies i can honetly say , mood wise , that i am now having more good days then bad the last tie my mood went really bad was when one of our foster kitties passed away from feline infectious peritonitis fips about a month ago i still very much miss him you might also like purging exercising for mood and health working part time and still exhausted linkwithin
