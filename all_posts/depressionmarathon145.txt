i am a lucky woman i believe i have the best treatment team around when my depression sucks me under , my team of expert providers and a few incredible friends keep me afloat until i once again can swim they are incredible at what they do i count on and trust each of them one of those experts is my social worker , sm she and i were connected more than years ago since that time , she 's been a crucial cog in the wheel she 's helped me connect with other providers , navigate the non user friendly social security disability system , find unknown resources , listened , advised , and listened some more i do n't know what i would do without her unfortunately , i'm going to find out exactly what i'm going to do without her my social worker is leaving she told me a few days ago she 's taking another job my heart sank did i mention i hate change ? initially i panicked then i got really sad then i panicked then i got really sad , again this was big , big unwelcome news and this will be a huge unwelcome change i do n't like change i like my pleasantly boring , stable life i feel safe with my current treatment team i knew someday this would happen but i always figured i would be the one leaving , you know , like after i got better and did n't need the help ? my social worker leaving just was n't in my plans thankfully , sm knows me so well she gave me a month to digest the news , but as of early june , she will be done we talked for two hours on wednesday , our last meeting together we decided to close my case rather than sm assigning me a new social worker i do n't have the energy to get to know a new person i'm not a fan of letting just anyone into the nitty gritty details of my life , and i'm even less enthusiastic about feeling vulnerable with someone i barely know so i'm going forward with one less team member it will be okay that 's what everyone , friends and professionals , have said i will be okay of course i will i 'll get through this , but that does n't mean i have to like it in fact , i do n't like it selfishly , i wish sm was n't going anywhere i 'll miss her kindness , professionalism , work ethic , compassion , and expertise she has been an amazing social worker but an even more incredible human being thank you , sm i 'll miss you
