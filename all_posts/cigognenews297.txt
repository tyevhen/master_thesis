there is a gating system in the brain that inhibits or slows the message of feeling when it is too much to bear when the amygdala s gating mechanism against rising feeling fails , there is a more direct impact on the frontal cortex causing it to be activated , to race , to manufacture ideas , beliefs , and in general , to do what it can to attenuate the onrush if the hippocampus is overtaxed with many painful memories , then it may be helpless to inform the hypothalamus to soften the amygdala s output of feelings the amygdala has direct connections to the frontal cortex so that feelings can also directly affect our thought processes and of course , it has direct connections to deeper levels of brain function when gating mechanisms fail , feelings that are rooted in lower levels of the brain , such as terror , can escape control and rise to the pre frontal cortex to signal danger the pre frontal cortex may label this an anxiety attack , and the individual is then aware of great discomfort a cognitive psychologist might try to deal with that anxiety as if it were a cortex only phenomenon , and attempt to control it through ideas , thoughts , logic , etc look here , you are overreacting there is no reason to be so excited yet reactions are nearly always correct they tell us what s really happening on lower levels of the brain , even though the original context of how they were imprinted may be unrecognizable we shouldn t deny or change reactions , but rather find their origins so that the reactions make sense without access to our feelings , we would be forced to conclude that some current behavior is irrational because we are unaware of its antecedents as for example , phobias driving our behavior , our own feelings , can be a danger to us because they are too much for the higher levels of the brain to accept and integrate the brain has a warning system that alerts us against potential overload more feelings than can be experienced and integrated it says gear up for the onslaught of pain , and the system obeys but if the inhibitory gating system is leaky , it allows too much pain to get through as this overload of pain hopelessness begins its march to the cortex , alarm bells are set off cortisol is one of these alarm chemicals the alarm is general , however , and many systems are affected the brain s own hippocampus can be damaged by too much cortisol secretion over too long a time , resulting in a weakened memory it is not surprising that those of us who were anxious throughout childhood barely remember anything eva hardly remembered anything of her childhood it was all a black hole she did tell us in the intake interview that , vague though it was , she believed she had a fairly happy childhood it wasn t exactly the case as she found out in therapy a good example of overload is in a recent case this is a forty year old woman who at the age of nine was taking a bath with an electrical heater sitting beside the tub she reached over to move the heater and received a massive shock she became immediately unconscious , but the violence of her flopping seizures tore the heater plug out of the wall and saved her life she went downstairs to tell her mother who was ironing her mother said , oh , that s too bad but you seem okay now she went on with her ironing the meaning to her daughter at the moment , which summed up many moments before , was , she doesn t care there s no help for me she really doesn t love me for the past several months she has been reliving that shock , flopping , seizing as violently as when it happened this has been filmed she had no idea that shock was still in there it was pure electrical energy with no content , yet it shut her down totally she had a rigid , immobile facial set that did not ease nor loosen until months of reliving the shock her whole body froze at the time of the shock , and even today making easy , fluid movements is difficult for her her whole system seems to have contracted permanently a total overload her primals as we call them , are both of the seizures and then she doesn t care there is no help there s no place to turn that realization was tremendous pain because it was an augury of her coming life she almost died her mother hardly reacted the most important thing she is getting out of these primals is that she was never able to express herself everything was locked inside she seemed dead now , finally , as she expresses the shock , she can also express herself emotionally her face has expression , whereas before it was expressionless and immobile she has had constant fears of dying , and it hasn t just been an idea it was a real experience her nightmares were filled with danger where she was on the verge of dying i have seen many patients who had those fears and it was not like something in the future it was immediate i am going to die now ! if she never relived the shock , we would have never known of her actual near death experience in cognitive therapy , her fears may have been treated as irrational ideas the electrical shock in the bathtub is no different from an overload by a feeling , it is all hopeless no one will ever love me that too , is electrical but it has content the shock did not that is what made it so devilish to discover there was no specific scene to rely on it was a neutral experience pure electricity , which allowed us to see the overload clearly and how it operates this overload , although having nothing to do with sex , can and did stunt sexual expression , as well and any early trauma can accomplish the same thing
