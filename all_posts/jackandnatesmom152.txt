i wrote earlier this week , on monday to be exact , about my mother turning my boys' grant applications in for me so that i did n't have to miss work i am here to tell you that for once , when i did something right , i got results and fast i got letters in the mail today for both jack and nate , and they both received full funding what does this mean ? in nate 's case it means that sending him to cisco center will be much less of a financial strain for us for awhile i can feel better than good about sending him he loves it and it 's financially feasible for jack , it means that he is going to be able to start one on one , special needs swim lessons ! ! ! and he will get to continue them for most of the year this is a wonderful day for our family so often the hurdles autism families face seem insurmountable we jump through so many hoops , and at the end of the obstacle course we see messages like warning , these services may not be covered for a diagnosis of autism it feels pretty damn good to do the work and achieve the desired outcome go our family ! ! !
