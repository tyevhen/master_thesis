it s been a while since my last post my new flat is lovely but i still haven t got internet access i really miss blogging and on bad days i cry because i need the thearapeutic benefit of my blog they are days like today i am staying in a hotel in spain at the moment as i have been attending a conference for the last few days i was worrying about the conference for months in advance not about the technical work or the contributions i would have to make but the social aspect and the networking i have a lovely colleague who i would be proud to call a friend and he has been great , i ll call him f but , he is quite a senior person and i was unsure how much i should stay around him silly really but looking back a little more logically and after me experiance today i think he would have been happy to have me around maybe not dressed as a clown though there s so much i want to say about the last few days i just don t know where to start so i will start at the beginning but it will have to be a quick summary because i have to go and get some food from somewhere thursday night after work i started to pack to come to spain packing was difficult as i had to wear business clothes , however i feel very uncomfortable in anything other than jeans i bought some summer dresses with a friend a few weeks ago purposely for this trip i had a panic the evening i packed as i had no idea what to expect or how to behave etc anyway i did the packing , carefully timed my medication pefectly so i would fall asleep at the correct time as not to leave room for those automatic negative thoughts to creep in , and i got a good nights sleep i had a good trip out to spain , i even relaxed a little on the plane when i arrived i got lost in the airport and got through customs without collecting my baggage i coped though ! i asked at three different information desks and went back through security found my bag and a taxi all on my own ! and i made it to the hotel i was really pleased with myself ! friday afternoon was nice and relaxing , i walked about miles along the coast into the city , i walked around the city and even ate out on my own ! a proper restaurant and not mc donalds too i had my purse stollen and caught the theif but that is a story for another time ! saturday the conference started , i attended all the sessions but i was quite lonely and could not find any of my colleagues i only knew one or two of the other attendees out of about from my company one i could not find and the other would not have a conversation with me i asked him if anything had been planned for dinner two evenings in a row and he brushed me off the first time i met him i fancied him but that was over a year ago now and to be honest as soon as i realised he was married the feelings went instantly ! and , to be honest he does not involve me with anything which makes my job really hard , he does not listen to my advice even though i have shared responsibilities with him he was getting very close to rude i must have been dressed like a clown , it was colder than i had expected so i did not have any clothes i felt comfortable in o that was my biggest problem my supervisor had told me before i left that i must wear business clothes and not to wear jeans , i listened to him and that turned out to be a huge mistake i was cold , uncomfortable , badly dressed and that drained all my confidence i must learn and remember that comfort is far more important than appearance , even at business meetings the thing is when i was dressed like a clown the business meetings i had were not about my appearance they were about the science i work with intelligent people and i must always remember the people worth knowing will not judge on appearance i usually work with a bunch of middle aged men so i had no one to look to for judging appearance and what to wear yesterday b arrived i have been working with her by phone for a wile but never met here face to face she was so nice and open and straight forward also not much older than me she was confident , dressed nicely and really open and friendly once she had arrived i felt like there was someone i could relate to yesterday evening i went out and bought myself a new pair of jeans i wore them today and felt a whole lot better i had such a nice afternoon , i felt confident , joined in more conversations and felt relaxed on the way to lunch with b and f today we discussed clothes for a bit dress codes etc f was talking about some of the women in his office and how their clothes were borderline i was saying how i wear jeans with holes in most days and how i had nothing to wear because i was told not to wear jeans f said how jeans were more elegant on some women than skirts etc the conversation was changed soon after but i think he may have been refering to me i am trying to view this logically and clinging to the fact that if he was refering to me he was decent and kind enough to be subtle and i will never know if i was over sensitive because i d felt so uncomfortable and disapointed with myself or whether my instincts can be trusted on this ocassion clothes are so important to confidence right now i don t think i will ever wear a dress or skirt again i made a mistake with my clothes this week and i feel dreadful when i did not feel comfortable i avoided contact with people as much as i could , i slouched around alone and felt awfully unhappy i went back to my hotel room this evening and had a really good cry i m staying on the th floor and for a moment i leaned over the balcony and thought about it for a few seconds ending the fight to feel accepted and fit in thinking about the shock and greif people would feel kind of makes me feel accepted but i do not want to die , i want to feel accepted in my life time i still feel that there is no one i can turn to and talk to my mother and sister were calling two or three times a day last week to see if i had packed and asking if i was excited i was actually dreading it and really worried about these social things i feel like my worse fears were realised ! i was thinking today about moving away to a different country and leaving all my problems behind me a part of me still blames my mum and sister for my depression and social anxiety i so wish i could have a person i can relax with and who would guide me and help me on social issues as i get older i believe more and more that no one can help me with my problems and i have to find my own way i so want to feel accepted and loved though that is my one target in life and the one i will pursue until the day i die if i run out of strength for the fight i ll just die sooner i think i throw myself into my work as i am starting to realise that i am good at what i do and f appreciates my help and input i m not completely sure of him though and at the moment i am worrying how much dressing like a clown will have changed his opinion of me he is so important to me , not in an inapproropriate way , but he is a mentor and the person i feel knows me best although we only talk about work most of the time i feel happiest when i am working as it does not leave space for negative thoughts in my mind it allows me to be myself , people i work in depth with usually like me i d like to tell f about my problems and history to explain my weird behavior and let him know how much i appreciate his help and support and how important his friendship is to me the problem is the smallest of disclosures shocks people i let it slip the other night over dinner that i was extremely shy and never spoke to my teachers it was not f but two other people with public school educations with latin lessons who i dare say have never needed or desired anything i doubt they have ever suffered as they were so shocked about my shyness and if this is a big deal how would these people take psychotic episodes , social anxiety and bipolar disorder i will tell f if i ever feel he needs to know and i feel confident his respect for me will not be risked , i appreciate his support so much that i could never risk that on the other had i have told two people who i work with , they have similar backgrounds to me though and their opinion of me was more respect my boss says i am the strongest person he knows and another guy does nothing but show me support i think i need to find a way to make more use of them they know me better than my family does ! i need to change something to reach my goal of acceptance i will never find that closeness i desire from a colleague especially as most of my colleagues are middle aged married men with children i do believe that you meet the love of your life when you are happy though so i must find non work activities which make me happy it would have to occupy my mind fully to block out negative thoughts usually when i feel this low i take my tablets and put a powerful movie on to keep my attention until i can no longer keep my eyes open in a hotel that is hard , the tv in my room is all in spanish and i do not want to go out after taking my tablets as i am likely to fall asleep in a public place , or worse meet a colleague while my eyes are rolling from the drugs ! i w a n n a g o h o m e ! everyone else has left and my flight is not until tomorrow afternoon , hours away !
