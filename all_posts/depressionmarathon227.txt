the worst part of returning from a journey is unpacking do n't you agree ? i just returned from vacation for the past week , my boyfriend , d , and i have been in arizona we stayed in scottsdale at a cool , retro 's hotel they even played 's music in the lobby it was pretty neat we enjoyed running , shopping , eating and hiking in warm sunshine it was really nice the picture above is of us at the top of camelback mountain camelback is about , feet high to get to the summit we climbed the mile echo trail , which at points is nearly vertical it is difficult climbing , but the workout is great and the views are spectacular ! we definitely deserved our big breakfast after we finished i did my best to keep up with my training while i was away i did my long run , miles , along a canal path through scottsdale and phoenix on saturday morning it was a gorgeous day for a long run , sunny and in the 's , and there were many others out running , too unfortunately , my right achilles tendon , which had been sore recently , got very sore over my final miles it swelled up later , and i was unable to walk without limping in fact , i 've been unable to run since saturday because of it i'm a little concerned , as i 've got a half marathon with my brother scheduled for this sunday i 've had achilles tendon issues several times in the past , so i'm familiar with the problem i'm betting my right hip is still a bit weak , causing slight alteration to my gait , which likely flared up the tendon i think it is improving , so i'm hopeful i 'll be able to race on sunday knowing me , i 'll race even if the tendon is not i'm looking forward to spending the time with my brother , and i'm anxious to see where my fitness is at currently i 'll let you know how it goes
