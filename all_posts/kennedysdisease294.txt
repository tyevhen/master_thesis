it is hard to believe that it is three months already since i started taking dutasteride time flies whether you are having fun or not i decided to breakdown this report into sections exercise in this area i have seen the most improvement my long exercise program has increased minutes minutes and i could even go longer my short exercise program has increase by minutes i have not intentionally tried to increase the length of these programs , it just came naturally as a result of the ease of performing each exercise i have added more weight or reps or both to every exercise all reps have increased by without causing any problems my muscles feel different after i exercise pumped and strong if that makes sense i do not feel fatigued afterward other observations i just realized the other day i have not had any aches or pain for at least a couple of months living with deep muscle aches became a part of my life for several years it sure it nice not having them i do not seem to have the fluctuations in weakness and energy that i was experiencing only occasionally have i had a down day for energy , but they are nothing like the lows i felt a few months ago some basic daily routines that were becoming more difficult are now easy , or at least easier this includes lifting dishes or other objects above my head ex removing dishes from high kitchen cabinets i feel much more secure comfortable standing my knees have not buckled in a long time when i stand now , the strength in my quads give me a sense of confidence other people my dentist for example are beginning to comment on specific changes they have seen side effects i am eating a little more more hungry , but that could be do to the increase in my exercise program i have not gained any weight , so what i am consuming must be burning up no other side effects that i am aware of granted , it has only been three months and i do not know what tomorrow will bring , but i am really enjoying this experience right now
