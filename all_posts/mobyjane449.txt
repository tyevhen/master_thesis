dear a b it 's me again and wondering if you could take a moment to answer just one question for me i have had a family crisis and fallen into the dark pit my question to you is on thought control how does one control his thoughts while sleeping ? or is it that i go to bed with those thoughts ? as i awoke today with my mind racing and feeling those old dark cloud thoughts that i hate so much it 's been coming on me , but today seemed to reach a zenith thanks b dear b it is not easy to control your thinking it is a simple process but hard to get over the lack of motivation to want to do it you have to insist on thinking your thought instead of what disturbing or anxious thought your brain has popped up for you remember , your brain always follows the direction of its most current dominant thought you make a thought dominant by thinking it over repetitively that 's why you can make your exercise thought dominant over the anxious thought you can think your thought over and over when the brain 's anxious thought intrudes , intrude back with your own thought we all have the same problem of thinking thoughts we hate to think you have to substitute a non emotional thought anything works lately at night when i 've gone to bed , i 've been using simple counting over and over if i 've been too agitated , and too much stress chemicals have been let loose , i read a book for a while to break the continuity and get my mind going in another direction or , on rare occasions , if nothing works , i 'll watch an old movie for an hour or so and then go back to bed if i wake up at night , i also use the counting to get back to sleep during the day , it is easier to distract yourself with work and concentrating on objective things rather than dwell on your unwelcome thoughts i simply do n't allow negative or anxious thoughts during the day at night it 's harder if you are trying to get to sleep but usually i manage only once or twice a month i might have a problem that i have to solve with reading or rarely , every couple of months , i might have to watch a movie a b curtiss dear a b not sure if i really understand here getting to sleep is not a problem for me it 's on awakening in the morning it 's usually a very bad feeling i awake to , and do n't know why did you mean if you think good thoughts when you retire that will help the mood when one awakes ? thanks for your replies i know you are busy woman also loved the group picture of as i counted themon your website i count seventeen in our group of course , we lost my granddaughter , and that was the tragedy of our life , but we do move on , yet never forget her thanks for all your help through all these years it 's really been a life saver to me , and i do recommend your books best regards , b dear b i often awake with a bad feeling in the morning as well probably because we ca n't direct our thinking while we 're asleep the way i handle it is to absolutely ignore the bad feeling and use an exercise counting , or green frog for a few seconds then i get up and get about my day i do not focus on my feelings at that time but , instead , focus on whatever activity i'm engaged in if bad thoughts sneak in , i do a quick exercise like counting for a few seconds and continue with my activity or i might say to myself this crappy feeling will soon pass but i continue to ignore the crappy feeling and do not sink into it i continue to move in the opposite direction thinking about what i'm going to do next , or doing some nursery rhyme , or singing exercise , or counting if necessary to thoughtjam the downer thoughts that keep sneaking in the crappy feeling can never survive more than an hour i generally just notice that it 's gone hope this helps a b curtiss
