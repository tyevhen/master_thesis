despite some mood dives this week , a really good week of running ! here is the summary for week six of the garry bjorklund half marathon training program week six april , ran days miles ! long run miles speedwork miles at tempo pace hills x seconds each supposed to do x seconds , but my hill was short ! found money i ended last week 's post with the thought that i needed to up my mileage i certainly accomplished that goal ! my legs really felt it during yesterday 's miler , too ! the next off day is n't scheduled until friday , but that would be consecutive running days for me unheard of ! based on the fatigued legs i felt yesterday , i think today may be a good day to hit the pool happy running !
