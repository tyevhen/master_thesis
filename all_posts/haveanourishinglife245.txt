this is a beautiful song , but it also makes a great poem there 's a girl in the corner with tear stains on her eyes from the places she 's wandered and the shame she ca n't hide she says , how did i get here ? i'm not who i once was and i'm crippled by the fear that i 've fallen too far to love but do n't you know who you are , what 's been done for you ? you are more than the choices that you 've made , you are more than the sum of your past mistakes , you are more than the problems you create , you 've been remade well she tries to believe it that she 's been given new life but she ca n't shake the feeling that it 's not true tonight she knows all the answers and she 's rehearsed all the lines and so she 'll try to do better but then she 's too weak to try but do n't you know who you are ? you are more than the choices that you 've made , you are more than the sum of your past mistakes , you are more than the problems you create , you 've been remade 'cause this is not about what you 've done , but what 's been done for you this is not about where you 've been , but where your brokenness brings you to this is not about what you feel , but what he felt to forgive you , and what he felt to make you loved you are more than the choices that you 've made , you are more than the sum of your past mistakes , you are more than the problems you create , you 've been remade you are more , by tenth avenue north lyrics courtesy of www elyrics net
