here 's a new poem i wrote in my old haunts of norcal mendocino woodlands a cataract of cloud slips from the sun , lighting a meadow of nettles whose sting , soft but persistent clings to my wrist all day ferns droop from banks of moss , blackberry vines clutch at my jeans , pleading spring young horsetails , cattails sprout along the path like oversized asparagus in a redwood grove huge stumps dwarf trunks of living trees , witness to the slaughter of loggers , monuments to a time when thick barked monsters ruled the forest over redwood needles and mud carpeted with leaves , our dog s limp is less noticeable than in the pitiless city i throw a stick into the river swollen and browned by rain but kenyon is slow to fetch stick in mouth , he seeks asylum on an island of bare limbed bushes beaten down by rain gorged waters i call reluctantly he paddles back to shore , ditching the stick the river s too cold today for his emaciated frame later in a gravelly pool water streams beneath his chest and belly contentedly he licks his forelimbs clean kathleen will brush the bracken from his fur but he may never rebound from a year with former friends , friends i now think capable of slaughtering these great trees again ce
