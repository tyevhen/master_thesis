back in i began teaching meditation classes for those of my clients who kept asking me how to do it i think they initially believed it was a mystical practice for the spiritually initiated did i have to roll up my one trouser leg and levitate over the coffee table ? had i attended a secret club hosted by yoda and the dalai lama ? the answer , of course , was no i just sat still for a couple of minutes and listened to my breathing no secret club no initiation i knew then that i wanted to show people how easy it was to meditate in , i published a simple pocket guide meditation a beginner s guide here is an excerpt if you don t know a chakra from a chorizo , prefer a pair of jimmy choo shoes over walking barefoot on dew covered grass , and the only labyrinth you ve heard of was a del toro film , then you ve come to the right place i teach meditation classes , not to highly spiritual students with hairy armpits and kaftans , but to ladies who are just like you and i , career women , single parents , teachers , nurses , retired grandparents meditation is available to everyone you don t need to be spiritual to enjoy the benefits of this practice we all experience those moments when we are caught up in a whirlwind of thoughts when i teach my classes , i refer to those moments often it s the time when your mind refuses to stop its internal chatter did i put the cat out ? i forgot to email x about y what shall we have for dinner ? i coined the phrase sausage and mash moments when you first heard about meditation what was your reaction ? maybe you thought it was a load of nonsense , or perhaps you thought it was a pastime for hippies wearing floating robes , bamboo sandals and chanting in fields meditation is , in fact , the simple task of being in the now living in the present and trying to be still you can meditate in your pyjamas sat on the couch , you can meditate in your business suit on the train , and you can even meditate in your jeans and jumper while sat in the dentist chair meditation is very simple take ten minutes , and you ll see for yourself i am a down to earth person , and so i write and teach in much the same way , there are no complicated methodology and no judgement meditation may seem esoteric but only by giving it a go will you begin to understand how simple it is to integrate this practice into your daily life meditation is such a wonderful gift to give yourself let s take a quick look at just some of the ways in which meditation can help you it reduces anxiety aches , pains and muscle tension decreases it slows your heart rate it helps you be more creative improves your memory and concentration boosts your self esteem not knowing how to get started is what puts people off trying do i need a special mat chair ? should i wear appropriate meditation clothes ? no just follow the next few steps and bingo you re meditating ! it helps if you find somewhere you aren t going to be disturbed until you get the hang of it switch off your phone , tell the family to leave you alone for ten minutes and then you re ready find a comfy place to sit armchair is fine make sure your back is well supported , and you re warm keep your shoulders relaxed , hands floppy in your lap and your feet flat on the floor close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose try and imagine the breath travelling up your nose , down your throat and dropping to your diaphragm that s the muscle between your chest and stomach if it helps , imagine a yo yo on a string , uncurling as it travels through you and then bouncing back up once it reaches your diaphragm breathe out slowly then repeat keep using this method and begin to maintain a calm and steady rhythm of breathing picturing something like a yo yo can help retain your focus remember the sausage and mash moments ! if you do find , your mind is wandering off then don t worry notice what the thought was and then start concentrating on your breathing again if using a visual aid isn t working you can try counting follow this method close your eyes and take a deep breath in then out maintain a calm rhythm of breathing as above on your next inhalation count in your head one as you breathe out count two wait for the next breath and count again one exhale two inhale one exhale two you will start to notice that your body begins to relax as your breathing slows down try and do this simple breathing exercise every day i sometimes do it when i m in my car waiting at traffic lights i do keep my eyes open though ! you could try it when you are washing up , cleaning the car , ironing or eating don t think that you need to find an extra hour a day to dedicate to meditation if you can , then fantastic go for it ! if however , you are like me , a single mum running a business and writing books , then ten minutes a day while in the shower might be all you can manage that s okay too i would love to hear how you get on with these meditation exercises feel free to leave me your feedback in the comments below or join me on the facebook page http www facebook com resolutionchallenge maybe you have another method that works for you and you d like to share it with the rest of us happy meditating ! j
