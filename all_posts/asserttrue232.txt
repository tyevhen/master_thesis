you 've seen the scenario play itself out a million times before a client or coworker comes to you for advice you offer your very best insights the other person nods , smiles , thanks you , and agrees to put some of your ideas into action but then you find out , hours or days later , the person not only ignored your advice but went against it you 've been grinf ked the urban dictionary defines grinf ck noun form as follows in business , when someone smiles and shakes your hand , assuring you that they have heard and will act upon your recommendation or concerns , when in truth you have already been ignored and dismissed i think the expectation of being grinf ked is why many of us are hesitant to take user satisfaction surveys when asked to do so by banks , e commerce sites , etc we suspect we 'll get the nod , the sincere thank you and see our suggestions ignored have you ever dialed the number listed under one of those how is my driving ? stickers on the backs of trucks ? me neither i'm not a psychologist so if any specialists are reading this , please speak up here , but it seems to me that grinf kery , in at least some cases , qualifies as a type of passive aggressive behavior , meant to humble the advice giver while bolstering the other person 's authority in other cases , grinf king is just a byproduct of someone 's opinion gathering requirement the person who asked for your advice was required to get a second or third opinion on something there was never any intent to use that opinion to deviate from an already chosen agenda and then there are those who mean you no disrespect , but who simply feel embarrassed or timid about disagreeing with you to your face these are well meaning people who are n't trying to be disingenuous they just do n't like to appear disagreeable or maybe they 're confrontation averse regardless of motivations , it seems to me we all have a duty to be honest and forthright in our dealings with clients and coworkers we can always agree to disagree on things , if need be there 's room or should be , in any organization for honest divergence of opinions transparent , open debate of ideas is healthy and should be encouraged but do n't be disingenuous do n't camouflage dissent as agreement do n't tell me one thing when you mean another do n't deliberately mislead me into thinking you value what i'm saying , when in fact you intend to ignore what i'm saying when i learn the truth , later , it does nothing good for our relationship just be honest with me let me know what you really think i can take it i promise do n't be a grinf ker
