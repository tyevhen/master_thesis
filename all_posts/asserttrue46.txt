omega fatty acids from fish oil have been shown to reduce risk for heart attack and stroke but they also have the capacity to thin the blood by interfering with clotting which is why some medical facilities ask patients to stop fish oil two weeks before major surgery it 's worth knowing about this effect if you take other drugs to slow clotting overall , there 's not much to worry about surveys of the literature consistently find a lack of complications in surgery patients who take fish oil studies of the effect frequently say things like no difference in clinically significant bleeding noted or no patient suffered from bleeding complications see for example this review for an actual study , see watson et al , american journal of cardiology frankly , if fish oil did n't reduce platelet aggregation , you probably would n't get the heart protective effects there are two situations , though , in which the blood thinning effects of omega fatty acids can be important one is if you are deficient in vitamin k , a vitamin crucial to forming blood clotting protein omega fatty acids in the presence of vitamin k deficiency can cause an excess risk of bleeding so by all means , eat plenty of k rich foods like broccoli , lettuces , green peppers , and other green colored foods the second situation is the intentional vitamin k deficiency induced by drugs like coumadin warfarin omega fatty acids modestly reduce production of several clotting proteins e g , factors vii and x that overlap with coumadin 's action , so blood may thin more with omerga s than without omega s the bottom line is that if you are taking plavix , coumadin , or any similar medication , you should consult with your doctor on the use of fish oil it 's possible you may need to take less of the prescription drugs while taking fish oil for most of us , the clotting reduction effects of fish oils are a benefit , rather than a risk it helps offset the clot promoting effects of smoking , physical inactivity , fast foods , etc and yes , you should definitely modify your lifestyle appropriately , but until then , a little fish oil ca n't hurt as one doctor puts it rather than causing blood thinning , i prefer to think that omega fatty acids from fish oil restore protection from abnormal clotting taking omega fatty acids from fish oil simply restores a normal level of omega fatty acids in the blood sufficient to strike a healthy balance between blood thinning and healthy blood clotting a big thank you to all the great people who retweeted me yesterday buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
