i took my car in to the shop last week to visit his car momma i 've been going to this garage for years and i know most of the mechanics i 've run into car momma at the hair salon with her head wrapped in a towel i 've heard about her son , his school activities and her home renovation projects she 's heard about my vacations and seen my climbing pictures i 've always been on a first name basis with the people i know there this time , i had to leave the car and get a rental i left a voice message with the rental desk and when the rental guy called me back at work i answered the phone with my usual , dr clinkshrink now , my garage knows what i do for a living and it 's just never been an issue or really even a topic of conversation once the novelty wore off the difference this time was that the guy worked on my car was new to the shop when i arrived at my scheduled time the next morning , he was standing in front of the shop , clipboard in hand , waiting for me dr clinkshrink ? he asked and he shook my hand he had all the paperwork waiting to go , my rental was lined up and waiting , and every reference to me was preceded by dr i gotta tell ya , it felt weird eventually he asked me if i was a medical doctor , explaining that he asked because there are a lot of people who go by 'doctor' who are n't actually md 's my first thought was blog material i never go by my title or my initials when i'm off duty when i first graduated from medical school a got several letters hand written , pre email from my mother addressed to dr clinkshrink or clinkshrink , md , but that was about it i think and still do that people who flash their initials around are a bit obnoxious this was just the first occasion that i really was struck by what initials can do and no , i do n't plan to make a habit of flashing the 'md' it just felt too weird and for the record , i did make a point of telling the rental guy that phd 's earned their degrees too
