i'm still grieving the lost of my post , off label in jail , inspired by an article in the new york times about a maryland psychiatrist no one i know who was arrested for giving paid talks promoting the off label use of xyrem , a medication marketed only for narcolepsy , which contains ghb , the substance in the date rape drug clinkshrink , in kind form as she continues to address my constant quest for a viewable sidebar , shortened some lines i had drawn around a direct quote , but does not think that caused most of the entry to be eaten i am left to blame the support duck as max does not eat lines he only eats meat you ca n't escape or rather , i ca n't escape i picked up a novel the other night , one i got from the library , chosen like i choose my wines for the pretty cover the first chapter was titled confinement and the protagonist was having trouble getting up throughout the night , so i correctly assumed she was pregnant by page two , her water had broken by page three , it was apparent that she was a prison inmate about to deliver either a jail baby or a gummy bear i wanted to scream and throw the book out the window and if that was n't enough , i was at the clinic today and i was approached by a drug rep who handed me an article about the wonders of treating criminals with depakote he let rip a line about how prisoners get no mental health care and i told him my co blogger ah , did he know we had a blog ? he does now ! would be deeply offended he went on about the jails , i excused myself to return to my patient who had been a criminal so this time it 's someone other than foofoo clink making it all about their prisoners another new york times piece well worth checking out he who cast the first stone probably didn t is an op ed article by harvard psychologist daniel gilbert as he looks at the psychology of fighting starting in his parents' station wagon , ending in the mideast just a well written , interesting piece i'm off to the beach for two days of sun escape no kids no max no patients no prisoners oops , but i'm going with a judge , hoping she wo n't bring her clientele
