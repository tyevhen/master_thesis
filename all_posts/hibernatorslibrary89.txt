holding smoke , by elle cosimano i received a copy of this book from disney press via netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review john conlan is in juvie for double murder , but the bars ca n't hold him like they hold the other inmates john is able to leave his body behind and travel around as a ghost i read holding smoke for two reasons i like teen fantasy , and i like realism about teens in difficult situations the second one is a bit of a stretch , since fantasy and realism are generally considered opposites , but i had high hopes for the realistic setting of this book because the author was the daughter of a prison warden as far as realistic settings go , cosimano did a fantastic job she managed to show the type of anger and violence that occur in a prison , without making it unsuitable for teens she also wrote likable main characters with flaws i'm always interested in reading what teen books say about prison , since i think it is important for teens to realize that this could be you under different circumstances no , i do n't think of every teen as a potential prisoner so much as every prisoner as a human being with a story this book did a good job of showing that john was a human being first , and a prisoner second of course , the realism had to stop somewhere it is , above all , a fantasy novel i enjoyed the fantasy romance side of the story , too in fact , it 's the unique prison setting that makes this such a good fantasy story also unlike most teen fantasies these days , it 's about a male character making it appeal to kids of both genders recommended for teens and up
