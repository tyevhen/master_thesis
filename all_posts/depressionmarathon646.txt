i detailed the joy of owning a home in my last post as the outside temps and humidity increased , my air conditioning decreased today , my house is slightly cooler , but that 's because the amazonian temperatures and humidity have finally broken my poor , old air conditioner can now keep up and that 's basically what i found out from the air conditioner repairman my air conditioner is old and needs to be replaced ugh replacing a central air conditioner , it turns out , is quite an expensive proposition i 've only gotten one quote so far , , but i will be getting more i'm also in the process of trying to figure out how to cover the cost i keep telling myself it will all work out and it will i just do n't know how yet in other news , my running is going well this is a big week i completed my speed workout on tuesday , x mile , and an mile tempo run today both were tough , but doable on saturday i'm praying for cool weather because i 'll be outside for hours running my miles i'm not necessarily looking forward to the miler , but i'm not dreading it either that 's a good sign i think it will be a good run my next marathon is only weeks away now i'm running the eisenbahn marathon in wisconsin it 's a smaller race , run primarily on a bike path , between two small towns i'm looking forward to it it will be my th marathon in months i never thought i 'd do this many marathons in such a short span of time , but it 's been fun , and i think it 's helped my mental health it 's important , i think , for all of us to find something outside our heads on which to focus having a chronic illness is tough enough without spending an inordinate amount of time fixated on it for me that focus is running i wonder what it is for you ? i encourage all of my readers to find something which brings joy despite our illnesses , joy is possible look for it
