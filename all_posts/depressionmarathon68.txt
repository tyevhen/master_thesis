i ran a long way yesterday , miles to be exact , and at least the first miles were spent fuming about the latest insulting difference between treatment for my illness , depression , versus treatment for just about any other physical illness too bad i ca n't type while i'm running , because i composed a whopper of a post during those first ten miles ! here 's what happened a few days ago it was suggested , since i'm still not well , that perhaps i should attend an intensive outpatient program for people with mental illness ect , hospitalizations , med changes , therapy , mom visit none of those interventions worked to alleviate my symptoms , so this was now the best idea we had i quickly , and with contained irritation , declined you see , i completed this very program several years ago in fact , i 've completed several similar outpatient programs over the past years and while i 've learned a couple of things here and there , the majority of these remedial education groups have been more frustrating than productive these groups are intended to teach life skills , coping mechanisms , socialization , etc there are lectures about how to organize our day , how to manage our time , with included blank time management schedules to fill out , and lists of pleasant activities we could tap into when feeling really low interestingly , i 've never met anyone in any of these groups who was there to deal with their despair over their diagnosis of ms or cancer perhaps it 's a fact that people with ms or cancer know how to manage their time perhaps they realize eating a piece of chocolate one of the items on the pleasant activities list when feeling low would cure all that ails them but me , a person with depression , a person who managed time well enough to excel through two post graduate degrees , who holds down a professional job despite feeling like shit , who owns and maintains a home , and who has trained for and run marathons clearly my time management skills suck if i could just fill in that blank time schedule and learn to take a bath or eat some chocolate , all would be well so simple how could we have missed it all this time why did we even bother with the hospital , or ect , or medication ? ? but let me tell you the real problem i had with the most recent intensive outpatient program i attended instead of a room full of patients with depression , i was surrounded by all sorts of interesting characters , which is not to say i did n't learn from them for example , i learned more than i cared to know about the best times and places to score after each group i was usually the only sober person in the room i was puzzled and saddened by the woman who seemed to have a different , fresh , self inflicted flesh wound everyday , which she made no attempt at hiding and worst of all , at every opportunity they had , i was forced to listen to snickering patients bragging about how they escaped jail or work release simply by attending this group yup , i learned a lot , none of it therapeutic when i could n't stand it any longer , i pulled the instructors aside and explained what i was seeing and hearing every time they left the room i told them i was very uncomfortable with the snickering and bragging that discussion ended with me being dismissed from the group , as the instructors decided i was inappropriately focused on others rather then on myself i was the problem fine see you later i am a professional , functional , athletic , sober woman with a major mental illness i have treatment resistant , severe depression why , when we run out of ideas we hoped would work , is the next step to send me to a remedial education group ? i'm not saying there is no place for groups like this , but at the risk of sounding like a snob , groups like this are not appropriate for everyone and they are certainly not appropriate just because nothing else has worked when the tumor does n't shrink , or the ms does n't abate , the next step is never to send the patient to time management training ! it 's not the cancer patient 's fault the tumor did n't shrink it 's not the patient 's fault the ms continues to progress and it 's not my fault i still feel like shit ! i have depression even if i go take a bath with a box full of chocolates , i bet i 'll still have depression it 's an illness let 's deal with it like the illness it is please !
