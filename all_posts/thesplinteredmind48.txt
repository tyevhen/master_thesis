it s time for winter depression again daylight savings time dst has struck and suddenly it s darker during the end of your work day than it was two weeks ago although i have clinical depression year round , i have noticed that every time at this year my mood disorder spikes i ve written about season affective disorder before so why was this year harder than previous years ? you d think i d be prepared well , i was prepared last year the bulbs only burn for about a year and starting around august my bulbs began to die off by the time november rolled around , i was desperately trying to replace them if i thought things were confusing in the last time i had to decipher industry offerings for daylight spectrum bulbs , that was nothing compared to the brave new world of federally regulated light bulbs today everything has changed again since i couldn t find an exact match to the bulbs i was using before , i ve been using ge reveal halogen bulbs as an experiment and they are ok , but i only bought two of them and have under illuminated my environment this is why i have been harder hit by dst this year since i ve been using ceiling lights to treat winter depression as opposed to dedicated depression lamps , i have discovered a few things first , full spectrum bulbs are hard to find now i realize that most commercial full spectrum bulbs aren t really full spectrum , but i liked the cool morning light affect of these bulbs and they alleviated my winter depression ge makes regular and full spectrum reveal bulbs their difference seems to be a blue tint on the full spectrum bulbs i went with the regular reveal halogen bulbs because that s all i could buy , but amazon lists full spectrum versions i would dearly like to find second , the type of bulb doesn t seem to matter as long as the lux value is high lux is equal to light output lumens divided by square meters lx lm m don t you feel all smart and everything now ? most light bulbs will list lumens stats , so lux is the measurement of the amount of light in your work area by having the hallway and kitchen lights using these high lumens bulbs i could offset the winter depression this year , however , i only had the high lumens bulbs in the hallway the lack of lux had a profound affect on my depression i can t say that a dedicated full spectrum verilux happylite deluxe sunshine simulator can be replaced with far less expensive bulbs , but perhaps the far less expensive bulbs can be good enough if you have enough of them installed and that s my report for the year i look forward to getting more reveal lights installed soon contact me on twitter or via email if you want to know how my experiment is going
