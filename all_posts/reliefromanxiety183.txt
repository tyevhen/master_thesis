although this is something i do n't usually write about and seems somewhat contradictory , i feel it 's important to write about i found the video 'look up' through anna 's blog and i have to say it 's pretty impressive it focuses on the many moments in life that we miss because we spend the majority of our time using technology after all , we do n't know how many breaths we 're guaranteed although i use the internet a fair bit , not only to write this blog and to keep in touch with all of you , but to talk to friends and keep up to date with events i can go without it and i often find myself without my phone when going out however , technology has become a main part of our lives i know that it can be annoying without my my ipod and the internet general nevertheless , it 's not a complete disaster that i do n't have access to it sometimes i often find that when you leave the technology at home , your mind is much clearer , especially if you leave it for a long time nowadays , even though technology is essential , i find it has disadvantaged us the times when we 're on buses , or in waiting rooms and no one dare to make eye contact in the fear that someone may talk to us you never know where a conversation may lead and the experience it may hold as the video touches on , you 're not going to remember all of that time you 've spent on technology , but rather look back at the time you 've missed there are definitely many advantages to technology and for that i am grateful , but occasionally we should take a break and observe the world in which we live best wishes , amy xx
