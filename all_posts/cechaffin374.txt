after my rant on literary narcissism , i feel impelled to follow my own dictum suspect yourself first regarding the defects of my poetry , i have had critics say it was inhuman or unapproachable , had it compared to stainless steal after my last post a good friend wrote me with some insightful comments i would like to excerpt if you 're trafficking in authentic mysteries , truly the sublime , then the intellect can only pretend a sort of false mastery so there is perhaps a tendency towards smugness that you should perennially be on guard against a challenge for you i would think is how to strike a communion with your audience that is earnest and authentic without lapsing into condescension i'm sure you grasp the perils of cerebral poetry in this subjective age i went through some poems trying to find one that exhibited more room for communion with the audience , an open poem if you will , as opposed to a closed or internally completed poem it took me some time to settle on one i thought would qualify here it is jacob my grandson s cry tonight is a buzz saw on aluminum , a kickstand scraping concrete reminding me of beckett s last play , where a heap of post apocalyptic trash appears , then a baby s cry , then darkness i can t rid these prickles from my heart , resentment at his shrieking intransigence the fuse of a child abuser ? holding him is best because i feel as if i m doing something he is mine and i can t stand it unpublished mood holding , thanks be to god and medications and an understanding wife , ce
