this is an abstract of an article i wrote for the journal for neurocognitive research ans activitas nervosa superior that published last month this is a report of clinical observations over forty five years we describe the difference between limbic fear versus brainstem terror the earlier a patient relives events from childhood , and infancy , the deeper into the brain he may reach in the process , the affective responses become more exaggerated for example , mild hopelessness becomes suicidal hopelessness , fear becomes terror , and anger becomes rage the responses become more primitive as they emanate from a brain that is more primitive older and pre human janov , that primitive brain inside of us provides all of the responses that existed hundreds of millions of years ago in some respects we are still that alligator or shark with no pity or remorse , just instinct those primitive responses are pre emotion , before mammalian caring and concern evolved , and they do allow us to murder when evoked they also permit panic attacks which evolved to be life saving in situations where rapid and vigorous responses meant survival a person responding with rage or terror is overwhelmed by his brainstem activity and is reacting exactly like the alligator does these deep and early processes have largely been ignored in clinical work and must be revisited you can read the full article here http www activitas org index php nervosa article view
