i did it i finished my first outdoor triathlon the swim meters or miles was as ugly as it could get i believe i was one of the last people out of the water but i made it around the lake , twice the bike hilly miles was great it felt fast i passed a lot of people the run miles was tough , but doable i passed a lot of people on the run , too i was as grateful as grateful can be to finish , especially after the ugly swim i had lots of people there supporting me , which was very cool and of course i thought of all you blogosphere fans , too , especially when i contemplated dropping out during the swim it was nice to feel all of the support thank you my final time was under hours , and that makes me pleased i think that 's not too bad for a first attempt i 'll write more about the whole experience later right now , it 's time for a nap
