integration means that the reliving of a key memory will affect nearly every system in our lives so we measure natural killer cells , serotonin and brainwave function to test whether there has been integration and we have found profound changes normalization in all of those over time in our therapy so we might ask , does it matter if we don t relive events during womb life ? yes , because that reliving can produce a change in many physiologic parameters and in behavior ? so the answer is clear yes , it matters because we have seen engraved patterns migraine , high blood pressure , impulsive acting out from early childhood and fetal life get resolved and integrated decades later in therapy if patients needed to do more than relive , then they would feel worse , not better , months and years after therapy and their physiologic changes would not hold up the stress hormone , cortisol , would again diminish to pre therapy times as i have reiterated , the only time we can rewire deviated set points is when the brain retreats to an earlier prenatal time and deals directly with the original causes of deviation this means getting below repression and into history with every fiber of our being , and that history contains life before birth late research seems to confirm this assumption scientists from mass inst technology have found that the brain becomes much easier to rewire the younger we are in the journal current biology oct , , lead author , marina bedny suggests that as we get older it is much more difficult to rewire the brain most circuits are pretty well fixed i wonder if it is not easier to rewire the brain when we go back and relive those very early brain states it may be why we see such progress in those patients who do successfully relive early imprints this may defy current research which indicates how difficult it is to rewire circuits later in life let me be clear about all this any intervention by a therapist after the critical period can only be palliative the warm , attentive doctor can only provide a cushion against the impact of the internal pain that warmth cannot penetrate deep enough to attack the original imprint of course , the patient will feel better she has been palliated , and that feels good , as i have reiterated the analysis of transference , understanding one s pattern of behavior toward the doctor cannot make fundamental change , nor can any insight therapy the shuttered sensory window won t permit it repression is locked into place it stops any deep penetration it keeps us on a superficial level
