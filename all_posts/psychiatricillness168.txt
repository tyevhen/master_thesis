i have always thought of self harm as a cry for help and never seriously attempted it before as i was worried that people would think i am attention seeking and being a spoilt brat yesterday i had a particulary bad day at work , i had put all my effort into two peices of work and really gave it everything i had i thought on wednesday it was complete , when i went in yesterday morning a very senior person in the company said simply he had changed his mind and did not want to use the wording i provided as an alternative for his inappropriate proposal he wrote quite a rude and abrupt email so that really upset me i did not do any work yeasterday and i was in tears a couple of times i was really ready to just resign and have done with it i have been living in this town for nearly years and i have tried really hard to meet people during the last months and there is still no one i can call upon to go to the pub with after a bad day ! i was seriouslg considering quitting my job and moving closer to my family after all , a stressful famly is better than no famly ! i watch tv until pm just in numb mode , i went to bed and cryed for a while after a bit the idea of self harm came into my head , i thought of the kitchen knives and i tried to cut myself wih a huge chopper i did not want to cut deep as i did not want anyone to know it did not matter if people thought i was attention seeking , i knew i was not ! ! in fact i did not want anyone to know ! the knives did not cut me , they were too blunt i covered a used light bulb with a cloth and smashed it with a hammer it took quite some effort to cut through my skin and draw blood i was really surprised about how thick my skin is i have only managed a cut of about cm i felt quiet in the mind after , it was a release i forced myself to get up and go to work this morning i must have looked a right wreck i did not wash , i cleaned teeth cos of my brace but i threw dirty clothes on and went to work it was really hard wth peple saying morning and stuff , i went to the bathroom several time and tryed to bite myself i gotr some good hard bites up both arms but did not draw blood it was a release from an unbearable situation at lunch time my boss who i think of as a friend asked me to join him for lunch we had a good chat about things and i felt a lot better this afternoon o i do not feel like harming myself anymore i now understand that self harm is not attention seeking , those people i listened to many years ago when i was frst contemplating it were wrong self harm is a release i in no way want to kill myself or stop living but the self harm is a coping strategy not an ideal one but it take the emotional pain away i know i probably need a bit more help right noe but i do not want to bother the doctor or psychiatrist this close to christmas anyway i do not want more meds and i do not want pity my chat at lunch time was the help i needed i am going to get my pc fixed in the new year as a matter of a priority , my blogg is definitely a better release than bites the bite marks are gone now , but they took several hours to go i hope they do not bruise as i do not want to wear long sleeves all over christmas sorry for such a depressive post so close to christmas , but it helps to write these things down i still feel i have a new confidence , i am not bad for wanting to harm myself , it was a coping strategy until someone had time for me !
