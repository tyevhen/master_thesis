today is my daughter 's baby blessing i have been nervous about today for a long time , and this morning my anxiety level is really high i have n't felt this anxious in a really long time i finally felt things slipping out from my control and so i am forcing myself to write things out to help calm me down so many things could go wrong today , granted they are all little and not a big deal but i have this huge desire for everything to be perfect i am hoping things are somewhat organized but forgive me if i babble things that are bothering me what if we are late to church in the first place ? what if she cries through the whole blessing ? what if she poops all over her pretty dress before we even make it in the doors ? what if she does n't eat enough before hand and is hungry and wo n't stop crying ? what if its not perfect ? i thought these thing through thinking , what if all of the above happened , whats the big deal ? why am i so worried ? and then it hit me deep down inside i am telling myself that if any of these things happen , i am a bad mother and then i realized a whole new role had opened up in my life for people to judge me and me to worry about as if to prove a point that things were n't going to go right , when i woke up yesterday my little one had scratched all across her nose with her fingernails leaving a long , first thing you see when you look at her , scratch mark luckily i am familiar enough with photoshop to be able to remove it from pictures , but it still seemed like the mark represented a failure if i was better at keeping her nails short , this would n't have happened if only i was a better mother , is what i was telling myself how mean i am to myself i know i am not a bad mother , but subconsciously i am thinking this over and over again i want so badly for everyone to think i have everything under control so i had to tell myself over and over again that i am a good mother replacing the negative thoughts with a positive one seemed to help calm me down a little so here goes taking deep breaths we have to leave in about an hour and a half i have n't even grazed on the fact that all of the family is coming over to our house for a bbq afterward and the anxiety that i will most likely feel there i will update this afterward to let you know if and how i handle any panic attacks you might also like i hate anxiety and worrying about work performance theres no need to push myself are you a perfectionist or healthy striver ? is recovery like santa claus or the easter bunny ? linkwithin
