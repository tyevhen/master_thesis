thanks again to dr hale for pointing out a new study on diet and adhd and thanks again to australia for studying diet and psychiatric issues observationally , though a prospective controlled dietary trial from any country would be nice every now and then throw us psychiatrists a bone i know we are n't cardiologists and do n't make the big with procedures , but we 're important too ahem the design of this study is rather interesting in , researchers recruited a bunch of pregnant women in and around perth , australia , to allow their children to be followed for medical science or so agreed , and the moms families answered questionnaires at weeks pregnant , weeks pregnant , birth , , , , , , , and years of age by the year mark , , of the original cohort of live births sent in their sase with answers about diet , sociodemographic , and lifestyle factors each caregiver was asked if their child was diagnosed by a health professional with adhd , and trained research assistants followed up with the healthcare professional to confirm the diagnosis , including the adhd subtype inattentive , hyperactive , or combined in the end , the diagnosis or lack thereof was confirmed for adolescents diet was evaluated via a food frequency questionnaire which is always a bit of a shot in the dark , but the questionnaire was confirmed both by the kid 's primary caregiver and by a visit with a research assistant the researchers divided the diets into two patterns western and healthy a western diet had higher total fat , saturated fat , refined sugars , and sodium with lesser amounts of omega , fiber , and folate alas poor sat fat is lumped in with refined sugars and processed food sodium yet again the healthy pattern had high omega , fiber , and folate and low saturated fat , refined sugars , sodium , and total fat tons of numbers were crunched maternal smoking , poverty , alcohol , stressful events during pregnancy and early childhood , physical activity many , many , many numbers were crunched in the end , of the boys and of the girls had a diagnosis of adhd adolescents with a western dietary pattern were a little more than twice as likely to have adhd than those with a healthy pattern three or more stressful events during pregnancy were also associated with adhd in boys , but not in girls kids who exercised outside school hours were less likely to have adhd specific food groups with increased risk for adhd included fast food , processed meats , red meat , high fat dairy products ice cream ? , soft drinks , and crisps chips , i think they mean ! ! now some discussion first , evolutionary psychiatry would like to point out that this is an observational study , with all the limitations therein good for speculation , but not good for recommendations fortunately , we at evolutionary psychiatry love to speculate let 's review some other data about adhd and nutrition lower plasma omega and higher omega has been observed in kids with adhd adhd is also linked in a prospective , randomized controlled trial with food additives and food colorings , which would be higher in a western diet a lack of micronutrients such as zinc has also been associated with adhd and supplementation was found to be helpful in an intervention trial all these issues would be associated with a western but not a paleolithic style dietary pattern one more important thing to consider adhd is highly genetic perhaps related to inherited inefficiency with dopamine receptors in the frontal lobes i'm an adult psychiatrist often i will get an adult coming in saying , my son was just diagnosed with adhd , and you know , i think i 've had it my whole life too eating healthy requires some planning and organization though it is not that difficult once you get used to the dos and do n'ts when adhd affects whole families , fast food can be an easier solution than cooking and preparing meals at home
