not long ago , a local newspaper ran a story about ralph ver ploeg , a year old mesa , arizona man who works the drive through line at a mcdonald 's in neighboring gilbert people opt eagerly for his line , even if it moves a little slower than the other why ? because , in addition to his order taking efficiency , ralph asks how a customer 's day is going he delights in hearing their news and offers support to people struggling through a job loss or divorce he 's kind he cares and his goodbye is god bless in some ways , ralph would seem to be living a old age nightmare he needs to work to supplement his retirement benefits he was laid off from a full time job in security two years ago and was unable to find full time work so he applied for part time positions and landed at mcdonald 's he sees the lay off as a great blessing because it brought him to the drive through and the opportunity to share his love for god and life in general with hundreds of people a day his eyes filled with tears as he talked with the reporter about his job i love it so much i feel that my whole life has been in preparation for this such a positive attitude in the face of harsh economic realities is an inspiration and a lesson in making the most of what life brings i 've seen seniors with so much more in material comforts complaining about being bored or not having friends or a spouse not being available enough or being too present and i ca n't help but think what we can learn from peers who seem so rich with so much less i have a dear friend i 'll call joe i met joe about twenty years ago in graduate school when i went back for a clinical master 's in psychology when he walked into the classroom for the first time , clad in jeans and a laker 's t shirt and speaking with a heavy new york accent , he seemed like a big , personable jock not surprisingly , he was a high school teacher and coach i was shocked to discover , some weeks later , that he was , not so incidentally , a catholic monk initially , my reaction was to avoid him a lapsed catholic , i did n't want to get into a discussion of my issues with the church but you do n't understand , he said , sitting beside me at the dinner break one day i'm in a period of my life when i'm questioning so much i really would like to talk with someone who has questioned , too with our questioning , our doubts , our stresses in working full time while taking on a demanding graduate program , we became fast friends in our classroom clinical exercises , joe showed promise of being an excellent therapist he listened , remembered , encouraged , was down to earth , used humor appropriately and cared deeply although he ultimately decided to transfer to the non clinical program to become a school counselor , we still met for dinner breaks on graduation day , we went out for a celebratory dinner together with our families in the years since , life has been less than kind to joe he made the painful decision to leave the religious order he had entered at the age of thirteen he taught religion and ethics at various catholic high schools he fought bouts of depression as he struggled to make his own way in the world after more than years in a religious order he went back to new york to care for his mother during her last illness some years passed after her death , he headed back to california where , now , he has struggled to find work he put in applications for substitute teaching nothing he worked at home depot where , as the most recently hired , he was laid off in a cutback he is currently living mostly in his year old car with his beloved dog and is surviving on lean social security benefits lean because , for the more than years he worked as a religious order teacher , the church did not pay into social security his benefits cover only the last years of his work since he left the order but he is n't complaining he sees life as a blessing and a chance to reach out talking with a depressed teenage girl in a park one day , he dug deep into his suitcase of his life 's treasures and gave her a copy of the edition of my understanding teenage depression book that i had signed and given to him all those years ago , encouraging her to take it home and share it and her feelings with her parents he found a bill on the sidewalk one day and invited another homeless man to enjoy a feast with him at a local fast food restaurant he is upbeat about his situation sure i 'd love to be working , teaching , again , he says i'm going to keep applying for teaching jobs , for any jobs but i feel blessed i 've made peace with myself even if nothing changes , i'm a happy man i'm living in an area i love i have my faithful , sweet dog i feel god is with me i enjoy the sunshine and the ocean air i can laugh at myself and at life i have no regrets and wonderful memories i loved my time as a monk i loved teaching and doing missionary work in new guinea and studying psychology was such a gift think of it me , this poor kid growing up in a tenement in new york what a great life i 've had ! sure , i'm broken in some ways i know now that depression is in my genes my father self medicated with alcohol i take medication life is n't always easy but i'm blessed i still love i still laugh i still have so much to give , however i find a way my goal is random kindness every day i live i marveled at his enthusiasm as we spoke on the phone i 've been plagued on occasion by bag lady fantasies and have wondered how i would cope if i were to lose everything and be looking at growing old on the margins of society perhaps those challenges are not the worst nightmares of old age after all maybe there is more to fear from what i see from some other peers pettiness , boredom , selfishness , bigotry , unkindness or complacency i do n't know if i would be as gracious as ralph ver ploeg if i found myself working the drive through at mcdonald 's or as kind and giving as joe if i found myself homeless but the lessons they can teach on savoring an unlikely opportunity , counting blessings , living with kindness and gratitude and love every day are priceless
