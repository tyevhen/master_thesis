i really dislike the word jog i am not a jogger i am a runner regardless , i'm thrilled to report that i 've jogged times this week , including today it 's been months since i partially tore my achilles , months since i last ran too long so on monday i consulted my local physical therapist , me , and decided it was time to get going i walked minutes and ran minute five times it went well i had no pain when i ran , um jogged i did have a tiny bit of soreness the next day , which was discouraging , but it resolved fairly quickly on wednesday and again today i repeated the process i ran , um jogged , a total of minutes wednesday and minutes today so far , so good , i think i'm anxious to see how my achilles responds tomorrow i'm cautiously optimistic that if i take my time and come back very , very slowly things will be okay but i 'd be lying if i said i was counting on it we 'll see physically , i'm getting better my mouth continues to heal i can actually chew without pain on the right side now that 's a step forward i 've also been going to the gym days a week for strengthening and cycling classes for the last month i'm getting some of my strength and endurance back not running combined with months of depression really set me back it 's nice to feel stronger again it 's also nice to be back among the working again i worked several short shifts this week , and i'm scheduled for at least hours per week through the end of the month if things continue to go well i 'll build up from there again , i'm taking it slow i do n't want to take on too much and risk a setback inching forward , one step at a time , that 's where i'm at
