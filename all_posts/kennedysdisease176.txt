fortunately , my wife and i are pretty healthy we hardly ever are down with a cold or the flu yet , it seems like when my wife does come down with something , she gets a full dose of it not easily shaken this last week she caught a cold or flu type bug that she cannot seem to shake i know she is not feeling well when she takes two or three naps during the day and goes to bed around at night i talked with both our families this week when i mentioned that cindy was not , they also asked if i had come down with the bug my reply a standard response of mine throughout the years is that men just come from stronger stock it takes more than a little cold or flu bug to get us down of course my reply always causes the caller if of the female gender to come back with some negative response they just cannot accept that men are healthier and tougher then they are i attribute this resistance to illness to the hunter genes that men are born with we fought the wars , killed the dinosaurs , and brought home the game for the women to prepare as hunters , we did not have the luxury of staying in bed if we were not well we had to hunt or the family would starve women , on the other hand , have always been gatherers they go out and pick things like berries or flowers if it was wintertime and nothing was growing , the women would just sit around the cave teepee , or hut and wait for the man to bring home something to eat talk about a great life by now , i hope you realize that i am just having a little fun today our years together have shown me that my wife is tougher than i am no matter how bad she feels , she still believes there is a need to take care of me prepare the meals , do the laundry , etc she knows that i will get by , but still feels some an obligation to perform certain duties around the house no matter how sick she is to further the point , i have never given birth nor do i want to , had to worry about female hormonal issues , or felt responsible for all the household duties even when she was working outside the home , she still felt it was necessary to prepare all the meals , as well as do the laundry or clean the house before going to bed at night my philosophy , on the other hand , is slightly different if there is no meal to throw into the microwave , call dominos if i become tired of pizza , drive to a mcdonalds , hardees , or subway the laundry needs to go to the cleaners once a week house cleaning is what cleaning services do for a living furthermore , i would only drive to one grocery store and buy what i like to eat whether it is on sale or not i would also eat all meals in front of the television i think you get the idea of course i would probably die within a few years because of my diet as you can tell , i love my wife dearly and she makes me a better person i hate to see her not feeling at any time that being said , i still feel that men come from stronger stock just kidding p s my wife , being the giving person she is , passed the bug along to me a couple of days ago it has to be a conspiracy , right ?
