my beautiful motorcycle is now gone i watched it drive away yesterday tough having a bike represented some sort of freedom , i think i did n't ride it often , but when i did , there was nothing more mindful i could have been doing i could daydream driving my car , but on my motorcycle , a squirrel could have killed me it was a great way to rid my mind of whatever was weighing me down i 'll miss that i 'll miss that freedom but it did n't make sense to hang onto something i was n't using , either i think the freedom of lightening my load will outweigh hanging onto unused toys and that brings me to today i 've spent the day preparing for a huge garage sale , which i'm having this friday and saturday as i mentioned here last week , i have too much stuff i moved into this house years ago , and i 've got stuff i have n't even unpacked yet ! lots of it ! obviously , if i have n't needed it in the last years , i do n't need it at all do n't you agree ? there is also a lot of mental baggage among that stuff , which i also do not need i'm looking forward to the freedom of being rid of the baggage and the stuff it 's been a long day of lifting , hauling , sorting and pricing my back is killing me ! this is the most exercise i 've had since the triathlon a few weeks ago once again , i 've hit a lull in my motivation i 've got so many things going on right now , i just do n't feel like going out for a run fortunately , following weight watchers is keeping me from suffering the consequences of my inactivity i miss racing , but i'm otherwise doing okay with my lull i know i 'll eventually get back out there i'm tired and ready to hit my bed now , so i 'll leave you with a quote i found during my hours of sorting today goodnight the will to succeed is important , but what 's even more important is the will to prepare bobby knight
