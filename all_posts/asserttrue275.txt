these days , most genes , in most sequenced genomes , are machine annotated with a minimum of human intervention , and as a result around of gene annotations are inaccurate , either as to functional assignment or as to reading frame it 's not hard to find serious errors in published genomes in the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc , for example , there 's a kilobase pair section of the genome that 's full of errors see below a view of two tuberculosis bacterial genomes showing a , base region denoted by pink of sequence similarity notice that even though the genomes are sequence identical in the region , the number , strand orientation , and sizes of genes differ the yellow gene in the top panel is identified by genemarks as secretion protein espk , while the yellow gene in the lower panel is identified as dna ligase liga and is much smaller and occurs on the opposite strand in this graphic , the same region is shown for two strains of m tuberculosis on top is m tuberculosis strain eai and on the bottom is m tuberculosis atcc to browse the genomes in your own browser , go to this link and click the pink run gevo analysis ! button when the panels appear , you 'll be able to click on individual genes to see what they supposedly are the yellow colored gene in the top panel is annotated as secretion protein espk , while the corresponding region in the bottom genome has two genes green and yellow on opposing strands of dna , with one gene in green given as a hypothetical protein and the other in yellow as dna ligase note that the entire region covered by the pink bands is identical from organism to organism in terms of dna sequence and yet one annotation program found genes while the other found sadly , this is not an unusual situation how can you tell which annotations are correct ? unfortunately , it takes some investigation consider the two yellow genes they ca n't both be correct as shown , because one is twice as long as the other and each is on a different strand of the dna ! and yet , if you obtain the dna sequence of each , and use it as a query sequence in a blast search , you 'll come up with good hits for each gene because there are other incorrectly identified genes in public databases , matching each query it turns out the secretion protein espk the large yellow gene in the top panel is correctly identified to determine this , i downloaded the fasta sequence for the large gene , plus the sequence for the same gene in the same location in the m canetti cipt genome identified as hypothetical alanine and proline rich protein , plus the same gene in m canetti cipt , with the idea of identifying the differences in the aligned dna sequences with respect to their codon positions when i had a script identify mutations by codon location , the number of differences at the three possible codon locations , were base changes base changes base changes this is exactly the pattern you would expect if the reading frame is correct base the wobble base tends to accumulate the majority of mutations , because changes in a codon 's third base usually result in no amino acid change due to the genetic code 's degeneracy base has a small amount of degeneracy and thus has the next highest number of mutations base has no degeneracy all changes to this base result in a different amino acid all changes are non synonymous , in other words i repeated this check using the so called dna ligase gene of mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc , but using sequence data from the bottom strand of dna , with bases' worth of additional ' end sequence data in order to cover the same amount of dna as the other sequences i got difference data of , , and for bases one , two , and three this verified that the active gene is actually on the bottom strand erdman is incorrectly annotated as a top strand dna ligase instead of two genes , erdman and erdman on two opposing strands , mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc should be shown as having a single large gene on the minus one strand the correct identification based on more than thirty e , identity hits in other strains is , in fact , secretion protein espk unfortunately , at least other tuberculosis strains , namely m tuberculosis guangz , plus strain ccdc and strain ccdc , also harbor an incorrect liga annotation , and mycobacterium is n't the only organism with a bogus liga problem micromonospora sp m also has a fake liga gene and i'm certain there are others bottom line , do n't believe everything you read in genome annotations the annotation may say dna ligase , but you could actually be looking at something else entirely
