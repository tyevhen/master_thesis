i ran miles today saturday mornings are my traditional long run time , and is the longest i 've done in this training cycle so far i'm assuming the milers will start within the next two weeks remember , i do n't know what 's on my schedule next week , as i'm only revealing one week at a time that strategy is still working for me it keeps my anticipative anxiety down and allows me to focus on one workout at a time so , i ran miles today next week , i do n't know yet ! despite revealing only one week at a time , i still had anxiety about today 's distance you see , after my miler last saturday , i felt so good i decided to hit a bucket of golf balls well , driving a golf ball requires a fair amount of twisting on my right knee long story short , my not so brilliant decision to hit a bucket on an already tired knee resulted in the aggravation of an old meniscus injury unfortunately , i 've been struggling with a bit of tendinitis in that knee as well i spent most of yesterday fretting about today 's miles i was n't sure how my knee would respond for most of my run today , i was really fretting my knee hurt it hurt with every step from miles i considered stopping , but i was more concerned about missing my miles than i was about my knee a bit of denial was also quite handy after miles or so , my knee remarkably started to feel better i do n't know why i'm not going to try to figure it out either i really do n't care ! all i know or care about is i was able to finish my run much more comfortably than i began it it 's several hours later now , and while my knee is sore , it is still less painful than it was when i began the day i'm sure the ice bath after my run helped i 'll continue icing it throughout the day , too who knows ? i may wake up tomorrow and not be able to walk , but for now , i'm encouraged i'm also really encouraged by my run eighteen miles is a long way physically and mentally despite my anxiety and pain , it actually went well i averaged around minutes per mile without trying i did n't look at my watch i fell into that pace comfortably to qualify for boston , i need to average per mile , so i'm pretty happy with today 's comfortable effort it means i'm right where i need to be right now that 's really encouraging now i'm sitting with my feet up , petting my dog , and watching football right where i need to be
