my son , dominic , is a little on the timid side he gets startled and frightened easily loud noises , like the horn at a basketball game , or a dunder storm scare him which i'm sure is typical for a two year old of course , i try to be compassionate and understanding i tell him it 's ok , you 're ok , it ca n't hurt you or i'm here and i 'll keep you safe or something like that i try to help him see that he does n't have to be afraid it 's hard to see him afraid but , at times , it 's humorous like when he screams and covers his mouth every time he sees a fly i guess i should n't have sang him the song , there was an old lady who swallowed a fly jesus tells us be not afraid ! i heard once that , in the bible , god tells us to fear not times one for each day of the year i'm not sure if that 's true i personally have not gone through the bible and counted if i had that much free time ! ! ! i imagine that our heavenly father has compassion for us when he sees us afraid of things maybe even sometimes we make him chuckle ah , my silly children , you do n't have to be afraid of things like the future , money , or global warming i am here i will keep you safe trust me you do n't understand now , but you will later
