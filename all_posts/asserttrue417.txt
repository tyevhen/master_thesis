in a previous post information theory in three minutes , i hinted at the power of information theory to gage redundancy in a language a fundamental finding of information theory is that when a language uses symbols in such a way that some symbols appear more often than others for example when vowels turn up more often than consonants , in english , it 's a tipoff to redundancy dna is a language with many hidden redundancies it 's a four letter language , with symbol choices of a , g , c , and t adenine , guanine , cytosine , and thymine , which means any given symbol should be able to convey two bits' worth of information , since log is two but it turns out , different organisms speak different dialects of this language some organisms use g and c twice as often as a and t , which if you do the math means each symbol is actually carrying a maximum of bits not bits of information consider how an alien visitor to earth might be able to use information theory to figure out terrestrial molecular biology the first thing an alien visitor might notice is that there are four symbols in dna a , g , c , t by analyzing the frequencies of various naturally occurring combinations of these letters , the alien would quickly determine that the natural word length of dna is three there are possible letter words that can be spelled with a letter alphabet so in theory , a letter word in dna should convey bits worth of information since to the th power is but an alien would look at many samples of earthly dna , from many creatures , and do a summation of f logf for every letter word used by a given creature 's dna where f is simply the frequency of usage of the letter combo from this sort of analysis , the alien would find that even though different codons letter words are , in fact , being used in earthly dna , in actuality the entropy per codon in some cases is as little as bits or at least , it approaches that value asymptotically since to the power is , and since proteins the predominant macromolecule in earthly biology are made of amino acids , a canny alien would surmise that there must be around different amino acids and earthly dna is a language for mapping letters words to those amino acids as it turns out , the genetic code does use letter words codons to specify amino acids , but there are amino acids not , with stop codons reserved for telling the cell 's protein making machinery this is the end of this protein stop here e coli codon usage the above chart shows the actual codon usage pattern for e coli note that all organisms use the same letter codes for the same amino acids , and most organisms use all possible codons , but the codons are used with vastly unequal frequencies if you look in the upper right corner of the above chart , for example , you 'll see that e coli uses ctg one of the six codons for leucine far more often than cta another codon for leucine one of the open questions in biology is why organisms favor certain synonymous codons over others a phenomenon called codon usage bias while dna 's bit codon bandwidth permits different codons , and while organisms do generally make use of all codons , the uneven usage pattern means fewer than bits of information are used per codon to get the actual codon entropy , all you have to do is take each usage frequency and calculate f logf for each codon , then sum if you do that for e coli , you get bits per codon as it happens , e coli actually does make use of almost all the available bandwidth of bits in its codons this turns out not to be true for all organisms , however
