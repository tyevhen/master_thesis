the oxymoronic title is only a loss leader yet the wheels of justice do move slow , though i think no more slowly than the wheels that have long come off the american system i met with our lawyer yesterday , and she told me that now the investigative portion of the case had been completed , similar to an indictment , and the case will be given to the prosecutorial branch , which has three days to review it before she will start pestering them on another note , i have been a friend and occasional doctor to a number of folks here , one of whom just died of lung cancer and whose wake we will be attending today at finnegan 's yes , in san miguel there are irish bars , german bars , even two sushi bars not to mention chocolate bars and bars to progress today i 'd like to thank brother chris for his encouraging message and daughter keturah for my first e birthday card hard to make jokes about cancer and the dead i was the lucky guy he went to to ask the inevitable question , how long do i got , doc ? munching my carrot , per usual i was overly optimistic for obvious psychological reasons , though i urged him to get his affairs in order the late jim bolen was a smart , generous man and a good friend i wish i 'd known longer he was a retired decorator from san francisco who overcame the stigma of his heterosexuality to succeed in a very competitive field and a non smoker yeah , death 's a lottery , all right and as my younger brother said , it seems to run in our family i fear us chaffins will certainly die of terminal uniqueness some day on a happier note , i still have the most hair of my brothers and have achieved somewhat of a backwards comb over , kind of like jack nicholson when he was younger not the horrible side parted variety this is what passe for achievement in my life ? off to the wake in mexico the dead are happiest , and they are still with us in fact , their special day comes up nov , when the mayans actually disinter their ancestors and clean their bones with brushes while having a picnic one of the things i like about mexico who 's gonna brush my bones when i am gone ? i think that might make a good country song thine , ce
