this is an addendum to frank 's story since writing skipping steps , the insights keep coming the meds slow me down so i can be more conscious of what s going on around me of course , by that i mean that i feel more as well as become more aware my first insight was patience , i don t have to get this over with as fast as i can i m more grounded in the present and i m not quite so controlled by the panic and terror of the past i can let other people be where they are at and join them there and then the big to me insight of don t skip steps since then i recently had another big insight softer i admit that you ve really got to be inside my skin to understand what that means to me , but i ll try to explain when i hold a pencil , or mouse , or almost anything , i grip it like someone is trying to take it away from me , or that my life depends on not letting it go , or that i ll lose control if i relax my grip when i type , i strike the keys hard to make sure they do their job , and harder after mistakes when i write , i feel like i m holding on to a plow being pulled by a wild horse , dragging me all over the place while i ve got to keep the rows straight this leaves my writing with a hard , coarse , jerky somewhat illegible appearance when i talk , i m desperate to make sure i m heard , making my voice louder and sharper than it needs to be oddly enough to me i ve been somewhat aware of this for a long time , but this is the first time i ve been able to feel how unpleasant it is to me in the doing , not just the result and this leads me to another insight i m always careful but it is a carefulness born of fear rather than love it arises from wombs eye fear that something terrible is going to happen to me if i don t watch out i want to remain careful , but in a positive way born of love for myself , and for what i m doing , along with love for those with whom my life transpires it s a carefulness that comes from within rather than from the outside i also have to add that this change doesn t happen cleanly , and instantly it is a slow process of being more conscious and noticing those things that sabotage my daily life , and applying conscious effort to change because the truth of the matter is that i ve had over years practice reinforcing these imprints , and my only advantage is that i feel what they do to me , and also feel what it s like to relax and go slower , softer , and consciously careful
