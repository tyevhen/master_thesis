so you all know about my long term battle with fatigue and my more recent concern with weight gain both depression symptoms significantly and negatively impact my running i am tremendously satisfied to report to you that i feel better i am less fatigued , and i 've lost some weight running is becoming fun again i began taking a new supplement a couple weeks ago , and i think i have the supplement to thank for these changes i already buy , use and love this company 's juice actually , i became a distributor in order to get the juice cheaper their juice totally solved my ibs irritable bowel syndrome they came out with this supplement several months ago , but being a skeptic despite my success with their juice i waited , and waited , and waited a million positive testimonials later , i finally took the plunge and decided to try it well , i'm no longer a skeptic i'm no longer a skeptic because the supplement seems to work i took the company 's 'vigor' test , and after two weeks on this supplement my 'vigor' score rose from a to an i ca n't believe the difference in how i feel i really ca n't after discussion with my psychiatrist let me repeat that after discussion with my psychiatrist i discontinued the anti fatigue med i 've felt so ambivalent about taking yes , the anti fatigue med is now gone even without that med , i feel more alert and energetic throughout my day i 've lost a couple pounds , and most importantly , my running has improved my training runs have been quicker and easier it 's all rather surprising to a skeptic i'm still waiting to see if the results will last i mean , i 've been battling this fatigue for years i 've been battling weight gain for at least years it will be a very pleasant surprise , and rather ironic , if the answer turns out to be a simple supplement i certainly hope to continue feeling the way i feel today it 's such a relief ! i 'll keep you updated on my progress
