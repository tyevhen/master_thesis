the other day i had to read an important document well , important might be too strong of an adjective , but it was something i did need to read carefully when i began the task my symptoms an old friend showed up my vision became blurry and my breathing was shallow i feared making a mistake , missing something important my thinking was very insecure then i began to spot that it is average to make mistakes and it takes courage to make them i reminded myself that it is not how we feel , but how we function that counts although my inclination was to not read this document , i had an obligation to do so , and i wasn t going to let uncomfortable symptoms get in the way i muddled through the task i didn t feel great , but i endorsed myself before recovery i would start a project like this feel anxious start over feel more anxious start over yet again and something that should take ten minutes would take four torturous hours now , though , i have skills learned through recovery training to deal with uncomfortable feelings and not let them run my life
