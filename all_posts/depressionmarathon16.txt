something cool happened today i was out shopping when i ran into a nurse from my local inpatient mental health unit even though i had just come from the gym and was wearing sweats and a baseball hat , she could hardly believe her eyes over and over again she said things like , you look so good ! wow , you look really good ! i laughed that was really nice to hear it was great to see someone , in my normal everyday life , who has never seen me outside an inpatient mental health unit i told her i just look like my normal self , but she , of course , has never seen me in my normal state she 's only seen me in the depths of despair and even though i'm always a little better when i leave an inpatient stint , i'm never back to normal so it was really satisfying to see her today it reinforced how well i'm feeling and doing other than that , i do n't have anything new to report i'm continuing to feel well and continuing to move forward my life has been free of drama and distress that 's always a good thing i really am just putting one foot in front of the other , working , exercising , and taking care of my daily routine life is good living with , rather than suffering from depression is a very nice place to be
