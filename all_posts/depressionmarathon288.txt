things are going well around here i 've been busy working , running , and taking care of jet work has been busier than usual , and so far i'm handling it okay , although i am a bit brain dead by the time i get home i definitely need my days off for my brain to recuperate on tuesday and thursday mornings i'm taking a weight training class , which just about knocks me flat every time ! i love it , though i'm definitely getting stronger unfortunately , i am scheduled to run my longer , speedier workouts on tuesdays and thursdays , as well thus far , i 've gotten the miles done , but i 've not been able to do any of the scheduled speed work i figure i 'll get back to speed training when my weight training class ends in weeks until then , i 'll just keep working on getting stronger other than missing some speed training , my running is going well my hip is holding up , and i'm putting in the miles i ran miles with a friend this past saturday it 's funny , as my friend and i noted on saturday , miles used to be such a big deal , and we often dreaded it that 's not the case anymore sure it 's still difficult , but i do n't dread the long runs and actually enjoy them most of the time now i guess that means i'm in decent shape work , running , jet , sleep that 's pretty much my life right now i'm not up to much otherwise by the time i take care of each of those things it 's time to start another day my mood is holding up well i'm glad i'm grateful it 's nice to feel good and to be able to handle whatever life throws my way but it 's also nice that life is n't tossing too many curveballs right now carry on , friends
