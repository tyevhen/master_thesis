i find it endlessly fascinating and perpetually frustrating that years after the introduction of the mac , all of us on windows , mac , gnome desktop , pretty much you name it are still suffering with the same tired ui metaphors in our desktop apps , some of which continue to serve us well , but others of which continue to serve us shoddily , day after frustrating day the ui metaphor that serves us most shoddily of all , arguably , is that of the modal dialog i'm starting to agree with aza raskin and others who have pointed out that modal dialogs dialogs that wo n't go away until you deal with them are basically evil they 're not dialogs at all they 're more in the nature of monologs a programmer has decided that you need to stop what you 're doing and focus on and make a decision regarding whatever it is the programmer has decided you need to focus on , before you can move on to something else this is done for your own good , of course god forbid you should defer a decision , or decide to go on working while making a decision some modal dialogs are necessary , of course after all , if it is a requirement that you enter a license string before using a product , then you damn well better enter the license string but most modal dialogs do n't have to be modal and should n't be , imho most modal dialogs are modal because it 's easier for the programmer if you work that way maintaining a consistent program state becomes messy and difficult if you have a bunch of dialog boxes open at once it 's a matter of convenience not your convenience the convenience of the people who designed the program modal is not how people like to work , though people tend to be extremely ad hoc in their working styles to match their thinking styles , tackling little bits of a job in random order , working a little on this , a little on that , until the job is done few people tackle a job by working it linearly , in rigid stepwise fashion , step by step until it 's done that 's why wizards are as ui devices go generally odious they do n't match the way people work in my day job , i have the displeasure of using adobe products intensively the three i use daily are acrobat professional , photoshop , and framemaker of these , the one i use the most and that causes the most heartburn is framemaker ironically , adobe has learned a great deal about good ui design over the years , but they 've applied the knowledge haphazardly photoshop , in particular , has become much less modal as has framemaker you can work ad hoc now through a combination of always open dialogs palette panels , always visible contextual toolbar buttons , and hotkey combos however , image filters plug ins are still modal you work with one effect at a time and ca n't leave them open while jumping back and forth between them , much less chain them ironically , adobe after effects does let you work with filters that way pipelining them playing with multiple filter settings simultaneously , in non modal fashion you 'd think adobe would apply what it has learned from after effects to photoshop , for the benefit of the much larger photoshop audience but no with framemaker , palette style operations are thankfully much more the norm now , but there are still far too many modal dialogs , and the ones that are most intrusive for me happen at the worst time when i am opening a file it so happens that i work with a lot of files that have missing graphics graphics that are on someone else 's machine and or unresolved cross references it 's in the nature of what i do that i'm always encountering such files , which means that when i open them , i always have to dismiss dialogs the first dialog asks me to locate missing graphics after i dismiss that dialog , i'm confronted with the following dialog monolog once i dismiss this monolog , i am confronted with yet another warning my question to adobe is , why do i have to dismiss dialogs in order to open a file ? and go through the same process every day , every time i open the same file ? why ca n't you just put this information in a status bar message at the bottom of the window , or flash it in a tooltip at the appropriate time when i hover over a missing graphic , or at least put a checkbox on these dialogs that says do n't show me this again ? better yet , give me a global config setting somewhere that turns off all informational alerts see the little 'i' icon in the box ? and converts whatever those alerts monologs were going to tell me into log messages that i can look at whenever i want ? why put a modal dialog in my face and make me dismiss it times a day ? but then , maybe i ask for too much after all , it 's only been years now these things take time to change
