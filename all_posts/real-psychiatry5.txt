in ireland , they say it takes just alcoholics to keep a small bar running in a country town i ran into this film last week and was impressed enough to write this post about it it is an award winning short film about four people in a pub in rural ireland and events that transpired on a certain day given the availability and brevity of the film , i encourage anyone interested to view the video before reading this post you can go to any number of saturday night live skits and see alcoholics ridiculed this film takes the problem more seriously what you see will depend on your experience observing and interacting with people who have an alcohol problem to set the scene , the film begins with the quote posted at the top of this page we see two middle aged men standing outside a pub waiting for it to open the owner shows up they all enter and the two men who were waiting commence drinking pints of guinness over the duration of the time lapse in the film they each drink pints of guinness the first two in what seems fairly rapid succession after they put down about two pints a young woman enters , asks them about the availability of wine after getting their recommendations she proceeds to drink the first glass rapidly over the time lapsed in the film she drinks a total of ml bottles the pub owner and the two men in the bar seem impressed with her ability to drink , but they are also impressed with her ability as a ranconteur she tells a fable about getting rid of all motor transport and lining people up against the wall and shooting them she moves on to describe severe physical abuse by her husband and shows lacerations on her wrists where she was tied up on the garage floor she tells them what her husband was saying to her when he became abusive and does not miss a beat she sarcastically dismisses her rant by saying i should have seen it coming at that point she says good bye and the pub owner tells her what the opening time for the pub is every day she thanks him for the information and walks out the men are clearly impressed with her and one of them longingly touches the stool where she was sitting at the level of entertainment , i can see why this is an award winning short the writing and acting are good the woman in the scene , actress ruth bradley is a compelling screen presence she plays this role perfectly it is a plausible scene from any bar irish or american from the standpoint of an addiction psychiatrist what is wrong with this picture ? the alcohol consumed per unit time is a red flag the cdc defines binge drinking as probably occurring if a woman consumes or more drinks or a man consumes or more in hours the time span of this film may be subject to debate but i counted pints of guinness per man or standard drinks and ml wine ml bottles or standard drinks for the woman it is clear from the depiction by the actors that they are drinking these beverages at times like water in bars or pubs bad things tend to happen when the patrons are binge drinking binge drinking alone whether it is associated with a diagnosis of alcohol use problems has associated mortality and morbidity per the cdc site there is a high tolerance for unusual behavior in the pub one of the men leaves and his behavior is discussed among the remaining people in another scene marking the sixth pint he becomes irate with his associate and that behavior is translated as an acknowledgement that he does want another pint the woman had two discrete rants about motor vehicles and the violence she has sustained by her husband and immediately resumes a normal even joking manner the men are intensely interested in this woman , she breaks up their routine , is attractive to them and is charismatic their response to her description of the violence she has sustained and even the presentation of her wrist lacerations is definitely muted no one is interested in the violence or her newly acquired wounds , everyone is interested in moving on as soon as possible the dynamic that jumps out at me whether i am listening to heavy drinkers talk about relationships or observing them first hand in bars is grandiosity grandiosity can be a feature of mood disorders or narcissism one theory of grandiosity in narcissism is that there is an inadequate mental representation of affirming objects representing attributes or real relationships in the environment if people with those attributes are absent or the people present have an inadequate positive affiliation with the person in question they can form their own representations that leads to grandiosity and narcissism as an amplification of a deficient process with more realistic balances in alcoholism this can occur as a reaction to the hopelessness of the addiction and its sequelae as an example , a bar full of middle aged men with alcoholic liver disease betting on who is going to die first sometimes it occurs on a larger scale the family that supports their father 's grandiose statements about drinking himself to death during a hospitalization for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy from alcoholic cirrhosis the person involved comes across as though they are indestructible but at a deeper level they cannot reconcile the severity of their illness and their inability to stop drinking that is what i think the female character brings to this scene she is clearly in an abusive marriage that she fled earlier the same day that she comes into the pub she does not appear to be traumatized at all until she demonstrates the injuries and even then she is loudly mocking her husband and eventually herself i should have seen it coming ! the men seem transfixed on this story unable to challenge it or accept the reality of her status as an abused wife i saw one comment posted on the youtube site from a person who watched this film on an airline flight he was left thinking about the lives of the people in the film and what happened to them that is natural enough and something i wondered when i encountered a heavily intoxicated young woman in boston and tried to help her to me it is always a lesson in the dynamics of heavy alcohol use there is an element of intoxication involved , but there is more than that driving a lot of the interpersonal behaviors and what you see happening in a pub or bar defensive behavior about the inability to stop can be part of that george dawson , md , dfapa
