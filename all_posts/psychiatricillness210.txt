i have been feeling a bit lonely recently but today , my ex bought my cat around to live , i asked if i could have her back he has had her since we split up but today i got her back to live with me i am not really suppose to have pets in my flat as iam renting but i do n't care as i have someone even if they are feline to talk to , play with and cuddle she has only been here a few hours but she is starting to make her self at home already and she has been purring and having a good fuss too i am trying to work out if she remembers me , i moved out months ago but she is still responding to me calling her and is quite happy with me picking her up
