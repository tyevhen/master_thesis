bacteria belonging to the pseudomonas family are a perennial favorite among bacteriology instructors and students because of the curious ability of some of its members to produce pigments that fluoresce under an ultraviolet light if you 're unlucky enough to get an infected cut on the arm while working in the garden , it 's possible your cut will fluoresce under a black light that 's enough of a diagnosis to pronounce the infectious agent fluorescent colonies of pseudomonas silby and levy , investigating the adaptation of the bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens to soil , uncovered the existence of at least ten antisense genes in p fluorescens they went on to demonstrate experimentally that one of the genes , cosa , produces not just antisense rna but an associated protein tellingly , silby and levy commented these findings suggest that current genome annotations provide an incomplete view of the genetic potential of a given organism the implication is that additional antitranscriptome genes remain to be found , not only in pseudomonas but in other organisms there 's a good reason they have n't been found yet overlapping genes are automatically rejected by many of the annotation programs that are commonly used to find , identify , and label genes in genome sequences the oft used freeware glimmer program allows you to set the overlap rejection threshold many yet to be discovered antisense genes have been deliberately and systematically obscured in published genomes still , once in a while such genes do surface for example , in pseudomonas stutzeri a , we find a pair of overlapping genes at an offset of on the chromosome see illustration below overapping genes in pseudomonas stutzeri the top gene is annotated merely as a hypothetical protein , while the underlying gene on the opposite strand is an aspartyl trna synthetase one 's normal inclination is to dismiss a hypothetical protein as being unimportant , but this may not be wise twenty percent or more of bacterial genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins common sense says they ca n't all be unimportant in fact , in transcriptome analysis of pseudomonas syringae identifies new genes , noncoding rnas , and antisense activity by filiatrault et al , researchers found that out of , protein genes in p syringae annotated as hypothetical proteins were expressed under iron limited conditions many probably most genes annotated as hypothetical protein are quite real and should probably be re annotated as puf protein of unknown function in this case , the hypothetical protein shown in yellow above turns up medium strength protein blast hits with other hypothetical proteins from other organisms , including a hit with an e value of in parasutterella excrementihominis yit and a comparable hit on a predicted phosphatase phosphohexomutase in rothia mucilaginosa dy in this particular case , the hypothetical protein gene lacks a strong upstream shine dalgarno sequence a sequence preceding many genes that helps bind a ribosome to the mrna but so too does the gene on the opposite strand this is not unusual the sd sequence is not required for translation and in fact , in about half of bacterial species , a shine dalgarno sequence is associated with fewer than of genes hence , the jury 's out on whether the antigene is expressed it could be that no protein is made from the top strand but the gene provides rna mediated control of the gene on the bottom strand we wo n't know for sure until someone investigates in pseudomonas aeruginosa strain padk cf , we find another instance of a bidirectional overlapping gene pair see graphic below in this case , the gene on the top strand cf encodes the large subunit of an isopropylmalate isomerase the gene on the bottom strand cf , shown in yellow is annotated as flp pilus assembly protein tadg it could very well be a misannotated non gene however , five genes away is fimv cf , another pilus assembly motility protein moreover , the gene marked tadg has a strong upstream sd sequence containing the canonical ggagg motif the gene above it has a weaker ggaaa motif p aeruginosa has an overlap of an isopropylmalate isomerase gene and a gene for a motility protein the latter is shown in yellow in previous posts , i 've mentioned and shown data for the fact that in the overwhelming majority of protein encoding genes across every kind of genome , the first base of a codon tends to be purine rich one check of whether a bidi overlap gene is real or not ought to be that the first codon base should be purine rich in both reading directions this is , in fact , the case for the examples shown above the aspartyl trna synthetase gene for p stutzeri has ag st base , purine content averaging , whereas its bidirectional partner gene hypothetical protein has ag the isopropylmalate isomerase of p aeruginosa has ag , while its antisymmetric partner tadg has ag if you enjoyed this post , please give the url to your biogeek friends thanks !
