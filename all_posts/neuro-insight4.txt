touched by an angel during a neuroptimal session this is a genuine story that happened in my private practice neuro insight only last april how does the story go ? well , let me start the story where it began in december i received a call for help with neuroptimal neurofeedback what else ? from a year old lady who hadn t been able to sleep well since as she had been telling me , without any significant reason let me tell you , as an experienced coach and neuroptimal trainer , i was sure that something must have happened in that year , and , i also knew that the lady would tell me within sessions she appeared to be a very hard working person with lots of interests in doing things , and in other people she is the kind of person who would take everyones crap on her shoulders including her own , trying to solve and help in the same order she also told me she was oversensitive to smell , sounds and so on during four weeks she took four sessions , and , after the fourth sessions she reported she noticed she could sleep hours without waking in between for her , that was an major breaktrough after the th session , she walked in happily because she had been able to say no to a questions that came from work she said no to working late for a collegue who was ill during her th neuroptimal session she started to cry , it just happened she couldn t stop i handed her tissues , without asking or saying anything , just allowing this to happen you see , as a neuroptimal trainer i just know that things will be emerging , and , this was definitely happening at that particular moment after the session the lady asked me if she could share what had happened so she did you see , hannie , today , exactly at this hour , it has been years ago since my brother passed away in an accident and , i never realized it , but now i see that i have been feeling that i was robbed from my brother that day i never had the chance to say goodbye to him , and i miss him immensely during the session i could smell his presence , i could feel his touch and i heard him saying that he is alright , and that this is the time for me to let go my feelings of guilt and go on with my life , exploring my gift of being a sensitive person i was touched by an angel , who is my brother thank you for that , as if i hadn t had these neuroptimal sessions with you , i am sure this would never , ever have happened hannie ruinen hannie ruinen neuroptimal com info neuro insight eu www neuro insight eu
