imagine trying to concentrate while trucks and trains and cars are whizzing by , make noise and creating tumult well that is going on in the brain of those who belong to that not so exclusive class of adders where do all those trucks and cars come from ? those are the imprints traumatic memories are shooting up noisy information from below and they never stop , trying to tell the higher brain about so many dangers that the person no longer knows where to turn he cannot select out a single task to focus on because of all those inputs trains , trucks and cars whizzing around creating tumult the brain has to focus on so many inputs , so much incoming information that it cannot concentrate on one thing alone focus means to eliminate extraneous input from outside and inside and select one single topic how can anyone do that when the input is so strong and intruding ? it has to be intruding because it includes life saving information something we must pay attention to it tells us there are things inside memories that need to be addressed and resolved and the add person must give priority to memory , for that is lifesaving that imprint is saying , pay attention to me and because of that , what do we get ? attention deficit disorder it is signaling to every part of the higher brain i am important and can help you live it is not attention deficit it is hyper attention disorder having to pay attention to many other things remember it is a lifesaving fact the brain is performing correctly with add , not something to be overcome and done away with it is warning us hence the need to be hyperactive the imprints over activate and keep the person going and going , running from the terror , while the information is pushing , seeking higher neuronal ground it is carrying out its function of trying to inform us of the imprint so activation blocks and suppresses through hyperactivity keeps us from focusing completely on what lies inside the imprint is so strong and life endangering that we have to keep running away our minds go everywhere at once what the going and doing all of the time does is help drain some of the activation , lower the level of input , and help us function a bit better isn t that what pills like prozac do ? to lower the reactions , slow the hyperactivity and help us slow down and relax one of the reasons that pills are weak in the face of all this is that there is sometimes impairment of the neo cortex which should work well to repress , but doesn t the reason there is a failure to repress is that the primal terror chews up so much of the painkilling supplies and never allows it to achieve normal levels what primal therapy does is lower reactivity so that the cortex is not overwhelmed by input and can begin to do its job of integration and resolution the job it was made for this is the particularly true of those whose imprint involves massive terror anxiety and therefore exceptionally strong input that input scatters the organic sense of the brain and it seems like it is in pieces , having lost its cohesion and it s cohesion that keeps the train on the right track in terms of how it functions and with the add individuals there is often a lack of cohesive , overall , gestalt thinking so easily distracted , so easily disconcerted , so often losing the train of thought as i said before , when you get on the wrong train every stop you make will be the wrong one it is not a matter of correcting the destination , it involves redoing the beginning of the trip getting on the right train and that right train is always the right one , the normal one , the one that instinctively knows the right track it is the track of feeling i have treated many adders one is now in a doctor s program who was unable to finish high school this is multiplied by many patients when we remove the terror and pain over months and years we also extirpate the neurotic drive they suffer from end of distraction and lack of focus end of add
