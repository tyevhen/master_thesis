there 's an interesting article in the atlantic about how we now coddle college students by avoiding certain ideas and even certain words that might be offensive to someone the article talks about certain words ideas being 'microagressions' and that professors offer 'trigger warnings , ' if course material might remind people of past traumas in the coddling of the american mind , greg lukianoff and johnathan haidt write , last december , jeannie suk wrote in an online article for the new yorker about law students asking her fellow professors at harvard not to teach rape law or , in one case , even use the word violate as in that violates the law lest it cause students distress wait , so we think our top lawyers should not be educated about rape law ? who will prosecute or defend the rapists ? the list of what might be offensive is long and sometimes a bit oblique for me , and i have to say , i wonder about first amendment rights to free speech or any speech , when the topics come down to things such as this during the school year , for instance , the deans and department chairs at the university of california system schools were presented by administrators at faculty leader training sessions with examples of microaggressions the list of offensive statements included america is the land of opportunity and i believe the most qualified person should get the job america may or may not be the land of opportunity , but if a college professor truly believes that , he ca n't say it ? and beware , possible micro agression in the rest of the sentence , i'm totally lost as to what is wrong with expressing the personal belief that the most qualified person should get the job the authors write the press has typically described these developments as a resurgence of political correctness that s partly right , although there are important differences between what s happening now and what happened in the s and s that movement sought to restrict speech specifically hate speech aimed at marginalized groups , but it also challenged the literary , philosophical , and historical canon , seeking to widen it by including more diverse perspectives the current movement is largely about emotional well being more than the last , it presumes an extraordinary fragility of the collegiate psyche , and therefore elevates the goal of protecting students from psychological harm the ultimate aim , it seems , is to turn campuses into safe spaces where young adults are shielded from words and ideas that make some uncomfortable and more than the last , this movement seeks to punish anyone who interferes with that aim , even accidentally you might call this impulse vindictive protectiveness it is creating a culture in which everyone must think twice before speaking up , lest they face charges of insensitivity , aggression , or worse today , what we call the socratic method is a way of teaching that fosters critical thinking , in part by encouraging students to question their own unexamined beliefs , as well as the received wisdom of those around them such questioning sometimes leads to discomfort , and even to anger , on the way to understanding but vindictive protectiveness teaches students to think in a very different way it prepares them poorly for professional life , which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong the harm may be more immediate , too a campus culture devoted to policing speech and punishing speakers is likely to engender patterns of thought that are surprisingly similar to those long identified by cognitive behavioral therapists as causes of depression and anxiety the new protectiveness may be teaching students to think pathologically the authors contend that over time , parents have become more concerned with safety , from bullying which might contribute to mass murders , to peanut butter bans , to unsafe playground equipment children have learned that the world is an unsafe place and adults will provide protection read the article , because the examples go on and on , one includes a hearing against a young man who was disciplined for reading a book about the klan specifically about how a college protested the ku klux klan because the picture on the cover offended another student the authors go on to note because there is a broad ban in academic circles on blaming the victim , it is generally considered unacceptable to question the reasonableness let alone the sincerity of someone s emotional state , particularly if those emotions are linked to one s group identity the thin argument i m offended becomes an unbeatable trump card furthermore , they contend that avoiding discussion of certain topics is not helpful to people with problems and may create pathology in those without them however , there is a deeper problem with trigger warnings according to the most basic tenets of psychology , the very idea of helping people with anxiety disorders avoid the things they fear is misguided a person who is trapped in an elevator during a power outage may panic and think she is going to die that frightening experience can change neural connections in her amygdala , leading to an elevator phobia if you want this woman to retain her fear for life , you should help her avoid elevators but if you want to help her return to normalcy , you should take your cues from ivan pavlov and guide her through a process known as exposure therapy you might start by asking the woman to merely look at an elevator from a distance standing in a building lobby , perhaps until her apprehension begins to subside if nothing bad happens while she s standing in the lobby if the fear is not reinforced then she will begin to learn a new association elevators are not dangerous this reduction in fear during exposure is called habituation then , on subsequent days , you might ask her to get closer , and on later days to push the call button , and eventually to step in and go up one floor this is how the amygdala can get rewired again to associate a previously feared situation with safety or normalcy students who call for trigger warnings may be correct that some of their peers are harboring memories of trauma that could be reactivated by course readings but they are wrong to try to prevent such reactivations students with ptsd should of course get treatment , but they should not try to avoid normal life , with its many opportunities for habituation classroom discussions are safe places to be exposed to incidental reminders of trauma such as the word violate a discussion of violence is unlikely to be followed by actual violence , so it is a good way to help students change the associations that are causing them discomfort and they d better get their habituation done in college , because the world beyond college will be far less willing to accommodate requests for trigger warnings and opt outs the expansive use of trigger warnings may also foster unhealthy mental habits in the vastly larger group of students who do not suffer from ptsd or other anxiety disorders people acquire their fears not just from their own past experiences , but from social learning as well if everyone around you acts as though something is dangerous elevators , certain neighborhoods , novels depicting racism then you are at risk of acquiring that fear too the psychiatrist sarah roff pointed this out last year in an online article for the chronicle of higher education one of my biggest concerns about trigger warnings , roff wrote , is that they will apply not just to those who have experienced trauma , but to all students , creating an atmosphere in which they are encouraged to believe that there is something dangerous or damaging about discussing difficult aspects of our history the authors conclude , for a number of reasons , that shielding students from potentially controversial or upsetting words and ideas is wrong it leaves them too thin skinned and it creates an intellectual environment of homogeneity what 's the answer ? the authors conclude that college students should all be taught cognitive behavioral therapy to help them deal with uncomfortable ideas the whole article was great food for thought , although the idea that we are stifling intellectual innovation and exploration for fear of using a word that might offend someone , well it makes me kind of uncomfortable
