if you are a regular visitor here , perhaps you 've noticed i 've had less to say recently i 've been struggling with writing , and i feel bad about that i'm still soooo tired ca n't seem to sleep enough it 's very frustrating , and it 's negatively impacting the rest of my life one of the areas this sleepiness seems to have most affected is writing i either have n't wanted to write , or when i 've wanted to , i have n't had anything to say i apologize for that i do feel an obligation to keep up with these pages for those of you who visit whether it 's knowledge , fun or curiosity that keeps you coming back , i want to keep up i am still here i'm here battling the sometimes subtle symptoms of this illness , yet my mood is still okay i guess that 's one thing for which to be grateful thanks for visiting
