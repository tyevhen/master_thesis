it 's after midnight , so technically earth day is over but i just had to give you this one last environmental gem so i went to the campus gym tonight , and i notice water coolers all over the place on each water cooler is a sign that says to the best of my memory disposable water bottles kill the earth ! please use non disposable water bottles ! this water cooler is here so that you can refill your non disposable water bottle ! as you know from my previous post , i am all for saving mama earth but this tactic is a little ridiculous considering a there are already a plethora of permanent water fountains in the campus gym b in addition to permanent water fountains and now temporary water coolers , a second plethora of vending machines selling disposable bottled water litter the campus gym c what if somebody wants to refill their gasp disposable water bottle using the water coolers ? will a environmental hall monitor rebuke them ? will they make the thirsty person throw away their disposable water bottle in order to buy a non disposable one ? or will they simply point the thirsty student in the direction of the water fountain ?
