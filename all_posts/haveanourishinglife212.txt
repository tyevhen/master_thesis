i struggle with body bashing for years , i believed that i was fat and ugly and not good enough to be loved i hated my body i hated having curves , a squishy tummy , and a round face every time i looked in the mirror , i found something that was wrong with the way i looked i would analyze every square inch of my body and take stock of all the imperfections from head to toe , i criticized my appearance my hair was too frizzy my collar bones didn t protrude enough my shoulders were too broad my stomach was too flabby my butt wasn t the right shape my thighs shouldn t rub together my knees bent inward instead of out yada , yada , yada my expectations were ridiculous in my head , in front of the mirror , my objectives are important on paper , they seem irrelevant and reading it kind of makes me laugh why do i believe that these imperfections are making me unhappy ? what is really making me unhappy is the belief that i have to look a certain way it is perfectly perfect for me to be the size and shape that i am god created me this way every time i find myself talking negatively or body bashing , i try to thank god for the gift of my body for example , if i am lamenting over the lack of definition in my arms , i thank god for giving me two healthy functioning arms with my arms , i can knit , play piano , draw a picture , give a hug , hold a baby , cook a delicious meal , and much more if i am sulking about the softness of my tummy , i thank god that my belly will hopefully ! one day carry a new life for nine months what an incredible miracle that would be ! the same goes for my chest to one day be able to nourish a newborn child would be an amazing experience when i turn my complaining into gratitude , i immediately start to feel better trying to change my appearance to meet society s standards will not make me happy it is a never ending road of lies i was created the way i am for a unique purpose and i thank god for the gift of my body which enables me to fulfill my purpose the next time you find yourself body bashing in front of a mirror , walk away the next time you come back to the mirror , thank god for just one thing about your body taking these small steps will help you realize your value loving yourself for the way you are is the only way you will be truly happy about the way you look until next time , take care you !
