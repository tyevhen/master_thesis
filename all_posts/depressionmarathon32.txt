i saw my therapist yesterday when she offered to drive me directly to the hospital , herself , i knew she meant business but that 's what i needed depression had muddled my thinking so completely , there was no way i could have , or would have , made such a decision on my own and my thoughts were as dark as they 'd ever been , so she was right to be concerned i guess i was concerned on some intellectual level , but mostly i did n't care i could n't muster the energy to care what was happening to me anymore , and my thinking was leading me down a very dark road with a very abrupt end as much as i hate it , i guess i need to be here right now unfortunately , tms is an outpatient procedure , so i'm unable to continue my tms treatments while hospitalized but all is not lost there is a potential light at the end of the tunnel mayo clinic is in the midst of a research study involving ketamine the inpatient doctor recommended it , and i qualified to participate i signed the consent forms today i will be getting ketamine infusions , up to seven of them if the results warrant , beginning next week i do have a little hope the ketamine will work from what i 've read , previous small studies have been promising and if it works , it 's supposed to take effect quickly that would be a great result ! i hope i am one of the people who responds well to it any relief will be greatly appreciated at this point unfortunately , it looks like i'm going to be here awhile i already desperately miss jet and being able to go outside of course , i 'd much rather be home , but home probably is n't the safest option right now i'm not looking forward to being an inpatient for the long , holiday weekend ahead bad timing i have to wait until tuesday to begin the ketamine treatment i 'll let you know how it goes
