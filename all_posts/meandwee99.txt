dear little n , i'm so late with your month letter booo i was away that day i was off in florida having me time i flew down and stayed with a friend and had a nice time just being in the warm sunshine it was so heavenly and much needed ! i missed you so much though i knew you were having fun with daddy so i did n't worry but i still missed our snuggles the biggest milestone happened for you this past month ! you learned to walk and it was so exciting it happened sort of suddenly you would just take a step or two and fall and you did that for a few days here and there then , you just started to go across the room and that was it i'm so proud ! you 've started to bring me things that you are interested in it 's so sweet you 've also started pointing at everything and grunting to communicate what you want you are very clear in your intentions ! paige never did this , so i'm thrilled for you that communication is not something you will struggle with and i'm glad i do n't have to worry right now , you 're favorite game is when i say i'm gonna get choo ! and i wiggle my fingers and pretend to chase you you ca n't run yet , but you get the biggest grin and try to waddle away as fast as you can you stick your chest and neck right out as you try to scurry away i let you get a way a little while and then i finally tickle you as you scream in delight we 'll do that over and over again because i love to see you laugh and because you seem to love the game so much ! you 've started loving to go outside now that you can walk it 's pretty wet , muddy and snowy here so you 've been walking around the driveway and street we live on a dead end traffic less street exploring the puddles sitting in them and touching the rocks remind me that i need to invest in some rain pants for you sitting in winter puddles gets cold all in all it 's been a huge milestone month for you , buddy seeing the joy on your face as you make new discoveries has been a priceless treat i'm so honored that i 've been able to witness so many special moments for you so far i love you more than the world my little bear and i'm ever so proud of you love you always , mama save
