i got up early thinking i would shovel my driveway , make it to a class at the gym , and then drive to work minutes away this is what i encountered instead i had to push my way out the door this is the doorway into my driveway it sits at least inches above my driveway this is looking out my door toward my garage those drifts are about to feet high needless to say , i did n't make it out of my driveway , as i do n't own a snow blower , and i could n't fathom shoveling this yet , especially since it is still snowing still snowing hard fun , fun , fun !
