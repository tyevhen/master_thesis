welcome to week two of my diary series , my week as i am writing them started on saturday th march if you re not sure what this is all about then see my welcome to the diary series here blogging and life in general unfortunately , the first blog event i was due to go to on thursday was postponed for three weeks however , i am still going to the derby bloggers brunch on saturday th and i am really looking forward to that , if not also a tad nervous ! my social media accounts are still growing although my reach on facebook is down i m not sure people realise just how much it helps when they like and or comment on my status updates i have given up asking them too though as i don t want to annoy people ! i guess my focus for the blog has already changed in the sense that the numbers do matter to me i know they shouldn t but they do ! i can t help but feel joyful when a post does well knowing people are reading makes it so worthwhile i believe the only photos taken this week were selfies when i got my hair cut , such as the one above ! i also took some in a changing room of my new primark skirt and t shirt , the bon jovi one which if you read my primark haul you will know i am very excited about ! see those pics and a before haircut selfie later in the post speaking of my new hair , i go to nottingham to get it done to icon hair and beauty in the cornerhouse i see damian who is fab people ask why i go as far as nottingham i guess initially it was part of my therapy and facing my fears , there are plenty to face ! firstly , it is on the top floor and there are four i think escalators to go up , then there is the drive to nottingham see my last post on that anxiety here and the fear of going into a modern salon at all , i used to feel completely inadequate and judged in places like that , thankfully now i worry a lot less about it i first met damian about two years ago , these two years have been quite a journey for me and he understands that i guess hairdressers are easy to talk to ! those who know me will remember i had my hair cut in a bob with a fringe for years and years and years it was my comfort haircut ! changing my hair has been part of my change in many ways so , when i asked him this week to cut it short again he refused and said i m not giving the new kelly the old kelly s haircut he was so right ! he also said he loved my outfit and that it was the best he had ever seen me styled , thank you damian my journey may already be two years in but it s just the tip of the iceberg so stay with me to see how i progress over the next year maybe my hair will be pink by then ! health tuesday was a challenge anxiety wise as i have said after that i spent the rest of the week feeling more fatigued and a little more teary than normal i think it s the anxiety hangover as i refer to it i also suffered with a foggy and giddy head for most of wednesday and thursday it s one of the more uncomfortable symptoms of my cfs although not painful it s disorientating , affects my concentration and limits what i can do on thursday i had my gym based physio , we meet for half an hour every three weeks and i learn new exercises and see how much i can manage , it s not a solid half an hour though as we take breaks i will do a post all about these sessions another time i m still affected by the stressful situation i can t talk about this week too and it disrupts my sleep so physically not great for the latter part of the week but on the whole i have felt ok emotionally , just a few wobbles my cfs is so frustrating and trying to treat it is the most frustrating part of all when i have a more difficult week i m left thinking is it the stress and anxiety and if so how do i stop that ? alternatively , is it the diet changes or the exercise ? i hope not as i am doing those to try and improve things but it all guess work on my part i know on tuesday i just felt to get through my drive home i needed a sugar hit and so succumbed to a piece of tiffin cake , it may not help in the long run but it helped in the short term ! diet for each day , i have listed my breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks and cheats some cheats might not seem too bad , if you read my diet rules you will understand why they are cheats you ll notice repetition as i make everything from scratch so always try and make extra for another day saturday b granola and yogurt recipe here l hard boiled eggs , salad and pumpkin seeds d carvery oops we ate out and i was determined to enjoy it , i avoided pudding though s none c the carvery and some lime cordial in a lime and soda sunday b porridge with half a banana , peanut butter and coconut oil l hard boiled eggs and stir fry veg d ham carved from a gammon joint we boiled , salad and new potatoes s none c the half banana see my diet rules here monday b hard boiled eggs l cajun chicken strips , swede fries , salad and natural yogurt d pork steak , grilled veg leek , courgettes and peppers and sweet potato wedges s none c none tuesday b green smoothie recipe here l cajun chicken strips with salad , pumpkin seeds , hazelnuts and natural yogurt d ham as above with mash potatoes , broccoli , leeks and carrots s a slice of tiffin cake oooops c the tiffin embarrassed face wednesday b porridge with half a banana , almond butter and coconut oil l cajun chicken strips , swede fries and green beans , broccoli and courgette in a tomato sauce d chicken fajitas the filling not the wraps , made with my own spice mix , guacamole , cheese and yogurt s none c none thursday b hard boiled eggs l chilli and a jacket potato d steak , new potatoes and green beans , broccoli and courgette in a tomato sauce s mini babybel and a handful of cashew nuts c the chilli wasn t homemade oops friday b porridge with half a banana , almond butter and coconut oil l fajita chicken and green beans , broccoli and courgette in a tomato sauce d a prawn curry and a potato and chick pea curry with quinoa s sweet potato wedges and hummus recipe from deliciously ella see pic below c half a banana exercise i am following an exercise plan my friend sent me , you pick one cardio , one leg , one arm and one core exercise and do a minute of each i decided to start with seconds of each and up this by more seconds each week or two this week due to other exercising i didn t manage any of these plus , my usual mum activities of course ! saturday walked around ikea that counts ! ! sunday yoga with the kids monday rest day tuesday walked around nottingham mainly shops ! wednesday walked to and twice around our local park whilst the kids lapped me on their bikes thursday physio friday short walk i will try and start calculating the distance i walk and tell you how long it takes me goals for next week no tiffin cake type diet cheats get back to the exercise plan publish blog posts enjoy my first blogging event take more pictures , especially food ones remember to come back for next week s diary and subscribe to my blog by email if you enjoy my posts please thank you kelly x suggested posts week one diary my journey to healthy eating my exercise history or lack of facing my fashion fears
