sometimes i feel so not like myself i think that i must have lost myself somewhere in the shuffle and i try to find it back by doing what i think might return me to a normal state of myself but then i think , is this still myself , even when i am not myself if i am not myself , than who am i ? and then i think , am i thinking too much ? the last sentence is probably the truest of true i think too much or do i ?
