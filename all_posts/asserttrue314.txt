in who owns the future ? simon schuster , , virtual reality pioneer and futurist jaron lanier succeeds in doing what no economist so far has been able to do , which is to provide a credible explanation for the perverse persistence of the current economic downturn while also outlining a possible path to a new resurgence of the middle class reversing its current state of rapid decline but the story he tells is by no means all brightness and light this is not another ber technologist giving us a saccharine technology will fix everything in the end weltanschaung lanier 's interpretation of current information economy reality is a chilling one , and the implication that a special kind of doom awaits us if we do nothing as politicians and others in a position of power are wont to do these days reverberates throughout lanier 's contention is that the leviathans of the information economy not just google , amazon , facebook , ebay , and so forth , but also apple , walmart , and many others who have used big data to reimagine and reconfigure their supply chains derive their wealth and power from hundreds of millions of people that 's us who supply personal data not just name and address , but info about browsing , reading , and purchasing habits to these giants for free google 's billion valuation is due not to any facilities or land they own , not to their employee headcount , not to any magic computer code no codebase in the world is worth billion , but rather , stems directly from the ability of google to spy on hundreds of millions of people without the people data , google 's business model , based on contextual placement of ad links , does n't exist with suitable variations , the same holds true for amazon and all the rest think of it this way google has a focus group it contains around a billion people google knows the searching , browsing , purchasing , e mailing , document storing creation sharing , scheduling google calendar , reading google books , and other habits of those billion or so people the information available to google through the chrome browser , which is a type of full time spying device , or the android os , another full time spying environment , is mind boggling but no one in the focus group gets paid for this exquisitvely valuable indeed priceless information the spoils go directly to google and its workers and stockholders they get paid the rest of us do n't proudhon would call it straight up theft in lanier 's view , it amounts to an accounting irregularity that should be corrected at once not just for the benefit of the average person but for the long term survival of google , facebook , etc according to lanier , you and i and all other users of ad festooned websites should be compensated , on an ongoing basis , for the use of our private and public data including all data pertaining to browsing , purchasing , etc habits , via a system of micropayments that would register whenever information derived from you is captured he does n't say how big these micropayments might be , but he maintains that in the long run , such a system of compensating ordinary people for the use of their online behaviors would significantly strengthen a middle class that 's currently on the way to disappearing so we 're not talking a trivial amount of money why is it in google 's and others' interests to do this ? because over the long haul , the current system is unsustainable to put it more bluntly , at some point in the future there wo n't be a purchasing class a middle class to spy on all the good jobs will have disappeared a small mandarin class of technocrats will exist to maintain the info plutocracy , but in the meantime the rest of us will be flipping burgers or doing whatever it is burger flippers do in future generations lanier states flat out on p of his book that the internet has destroyed more jobs than it has created he cites a number of examples , mostly famously that of kodak at the height of its power , kodak employed , people and was worth billion by the time digital photography became a throwaway feature of cell phones , kodak disappeared and we had instagram meanwhile , instagram when it was purchased by facebook for a billion dollars employed people one can argue endlessly about whether instagram was fairly valued or whether any discussion of instagram in relation to kodak is apropos , but does anyone seriously question that amazon has reconfigured the bookstore industry to employ fewer people ? does anyone seriously question that walmart with its computerized supply chain and chinese maufacturing operations has put ma and pa stores out of business ? add up all the kodaks and mall closures , etc , and you end up with what we have now , which is a situation where there are three unemployed persons for every job opening in the u s , otherwise known as structural unemployment , or how about plain english ? mass suffering president obama and many others including past presidents of both administrations have bought into , and continue to sell , the myth that more education more degrees in science , math , and technology , in particular will enable us , somehow by magic , apparently , to bootstrap our way out of our current predicament they tell us this even as science , math , and technology jobs regularly get outsourced to india lanier buys into no such sophistry he explains how even fields like surgery and nursing once thought to be invulnerable are being automated , reducing employment prospects for even the very well educated anyone who does n't believe good jobs for the well educated are going away need only talk to a recent ph d graduate see a generation of jobless phds university degrees are becoming less valuable by the minute , even as the cost of obtaining them soars out of reach the arts have always been a hard place to earn a living in the information economy it 's become even harder lanier himself a musician explains , in some detail , the sad story of what 's become of the music industry then he reports how the same scenario has played out and continues to be played out for authors , videographers , photographers , and others , creating a lotto like winner take all star system in which a relative handful of lucky youtube and amazon indies those for whom sales or views happen to go viral , essentially win the online lotto , providing the success stories that motivate thousands or millions of others who will go on to fail the point being , if every field becomes as hard to break into and succeed at as acting , music , or now writing , there will be a lot of starving artists out there would n't it be fairer if every time someone downloaded something you created whether it 's a photo , a blog , a short story , a video , or whatever you got paid something ? information , after all , is n't really free we pay for it with our online lives , which are pirated on a mass scale by google and all the rest right now , the information about your online life that gets harvested and processed by google by programs that sift through your mail , take note of your search habits , track your site visitations , etc is not shown on google 's books as having any intrinsic value the raw materials are valued at nothing the value shows up later when google puts an ad for a firearms training course next to the e mail you wrote mentioning squirt guns google profits from raw materials it does n't pay for few industries enjoy such an advantage when information is no longer free , you 'll have to pay something , of course , to use a service like wikipedia , or to watch that hilarious video that 's making the rounds but lanier says right now , the balance of accounting is so out of whack , so massively in favor of google , amazon , facebook , etc , that if accurate accounting were done if the books were properly kept , ordinary web users would still come out way ahead , even if you had to pay a micropayment of some kind for every site you visited amazon , google , etc would continue to exist , but they 'd pay for raw materials and you would know exactly what information they acquired about you you 'd be able to opt out of their spying activities but chances are , you would n't want to miss out on the income jaron lanier lanier 's book is light on actual computation , ironically , but it 's clear that the combined revenues of the top several hundred digital brands comes to many trillions of dollars , which means that even if a billion or more web customers participated in the profit sharing , rebates to online customers would amount to thousands of dollars per person per year i suspect the reason lanier did n't trot out the actual calculations is n't that the accounting does n't favor his position but because it would only cloud the basic argument with who owns the future , lanier is trying to start a dialog i can understand him not wanting to get sidetracked with details before we know what we 're arguing about still , critics will want to see pro formas in any future editions of this book i would expect to see an appendix showing some actual numbers justifying the major ideas in the book as it stands , that level of specificity is lacking and it tends to weaken lanier 's case , imho criticisms aside , lanier 's book deserves serious consideration , right now , today , by technocrats , economists , politicians , planners , and of course ceos and board members of top companies the path we 're on now toward ever greater automation , and subsumption of the proton economy into a world of electrons has led and continues to lead toward loss of good jobs and the massive enrichment of the few , while the private data of the many are compromised the market efficiencies brought about by amazon and walmart are not putting more people to work what we 've gotten , in fact , is a net loss , not only in quantity but quality of jobs today , it 's three unemployed americans for every job opening tomorrow it will be four at what point do we stop and take lanier 's arguments seriously ? i think we 're reached that point now we ignore the arguments in his book at our own peril
