since it is mental health awareness month , i decided to write a post regarding a common mental health disorder that students are exhibiting in school unfortunately , school counselors are often unaware of how to help students and families who face this disorder in this post , i hope to give some insight to school counselors about the mood disorder anxiety a few weeks ago , a colleague shared her concerns about a ninth grader who was skipping class and failing several of her courses when my friend confronted the student about her grades and skipping , the student told her that she suffered from anxiety and felt uncomfortable around large groups of students my colleague decided to meet with the guardian of the student to come up with a plan to help her when she was feeling anxious during the meeting , the guardian was resistant to many of my colleague 's suggestions and felt that the student was truly unable to properly function in a classroom my colleague told the guardian that she understood her concerns for her child , but she was worried for the student 's safety as she was constantly missing class and no one knew her whereabouts when the guardian asked the student where she was going , the student burst into tears and accused the guardian of not caring about her , threatened to run away , and got up to leave the room instantly , the guardian backed down and told the counselor that her child needed time to regain her composure calmly , my colleague listened to the parent , but insisted a plan was needed to make sure the student was safe and academically successful frustrated , the parent excused herself and left with her child leaving my colleague scratching her head what is anxiety ? according to healthy place , anxiety disorders are a group of illnesses including generalized anxiety disorder , phobias , panic disorders , post traumatic stress disorder , social disorder , and obsessive compulsive disorder researchers believe that anxiety is a biological disorder that runs in families and may manifest from a series of risk factors like brain chemistry , genetics , personality , and life events how to help a student who suffers from anxiety ?

some suggestions from dr manassis include escort the student to class create a plan for helping the student to catch up in his or her class remain calm and thoughtful with the student and family schools should be flexible and allow variations in student 's schedule allow a staff person to be available to assist the student when he or she is having anxiety schools should be flexible with academic expectations as the student adjusts back to school in addition to assisting students in school , school counselors should refer the student to an outside referral dr manassis suggests that students should see a therapist regularly regarding their anxiety some therapies for students with anxiety often include cognitive behavior therapy motivational interviewing family therapy dr manassis warns that home school should not be a recommendation for students as it often becomes a lifestyle for the student also , changing schools may not always be the best solution as transition can be stressful for the student dr manassis says that changing schools should only be considered if the school is toxic i e bullying is present helpful tips when students are having anxiety therapist and mental health vlogger , kati morton , gives some additional tips school counselors can give students these suggestions include stay busy ! anxiety often appears when students are quiet and allow their minds to run with thoughts help students focus on the area where they feel the worry and use deep breathing suggest that students begin to exercise anxiety thrives when we have a lot of pent up energy suggest the student have an emergency contact list to reach out when he or she is anxious having at least five people is important so that if someone cannot answer , the student has a back up contact consider seeing a psychiatrist if his or her anxiety is not improving worry wise kids has a list of accommodations that schools can put into place if a student is exhibiting symptoms of anxiety some tips include seat students away from other students who may be disruptive or distracting allow the student to present class presentations to the teacher alone or allow the student to videotape the lesson at home to show to the teacher allow extended time on tests create a cool down pass with a time limit of minutes for the student to wash his or her face or get water see more suggestions in this article , sample accommodations for students with anxiety additional resources do you need additional resources for assisting students with mood disorders ?
