at times , it would be nice to just sail away and forget about all our troubles at least for a day or two unfortunately , it just doesn t work that way we still have to wake up the following morning and face the music however , having an escape mechanism is important for all of us it is even more important for those of us with a health issue these escapes can be any hobby or sport or activity that allows us to forget about our troubles for a moment anyway another activity that accomplishes the same thing is spending quality time with our loved ones , especially our children and grandchildren refocusing is the key point of any of these activities it is the ability to escape for a moment by redirecting our thoughts towards something more pleasant and interesting and , if the object of our newfound attention is something we love to do , it can be an even more wonderful experience often , when we learn about our non treatable and incurable disease , it becomes far too easy to slip into a world of asking why me how could this happen what now and what is the use and , that is why it is important to refocus our thoughts on something more pleasant and beneficial if we don t have such an activity or have given it up , perhaps it is time to find that special something we enjoy and make it a part of our life once again with such an activity , it is possible to sail away to a world more pleasant and acceptable at least for the moment anyway
