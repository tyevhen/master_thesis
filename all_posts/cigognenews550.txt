today my children i am going to tell you about a world we could have , not for our children or grandchildren , but for us and we can do it easily but first in order to explore the subject i want to tell you about an article in the paper today a man had a quarrel with his girlfriend he left home and came back with a knife and stabbed her times this with their children in another room no thoughts about those kids and certainly no thoughts that he was taking a life , savagely i thought to myself could i go out and get a knife and stab anyone times ? of course not then i said , is he really from a different species than i ? and the answer is yes ! what ? do i mean that ? absolutely now we have to go back to my three levels of brain development and revisit the first line remember we start out in the womb with a brainstem and little else that brain structure is primitive , equal to the whole brain of the crocodile it allows quick and immediate responses to get out of the way and save our lives it allows impulsive reactions and is the base for the deepest aspect of feeling hopelessness and helplessness it organizes terror and above all , rage ! when we need to fight to save our lives when adverse events occur while we are being carried , it impacts the brainstem and first line when something happens as adults it can resonate with those first line reactions , unless of course there is adequate gating to hold down those primitive responses but when a child is neglected , abandoned and unloved and untouched growing up , the pain grows and is compounded , weakening the gates between levels of consciousness gating is defective so that when there is resonance it reaches all the way down to first line and rage ensues or other great pain hidden in the antipodes of the brain normally that reach does not trigger off first line reactions unless our lives are in danger and we have to react to save ourselves those with faulty gates are immersed nearly all of the time in first line and that is what we often call the hysteric , who overreacts to almost anything so mister killer got jealous , she looked at another guy and that s all , and the rage bubbled up and he killed he for the moment was a complete crocodile with no cortex or limbic system to help out when he was enveloped in the crocodile brain there was no longer the adult human brain to control and think things out he was no longer human no longer part of us he was a different species a primitive species with no human thought or compassion when he was no longer triggered he will be overcome with what he did and want to kill himself but that comes later when he can think and feel without being overwhelmed by first line i remember when my father got mad we knew to stay away because his eyes began to water and turn red we knew something deep and terrible was lurking down below we did not know what to call it but now we do his first line , lizard brain was on the march watch out ! because that brain has no control the reason is that when adverse things happen while we are in the womb it literally diminishes the development of the neocortex , controlling , thinking reasoning brain there is damage to these developing cells , particularly during birth where there may be a serious lack of oxygen so now we grow up without all our cortical marbles and with serious imprints on the brainstem limbic feeling areas and we begin to eat like there is no tomorrow and literally for the first liner there is no more tomorrow eating becomes life and death urgent ! because the drive behind it is so urgent there may have been starvation during womblife or some other serious trauma the same with violent act outs here the idea of anger management is ridiculous , unless we expect the person to grow new cortical cells what they do offer is a cortical third line buffer against upcoming pain it will hold only for a short while better to let it all out in a safe environment with slow emotional steps in a methodical way any extreme behavior is usually first line derived suicide , overeating , oversexed , addiction , and so on certainly , we can include psychosis in all this and we know now what it takes to treat all these symptoms and behavior now suppose there comes along a therapy that deals with first line ? modestly , i say it is mine what will that do ? it will make a world without uncontrolled rage a world without serious alcoholics and drug addicts , a world without suicides don t forget that all of what i am describing is at base emanating from first line i have seen it and my staff have treated it successfully it ain t easy but it can be done slowly , methodically and carefully but we can make a decent world we can safely live in and we can do it now ! it is no longer a mystery except to those who have no access , which is most of us so now children , before you fall off to sleep let me assure you , we have it in our power to make a much better world right away
