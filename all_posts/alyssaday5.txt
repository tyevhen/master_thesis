so , i am a champion worrier if worrying were a sport in the olympics , i would have gold medals by now i can worry about things that are not remotely possible , like what if navy guy is on deployment and i'm driving home from the grocery store and a meteorite hits my car and i die , but i'm smushed beyond recognition so nobody knows who i am to tell the kids , who are all alone in the world , and with no food in the house this was my biggest concern driving home this morning i am so not making this up it is scary inside my head
