the spam bot attack seems to have calmed a bit , so i dare to post something new i must delete the false posts by hand to keep this blog protected from being used as an advertising zombie so what momentous occasion has strengthened me to post again ? you guessed it , depression i began to slide around new year 's and of late it 's become intense i could n't even talk to my sister or brother on the phone without crying , having to catch my breath to talk i do n't know if my older brother has ever heard me cry as an adult , and my sister has only witnessed it on rare occasions when my self control could not hold kathleen , of course , hears it all the time i apologize on behalf of the other blog i started in a moment of normal mood best poetry online my judgment is presently impaired regarding choices so i must postpone the resumption of that blog until i'm better or not truthfully my judgment is n't so bad about others' work , just my own , which i find wholly execrable in depression , so perhaps it 's just a lack of energy and hope it takes me forever surfing the net to find one poem i think worthy of noting so much passable stuff , so little outstanding much intelligence and little genius the best poem i wrote in the last year , imho , the whole thing , was just rejected by rattle after they had held it for two months and given me hope more and more i get these notices , i really liked this poem but the other editors as if everything is being selected by committee , the same process that produced an elephant or a camel , i can never decide such a democratic imposition on the selection process must militate against the most original poems , one would think it takes one editor with vision to find something truly unique below some sonnets i dashed off yesterday and today dark sonnets identified only by number not up to the standard of gerard manley hopkins but what do i care ? they are therapeutic exercises as i resort to formal verse when depressed i once more this grinding anxiety of mind galls itself , one plate wears down another the dust of dueling surfaces will find more gears to infiltrate , more smooth to smother i put a stethescope upon my crown to eavesdrop on the stuttering machine i hear nothing but silence in the town save for the jukebox skipping in routine i think of pills and blades and guns and cars all useful in their way , pushed to the max as in my ragtop headed for the stars beyond the guard rail at big sur relax i have no plan , i will endure this rape with dolls eyes and a positive thinking tape ii i m swallowed by the groaning of the reef at one more wave s untiring onslaught i listen to a chain saw for relief , a brighter racket than my pounding thought you who stand there do you think in straight lines ? do thoughts follow another , hand to hand ? or is it that your insight s without spines like a sea urchin s skeleton on sand ? vanilla life , vanilla in your veins , uncomplicated , unexamined days if only i could tender you the reins to my life , would i sail through the quays sipping a gin fizz , waving to the shore ? i d give my soul for your whitebread rapport iii persecutor , victim , does it matter ? logic self destructs in such a mood when self rags on itself in petty chatter begging only for the hangman s hood to stand upon the platform with a noose is all i ask of life or hope of death the world s wheels moved i m the caboose left on the track , far from the engine s breath gather the spikes you used to lay the rails , gather the beams , the workmen , engineers , tell them that in all of life s travails a man is just the sum of his worst fears it suits me to be left behind , to rust why couple with a train i cannot trust ? iv here is my soul inside a water drop place it on a slide , adjust the scope look at all the creatures in that slop ! crazy how life proliferates in hope which corresponds to me ? bacterium stained blue , gram positive and walled ? or is the dynoflagellate delirium of tendrils a better fit for the appalled ? job wished he d been aborted i understand there should be limits to what man can suffer unfortunately there s no manual at hand to say , he s had enough , don t make it tougher i ve got more courage than the average bear if only it were more use in despair to any readers still following this blog , my thanks , and comments are always salutory as they assure me i am not entirely alone in the ether kilorats , ce
