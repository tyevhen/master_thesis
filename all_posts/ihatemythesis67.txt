thanks to a kind fellow blogger , i discovered that antony is the saint of lost things unfortunately , when i finally reached his offices , his secretary referred me to st jude as i walked down the block to jude 's office all the saints' offices are lined up , kinda like embassy row , i assumed that st jude must be in charge of success in education or extraordinary intellect and achievement or at least graduation gown fittings but before i arrived , i saw the sign welcome to the offices of st jude the patron saint of lost causes desperate situations please take a number i just walked away , dejected no reason to bother a leader of a religion i do n't even belong to back to studying i guess but wait a sign ! in the middle of writing this very blog , my roommate 's girlfriend found and delivered two of my long lost backpacks ! maybe somebody is telling me to keep the faith if you really must know , a year ago i lent the backpacks to her friends for a camping trip and the friends subsequently disappeared
