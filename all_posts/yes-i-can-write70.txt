i 've been grumbling and grumping periodically on the blog facebook page , twitter , and other online haunts about the problems i have with the uncollege education hacking movements for over a year now people have reacted differently , some saying i'm being overly critical , some agreeing , and some just saying then write something already explaining your stance instead of just complaining ! those latter people are probably right , in that perhaps it would have been a good idea to write about that ages ago , but at the same time , i do n't think the timing was right i have n't been in quite the right head space i finally got the push i needed when i read a post a few days ago by jessica over at college rebellion several things came together that post , the post she links when life hacking is really white privilege , which i read a month or two ago and which has really stuck with me , and a quote i remembered posting many months ago suddenly it was n't just that i felt vaguely uncomfortable almost every time i read something about uncollege or education hacking , now i had an actual post in my head a place to start everybody , and i mean everybody , is jumping on the 'self directed learning' bandwagon these days and they are bringing to it all the same old bullshit children who are 'more' more curious , more motivated , more more more so let me put my position out there for me this lifestyle is about a principle and that alone offering as free a life as possible to my children and myself it 's not about making a little super genius , super diverse interest , super engaged human these children are not circus performers so stop showcasing who did what at the youngest age , who gives the best ted teen presentations and not think that to me it will look no different except now the child is at home unschooling , self directed lives , natural learning , call it what you want if it 's 'about' results then it 's not my cup of tea into flow or no expectations ? then i can engage even if the flow includes results gillian goddard i think expecting that once grown someone has the skills to support themselves is reasonable if there are jobs to be had , and if disability , mental illness , or other serious things do n't impede someone 's ability to do that so even that expectation is n't cut and dried nevertheless this perfectly highlights , to me , one of the biggest problems i feel there is with the uncollege type movement people have taken a philosophy about learning more freely , a philosophy that should be exciting and comforting at the same time following what interests you , combined with the comfort of choosing how much or little you feel able to do , free from the stress of a heavy college course load , and turned it into just the newest way to claw your way up the corporate ladder , become a wealthy entrepreneur , or otherwise become successful by the most capitalistic measures out there who are they speaking to ? i say movements , plural , in this post because it is n't necessarily one movement , but a collection of trends moving in generally the same direction , that share a lot of commonalities in attitudes and views generally , there 's lots of talks about how college is a waste of time and money college is conventional and makes someone boring , and to truly stand out from the crowd you should do impressive things instead like travel the world or start a business corporations prefer people who are involved with business from a young age instead of going to college you 'll learn more than your peers in college the way of the future is technology , and schools are outdated and lacking in technology a couple of those i agree with like the fact that college is really ridiculously expensive in some parts of the world , and most definitely in the us , for instance , though it 's not as bad where i live , but many other seem like pretty bad points , to be honest , and points that only seem especially relevant to a select group of people while not going to college is cheaper than going , for many people doing anything but directly entering the job market is a struggle many people do n't come from families where parents can support either college or expensive travel adventures , for instance underpinning at least my understanding of unschooling has always been life learning as a , perhaps , liberatory approach to education an unschooling influenced by wendy priesnitz' talk of life learning as an important part of saving our planet and re imagining ways of living together , and unschooling as an important part of decolonization the uncollege and hacking your education movements do n't even seem to realize social inequalities exist , or if they do they do n't seem to care ignoring the existence of institutionalized inequalities does n't erase them , it just means that those considered the default , those already most privileged in our society , continue to be those best served by an oblivious or uncaring movement white , male , straight , middle and upper class no , not everyone involved falls into those categories but everything i 've seen seems to show that many people involved fall into at least a couple of those , and that there 's very little to no representation from those most marginalized in prioritizing corporate and business ideas of success above any type of societal shift for a more just , more egalitarian , more sustainable world , i think it 's clear that this movement is n't and has never been for everyone it 's just a new way for those already in the lead of a race that was rigged to start with to pull even further ahead money talks with the surge in popularity for unschooling , uncollege , hacking your education , edupunking , the whole learning more independently outside of educational institutions thing , there 's been a corresponding surge in people trying to make money off of this trend a trend spotting firm something that , until very recently , i did not know existed even predicted recently that unschooling counselor will be one of new jobs people have in i think it 's fair to say that job already exists , with numerous people offering unschooling and uncollege coaching over phone , skype , and through online programs new events and alternative programs claiming to support this type of education are popping up all over the place i do n't think this is necessarily bad in and of itself in fact , in plenty of cases this is a good thing ! but it does point to a worrying trend of both turning unschooling into yet another specialty held by experts , and something you need to pay for to receive , instead of something everyone can do without any type of expert intervention finances to have the time to pursue education permitting it also leads to some people misrepresenting their credentials , their success , and their experience in order to take advantage of a new market i often feel like those claiming to want to help the unschooling or uncollege community for a fee , of course are far less concerned with helping and far ore concerned with that fee who 's genuine and reasonable when it comes to the numerous books , programs , and coaching available is , of course , something each individual can only decide for themselves if you trust someone , can afford their services , and gain positive things from it , that 's great ! and if you love something you 're knowledgeable about and want to help support yourself through the sharing of that knowledge , i also do n't think there 's anything wrong with that i 'd just like to see maybe a bit more accountability to the community , and more openness about an individual 's experience and troubles if someone 's life seems too good to be true , it might be because it is n't true either way , i find it alarming that unschooling is being turned into a commodity , information and expertise to be bought and sold , instead of a free form philosophy about living and learning i 've never felt like there 's much room for me i'm not attending college or university , and i never have attended any type of educational institution so initially , i got excited about all this new stuff i joined groups on facebook , followed blogs , read articles and quickly started feeling disillusioned nowhere was i seeing the concern for humanity as a whole i was more used to seeing in unschooling circles i was just seeing a lot of success ! and tech ! and success in tech ! and entrepreneurship ! business is good ! i saw posts suggesting pursuing learning in ways that did n't appeal to me at all , grand adventures that i 'd never want to go on and in fact with my struggles with anxiety probably could n't go on without suffering a breakdown and could n't afford i did n't feel like my anxious queer hippie feminist self had a place in that movement at all , and i still do n't not a condemnation all that said , i think the college free movements have helped popularize some important ideas i think popular advocates have said plenty of good and helpful things i think plenty of people have gotten a lot of good out of being a part of these movements i do n't think they should cease to exist i just think there are a lot of largely unacknowledged problems , big blind spots , and goals i can never get behind i want to like seeing unschooling ideas for college aged people getting so much attention and support , but i just feel uneasy and uncomfortable by so much of it that i see and read and i really just hope to see more awareness in the future of social realities , and goals more closely aligned with the true success of all people , not just the wealthiest , whitest , most male of the lot edited march th the note about comments that was
