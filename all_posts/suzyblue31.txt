one of my favourite things about the christmas season is when starbucks and costa release their holiday menu their festive themed drinks are so creative and always taste so divine my favourite this season has to be costa 's black forest hot chocolate it legit tastes like a g teau in a mug delicious ! saying that , one of my all time favourite festive drinks has to be starbucks 's peppermint hot chocolate i love it so much that i decided to try and recreate the recipe at home and it worked so well that i just had to share it with you guys too ! the pictures above pretty much explain the steps you take to make the drink , however i will mention that whisking the milk into the after eight paste until it becomes totally smooth does take a while ! also make sure the heat on your hob is n't too high as the chocolate will end up burning and your drink will be ruined ! let me know how you get on if you try this recipe and if you enjoy it ! happy december ! first image available from http smartcanucks ca starbucks canada get your free red holiday cup today related posts my evening skincare routine suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration
