we gave paige a wheeler bike for her fifth birthday among some other smaller gifts it has a unicorn pouch ! ! ! at the front and is covered in unicorn designs it is also a combination of her favorite colors so she 's pretty thrilled there are training wheels on it to help her get used to riding and she took to it like a duck to water ! overall i 'd say the bike is an epic win ! save
