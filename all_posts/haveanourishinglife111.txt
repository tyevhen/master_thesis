i m still listening to this wonderful tape series call attacking anxiety and depression by lucinda bassett from the midwest center for stress and anxiety a few weeks ago , i wrote about the tapes and what i ve learned from listening to them if you d like to read or re read those posts about anxiety , you can find most of them by searching curing anxiety in this blog , or you can click here to get you started recently , i ve been struggling less with depression hooray ! yet more with anxiety , especially when it comes to food , weight , and appearance anxiety can attack you in many ways for me , a lot of my anxiety is the result of continuous worrying about my weight for you it might be constant concern about your health , about other people s problems , relentless worrying about your children s well being , guilty feelings about your past mistakes , a high stress job or obligation , hypochondriac ism , panicking or over reacting in non emergency situations , anticipating bad things to happen , obsessions or ocd behaviors , or what if or catastrophe thinking all of those reaction attitudes can turn into debilitating anxiety if you do not have health coping skills if you are frequently in a state of worry or stress , then your life is probably miserable constant anxiety is not fun it controls your life , brings you down , and keeps you from doing the things you want to do you may think you have to live with it you may think that s just the way you are but that s not true you don t have to live with anxiety anxiety is a part of life that much is true you can never escape it completely yet , if you directly deal with anxiety in a healthy manner , you can have a more peaceful life first , you have to recognize the anxiety in your daily life what it looks like , why you have it , and how it controls you then you have to retrain your thoughts to steer you away from feeding into your anxiety and , instead , lead you to realistic thinking what are you missing when you give in to worry and anxiety ? are you losing focus with your job or your hobbies ? are you afraid to go places because bad things could happen ? are you missing out on key moments in your children s lives because you are too worried about their future ? do you have trouble sleeping at night because you can t turn off your brain ? mainly , is anxiety keeping you from living a fulfilling life ? personally , before i started confronting my anxiety , i was afraid of being in public places , i was afraid of not being in control , i had a difficult time going to parties , i constantly worried about bad things happening , i made other people s problems my problems , and i had extreme expectations of myself to be perfect in all things i had so much anxiety that i would make myself sick by listening to the self help tapes , i realized that lots of other people feel the same way i do i wasn t alone in my feelings and problems better than that i also realized that many people got over their anxiety and got back to their lives well , after they dealt with it , they actually had better lives ! how you deal makes all the difference in the world the good news is dealing with anxiety is a learned behavior you can change your behaviors your habits got you to where you are now , so different habits can get you to a better place your anxiety is not a characteristic that makes up who you are it s not like your height or your eye color you can t change those aspects anxiety is the result of years of negative thinking you can change the way you think it will take time and practice , but it is possible it may feel easier to change your height than your anxiety at first but with time , changing your habits will get easier the first step is believing that you can come back next time to find out more !
