no , this is n't another cannibal post that 's the sound of me eating my words from a recent new york times article , market forces pushing doctors to be more available in dr gerdes 's office , the innovations include daily clinics at lunchtime called quicksick , in which patients who have phoned up that morning can come in for routine problems requiring immediate attention , like an upper respiratory infection , and are guaranteed they will be examined , treated and on their way within a half hour after a nurse checks the patient 's temperature and blood pressure and types the symptoms into a computer , the doctor follows up with a brief exam if medication is warranted , dr gerdes can e mail a prescription that will be ready when the patient arrives at the pharmacy i can see three patients with acute needs every minutes , she said the charge is to , which is coverable by insurance and similar to prices at many of the new clinics springing up in places like cvs pharmacies and retail chains like wal mart we have now entered the fast food age of medicine quicksick sounds like the golden arches of health care quick math check one patient every five minutes at a pop per hour of revenue guess i 'd better take back everything i said about the spiritual gardening consultant but do they charge for missed appointments ?
