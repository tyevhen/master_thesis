some time ago i had back surgery i wanted pain killers afterward for a lot of pain sorry , they said , the medical committee had come in and shut down heavy pain killers because of the possibility of abuse so we all suffered we suffered because men from the state capitol , who obviously managed to cover their pain , decided we didn t need it today in the n y times is a story about the same thing washington state has pretty much decided the same thing the abuse they say is too widespread , and it may be , but what about those who need it and are not abusing it ? how can they tell the difference ? did they know how much pain killers i need ? no they don t only i do and i do they doctor from that state who shall remain nameless , decided that we have to cut down on drugs there is a picture of him in the paper he is very very fat so he manages to cut down on pain by stuffing his face with food , while he doesn t like us to take pills to do the same thing shame is it possible that more and more of us are in pain ? is it possible we need it ? do people who are not in pain compulsively take pain killers ? i doubt it why on earth would they ? why do people stuff food down ? do they need it ? they seem to if we stopped them they would be in plenty of pain then they would need pills then they would know what pain was about alas , they can eat and never find out
