i heard a very telling story this morning on one of my favorite npr radio programs very telling , very sickening , and very sad use the following link to hear a story about tommy blake , a top nfl prospect until sidelined by mental illness it is an excellent piece about his diagnosis , treatment , and subsequent comeback attempt , but be prepared to hear a sickening comment by a top nfl scout highlighting the ugly pervasiveness of stigma http www onlyagame org shows asp tommy stand tall , run fast , and hit hard ! and if you get a chance , pummel that top nfl scout , for all of us ! good luck
