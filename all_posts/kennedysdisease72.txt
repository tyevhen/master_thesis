the day before christmas was like any other day i was getting ready to take a shower since there is about a four inch lip between the floor and the shower stall , i have to step up and then inside while stepping into the shower , i reached across as i always do to grab the bar and pulled myself up and inside when all my weight was on my left leg the one inside the shower , the knee buckled now anyone who has kennedy 's disease and has fallen a few times is aware of this feeling of helplessness it lasts perhaps a second , but in that moment you have time to realize that the knee did not hold and that you are going down people talk about their life flashing before their eyes when a serious accident occurs well , every bad fall i have ever taken flashed across my eyes in that moment a slight exaggeration i also had time to yell , not now ! it is interesting that my only thought more like a fear was that it was the day before christmas and we were planning to go to marietta to be with family twenty of us this year now , you have to realize that i have fallen so many times and most falls have not resulted in any serious injuries my recent record , however , has not been favorable with several fractures and one very serious one moreover , my last two serious falls happened as i was preparing to take a shower falling naked on a tile floor in cramped quarters is bad enough , but when you break a leg in the process things become even more complicated i know from experience that trying to get dressed it is funny how that becomes very important at the time on the floor in the bathroom with a broken leg is difficult , to say the least , and very painful well , fortunately for me and especially for my wife , my quads held this time and i did not go down another miracle i wrenched my knee and it was a little sore , but otherwise i was unharmed i kept on saying , thank you , god repeatedly as my heart rate started to return to normal i will credit my exercise program for this save it must be working , because in the past i would have been down for the count the brain is an amazing thing it is the fastest processor imaginable how all these thoughts and visions could take place in a second while the central nervous system is sending messages to your quads to hold is amazing it all worked this time thank god !
