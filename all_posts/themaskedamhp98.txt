i try to avoid using too much jargon in this blog , but i inevitably have to use acronyms and abbreviations for brevity if nothing else so here s a list of acronyms and other common terms that crop up , with explanations any legislation referred to is british or more specifically , referring to england and wales , as scotland and northern ireland have their own mental health legislation many of the explanations are highly simplified if you want to know more about a particular topic , you can search the blog using the blog search box , or look up the labels on the right hand side of the blog if i

article right to respect for private and family life article freedom of thought , conscience and religion article freedom of assembly and association article right to marry article prohibition of

mental health act manual now on its th edition , the book has pages , is around the size of a breeze block and requires a sack barrow to transport it around nevertheless , it is the bible for mental health professionals , and an amhp would feel naked if they were not carting around their own copy , well thumbed , with significant passages illuminated with highlighter pens , and with a blizzard of post it notes bristling from its pages lse low stimulus environment some acute psychiatric units have a section away from the main ward where particularly disturbed patients can be nursed and treated in a safe and secluded setting they will have one or two beds , a higher level of security , and a high level of supervision these are not padded cells mca mental capacity act this legislation relates to people who are considered to lack mental capacity it provides the legal framework for acting and making decisions on behalf of individuals who lack the mental capacity to make particular decisions for themselves it is based on five statutory principles a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision an act done , or decision made , under this act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done , or made , in his best interests before the act is done , or the decision is made , regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person s rights and freedom of action mental disorder the mental health act only applies to people identified as having a mental disorder however , the definition of mental disorder in the mha is very broad , being any disorder or disability of the mind the code of practice gives examples of disorders that would fall within this definition these include affective disorders , such as depression and bipolar disorder schizophrenia and delusional disorders neurotic , stress related and somatoform disorders , such as anxiety , phobic disorders , obsessive compulsive disorders , post traumatic stress disorder and hypochondriacal disorders organic mental disorders such as dementia and delirium however caused personality and behavioural changes caused by brain injury or damage however acquired personality disorders mental and behavioural disorders caused by psychoactive substance use eating disorders , non organic sleep disorders and non organic sexual disorders learning disabilities autistic spectrum disorders including asperger s syndrome behavioural and emotional disorders of children and adolescents however , there are explicit exclusions the mha states that learning disability of itself does not mean that a person is suffering from a mental disorder , unless that disability is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct the mha defines learning disability as a state of arrested or incomplete development of the mind which includes significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning the mha explicitly states that dependence on alcohol or drugs is not considered to be a disorder or disability of the mind mental health tribunal mht mental health tribunals are part of the judicial system they are effectively a court of law their function is to hear appeals against detention under the mha they consist of a judge , a psychiatrist , and a specialist lay member , which is someone who has particular interest and experience in working in the mental health field their main purpose is to review the cases of detained , conditionally discharged , and supervised community treatment sct patients under the act to direct the discharge of any patients where it thinks it appropriate to consider applications for discharge from guardianship mental welfare officer mwo the predecessor to the asw and the amhp under the act mha mental health act this was the predecessor to the act i m so old that i practiced under this act for a couple of years , until it was replaced by the act mha mental health act the principle legislation defining what can and cannot be done with people with mental disorders mha mental health act this act amended the act among other things it simplified the definition of mental disorder , and introduced supervised community treatment sct nr nearest relative the nearest relative has a particular meaning under the mha a patient s nr has certain rights and powers under the act , which is why amhp s have to be very careful about correctly identifying who the nr is the nr is the first person you encounter in the following list husband , wife or civil partner son or daughter father or mother brother or sister grandparent grandchild uncle or aunt nephew or niece but it s rather more complicated than that for example , a relative of the full blood takes precedence over a relative of the half blood the elder of two parents or siblings would take precedence whole books have been written about how to identify the nr part iii part iii of the mental health act is concerned with mentally disordered people who are subject to criminal proceedings or who have been convicted of a criminal offence patient the term patient is explicitly used within the mha to refer to people with mental disorders i'm afraid that patients are always referred to in the masculine throughout the mha pic police investigation centre some police authorities have purpose built centres where all arrested people are taken for questioning at times , people with mental health problems who have been arrested or even detained under sec may be held in a pic , and may be assessed under the mha while there picu psychiatric intensive care unit these are specialist short stay units which are generally low secure , meaning that they are locked units with a fair degree of security they are used when a patient is so disturbed or violent that they cannot be managed in a general acute psychiatric unit rc responsible clinician this is usually the consultant psychiatrist clinically in charge of a patient , whether in hospital or in the community under the revised mha other mental health professionals , such as nurses , clinical psychologists or social workers can now be appointed rc s sct supervised community treatment also known as a community treatment order section verb people involved professionally or personally with the mha often refer to sectioning someone or being sectioned this is a form of shorthand which refers to the process of assessing and detaining someone under a section of the mha , particularly , sec , sec and sec in my view , the use of this term , while being tempting to use by professionals , should not be encouraged , as it is disrespectful to the process and the individual sec section of the mha this is an application made for someone to be assessed which can include treatment in a hospital this lasts for up to days an amhp can make an application on the recommendations of two doctors sec section of the mha this is an application made for someone to receive treatment in a hospital this lasts for up to months in the first instance an amhp can make an application on the recommendations of two doctors sec section of the mha this is an application made for someone to receive assessment in a hospital in an emergency this lasts for up to hours an amhp can make an application on the recommendation of a single doctor sec section of the mha otherwise known as guardianship this can be imposed on someone subject to sec guardianship can impose certain conditions the residence power allows a guardian to require a patient to live at a specified place the attendance power lets a guardian require a patient to attend specified places at specified times for medical treatment , occupation , education or training the access power entitles a guardian to require that access to the patient be given at the place where the patient is living , to any doctor , amhp , or other specified person the main purpose of guardianship is to ensure that someone receives care and protection rather than medical treatment although guardians have powers to require patients to attend for medical treatment , they do not have any power to make them accept this treatment sec approved doctor when a patient is being detained under sec or sec , where two medical recommendations are required , sec mha states that one of the assessing doctors has to be approved by the secretary of state as having special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorder sec a criminal court can remand an offender to hospital in order to assess their mental condition this remand can last for up to days , and can be extended for up to months sec a criminal court , once a patient have been convicted of an offence , may order that the patient be detained in a hospital a crown court can place restrictions on the discharge of the patient , so that only the secretary of state can order their discharge a patient subject to sec may be living in the community , but subject to a range of conditions if any of these conditions are broken , they can be recalled to hospital sec aftercare sec lays down a duty for the local authority and the nhs to provide services for people who have been detained and then discharged from certain sections of the act the most common section is sec , where a patient has been detained for treatment there are some other sections of the act relating to people who have committed criminal offences for whom sec also applies these are sections , a , and detention under these sections is much less common a patient who has only ever been an informal patient , or who has only ever been detained under sec for assessment is not entitled to aftercare under sec the most significant aspect of sec is that any aftercare provided under this section cannot be charged for see other blog posts devoted to sec aftercare for more information sec sec gives a justice of the peace the power to issue a warrant for an amhp and a constable to enter premises with the purpose of removing someone believed to be suffering from a mental disorder in order for them to be assessed there has to be evidence that the person has been , or is being , ill treated , neglected or kept otherwise than under proper control , in any place within the jurisdiction of the justice , or , being unable to care for himself , is living alone in any such place sec allows a justice of the peace to provide a warrant to a constable the enter the premises of a patient if need be by force and remove the patient the patient has to be liable to detention under the mha for example , having been detained under sec they have then absconded there has to be reasonable cause to believe that the patient is to be found on premises within the jurisdiction of the justice and that admission to the premises has been refused or that a refusal of such admission is apprehended the patient can then be returned to hospital sec sec mha states if a constable finds in a place to which the public have access a person who appears to him to be suffering from mental disorder and to be in immediate need of care or control , the constable may , if he thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of that person or for the protection of other persons , remove that person to a place of safety a place of safety can be anywhere , but most areas have a policy that people detained under sec should be taken to a specially designated sec suite , which would usually be on the site of a hospital a sec lasts for up to hours once someone has been detained under sec , they have to be assessed by an amhp and a doctor whose job it is to assess whether or not the person needs to be detained in hospital
