this is a picture of my daughters and i , from left rachel , sarah , papa , and keturah i only post this so one can visualize them and perhaps better understand , below , why i stressed myself out so much to see them all in a week , though they are divided by long distances not grief here i repeat myself , relapsed again my heart is broken , my limp limbs are lead my skull s a rotten melon i seek the dead whom i imagine are beyond such pain but who s to know ? the strangled spirit flies out in the ether , desperately alone or joined by friends ? or by old enemies scorned ? jesus came back but didn t explain the skies i know i am not much i know my tears come at eleven o clock i hide them well no need for my deaf wife to hear my bell that cracks and tolls , rehearsing its arrears to god and man inside a third rate poem depression is not grief i have no home before my relapse i knew better , even though i was feeling better first i had been taking a mild dose of a pain medication from which , when i withdraw , i often lapse into depression i was taking only half my usual dose and tapered off gently still the false endorphins it fed my brain were not replaced quickly enough to arrest a downward spiral meanwhile , while kathleen went to n y to visit her mother , i drove some miles to see all three of my daughters and my grandson my eldest daughter was depressed and in need of my help my second daughter was in her first long term relationship and i had yet to meet her beau and my youngest had just turned and i wanted to give her a gift and take her to dinner while driving south to la from the sacramento area my crying spells returned throughout the trip i allowed no one to see that side of me i refused to be depressed and acted normally even today , when the tears hit , i held them back until kathleen went upstairs complicating these facts was also a mild viral infection mainly expressed in donations to the plumbing so stressful trip , much too much to take on in my fragile condition , though justified by my daughters needs , i thought playing with the fire of pain medication , simply inexcusable though when your mood improves , as mine had , you think you can risk things you shouldn t a viral infection , which , though mild , can often re awaken depression the overconfidence of euthymia , or normal mood , thus effectively threw me back into depression still there s some anger about the recurrence , and the attitude that i refuse to be depressed seems of some utility because i am not as deep down as i could be anger is much better than sorrow in overcoming depression naturally , my relapse interrupts my ambition to speak about poetry more broadly and having had seven rejections in a row , including contests in which i did not even place , doesn t help my opinion of my art to be fair , my art is not best represented by the formal poems i write here as an act of sanity , but by free verse pieces you can find throughout the net at two kilorats on a scale of to , thine , ce
