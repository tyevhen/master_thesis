it 's official i'm having a summer romance dates in and with more already in the diary i think it 's safe to label it now i 've never had a summer fling before but i 've naturally always fancied it fun dates in the sunshine , flirty eyes over ice cold beers , smooching just as the sun goes down it 's already been noted that i have watched way too many rom coms , so just roll with it it 's been fun so far and god knows that 's what i need there 's just one teensy little thing of course there is , nothing is ever straight forward with dudes and me this guy is super eager just then , when i said dates already booked in yea , one refers to a festival a festival people that 's a pretty serious date as soon as one dates over he 's on the text later that night pinpointing my next available diary space it 's cute right but i'm just not used to this the kinda guys i 've been dealing with lately have been the absolute opposite of that i literally had to twist mr cbas arm to spend anytime with me friday and saturday nights were off the cards and daytime dates were an even bigger no no i was reduced to weekday evenings only , if he even remembered we 'd made plans as for mr double date , he was a little bit more up for it but only if he could fit it around the gym and it was slotted in the dating diary a year in advance i totally understand what gods doing here , i see the irony and his sneaky plan i moan for ages about meeting a guy who is a keen bean , someone i did n't have to chase , someone who might actually chase me and look what he 's sent me if i 've learnt anything the last couple of years it 's that nothing is ever as you imagined it would be sadly this dudes eagerness is throwing me off , it appears too good to be true and perhaps it is i even addressed it with him recently , do n't worry , i used a well thought through emoji to get the tone of the text just right firstly he asked if it was a bad thing , then he said that he does n't have a lot of time and that he wants to make the most of it btw , he 's not dying he 's just heading back to uni at the end of the summer somewhere amoungst these messages he also admitted to 'enjoying spending time' with me he also used a carefully selected emoji , you know the one with the monkey covering his eyes ? my biggest concern with all of this is that perhaps it is too good to be true and let 's face it trying my hardest not to be the cynical old cow i am slowly turning in to , things generally are i'm going with it though , perhaps he 's right , perhaps summer flings are all about making the most of those few months of pub gardens and flip flops or maybe i'm gleefully skipping into a another massive disaster
