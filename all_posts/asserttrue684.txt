just found a fix for a problem that 's been driving me nuts for a month a few weeks ago , sometime in early september , i tried to go to the itunes store and found myself locked out of my itunes account anything i tried to do that involved a transaction of any kind resulted in an alert dialog that said itunes could not connect to the itunes store an unknown error occurred that 's it no diagnostic information , no tips , no links , no help whatsoever a less useful dialog box , i cannot begin to imagine apple 's site was of no use whatsoever the troubleshooting advice i found there was incredibly lame and of course , the error code means exactly what the dialog says it means unknown error i figured there must be someone , on one of the forums , who would have found the answer to this problem i did a lot of searching and wading through a lot of lame did you try this ? did you try that ? non answers , to no avail finally , on september , mike p ryan posted what for me turned out to be the solution , on discussions apple com the problem ? a corrupt or missing trusted root certificate for itunes how or why this got messed up on my vista machine , i do n't know , but the same thing has clearly happened to boatloads of people , judging from the uproar on the discussion boards the cure is to download microsoft 's latest trusted root certificate update from here http www microsoft com downloads details aspx ? familyid fece eee e f bdb displaylang en follow the wizard instructions carefully , because you need to download two executables , not just one note that the fix works for win xp as well as vista mike , if you 're reading this , thanks !
