wow thanks for all the great comments on my last post today 's post should be much more upbeat i 've been focusing on living in the moment and looking toward the future rather than lamenting the past i'm continuing to train for boston in fact , yesterday i went back to the early morning weight training class i used to regularly attend i had n't attended it since my knee surgery in october it starts at am , so it takes a commitment to get there i was happy to be there yesterday , although my knee was a little sore afterward i like that class because we work our muscles while also working cardiovascularly it 's a nice compliment to running speaking of running , i had a decent long run of miles on saturday it 's still much harder than i 'd like it to be , but i'm trying to be patient it just sucks to start over ! today was actually a better day i had a great speed workout i ran by meters mile fast each fast interval took me around minute seconds , and i rested about minutes between each interval it was tough , but i felt like my old self for just a little while that was nice hopefully , that means my long run this weekend , miles , will also feel easier i saw my psychologist today we agreed this most recent depression relapse was the worst of my depression career we were discussing such things because i told her how i 've been feeling cautious lately maybe mistrusting is a better way to describe what i 've been feeling while i'm trying to stay in this moment , i find it difficult to trust that this latest episode is truly over i find myself waiting for the other shoe to drop that 's not a good feeling , but so far there are no shoes littering my floor i'm grateful for every normal moment i 'll try to quit looking over my shoulder that 's all i 've got for today things continue to go better i'm working my regular schedule i'm getting out a little more i'm taking care of more daily tasks and i'm exercising in the ways of which i was previously accustomed i pray i continue walking this gentle path
