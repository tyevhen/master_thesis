you see the previous post ? that 's the last time i 'll use a car analogy to describe my mood tonight my car died really you ca n't make this stuff up ! i feel like this is piling on a bit enough already ! god ? anyone ? i know , i know acceptance is the answer okay i accept it , but i do n't like it no more car analogies on to the rest of the story i'm still struggling with some intrusive thoughts despite that , i 've been able to continue working , exercising , and attending meetings it feels robotic at times , but i'm doing what i need to do regardless of this damn illness i started the triathlon class on monday we swam on tuesday , ran and did mega strengthening wednesday , and rode the bike today tomorrow is another strength day , but that 's all mondays and wednesdays are the big , tough days we workout together from am and our instructor really worked us out this week ! i kind of liked the tough workout though it reminded me of my college sports days showing up , being told what to do , and then working my butt off brought back memories plus , there was a nice simplicity to it i did n't have to think i just followed orders i appreciated that , especially this week well , i'm off to bed sleeping is about the only thing that quiets my brain , so i 've been doing a lot more of it not such a bad thing , really
