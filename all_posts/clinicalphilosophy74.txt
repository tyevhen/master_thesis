you know , there are times i think i m quietly sitting by the mountains , listening to the sunset , taking it all in but then i see my reflection , i hear my echo , bouncing back from the lake s surface and there s this bullfrog there he s puffed up , he s croaking loudly maybe he s been trying to drown out the sound of his fear and all my quiet listening was just habituation to the sound of his voice no wonder i wasn t really rested , well , or truly happy ! such reflections wound me , but they also help , for now at least i know what the truth is and what the task is but what helps even more is when the lake sometimes dries up , or when the sun goes all the way down for it s then that i m truly afraid , and know more fully of my utter dependency and fragility yet , now i m afraid , something else happens , something wonderful for what i see is that what really matters is not my survival or happiness at all but rather the wonderful facts of the sunset , the lake , and the mountains perhaps the acknowledgement of their glory is what some call worship and this worship it sustains me , it soothes me the lake and the sunset make me no false promise no promise of future rewards for good behaviour , they offer nothing which thus makes life make sense , nothing which makes it come out after all on my terms but such terms weren t they puny anyway ? the good man cannot be harmed' said socrates that seems right the bullfrog who 's not puffed himself up can t be knocked down a powerful calm descends i can t make it last but so what ? the mountains and the sunset they re still singing this post is an occasional 'somewhat secular' reflection on religious themes proverbs has it that 'the fear of the lord is a fountain of life , to depart from the snares of death ' i saw it last week on a building in chester
