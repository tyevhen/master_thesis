held hostage by microsquish day what i ca n't access literary correspondence files , medication orders including my blood pressure medicine yet to be delivered , submission files , family correspondence , just a few niggling things the reps that write me insist they 've unblocked my e mail but i ca n't get in and apparently they do n't work labor day weekend , unless bill gates sent them all to africa to step on mosquitoes enough whining we all keep correspondence too long , as if it were a totem , a fetish that proves we existed in the past , that we had feelings in the past , that our past mattered but who among us in this e mail age goes back to moon over and treasure past correspondence ? the only reason to keep it all is in case you die famous and someone wants to do a biography on you now fame is rare for anyone but the famous , like carmen electra , pam anderson and paris hilton so you have to ask yourself why do i keep all this correspondence ? do i secretly believe i might be a famous poet someday ? i believe enough in that possibility to save my literary correspondence , hoping some graduate student might someday discover me , although this scenario strikes me as a monkeys and typewriters proposition as for the rest , i need my passwords for various sites , lots of other technical information as well but it 's amazing how much you can live without we lug our bronzed baby shoes through the world like a ball and chain , thinking yesterday matters when it rarely does my history amounts to me but i am not merely my history quote from a failed poem of mine , the one line i like my sister recently gave me a packet of letters from germany which i wrote when i was did i open them ? no did i throw them away ? no did i save them somewhere like a mad packrat ? yes why ? what if i wanted to read through them sometime ? i do n't want to throw away that if yet my year in germany was so beset by depression that i fear to read the good face i put on it in letters home at that age i was too young to know what depression was we are forward looking creatures the further we get from memories , the less they seem to matter unless you 're in trauma oriented psychotherapy i have a habit of dissociating myself from the past , as my feeling about the past is that remembering it will be an unhappy experience or perhaps it 's painful to read the words of a year old when that same person is now what i most remember about the past are the severe depressions and manias i experienced , and all that feels radioactive to me and all correspondence before the age of has no clue to my diagnosis i willed my way through life while psychotic and undiagnosed am i tough ? you bet , and that 's no brag mental patients are n't glassware they 're some of the toughest people you 'll meet , because they have had to function under the worst kinds of duress i admit that a manic depressive poet is a clich , but a manic depressive doctor is not i have a much published poem i wrote during my internship that touches on that experience , which i will post below one correspondent wrote to me about this poem , saying it 's the one work that will likely live on after you that was high praise , but all that is half a lifetime ago i should mention , for those who care to comment here , that you may get an unsecure warning box if you try to post i do n't think this is dangerous , i think it 's just a glitch in the new beta blogging i 've begun i ca n't say with certainty that it 's ok to post here , but i'm running the risk myself and so far nothing untoward has occurred at kilorats , though the mixture of emotions inside me can never be adequately expressed in mere numbers but in terms of the depth of my depression , yes , virginia , after five months i 've been better for about a week thine in truth and art , c e chaffin p s i am slowly repairing my links , so please , anyone who wants to be listed on this page , write me ! a time to weep i suppose you could call me heartless as a dull anvil clanking in a sodden barn , the damp wood too lazy to echo your pain and your limbs twisted like great roots , your hearts rank melons bursting with fluid , your tidal headaches , your equatorial fevers were all grist for my scientific mill , my hands cold and precise like metallic probes on your beaded foreheads i suppose my brief visits and cryptic prognoses do little to comfort your collapsing veins you ask for a word , i spout statistics your skeletal hands pray for light i check your pupils do you understand ? it is not that i care not for healing if only the power would come but science is an impotent matchstick broken in death s fingers i have never collected moths but you are pinned somehow on my mind s wall several hallways from heart allow me this distance , allow me not to weep should those dark waves with their thousand eyes once spill over the dike , i do not know what sort of god i should become most likely a madman but never again your doctor published in the christian medical society journal , among others
