you know it 's a bit confabulated so one of my patients happened to mention today that her son is a coach in a league one of my kids plays in i must have known this , she must have mentioned it when i first took her history , eighteen months and two playing seasons ago today , at the end of the day , hours after she left and as i was writing progress notes , it suddenly hit me her son is my kid 's coach it was this funny , disconcerting feeling now the fact that a patient 's son coaches my kid is n't really a big deal only i wish i could say that my kid is the ideal player , the coach is a wonderful coach , that i 've never actually had reason to speak with the coach , or if i did , that it was a warm and rewarding experience let 's just say that 's not the case , the coach is a little weird , my kid once had an issue and i 'd felt a need to intervene and now i can wonder , who knows what ? this particular patient has no qualms about announcing her struggles with psychiatric illness i know the son knows she has shrink , i ca n't imagine my name does n't get uttered here and there she comes to sessions and sometimes says little howie said to be sure i tell you such and such only i have a fairly common last name and like my patient , my family members all seem to have different last names max has requested that i not publish his last name on the blog i now can wonder if coach related to me , neurotic mom , all the while thinking you 're my mom 's shrink or maybe he worried that she tells me personal things about him maybe we 've had a whole unspoken relationship that i just missed so , coach howie , if you 're out there , rest assured that mom says all nice things about you it 's fine that i treat coach howie 's mom this is the part that 's disconcerting i realized that i relate a bit differently to different people in different places in my life with patients and their families , i keep it pretty even and i try to remain professional i hope no ducks at all without even trying , i'm a slightly different person when i'm the doc than when i'm the mom in my non doc role , i talk more , i listen less , and i tell raunchier jokes i might look to coach howie for wisdom or understanding if i'm frustrated i might be more sarcastic than i 'd ever be with the family member of a patient i 'd never complain to the family member of a patient , even in a non clinical setting , that he was an idiot for not starting my kid when the kid he did start was clearly an inferior player oh , i did n't really do that , but it was fun to confabulate coach howie , you have a lovely mom
