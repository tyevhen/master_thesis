it 's hard to believe it 's july already summer has gone by so fast my thoughts go out to all of you across the nation sweltering in this incredible heat i am especially grateful today that i am able to stay cool inside my home , unlike many of you still without power after destructive weekend storms i got up very early to run my speed workout this morning , but it made little difference , as it was already sticky hot outside it was then that i said my prayer of thanks i am lucky to have working electricity and a cool home i ca n't imagine trying to live through this heat without at least a fan blowing the sticky air around i'm saying prayers that power is restored soon to everyone currently without like i said , it 's hard to believe it 's already july i feel like i 've missed the last two weeks with this lingering illness but the pneumonia is clearing i'm back on the road there are only weeks until my next marathon , so i'm trying to get back into training mode i ran , for the first time in days , on saturday it was hot ! but i think the heat actually helped my lungs i made it almost miles i probably could have gone further , but i did n't want to push it fortunately , i recovered quite nicely in fact , i recovered so well , i went for a mile bike ride on sunday again the heat was almost unbearable , and i baked in the sun at least i created my own breeze while slicing through the sticky air on my bicycle my legs were tired by the end , but my lungs felt more clear it was a good ride i took a rest day yesterday and focused on work instead that went well i'm getting a little quicker with my documentation and utilizing more rusty skills which used to be second nature this morning , before the sunrise , i got back on the track for a tough , new speed workout it was a step down workout of , , , , and meters , with each successive repeat run at a faster pace than the one before with only meters of rest between each repeat , it was a challenging track session as usual , i was quite pleased with hitting my paces and completing the workout , especially considering the recent pneumonia when i got home from the track , i took puck for a quick walk yesterday 's temperatures and humidity were so high , it was too dangerous to walk him he enjoyed being out so early in the day , and i'm quite pleased to have gotten both my run and his walk already out of the way i doubt i 'll spend much time outside my lovely , cool home for the rest of the day i'm looking forward to a productive , restful day inside happy day , everyone !
