photo courtesy of here i wish i had a fix for every broken heart i wish i had a solution for every problem i wish i had an answer for every question but i don t sometimes , life is downright dreadful but there is always hope , hope for others and hope for yourself there is always forgiveness , for others and yourself one thing i have learned is that each moment not just once each day i am faced with a choice i have to choose to eat like a normal person i have to choose to be thankful for what i am given i have to choose to take care of myself i have to choose to tell myself that i am beautiful and worthy when i look in the mirror i have to choose to do what i believe is right even if it doesn t feel good most of the time , i feel like a lazy , fat failure who can t do anything right but just because i feel that way doesn t mean that those thoughts should dictate my actions eventually , i hope my choices will come from my heart and it will become more second nature but , until then , i live by a phrase you ve probably heard before , fake it till you make it if you are sitting here right now and you don t feel like smiling , just fake a smile and keep it there until it becomes real keep trying do n't stop smiling think of a joke , funny story , something ! how about knock , knock who 's there ? me ! okay that was n't funny how about this nine times out of ten it will work however , it doesn t always work and , well , sometimes you don t have to change how you feel if i had tried this practice last friday , it wouldn t have worked i didn t want to try to change my sadness , though i wanted to mourn the loss of the innocent lives it is the same when i think about all the aborted babies and poor mothers who have had abortions i let myself feel sad for these reasons because it inspires me to pray and to do whatever i can to help my amazing husband has a very good analogy for coping with life during difficult times have you ever put together a piece puzzle of a landscape ? if you have , then you know the sky can be very frustrating to figure out all the pieces look the same and you can t tell where they go just by looking at them often times , the sky pieces don t make sense until the end and when the whole puzzle is completely finished , then the whole picture becomes clear just so , sometimes things happen in our lives that look an awful lot like a sky puzzle piece we can t tell what it is or what purpose it has we cannot understand it by itself and we probably won t be able to make sense of it until much much later it is hard to remember that it will be a beautiful picture in the end , more beautiful than we can even imagine take care
