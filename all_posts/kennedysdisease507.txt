my wife and i spent several hours last night watching the sandy hook elementary school tragedy this morning we started watching the news again still trying to absorb what has happened we cannot imagine what the parents , family and friends went through , are going through today , and will continue to go through for years to come and , we thank god that the teachers were able to respond in an intelligent and calm manner to protect and then evacuate their students of course , we all ask why did this happen and how could this happen ? and , even when we have the answers we will never really understand our conscious mind just cannot digest something as horrible as this as a nation , and across the world , our hearts reach out to this community we pray for them , no matter what our beliefs at a time like this i think of john lennon s song , imagine imagine all the people living life in peace you may say i'm a dreamer , but i'm not the only one i hope some day you 'll join us and the world will be as one
