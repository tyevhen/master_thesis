hypothetical situation with a little ring of possibility so a new patient shows up at my door , referred by a friend the patient used to be in treatment with my friend , but the friend is moving to another state the patient is sad , she will miss her old doctor who helped her so much , and while we hit it off just fine , it 's clear that i ca n't fill my friend 's shoes now here is the thing i'm wondering about the friend who used to treat the patient is my good friend , someone i talk to all the time are we thinking along the lines of a camel ? perhaps , but i 'll never tell after the move , i 'll still talk to her all the time , and i 'll still see her socially , even if it means a bit of planning or trekking should i tell the patient ? my initial thought is yes that this will be a connection , that i can relay regards and that the patient and the doc wo n't feel so cut off but then i wonder if maybe it will be hard to know that i am seeing the old shrink when she ca n't , if somehow this might be frustrating ? i 'd ask here , but clearly this is one where the answers may be very individual , oh , but why not ? go for it !
