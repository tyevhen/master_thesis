in my post how to make crime pay i blogged about a conversation i overheard in prison between two inmates regarding how to get money from the state for being a crime victim i was a bit aghast that one had gotten paid more than for getting shot during the course of an offense the money came from the state 's victim compensation fund so this past sunday our local newspaper published and in depth story about this problem , written by josh mitchell he reviewed five years worth of records documenting awards from the fund and found that over million had been awarded to drug dealers and violent offenders interestingly , the state is now trying to pass legislation to close the records regarding payouts in an unrelated note , maryland has come in once again in the top ten for the most dangerous states in the country
