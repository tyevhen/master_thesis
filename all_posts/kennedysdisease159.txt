as we prepare to celebrate july th independence day , i felt it was important to say something about those who serve , or have served , in our armed forces i keep them in my prayers and hope the wars will be over soon so they can return home i love the song god bless the usa by lee greenwood every time i hear it , i am reminded of how fortunate i am to live in this country the chorus is something i find myself singing quite often and i'm proud to be an american where at least i know i'm free and i wo n't forget the men who died who gave that right to me and i gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today 'cause there ai n't no doubt i love this land god bless the usa in my family four brothers , two brothers in law , and i served in the military three brothers and a brother in law served during the korean war including one who was at the front lines another brother served in germany during the berlin airlift a brother in law and i served in country vietnam he was a foot soldier and i was a part of the brown water navy the riverboats my son also served thirteen years in the army and five more years in the guards with time in kuwait just prior to desert storm i my son in law served in the army and was in irag my daughter also served in the army including a tour in germany when i was leaving for vietnam , i still remember what my brother who had been in korea during the conflict told me at the airport i could n't be more proud of you right now if you lose your life over there , i know that you died in the service of our country at the time , i was not certain i wanted to hear those sentiments today , i understood what he meant when i came home from vietnam that same brother took me to the vfw when we walked in , we walked around the club visiting several tables he always introduced me as his brother who just returned from vietnam i could not buy a drink or my meal that evening it was what i needed , however , after going through the airports in san francisco and minneapolis we were so thankful to be finally home unfortunately , we were greeted with boos and called some interesting names from people who did not believe in the war it was a difficult walk down the corridors that day one that i will never forget thirty seven years later i wrote about some of my experiences in a short story called will i finally find some peace the following is a paragraph from the story twenty years after my tour , i visited the vietnam veterans memorial while standing in front of the black granite wall , i was overcome by the pain that the , names represented all of my suppressed emotions and thoughts flooded over me i could not hold back the tears as i traced my fingers over the name of jan christianson my best friend in high school and a helicopter pilot in 'nam' i walked the length of the wall and the darkness and death that it represented tried to consume me for a moment , i felt like i was being absorbed into its black void feelings of futility surfaced once again and with it emerged all the frustration , anger , and disgust that i had kept hidden for so many years even if you disagree with the war in iraq and afghanistan , our troops are not to blame if they had a choice , i am certain none of them would be there these men and women should be honored for doing their duty serving their country they sacrifice so much including spending months and years away from family and friends and many put themselves in harm 's way every day thousands in the guards have given up good jobs to serve not knowing whether they will have a job when they return or if their family will survive financially during their absence too many return home missing an arm , a leg , or things much worse and , thousands more have given the ultimate sacrifice i can no longer serve , but i can at least honor and support those that do i love this land god bless the usa
