i 've written about some ways to encourage a hatred of reading , but now i'm moving on to something different ways to help someone love reading ! this is something that 's close to my heart , as despite being a late reader or perhaps because of it , as there 's never been anything negative in my life associated with reading , i am a very avid one , and have been since first i cracked open a novel to read myself so how did this happen ? what things in my life and things i 've seen in others lives have contributed to this deep love i have for the written word ? here are a few of the ways i think can help foster a love of reading my father loves reading , too read aloud some of my fondest childhood memories are of my mother and sister and i curled up together with a good book long before i was was reading myself , and apparently even before i was born , my mother would read aloud thus , long before i could read myself , i loved listening to others do so if you do n't take much joy in reading aloud yourself , audio books are another great way to listen to the written word , either alone or together with your kids or your parents ! they were a big favorite especially on road trips ! go to the library a lot ah , the library growing up , we 'd make weekly trips there , spending hours between the isles , flipping through countless books and piling those we decided we wanted to bring home onto a table we 'd claimed as our own a table placed there for studying , but to us is seemed far more useful as a surface to cover with stacks of books i remember how excited my sister was when she turned five and could get her own library card ! she 'd regularly max it out at books , way more than her petite self could manage , leaving her mother and older sister to wobble out the doors with rows of bags filled with heavy books on their shoulders talk about books and stories being able to share something with others almost always adds enjoyment to whatever it is you 're doing , and reading is no different i remember my mother commenting on multiple occasions that she did n't really get he point of requiring book reports , since she heard verbally all about whatever books me or my sister were reading ! and we still do that tell each other about the stories we 're currently involved in , talk about characters and where the plot might be going and things we like or do n't like about the writing style talking about books and stories is fun build a home library i counted bookcases in our house once , and lost count in our very cluttered basement after number seriously , i'm not kidding science fiction novels share shelf space with cookbooks , tarot reading manuals , books on the history of locomotives , horse breeds , and a huge variety of other subjects i'm lucky to have grown up in a house were my parents had already been collecting books for years , and to have been a part of continuing that collection through going to new and used book stores , garage and library sales , asking for books for various holidays , etc not everyone has the space or money for as large a home library as we do i'm not sure we have the space , either , to be honest , but we fit them in anyway , and regularly going to the library can serve almost as well but having a home library , collecting books on various subjects , can create such a wonderful environment for reading surround yourself your kids with a variety of books check out a new section at the library , pick up a book at the neighbors yard sale on a subject or in a genre that you 've never read before bring home books you think your children might be interested in books lying around about all different things are exciting , and can be a wonderful introduction to new things , new worlds , new ideas these are just a few very much overlapping things that i truly believe can contribute to a love of reading however , seeing as people are ultimately individuals with different passions , interests , and ways they enjoy spending their time , some people will grow up with all of these encouraging a love of books things in their lives and just not be very into reading , while others will have none of this yet become voracious readers i'm sure i missed some good ones in my list , so please , comment ! what are some other ways to help someone love reading ? you might also like ways to help someone hate reading how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! learning advice from a learning life why some learning is n't better than other learning linkwithin
