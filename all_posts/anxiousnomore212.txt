lately my anxiety has been flaring up i almost had an attack the other day and in all honesty i think i would have if i did n't escape the situation when i did i'm not feeling all that great today either as i have two bbqs to go to tonight , one i am hosting i stayed home from a boating outing i could have gone on simply because i do n't feel bathing suit worthy and did n't feel like dealing with the insecurity and constant fidgeting i would undergo so i am blogging and i plan to do some yoga since it has been way to long since i last did it and i hope it will help me to feel better about tonight i also plan to reread some of my older posts that i wrote to help me prepare for similar occasions the last poll was very interesting it seems like most of us are either pretty personal about our anxiety , telling only our close relatives and friends , or we are very outgoing about it and willing to tell anyone who wants to know anything only a few do n't dare to tell anyone i added a new poll that will simply allow me to know what you are most interested in reading about so i have a better idea of how i can help you i often look for interesting videos on youtube relating to anxiety , and awhile back i came across a long minute video of a man named charles linden who is trying to sell his services to cure anxiety at the time i watched it , he said some things that really interested me , but i was n't interested in posting such a long video that was really just an advertisement for someone now i have noticed that he has broken this video up into smaller chunks i found a small portion of it that discusses the science behind anxiety this is the part that interests me since i do n't really know what goes on up there when an anxiety attack occurs i am not endorsing his services by any means , but i thought this video portion was very educational for me and helped me to understand a little better what happens to the brain particularly the amyglada that causes overwhelming anxiety is he right ? i do n't know he says that its a fact that scientists have long agreed with so i thought i would do more research and see although i did n't find any article from a source that was credible everything i did find seemed to agree with what charles is saying so i am interested in your thoughts on it is he right ? is the chemical imbalance that we all hear about just our amyglada getting stuck on overload ? you might also like what to do when feeling overwhelmed anticipatory anxiety personal bill of rights my top anxiety tools and resources linkwithin
