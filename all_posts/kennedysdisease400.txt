last friday i had a good minute long morning exercise program i did not notice anything really different until early afternoon when i felt slightly weaker i thought that was a little strange , but didn t think anything more about it by evening i was feeling even weaker and began to wonder what was happening my neck was very weak and holding it up became a burden i woke up saturday morning feeling even weaker as the day went on i had more problems just performing ordinary tasks by evening my legs and neck were very weak and my arms were somewhat weaker sunday morning i felt a little stronger so i went about my morning routines by i was in my recliner with a blanket and fell asleep around after a two hour nap i felt a little better so i took my dog for his walk immediately after returning i was back in my chair with a blanket and took an hour long nap the naps seemed to help my fever broke and i felt a little stronger by bedtime the only benefit to this was that i was able to watch a lot of football this weekend without feeling guilty i woke up coughing several times during the night , but felt better this morning i performed a minute workout and it went very well this morning it is noon and my muscles are beginning to ache a little , but i still feel so much better than the last couple of days i have no idea what it was that caused the fever , extreme weakness and coughing , but i believe i am on the mend again yes , i complain about my weakness as this disease progresses , but today i am thankful for what little strength i still have you never know how much you appreciate something until you lose it
