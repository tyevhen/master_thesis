last week i traveled to england for work it was my longest flight , with about seven hours in the air between new york and london i had never been on a larger plane a , and i had never traveled outside of the united states except for road trips to canada i was nervous before leaving not only because of the flight , but i would be in a new country i excused instead of accused myself , recognizing that any person would be anxious in such a situation instead of working myself up , i worked the situation out by conducting online research about what to expect when traveling to the uk i acknowledged that anticipation is often worse than realization there were some uncomfortable moments during my travels , but by not allowing my fears to take control i was able to get through the experience and even enjoy my time there i endorsed myself for challenging myself and tackling my uncomfortable symptoms when nervous people are faced with a new or unexpected event , our usual reaction is to respond that i ca n't do that or i wo n't do that yet a person in recovery recognizes that obligations need to come before inclinations in my case , traveling internationally when i 'd prefer not to because i would be uncomfortable and when we do things that we fear and hate to do , we can be surprised and delighted about how much we can do , even when we are anxious
