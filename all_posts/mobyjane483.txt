hello my name is dr i came across your website after praying about getting healed from my depression i agree with most of what you are saying , but i do believe there are many components to being depressed genetics environment relationship you re in nutrition is a huge component spiritual warfare stress , lack of sleep i'm a chiropractor who has suffered with on off bouts of chronic anxiety , panic attacks and depression months ago it was like someone turned off the light switch , my thoughts went from being positive to negative i started having panic attacks again , back in the er times , and back on meds celexa and lorazepam thank god for the meds at the time , that 's how bad things get have you ever heard of true hope ? they are a company based out of canada that has come up with a nutritional formula that feeds the brain , basically the ingredients that create neurotransmitters , especially the b vitamins b ? ? is there any way of me being able to talk with you ? i have n't been depressed in over yrs , which landed me in the hospital in , and both my brothers have been diagnosed with bi polar one has tried to kill himself three times unsuccessfully he 's addicted to crack and heroin poor soul the other tends to manage his life without drugs , but ca n't cope with a job i myself have had my own practice for yrs , am highly creative when i'm healthy , highly energetic , passionate and enthusiastic i used to say i get high on life , but when my lows come they really wreak havoc my panic attacks have gone , but being on the meds mg citalopram generic celexa , i'm kind of numb , and it deflates my personality do you believe in the candida theory of depression ? systemic candida ? ? what are your thoughts ? i just want to get my life back in the last years i built a business to k in less than months and came off my meds for the st time in yrs i was feeling great , until this all started happening i usually snap out of it would love to hear back from you god bless with unconditional love and gratitude dear dr i was diagnosed with bipolar along with my father and brother they called it manic depression those days i suffered with panic attacks , migraine headaches , claustrophobia , depression and mania for more than years i became a board certified cognitive behavioral therapist to help myself , but found little to help me get out of my bipolar condition in either psychology or psychiatry not until i studied neuroscience did i see exactly how my brain got into depression , headaches , panic attacks , etc , and how i could absolutely prevent all of it the key to depression is he process of pain perception if you read my book depression is a choice i think they have it for on amazon now you will see how i educated myself to get out of being controlled by my own brain it is the philosophy of how to get out of depression my book brainswitch out of depression is more how to the neuroscience of how to get out of depression if you read all the info on the website , and read the letters on my blog http mobyjane blogspot com you will see that the main component of depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain i flatly reject the genetic component the fact that you or your siblings are not in charge of your own thinking is the problem , not some inherited disease street drugs , and alcohol abuse always end up in depression but so do anti depressants relationships are influenced by your depression , they don t necessarily cause it you can always alter your environment , or , if that is not possible , you can alter the way you think about your environment and the way you interact with your environment for understanding this i suggest you read viktor frankl s book man s search for meaning nutrition is necessary for good health , if you re not in good health , that could cause depression , but not necessarily the chemical imbalance , which all these anti depressants purport to cure , is caused by anxious thinking much of which you may not be aware that triggers the fight or flight response and dumps a bunch of stress chemicals in the brain which are extremely hard on the metabolic processes of the body you don t need drugs to change your way of thinking you can do it as an act of will taking drugs to change your depressive thinking is like taking your car to the repair shop because it isn t driving you to the correct address the ads they have on television where people complain about having to wind themselves up to be interested in life and therefore you need drugs are disgusting so wind yourself up get moving get up and do something , no matter how bad you feel , and in the doing of something productive , you begin to feel better i will be glad to answer any specific questions you have about depression as you look over this material and try to apply it to your life i do not take private patients anymore but answer anyone 's specific questions and i do not charge for this a b curtiss
