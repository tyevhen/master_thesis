loved this article in the wall street journal another way to look at relationships or maybe we should call them relationshops , as in workshops a b curtiss why do we fight ? blame it on our brains by katherine rosman my husband is smart super smart like , not only does he devour fat history books , but he can talk about them in an engaging manner that 's neither stuffy nor oversimplified he 's good with numbers , too and he knows the meaning of latin root words a big turn on to a crossword puzzle addict like me he had me at salve i love his brain it 's joe 's dominant quadrants i could do without recently , i got absolutely walloped by his lower left the fight was among the dumbest we 've ever had because we were n't in disagreement we were driving to yoga class on a saturday when i glanced at my iphone there was a note from a friend whose daughter is in a play group with our daughter my neighbor let me know that the price the parents pay a retired montessori teacher to lead the group as well as for supplies and snacks was going up for the summer session i looked up from my phone and told joe that the little school , as we call it , was going to be a bit more expensive how much more ? he asked i do n't know , but not much , i answered what do you base that presumption on ? he asked my sense of things , having talked a lot with the other moms , i said in other words , you have no idea , he said no , i do have an idea , i said my idea is that it wo n't be a big increase right , otherwise known as having no idea , he said then he added , one other question , what 's the extra money for ? i did n't answer we drove in silence for about five minutes then i spoke do you have a problem with our paying more for the little school ? there is virtually no amount that i can imagine being called for that i would have a problem with , he said the little school is worth every dime then what is the issue ? i huffed the issue is , i still would like to know the specifics , he said , exasperated the little school is something i had a big hand in setting up , something i'm very proud of joe knows this he said he was n't even worried about the increase yet he badgered i seethed in downward facing dog after class , joe got mad that i was still mad it would be hours before we spoke to each other again earlier that week , joe had spent a few days at a business conference at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania i got my personality tested today , he told me when he called from the hotel after a day of seminars and meetings did it get a passing grade ? i asked one of us thought that was pretty funny one of the things that makes my husband a great guy , and a smart person , is that he is always integrating lessons from one part of life into another the day after the little school blow up had blown over , joe said to me , i think we have very different dominant brain quadrants and when we fight , that 's getting in our way then he reached into his briefcase and pulled out a folder it was from personality school ! he began to set on the kitchen counter graphs and charts , the results of a herrmann international brain dominance survey these brain analysis surveys are meant to identify which segments of a person 's brain the part that controls rational thinking versus that in which we process conceptual ideas , for example kick into gear in the course of conducting business and when crises erupt here is how my brain works , joe said , pointing to a jumble of charts , lines and graphs he is a big a quadrant upper left guy strong in quantitative , analytical and technical thinking when he gets stressed , the analysis explained , he gets even more detail oriented and focused on the sequence of what happened and who said what b quadrant lower left if i needed any evidence of his methodical thinking , i might point to the fact that joe was using a chart to show me why he thinks we got in a fight i 've taken it upon myself to conduct an analysis of your brain and you 're are all upper and lower right , he said i consulted the chart this means i think artistically , emotionally and conceptually it does n't take a rocket scientist to know these things about us , i said , tapping into my own quadrant a logic joe looked a bit hurt that i was dismissing his powerpoint presentation so sensitive i kept thinking about the fight joe did , too last friday evening we began to discuss it further instead of poring over charts , we poured glasses of wine i felt like you were criticizing me , i said i was asking very straightforward questions , he said we were saying what the chart said in a stressful situation , i got emotional and unable to recognize that his questions were reasonable he got singularly focused on the details he could n't see that i was feeling criticized by his peppering me with questions to which i did n't have immediate answers joe and i know how different we are in the course of daily life , we often consider our individual differences a source of team strength but when the tension mounts , the differences turn on us and we turn on each other maybe recognizing that will help us to be a little more patient i do n't know how i feel about drawing marital insight from a chart , i said technically , he answered , it 's a graph i leaned over and kissed joe on the head that brain cracks me up write to katherine rosman at katherine rosman wsj com
