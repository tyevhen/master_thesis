i sent santa clause my wishlist in december and i must have been a good girl in my stocking i found this can you believe how expensive this is for one dvd ? i could n't justify buying it so that 's why i asked santa for it i was tired of the same episodes on my dvr and it was n't playing any new ones i also got this to help me drink more water and use it at the gym i recently hurt my tailbone by being my usual clumsy self , so i have been hesitant to try the yoga out but my body stress levels have been getting higher and i knew i needed to do something to decompress so today i braved through and just had to take it easier on some poses so refreshing i love it did santa bring you anything for christmas to help you out with your anxiety related goals ? did you make any new year 's resolutions to better your current mental or physical health ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like grinching christmas my story are we talking ourselves into panicking ? what to do when feeling overwhelmed linkwithin
