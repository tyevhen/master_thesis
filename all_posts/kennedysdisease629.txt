courage is not having the strength to go on it is going on when you don t have the strength i read the above quote from theodore roosevelt this morning and told myself i needed to write a blog article we have a friend who has just completed her cancer treatments she has had chemo , radiation and surgery during this long grueling battle , there were times she couldn t eat , other times she couldn t sleep , times she was so weak she could hardly move , and many times where she experienced terrible pain her attitude amazes me she knows she is going to beat this i still remember a friend who was near death the cancer had spread throughout her body even though she couldn t eat , couldn t really sleep because of the pain , and was so weak she could hardly move , she always asked how i was doing she felt terrible that i had kennedy s disease and she prayed for science to discover a cure for it she accepted that her time on this earth was near its end , so she focused her energy and prayers on others who still might have a chance that is real courage and strength we all know people who have beaten the odds people who found a way to maintain a positive attitude during ridiculously difficult times they are survivors if not physically , than within our memories their courage supports us during our own difficult times when i have the occasional lapse and my attitude slumps , i just think of these two friends for a needed adjustment how can i wimp out when they didn t ? photo schuitema human excellence group
