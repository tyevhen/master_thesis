when i look back on the days when i did not know i had kennedy 's disease , several instances come to mind as warning signs perhaps when they happened something flashed in my mind , but it was easy to forget about the occurrence and just get on with life no particular instance stood out by itself , but when you looked at the trend over four or five years it should have been a warning to me the first signs were when i was in the late twenties and playing racquetball almost daily along with lifting weights and running i remember my racquetball coach commenting about my muscles twitching the arms and legs after a good workout to me , it almost felt like i was having a sugar high because of the tingling sensations throughout the body my coach thought that it was an issue with me not eating enough carbs before working out i was not so sure , because i had never experienced these sensations or twitching before it was also right about then that i would wake up in the middle of the night with painful leg cramps i would massage the cramp until the pain went away , but often it would be sore for days during that time , i was having cramping three or four nights a week a couple of years later when i was thirty years old , we moved to florida every day i was in town not traveling on business , my wife and i would have lunch at one of the lakes and then take a walk around the lake before going back to work one day , while walking hand in hand around the lake , my legs just gave out and i went down i felt like a clumsy fool and hoped no one saw me i was fine afterwards except for a little bruised pride around the same time while playing a game of tennis , i went back to cover a lob while backpedaling , i lost my balance and went down hard again , i could not figure out what happened i was embarrassed , but also a little upset because i lost the game i was very competitive a year or so later , we moved to pennsylvania we lived in the country surrounded by apple orchards my wife was a power walker at the time , and she loved to push herself while walking through the hills and valleys i enjoyed walking with her , but found that i could not keep up with her as time passed , i found myself turning around earlier and earlier in our walks eventually , i just told her to go by herself because i was holding her back that was particularly difficult for me to admit about the same time , my maintenance manager asked me to stop by the shop to look at some trailer damage for years , i had just jumped up into the back end of a trailer without even a thought this particular day i remember walking over to the trailer , putting my hands on the back end , and trying to hop up i could not get up after three or four attempts , the maintenance manager wheeled over some portable steps boy was i embarrassed this was about the time that i began telling people that i had bad knees who would have ever thought at the time that these were the beginnings of living with kennedy 's disease ? and , even more interesting , who would have thought that thirty years later i would be sitting at my desk writing about these trivial moments in time ?
