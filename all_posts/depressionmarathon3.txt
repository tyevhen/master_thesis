i take a small cocktail of medications to treat my depression today i received my year end summary from the insurance company that pays for my prescriptions seventeen thousand , three hundred seventy two dollars and five cents that 's how much my medications cost in while there are a couple of other pills represented in that amount , the vast majority of the total cost came from my depression meds , it 's a bit shocking fortunately , i pay for insurance to cover the majority of that total cost , so i did not pay , out of pocket my health insurance coverage , including medication coverage , is quite expensive i pay over per month , but this year end summary reminded me why i pay the hefty price it also got me thinking what would i do if i could n't afford my insurance ? i certainly would not be able to afford my medications , and then what would happen ? it 's frightening to think about i need my medications without them i would not be functional in fact , i likely would not be alive without my meds they are an integral piece of my overall health plan i take care of myself physically , mentally and spiritually , and i take my medications that 's what works for me i am grateful i can afford the coverage i have having a chronic illness is expensive i know there are people out there less fortunate than i this year end summary made me think of them i know some people do n't even fill their prescriptions , or they are forced to use less effective medication options due to cost two of my meds are quite new and therefore quite expensive , but they work where others have n't if i could n't cover their cost , my depression would likely get the best of me that 's sad and scary i'm not sure where i'm going with this just thinking out loud , i guess , and processing the cost of chronic illness affording my insurance coverage is constantly on my mind , especially when i miss even a few days of work it 's a stressor i have to control it would be great if treating illness was n't a financial burden , but i do n't have any answers to this conundrum i 'll leave that to greater minds than mine seventeen thousand , three hundred seventy two dollars and five cents that 's a lot of money i pray i will continue to be able to afford my insurance coverage in
