what is a panic attack ? a panic attack also known as an anxiety attack is a relatively brief episode of intense fear that comes on suddenly , where the person is both terrified of the physical symptoms that are afflicting them as well as by the associated fears that either triggered or accompanied the attack a panic attack typically lasts for at least ten minutes but can stretch on for much longer , even hours or days if cyclic in nature cyclic panic attacks are where a person is subject to a continuous cycle of attack after attack , with a new attack triggering even as the previous one is fading away the fears associated with a panic attack are strongest when the attack begins these fears demand our attention , yet the more attention we give them the more we fear them the greater they become fighting , arguing with , fearing or trying to flee the panic attack and its disturbing symptoms causes negative adrenalin to flood our being this in turn causes even greater anxiety and even more disturbing sensations to afflict us during the attack in my case , a typical panic attack included an increased heart rate , flushed face , increased temperature , shortness of breath , chest feeling constricted , a complete lack of peace , and an intense churning discomfort in the stomach these physical symptoms were accompanied by a terrifying fear that was so vivid and threatening that i would often scream in my mind many sufferers wail or scream quite loudly during an attack what triggers panic attacks ? a panic attack can be triggered by an extremely stressful or fearful situation , or even by an exceptionally terrifying fearful thought subsequent exposure to the same situation or fearful thought may trigger further attacks being afraid that another attack may come increases the likelihood of them striking again the stress of trying to making an important life decision can also trigger a panic attack see below for how this can affect christians in particular panic attacks can even trigger without a cause , however , in these cases , the mind typically searches for a reason for the attack , and may latch onto a fear which then becomes the associated fear for that attack it is typical for the mind to latch onto a fear that has terrified the person in the past a mind prone to anxiety is the perfect seedbed in which a panic attack can take root and flourish some people by nature have a sensitive nervous system , which can be due to past or recent traumas or even due to genetic inheritance however , those suffering from depression are especially susceptible to panic attacks as their minds are locked in a state of constant anxiety peter is a perfect description of how panic attacks operate 'be self controlled and alert your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour although satan has been defeated by christ s victory on the cross , he masquerades as a roaring lion and tricks people into believing that panic attacks have real power and can devour them , when in fact they have no power at all dealing with panic attacks in late july , , i read self help for your nerves , by dr claire weekes , which taught me all about the fear adrenalin fear cycle , and how the more we fear , flee or fight panic attacks , the worse we become as the additional adrenalin produced prolongs symptoms and produces more disturbing physical , mental , emotional and spiritual sensations it is a very vicious cycle to recover from panic attacks we need to break this cycle the aware technique is one effective method used by many to break the cycle breaking the panic attack cycle using the aware technique a accept the panic attack do not fear it or fight it fearing or fighting it just makes it worse just let it be there for now , like background music do not be afraid that you may have more panic attacks in the future let them come w watch the panic attack , by rating it right now on a scale of to , being the worse it has ever been in the past , and meaning it has gone remember all anxiety attacks follow a pattern in that they increase to a peak and then decrease and stop so do not be alarmed at its intensity during its worse phase it will pass a act normal carry on as normal if you are currently engaged in an activity , concentrate on that activity otherwise , find something constructive to do , such as going for a walk , weeding the garden , washing the car if you stop being active and focus on the panic attack and the fearful topic associated with it , it will suck you in and it will get temporarily worse however , if you carry on as normal , choosing to focus on something else , the panic attack will start to fade r repeat let time pass and keeping repeating the above three steps until the panic attack has faded away e expect expect the best and remember that this panic attack will end soon just like all the previous ones did furthermore , expect each future attack to reduce in severity and duration , the more times you react to them with the aware technique eventually , you will no longer fear them and will be able to nip them in the bud before they start to help with future attacks , write this on a card or print it out and keep it in your wallet purse a accept the panic attack do not fear it or fight it w watch the panic attack , by rating it right now on a scale of to a act normal carry on as normal do not stop being active and therefore focus on the panic attack r repeat keeping repeating the above three steps until the panic attack has faded away e expect expect the best and remember that this panic attack will end i used to say this little summary to myself when hit by a new panic attack peter , you 're having a panic attack , just accept it , do n't fear it or fight it , learn to live with it , and let time pass these steps are a practical application of bible verses philippians , john , james if you would like to read further bible verses to deal with panic attacks , ie , that illustrate the above technique , please read this post , breaking depression 's fear cycle after i read self help for your nerves , whenever a panic attack hit me , i said to myself peter , you 're having a panic attack do n't fight it or fear it , just accept it , and learn to live with it , do n't debate it and argue with it , and let time pass , and it will fade to my amazement , the above technique worked , as it broke the fear adrenalin fear cycle first the intensity of the attacks reduced , then their frequency grew less , and finally i found that in most cases , i was able to nip the attack in the bud before it could take off another thing that can help when afflicted by an annoying re occurring panic attack is to share the panic attack topic or fear with a wise christian friend , so that we can get a fresh , healthier perspective on the issue although a fearful thought may seem larger than life to us , our friend will see right through it in this case , trust their perspective , not our own fearful one a word of caution , it is not wise to continually run these fears past our friends , as this will not only drive them crazy , but in time we need to learn how to find a fresh perspective ourselves from prayer and bible study another small note if you suffer from panic attacks and you simply cannot put into practice the steps i have outlined above , i recommend seeing a doctor if the doctor recommends anti depressants and professional counselling , consider the advice carefully anti depressants dull the effects of depression and panic attacks and this is a huge help in overcoming them see my entry , depression , christians , and anti depressant medication timothy for god did not give us a spirit of timidity of cowardice , of craven and cringing and fawning fear , but he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of calm and well balanced mind and discipline and self control amplified bible panic attacks and christians unfortunately , for some christians , a panic attack caused by the fear of making the wrong life choice has another insidious dimension to it since they cannot control it or make it stop , and because it is accompanied by a distinct lack of peace , they erroneously misinterpret the panic attack as god guiding them a common expression not found in the bible is , let the peace of god guide you it embarrasses me to admit that for many years i thought panic attacks were god guiding me mistaking panic attacks as being god s guidance actually makes the panic attacks worse , as such christians in their eagerness to obey god are unnecessarily terrified of disobeying him a verse which used to torment me when i resisted and fought against a panic attack was samuel does the lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the lord to obey is better than sacrifice as i drew closer to depression as wore on , i had an attack and lost my peace every time i was faced with a major decision every time i tried to take a step forward , an attack which i misinterpreted as god s guidance would send me reeling two steps backwards in the end , i was too scared to make decisions any more i m scared to commit to anything , such as joining a new church , getting a girlfriend , buying a computer , etc , in case he says no it s got to the point that i won t do anything in case god says 'no ' can you imagine the relief i felt when i discovered that panic attacks were not god s guidance , and that ignoring them was not disobeying him ? the most bewildering aspect of mistaking panic attacks as god guiding us is trying to work out exactly what god is trying to say since he is not actually saying anything when severely depressed i was frequently afflicted by cyclic panic attacks over a period of months these were associated with a large range of fears , most telling me that i was supposed to be doing this or that here is a diary entry showing the exasperation i felt at that time i feel like saying , what sort of god are you to do this to someone , and why don t you speak clearly ? all you have to do is speak to me or give me a vision , etc , and i ll obey , but what is this guess what i m saying with the hit and miss affair when i take away your peace to guide you before i became depressed , one thing that reinforced my belief that losing my peace due to a panic attack was god s voice , was that every time i gave into the panic attack fear , the attack ended and my peace returned immediately for example , once i was about to leave my job , enter part time ministry and look for a part time job the massive panic attack which followed ceased as soon as i decided to turn down the offer for part time ministry and remain at my job however , when i became clinically depressed , giving into a panic attack and doing what it appeared to be 'saying' no longer stopped the attack the attack just kept coming back , normally by switching immediately to another fearful thought , or topic this was because while suffering from depression , we are in a state of constant anxiety this was when i got my first real clue that the attacks and the lack of peace were not god s attempt to guide me , but something else being convinced of this was another matter entirely then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free john finally in april i saw a christian counsellor she told me that i was suffering from depression , and assured me that the panic attacks and lack of peace were not god attempting to guide me she said that i had been placing my trust in following a lack of peace as guidance it s always worked before instead of in him through her counselling , prayer and bible study , the lord taught me the following truths , which set me free from the erroneous belief that panic attacks were god guiding me isaiah for to us a child is born , to us a son is given , and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor , mighty god , everlasting father , prince of peace jesus is the prince of peace , not the prince of a lack of peace john peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid it does not say my lack of peace i give to guide you john do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also in me so if the bible does not say , let the peace of god guide you , what then does it say should guide us ? psalm your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path proverbs in all your ways acknowledge him , and he will make your paths straight james if any of you lacks wisdom , he should ask god , who gives generously to all without finding fault , and it will be given to him in conclusion , we need to make our life decisions prayerfully , with wisdom based on god s word , and we need to do so while dwelling in his peace with an untroubled heart a small footnote here our heart can of course be troubled without suffering a panic attack our heart can be troubled by a great number of things for example we may have agreed to take on one too many jobs , causing such stress that we cannot relax or sleep properly to reduce our workload here would be the wise choice this is a case of noting the warning signs of our mind and body and taking appropriate action if we are feeling pressured , rushed , or stressed out by any circumstances , we need to step back , meditate upon god 's word , pray and seek his guidance in such times , we need to wait upon jesus to receive his rest for our soul matthew come to me , all you who are weary and burdened , and i will give you rest now although i was relieved to know that the panic attacks were not god guiding me , the attacks continued relentlessly and with almost as much power my nervous system was still exhausted , and i was still reacting to the attacks in the wrong way by fighting and fearing them freedom from the panic attacks came when i read self help for your nerves , as i mentioned above self help for your nerves , doctor claire weekes , angus robertston publishers , , p
