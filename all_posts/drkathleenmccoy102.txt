before their trip to the hospital emergency room , there was an embrace when my cousin caron recently became ill with bacterial pneumonia , shivering with chills , she turned to her loving husband bud with one request please hold me and he did , warming her momentarily and forever with his embrace when life is gently ebbing , the most essential elements remain as my friend mary watches her beloved husband john spend more of his days in deep sleep from which it 's increasingly hard to wake him , she lies on top of the covers beside him and holds him , telling him that she loves him and often , from the depths of slumber , he will say softly the phrase that has defined their relationship from the early playful days of their courtship love you more when bad times come , when life is becoming increasingly tenuous and fragile , we are sustained by a warm embrace and loving words hold me i'm here , my love i love you love you more like a sweet , familiar song warming our hearts soothing our souls
