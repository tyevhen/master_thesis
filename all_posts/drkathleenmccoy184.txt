as other people party on new year 's eve , i reflect and remember and right now , for some reason , my thoughts keep returning to a new year 's eve years ago new year 's eve was like so many other new years eves of my childhood my father , usually a night owl , would retire to his bed at p m , growling about the sad state of the world , the dreadful fate of mankind and the inherent foolishness of anyone who even thought about celebrating the passage from one year to the next his grumblings were interrupted only by his occasional calls for snacks or for another rum and coke , sipped as he lay abed bemoaning the year past and the year to come and we knew the scenario for new year 's day as well he would rise in time to watch the rose parade on television , still clad in his favorite thermal ski pajamas , and make caustic comments about every marching band , every float , and , especially , every equestrian unit in the lineup with the ornate , bejeweled costumes of the riders and silver trimmed saddles further weighing down the horses and there was a certain comfort in such predictability we sat quietly with aunt molly that evening my mother occasionally joined us in between ferrying food and drink to my father 's lair suddenly , aunt molly announced that she felt some poems coming on i ran for pen and paper to transcribe her latest inspirations and , as i wrote her words down , memorizing them as i went along , i realized something suddenly that facing each day and each year with a family member who saw the world in a dark and completely different way offered aunt molly and us a unique opportunity we could make his dark moods our own or we could offer him love and understanding despite our differences and bring laughter to a usually difficult night in our house i was struck by the affection and gentle humor in aunt molly 's simple , spontaneous poems to and about her brother , my father for all their differences , differences that ran deep and angry and as long as they both lived , there was much love between them i felt it as i transcribed her words new year 's eve oh father on thy bed of pain the new year now rolls round again what words of joy you bring us all every time we hear you call oh father keep our spirits light with tales of plague and death and blight blithe spirit let us not forget the present 's black our doom is set but if thou wilt not rise , sweet pere , ring out wild bells ! let every hair stand upright as in earth and heaven fools of the world greet ' the day father rode in the rose parade the rose parade was at its height the horses pranced , the floats rolled by when suddenly an awesome sight appeared against the drizzly sky the crowd let out a mighty roar and rose to cheer , each man and boy , for larroping by on an old screen door was the one , the only james mccoy his ski pajamas blazed with jewels , his legs were beautiful to see he rode among the cheering fools a king of eccentricity he passed the stand and there unfurled a banner scrolled in plastic foam that read for all the waiting world okay , you 've had it ! fools go home ! we laughed heartily and together over her efforts even father , languishing in bed , laughed as he read the two poems and then aunt molly , my mother , mike and i celebrated the coming of midnight and the new year by grabbing pots and pans and wooden spoons , running around the front yard banging on the pots and yelling happy new year ! to our neighbors who were also running around their yards , setting off firecrackers and yelling with joy but the four of us had even more to celebrate that night we were united in our loving acceptance of what was and hopeful for what might be in the new year what is to be in ? i hope for love despite differences , shared laugher and much joy and gratitude as we greet yet another new year
