hello ! it 's that time again to play along with what i wore wednesday we 're all inspiring each other to get dressed at least sometimes ! during the day and feel good about ourselves this outfit was donned thanks to a hot day i used to throw on shorts and a random t shirt , but i 've found i enjoy the breeziness of a skirt if it 's long and soft , that 's even better ! with all the scooting around with noah all day , i need the skirt to have length this skirt in the photo is from downeast , as is the fun little short sleeved sweater one thing i took a risk on was with matching the colors of the skirt and shirt i would n't normally choose them together first , but they do coordinate i like that it 's an unexpected combo and i also like the unique shapes of the pieces there 's a definite s thing going on that excites me all are machine washable , easy , and comfortable i know most of my clothes lately are from the same place i just hit the jackpot with downeast basics cute clothes that are unique and inexpensive weee ! i 'd also like to say , in full disclosure , that this photo was taken specifically for this post and yes , i'm sucking in my stomach like a hoover vacuum again i was alone , so i put the camera on our patio table and used the automatic timer feature i felt like a douche standing there in my yard acting silly , but hey all in the spirit of sharing , right ? i'm a dork , and it 's ok i hope you enjoy your wednesday ! feel free to link back if you have your own stay at home mom style post i 'd love to see and share ! ! ! save
