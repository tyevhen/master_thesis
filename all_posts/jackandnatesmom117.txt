today was a long , long day most importantly it was jack s first day of first grade he wasn t excited per say , but he wasn t complaining either , so i consider that a victory he was very excited about his darth vader lunch box and his spiderman pencil pouch here are some pictures from this morning about an hour after i got him on the bus in which i made about frantic work calls for that pesky full time job of mine , i had a conference with nathan s new teacher he doesn t start until thursday nate s school is about minutes away the early intervention program doesn t have a classroom in our home school we met for about an hour and it went really well he has a new teacher this year , which wasn t the plan , but it is what it is , and she seems great ! i am excited to get back into the routine and feel much better about this change after our meeting after that i ran home , made about more frantic work calls and then the nih research coordinator called we did a minute phone interview in which she asked for all the basics about nate , and thus far we are good to go i have another phone interview next week , then a parent interview at nih and then the dreaded developmental screening i swear to god i am tempted to wear earmuffs and a blindfold this time enough but it s a means to an end , and we ll do what we have to do at this point it was about pm , and i figured i had a good two hours before jack got home to get some more work done and then the phone rang , and , it was jack s school any special needs parent will tell you just what kind of effect seeing that number on the caller id can have and on the first day ? ? sure enough , it was the special educator however the question was not what i was expecting she said mrs fury , jack is insistent that he is supposed to take a different bus this afternoon than he took this morning , so i just wanted to check with you i had just taken a sip of coffee and swear to god i snorted so hard it almost came out my nose before she even went into details , i told her his bus is number , not , no matter how many times he tells you otherwise she started laughing , because of course this is exactly what he was insisting , jack and i had been debating this for days you see , last year , he was on bus and he loved saying that number , and he loved mr roger , the driver when i checked his bus schedule the other day , i discovered that this year he is on bus the driver this morning introduced himself as bob jack was not happy about this however i am sure he was totally aware of the change because his reaction had been so strong and we had spent a significant amount of time discussing it when the special educator told me what he said i had no doubt that he was simply trying to change his reality if he said he still took enough times , then it would be true to his credit , he must have been very convincing , because about minutes after the special educator called , the school secretary called with the same question by this time i was practically rolling on the floor my year old outsmarted the adults ! at least twice ! they physically watched him get off of bus this morning , he even has an aide who walks him from the bus to class and somehow his insistence made them doubt themselves while i didn t enjoy having my heart jump into my throat twice , it is a great reminder , i have one clever kid ! ! ! ! i am hoping for a little smoother go of it tomorrow i have another conference for nathan , and jack has his special needs swim lesson after dinner it will be busy , but god willing , the teachers will soon be wise to mr jack and his trickery j
