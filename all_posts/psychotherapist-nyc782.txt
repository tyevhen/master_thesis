as a psychotherapist in nyc , i often see clients who come to therapy in crisis because they no longer feel confident in themselves , they feel lost , and they do n't know what they want to do with their lives or what they want in their relationships in many cases , their problems started because , somewhere along the line , often without realizing it , they began living their lives in an inauthentic way that was not in alignment with their values living authentically aligned with your values before coming to therapy , these clients have often tried on their own through a variety of methods talking to friends and family members , attending workshops , or reading self help books to try to regain their footing , but none of these methods have worked for them core values as adults , we know that we have to make certain reasonable compromises in life , especially for important relationships in our lives but i'm not referring to reasonable compromises i'm referring to living in an emotionally inauthentic way that is out of alignment with our core values over time , when we 're living in such an inauthentic state , our sense of self can become eroded often , in order to live in a way that is so misaligned with our core values , we have to shut down a part of ourselves , so that we keep ourselves from being consciously aware that we 're living in a way that is so out of synch with who we really are but no matter how much we try to suppress our conscious awareness , our unconscious is usually sending signals to us that become harder and harder to ignore over time , this signals often translate into physical symptoms we might suffer from insomnia or have nightmares we might feel anxious or irritable we might get depressed and we usually feel very tired from the energy that it takes to keep ourselves from being fully aware that we 've lost our way but how does this happen ? and why would people put themselves through such emotional turmoil ? well , the answer is n't simple and there can be many reasons often , people who are living out of alignment with their values are trying to please someone else whether it 's a parent or a spouse or a child or a boss the fear of loss involved with disappointing others might be greater than the awareness of how self destructive it can be when we live in a way that is out of synch with our values we can delude ourselves into thinking that we can do this without hurting ourselves or others a composite account of many cases jane jane was going through a very lonely time in her life when she met bill she was in her early s and she had not been in a relationship for several years she wanted very much to meet someone , settle down , and start a family so , when she met bill , a handsome , single , charming , intelligent man in his mid s with a good job on wall street , she was thrilled they began dating , and he was very kind and generous with her he talked about wanting to have a family , and jane could see that he could be a potential partner for her living authentically aligned with your values after they were dating for three months , bill asked her if she would hold onto a package for him in her apartment jane sensed that bill was being elusive about the contents of the package , so she tried to be very tactful when she asked him about it this was the first time that jane had ever seen bill get annoyed he accused her of not trusting him jane did n't want to upset him or jeopardize their relationship , so she assured him that she trusted him and she did n't need to know living authentically aligned with your values after a month or so , bill asked jane for the package back , and she gave it to him and this was the beginning of a pattern that went on for a few months inwardly , it bothered jane that bill would n't tell her what was in these packages , but she tried to convince herself that it did n't bother her but , finally , after a few months , she felt that bill owed her an explanation so she asked him again this time , bill was more open to talking to her about it , and he confided in her that he was dealing cocaine to colleagues on wall street , and he gave her the packages because he feared the police might have him under surveillance and he did n't want to be arrested for drug possession jane was shocked she had never been involved with anyone who was dealing drugs and she could n't understand why bill would be doing this , especially since he already earned a very good salary and bonus they argued about it , but bill refused to stop selling drugs he had lots of reasons why he wanted and needed the extra money , and he saw no reason to stop at this point , jane could have made a decision that would been in keeping with what she knew to be right for herself she was fully aware now of what was going on and she knew that she did n't want to live her life with a drug dealer but , more than this , on an emotional level , she did n't want to lose bill and she did n't want go back to being lonely so , she convinced herself that she would be able to persuade bill , eventually , to stop selling drugs to his colleagues and then there would n't be a problem any more but from that moment on , jane had no peace of mind she began having headaches and difficulty sleeping she was nervous most of the time she began withdrawing from friends she feared the police might follow bill to her home and they would both be arrested isolated and in crisis , she began therapy because she could no longer live with the pain of knowing that she was in love with a drug dealer only after she was able to admit how miserable she was and that he was knowingly placing her at risk was she able to end this relationship , start the repair work to her sense of self , and begin to understand how her lack of self confidence and loneliness caused her to go down a very slippery slope common examples of not living authentically , aligned with your values you might not be able to relate to the above example because it might seem extreme to you but living out of alignment with your values does n't have to involve abetting a crime there are many everyday examples of people making big compromises in their lives as a way to avoid the loss of a loved one the son who gives up his dream to be an engineer to become a doctor to please his father the wife who stops going to church , even though this has been an important part of her life , because it annoys her husband when she goes the daughter who hates lying , but lies to her mother 's employer whenever her mother is too drunk to go to work and so on body mind oriented psychotherapy helps people to recover their sense of self often , when people are living out of alignment with their values for a while , it becomes hard for them to recover a sense of themselves living authentically aligned with your values body mind oriented psychotherapy , such as somatic experiencing or clinical hypnosis , helps people to recover their sense of self and get back into alignment with their values their logical minds might keep them in denial , but when they are attuned to the the mind body connection through a mind body oriented form of psychotherapy , they become attuned to what they need mind body oriented psychotherapy is also often more effective than regular talk therapy in helping to heal the emotional
