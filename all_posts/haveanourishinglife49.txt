i know i m growing and gaining weight maybe no one else can tell yet , but my pants don t fit , my bras don t fit , and i can see a bump what if i gain too much weight according to the charts they have on their clipboards in the doctor s office ? what will they tell me ? what i really don t what to happen is a conversation with a doctor or nurse about how i m gaining too much weight and i should watch what i eat and get more exercise those words could send me flying back to an eating disorder and then what if i do have a total relapse ? now i m not just responsible for myself i m responsible for this other human being growing inside of me if i have a relapse , then my actions could potentially kill the baby if my mind would be thwarted back into that twisted eating disorder world , would i even care what happened ? before i freak out too much , realistically , the baby will probably help me if i m ever tempted to self destruct it s harder for me to do something for myself , but it s easier to do something for someone else when i am really having a hard time , i go through the motions , not for myself , but because i don t want to let down my husband in the same way , i think i will be able to stay away from a relapse because i will be doing it for the tiny , helpless baby now more than ever before , i need to dust off the positive body image phrases and all my coping skills as my clothes grow tighter , my self esteem grows thin i am more than my pants size i am more than what i look like i am more than the number on the scale i m going to be a mom i don t want to pass on another generation of eating disorders something i ve been telling myself when i m tempted eat less or skip a meal is , i definitely would not starve my baby outside the womb , so why would i starve my baby inside the womb ? growing babies can t live off of your fat stores they can t convert your reserves into fuel for energy a baby gets it s nutrients from what you eat that day , throughout the day that s why you have to eat regularly and frequently knowing this fact really helps me keep the temptations under control
