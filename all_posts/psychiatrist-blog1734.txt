first , i want to share my feelings of the moment with you sad that fat doctor has closed her blog i actually discuss her life with my husband as though she 's a friend or family member annoyed that an insurance company ca n't process the claims for one of my patients until i fax them a copy of my medical license no insurance company has ever wanted this before , why exactly are they the only one that ca n't process claims without it not quite true a few weeks ago , an insurance company mailed me a letter to my office they could n't process claims without my address ! where did they think they were mailing the letter ? , a copy of my tax id number i do n't believe i 've ever had such a document and my license , however i believe this is the same insurance company that called today how many hoops can they insist i jump through okay , okay , i faxed it , time to move on tired long day of being mom and doc and still more to do currently , i'm procrastinating stuff thank you all for your votes and comments on the first chapter of double billing it 's still not too late to vote , i was hoping for million responses and so far have gotten ummm a little over did you want the story of that chapter ? when i wrote the book , i liked the first chapter a lot i showed the book to an agent who said no thanks , and i got a bit paralyzed i decided to take a grad school course in the hopes of learning something about fiction writing and getting some constructive feedback i had to apply to grad school , got accepted , took the course , got a huge amount out of it , reworked the beginning of the novel , and incorporated a bunch of the instructor 's ideas , one of which was to have the intro chapter look like it was in third person but then have the narrator introduce herself into the story in this way that some of you described as jarring i liked it , he liked it what 's wrong with jarring , anyway ? if someone walks into a restaurant to unexpectedly find an identical twin , it might be , well , jarring but okay , like it , do n't like it , let me think about the commas , i am so fond of them so now i put up the original version of chapter one on a new blog , double billing the interactive novel i 'd love your vote so far it 's unopposed votes for the original chapter as soon as i can get some traffic there , i'm going to stop hogging shrink rap for this though i will post when the other blog is updated , and i'm going to put up the novel chapter by chapter for as long as anyone can stand it and clinkshrink , thanks for your repeated concern , but i'm happy to have the feedback and my feelings just do n't get hurt over this stuff carrie , that 's for you , too !
