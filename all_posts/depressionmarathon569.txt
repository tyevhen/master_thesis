it 's a loose body no , not my body within my knee joint , there is probably a loose body floating around in there most likely a piece of cartilage broke away from my previously damaged patella femoral joint during my strength training class on monday , and that piece of cartilage the loose body lodged in the joint between the tibia and femur that explains the immediate and sudden pain i had it also explains why it hurt to straighten my knee straightening the knee approximates the tibia and femur the two primary bones of the knee joint , so anything stuck in between them would cause pain as it got compressed and finally , it explains why my pain has moved from the anterior medial knee joint to the posterior lateral joint that little loose body came loose again and is now lodged in a different spot the good news is i have much less pain than i had a couple days ago the posterior lateral pain is much less disruptive i pretty much have full motion of my knee , and it does n't hurt to walk for the most part i have n't tried to run yet after much pain early yesterday at work , things suddenly got better maybe that 's the point at which all the prayers made their way home ? the problem , of course , is the little bugger loose body could come loose again and lodge in a different , more disruptive , painful spot but for now , i'm relieved i will consult with my doctor again today to see what he thinks about running believe it or not , i will follow his recommendation for now
