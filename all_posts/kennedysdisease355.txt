the following press release from the national institute of health was received this morning as many of you know , the knockout mouse model is used for much of the kennedy s disease research that is performed today this release explains the phase ii approach for developing additional knockout mouse models to further support research the first three paragraphs summarize the announcement u s department of health and human services national institutes of health nih news national human genome research institute nhgri , http www nhgri nih gov for immediate release thursday , september , over the next five years , national institutes of health nih funded researchers will extensively test and generate data about mice with disrupted genes to gain clues about human diseases nih today awarded a set of cooperative agreements totaling more than million to begin the second phase of the knockout mouse project komp the results of the next stage , called the knockout mouse phenotyping project , or komp , will be placed in a public database researchers make knockout mice by disrupting the function of individual genes across the animal 's genome komp is a trans nih and nih common fund project that will work with other members of the international knockout mouse phenotyping consortium impc to generate about , strains of knockout mice that will undergo a large battery of clinical phenotype tests a phenotype includes biological information about appearance , behavior and other measurable physical and biochemical characteristics such information will help reveal how all traits are affected by deleting a given gene in an individual mouse in the long term , the project aims to enable the research community to establish the traits associated with the function of every protein coding gene in the mammalian genome such information will be valuable for the discovery of the genetic causes of human diseases and will aid efforts to identify new drug targets the generation of detailed phenotypic information for each knockout mouse strain will be a boon to disease researchers who want to determine the function of genes and to improve mouse models of human disease , said nih director francis s collins , m d , ph d i am grateful to all of the people and programs across nih who are supporting this effort and to our international partners who have joined us in this scientific endeavor in partnership with several international programs , the initial five year phase of komp will reach its goal of creating knockout mouse embryonic stem cell lines for each of the approximately , protein coding genes in the mouse genome this year the international knockout mouse consortium ikmc includes the knockout mouse project komp , u s a the european conditional mouse mutagenesis program eucomm funded by the european commission the texas a m institute for genomic medicine tigm and the north american conditional mouse mutagenesis project norcomm funded by genome canada nih is committed to making knockout mouse models more widely accessible to the biomedical research community , said james battey , m d , ph d , director of the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders nidcd , who is also a co chairman of the trans nih mouse initiative getting these valuable models into the hands of a wide range of researchers will serve to accelerate our efforts to develop new strategies for understanding and treating human disease during the next five years , komp will transform the knockout mouse embryonic stem es cells into adult mice for , lines of well characterized knockout mice strains , and impc will create about , additional knockout mouse strains each mouse will undergo the same standard analysis so that the results can be compared for all of the mice tested nih has awarded six cooperative agreements to three groups to establish production and phenotype centers for the project it is going to take a great deal of scientific teamwork to assimilate phenotypic information about this knockout mouse resource , but we are confident in the team that has been assembled to accomplish the task , said national human genome research institute nhgri director eric d green , m d , ph d nhgri is involved in the planning and administration of komp the national center for research resources ncrr will administer the awards for the production centers , and nhgri will administer the awards for the phenotyping centers ncrr and nhgri are components of the nih the funded groups will all receive a total of approximately million and are expected to produce and phenotype strains of knockout mice each for a total of about , knockout mouse lines recipients of the awards are baylor college of medicine , houston this center will collaborate with the wellcome trust sanger institute in hinxton , england and the medical research council mrc harwell in oxfordshire , england university of california , davis this center will collaborate with the toronto center for phenogenomics in canada , children 's hospital oakland research institute in california , and charles river laboratories in wilmington , mass the jackson laboratory in bar harbor , maine this resource will enable many more researchers to tap into the power of knockout mice for exploring gene function , which in turn will speed our efforts to improve human health , said louise e ramm , ph d , acting director , national center for research resources in addition to the production and phenotype centers , nih awarded a five year , cooperative agreement totaling million to the european bioinformatics institute in hinxton , england , which will collaborate with mrc harwell and wellcome trust sanger institute to set up a data coordination center and database to track progress of the project and to coordinate efforts between komp and impc researchers in addition , this center will build an integrated web portal that will provide researchers access to the phenotype data the mouse is a key mammalian system in which to produce a genomics resource because of the long history and depth of understanding of mouse genetics and the availability of the mouse genome sequence what 's more , researchers have made advances over the last several years in improving the efficiency and decreasing the cost of generating knockout mice historically , researchers have generated their own lines of knockout mice to serve as models for human disease , such as heart disease or cancer however , rather than generating a detailed and comprehensive phenotype of the mouse , they often are only interested in a handful of phenotypes for example , a researcher interested in cardiovascular disease may only want to examine the effect of a disrupted gene on blood pressure this single lab approach can be expensive and inefficient a researcher with access to a low cost knockout mouse that has been extensively phenotyped can focus his or her time and research budget on more in depth research questions rather than spending it on producing a knockout mouse about which the researcher has limited information komp and impc researchers will begin by creating lines of knockout mice from embryonic stem cells produced by komp the , genes that will be knocked out will be selected from nominations already submitted by the research community many of the selected genes will be used to study disease processes and underlying mechanisms others will be selected based on the genetic variations associated with the human diseases that have been uncovered by genome wide association studies statistically , about percent of the mouse pups will inherit both copies of the knocked out gene , while their littermates will have only one copy and be heterozygous , or normal the knockout mice and the healthy littermates will both undergo a battery of more than phenotype measurements at multiple times during their lives tests will include x ray imaging , magnetic resonance imaging mri , blood exams , balance tests , and urine and fecal analysis , to name a few both the knockout and normal phenotype data will be made available through the komp data coordination center so that researchers who acquire and study the knockout mice can compare various phenotypes we want to characterize each line of mice broadly with no assumptions about what the gene is or is not doing , said impc executive director mark moore , ph d if you think of the function of a gene as a needle in a haystack , we 're removing the haystack so you can see what the needle does at the end of the initial five years of the effort , the nih and impc will evaluate the usefulness of the resource to the research community if the evaluation is a positive one , both efforts may scale up to create and phenotype a total of , more knockout mice once each knockout mouse is phenotyped , researchers can obtain information on what knockout mouse lines are available and how to order them from the university of california davis komp repository to access the ikmc web portal , please go to www knockoutmouse org the nih institutes , centers and offices contributing to
