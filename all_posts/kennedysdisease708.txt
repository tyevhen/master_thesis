this morning was the first fall weather of the year it was degrees it felt like fall and our two dogs loved the cool morning air then i noticed my hands didn t want to function normally and , i remembered what colder weather brings for many of us living with a progressive disorder my mind must put up a protective barrier sometime each spring to block out thoughts of what i just went through constantly having cold feet and hands is one thing , but not being able to effectively grip things , like zippers , is more of a problem it impacts getting dressed and undressed , brushing my teeth , eating , typing , and so much more wearing gloves all the time is not the answer i just have to accept it , be more mindful of my limitations , and move on with life fortunately , we ll still have some warm days between now and christmas and , somehow i ll manage to survive until march when the hands will thaw out again then , sometime in april or may , i ll forget about the last winter and the increased challenges it brought it sure is convenient
