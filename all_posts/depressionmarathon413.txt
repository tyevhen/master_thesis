the beauty , and scourge , of marathoning are the variables beyond our control which may make or break race day i 've been worried about tomorrow 's weather for the last couple of days it 's one of those uncontrollable variables we marathoners fret about until last night , the weather was on my mind i kept checking and re checking the forecast people around me were checking and re checking , too and then god gave me something new to deal with , a sore throat and body aches the weather was no longer a very big concern on my way to pick up my number from the marathon expo last night , i noticed my throat was getting sore i hoped it was just a passing , anxiety produced symptom of nothing by the time i went to bed a couple hours later , i knew otherwise i awoke in the middle of the night with a very sore throat and uncomfortably achy joints my condition has not improved today i'm a little worried i 've been resting , taking zinc , drinking juice , eating chicken soup homemade , thanks to mom , and drinking water in abundance so far , there 's been no change i'm ambulatory i did my typical mile shake out run this morning , showered , and dressed for the day , but i 've not done anything else napping and nutrition have consumed my day i'm doing my best to get through this blip as quickly as possible i know there 's no way i 'll miraculously recover enough to be operating at percent tomorrow i do n't know what this means for my race i'm sure i 'll finish what i start , but i'm not feeling quite as optimistic about running fast and accomplishing my goal i'm not sure i will be able to run fast , or even if i'm able to , i'm not sure i should i certainly do n't want to overdue it to the point where i make things worse post marathon i 've got a lot to think about between now and the start of the race tomorrow morning i'm trying to stay in the now i'm taking the actions i need to take i'm trying not to project into the future i'm trying not to be prematurely disappointed i'm trying to take things as they come , one moment at a time all i can do is take the next right action i'm doing that the outcome , well that 's not up to me i'm trying to remember that but i'm human i'm praying for a miraculous recovery anyway
