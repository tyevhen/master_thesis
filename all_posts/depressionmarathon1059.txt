i'm getting a bit concerned about my fatigue over the past few months , fatigue has gradually taken over my life in fact , it 's been so gradual , i just noticed it the other day i'm only doing the bare minimum requirement everyday i'm going to work , but i ca n't accomplish anything once i get home at night if , after work , i do n't take a nap , followed by dinner and bed , then i sit in my chair vegetable like , followed by dinner and bed it 's not much of an existence i figure i 'll get the unfinished tasks done on my days off however , on my days off , i end up catching up on my sleep , doing the exercise i did n't do the night before , and then sleeping off the exhaustion following exercise like i said , it 's not much of an existence i'm concerned about my fatigue existing on the bare minimum requirement is frustrating i like my work , but i do n't want it to consume my entire day i 'd like to give time to myself and my dog , too this was one of my concerns when i returned to work months ago i was worried i would be too mentally and physically tired after work , that i would n't have energy for any other activity or self care that is , it seems , exactly what 's happened i like staying in shape , but i do n't want exercise taking up my entire day either , especially if the running , yoga , or biking only lasts hours eight to ten hours of rest or vegetation is a high price to pay for hours of activity i feel good about being active , but the volume of rest leaves me more sluggish , frustrated and overwhelmed i end up with negative consequences for positive actions tough these negative consequences cause me consternation as i 've discussed previously , i have to decide where it 's most beneficial to expend the ever decreasing allotment of my energy i ca n't do what it seems most people can i ca n't work and exercise on the same day i ca n't cook and wash the dishes i ca n't wash clothes and fold them one or the other one or the other it 's frustrating i'm concerned about my fatigue i ca n't finish what i start i'm falling behind i'm getting overwhelmed this is not an existence i'm happy to lead i wish i could get past this fatigue
