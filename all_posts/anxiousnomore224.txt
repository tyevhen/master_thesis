when you wake up and are feeling anxious and you try to write out your thoughts and you write , i might get anxious , have an attack , and they will judge me who are those people ? who are the they that we are so afraid of and why do they have so much control over us ? for me they is anyone i am not comfortable around which is almost everyone ! they is anyone that looks at me with any vague suspicion anyone that shows general concern for my well being family , friends , coworkers no one is immune from the gang of they how can we wake up in the morning and already let they get to us ? people we haven t even encountered yet , haven t even seen suddenly has all the power and has stolen our happiness so how can we get the power back ? how do we turn the nebulous they into comforting , peaceful , and non judgmental people in our lives ? they don t hide in corners waiting to ambush us they don t hold mallets and sentence us to prison taking away our freedom and happiness they don t always laugh and mock us as soon as our backs are turned but we somehow imagine that they do whether consciously or subconsciously we have to learn to be comfortable enough with ourselves to not care about the monsters we sometimes create in our lives and then we can see they for whom they really are you might also like blog against abuse day why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? teaching our children to think positively celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip linkwithin
