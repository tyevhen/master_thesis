each september i meet with my senior students about their post secondary plans before our individual meetings , i visited the senior classrooms to go over their expectations for our time together one of my seniors , along with his family , came to their meeting with their completed to do list the student had chosen his schools to visit , he had applied for the ncaa clearinghouse , the student had taken the sat and act twice , and the family was planning to attend one of our local college probe fairs as we were talking , the conversation eventually turned to community service at this point , the student had never been active in clubs or community service so the subject never gained much attention in our conferences however in this meeting , the student pulled out a list of clubs of interest and told me that his goal was to get into as many clubs as possible in addition to joining clubs , the parents wanted to know what community service projects were possible to bring in scholarship opportunities i told the student and his family that it would be difficult to fulfill four years of club participation and service in one year however , the student protested that he could still join several clubs , complete hours of community service , and compete in sports sucessful ummmm , i do n't think so ! community service and college attendance do something org conducts a survey of colleges on community service and college admissions in their results , they found that admissions representatives preferred that students be consistently involved a few causes rather than a wide variety also , college representatives felt strongly that social change is not just something to mention on your application however , they want to see your passion and how you contributed to that change through your service unfortunately , this is something that few students address during their school career or school counselors fail to educate their students about in high school community service and steps to college as a counselor , it is our role to educate students and their parents about how community service can impact college admissions and scholarship opportunities often our students are so busy , that they cannot find the space in their schedule to fit in one more activity while meeting with students , find out about their activities and passions and help them create or seek out community service opportunities here are some ideas for students for business savvy students , have them think about creating a non profit for students that are talented or athletic , have them consider teaching others for instance , have a student think about giving free lessons on the guitar for creative students , have them create a kit for students who may be homeless , taking finals , new to the school , etc for students who attend church , synagogue , or mosque , have them consider working in the nursery or with vacation bible school for entrepreneurial students , have them consider organizing a fundraiser for a charity like relay for life or the red cross for socially conscience students , give them information about serving in local food banks or soup kitchens for environmentally conscience students , suggest that they create or organize an event like a recycling drive , a park cleanup , or a campus cleanup for patriotic students , suggest they organize and send care packages or thank you notes to soldier for students with free summers , give them information about summer camps and how they can serve as a lifeguard , a camp counselor , or volunteer for artist students , show them they can use their skills as a face painter at a fall carnival for students interested in the medical field , suggest they volunteer at a hospital or nursing home for politically minded students , have them consider volunteering for a political candidate for academic minded students , arrange for them to tutor struggling students one way to do this is to create a
