nothing like an antipsychotic for depression , eh ? well , apparently astrazeneca is hoping that is the case they are currently investigating seroquel quetiapine as a treatment for depression on their clinical trials website , i noted eight studies currently or in the near future examining seroquel for depression not bipolar disorder depression one of these studies is recruiting exclusively elderly patients this is just the latest in the seroquel for everything campaign , which includes generalized anxiety disorder , alcohol abuse , public speaking anxiety , anorexia , and likely more can you say zyprexa the sequel ? are we really all that surprised that astrazeneca is being sued for off label marketing of seroquel ?
