over the last month i have been helping move articles and information from our current kda website to our new under construction website we still have a long way to go , but the new site is coming together nicely if we do not run into any major issues , the new site should be up sometime in the first quarter this last week i have been transferring the chat room transcripts i found it interesting that we have archived chats in the process of moving the transcripts , i had a chance to review many of them i knew there was a lot of good information in these chats , but i forgot many of the topics covered and special guests working your way through a chat transcript to dig out information requires a little patience because throughout all the chats are general conversations on a variety of subjects including how someone is doing and what the weather is like in anchorage and brazil however , if you scan through the chatter to the good stuff in these transcripts , you will not be disappointed i found that the research updates are very informative and educational having a guest doctor or researcher live on a chat is quite handy when you have a bunch of questions or do not understand some aspect of kennedy s disease or a potential treatment i would be remiss in not thanking several guests who regularly take time out of their saturday mornings to update us on their research as well as answer questions on a variety of subjects related to kennedy s disease to name a few doctors fischbeck , taylor , lieberman , merry , pennuto , montie , and beitel and specialists like alison lapean and angela hokkinis have been wonderful supporters of the kda and anyone living with kennedy s disease if you have not attended a chat in some time , i would recommend that you check out the chat room transcript archives and glance through ten years of topics and guests i am certain you can find something of interest or value also , remember that the chats are the first and third saturdays of each month at eastern time
