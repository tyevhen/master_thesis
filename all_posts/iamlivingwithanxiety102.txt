a couple posts ago , i wrote about the power of laughter in reducing anxiety i 've thought of another guaranteed anxiety reducer listening to music when i'm really anxious or just having a bad day , i like to turn on some cheesy 's pop or dance music to take my mind elsewhere even though i might not feel like it , i 'll even sing along a great way to reduce that shortness of breath feeling anxiety often brings my current counselor even told me i should sing in the shower in the morning to start the day right i readily admit that i'm not a vocalist , but i do find getting revved up by a favorite song to be a great anxiety buster reducing anxiety essentially is about getting back to living laughing , singing , and enjoying company anxiety robs us of all that we must take our lives back !
