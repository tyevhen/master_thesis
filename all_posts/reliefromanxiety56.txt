how many times have you been depressed for so long that you do n't remember what it 's like to be happy ? but when you do finally start to feel better i find so many questions and thoughts running through my head life really is beautiful ! i missed out on so much i'm waisting my time was it all in my head ? could i have recovered quicker ? i want to reassure you that these thoughts and questions are completely normal i often feel guilt for what i believe my depression does to me , but i know that what i am dealing with is an illness and it is completely real and i am not alone ! in people are dealing with mental illness in any one year , which is at the end of the day , a third of the population you 're not alone in feeling the way you do and thinking this way at the end of the day , this is something that i have to cope with and i cannot just make it disappear and the sooner i realise this , the better i can find ways to deal with it and to recover quickly the depression and anxiety i have faced , have taught many things , alongside the trauma it causes what i was once told , is that anxiety and depression does not rob you you can do it i strongly believe that although some people do n't experience mental illness to the extent that perhaps you and i do , it does n't mean others are n't struggling in other ways it gives you strength if anything , whether it 's nasty or nice , to keep moving forward as always , coming back from the brink shows great strength it may not be fair , or easy , but you can do it best wishes , amy xx
