i'm doing okay my mood is okay despite social security piling onto my already full plate of concerns , i'm hanging in there but i'm tired and i'm getting a bit down on myself for being tired you see , i 've been working days a week for , well , about one week , and i'm already tired i spent much of yesterday , my day off , sound asleep i slept late i went back to bed after taking care of jet , and then i went back to bed again after being up for only a few hours i had no trouble falling asleep last night either i'm just tired to make matters worse , i'm feeling frustrated about feeling tired i find myself comparing myself to normal people most people , i told my social worker this morning , work days a week i'm tired working only four , i exclaimed with disgust ! that frustrates me i expect more from myself perhaps , though , the frustration is about more than my expectations i think feeling so tired , apparently due to my increased workload , reminds me that i'm not normal it reminds me that i still have this chronic illness and even though my mood is okay , and whether i like it or not , my depression still impacts my functioning and my life when i have long periods of mood stability , as i have for the past several months , i tend to forget depression affects more than just my mood fatigue has been a constant companion throughout my illness it 's certainly worse when my mood is low , but it does n't ever really go away i want to forget it , to wish fatigue away , but i'm being reminded once again , it 's still here so i'm not normal i'm tired from working days a week whatever the reason , that 's hard for me to accept but i'm certainly not going to let it stop me i 'll keep pushing forward , try not to be frustrated by what is , and rest as needed sounds good , but even as i wrote that last sentence , i shook my head in frustration i guess i need to work on my acceptance
