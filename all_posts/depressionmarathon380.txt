after days in the hospital , i am now home while an inpatient , i had ect treatments , including one today i have ambivalent feelings regarding ect the process is simple and relatively painless it 's worked for me in the past it 's brought me back from the brink of self destruction more than once i 'd likely not be alive today without it but that healing comes at a price , of course ect really screws up my memory i get pretty stupid the other dilemma with ect is the babysitter requirement because ect involves being put to sleep , the docs require hour supervision afterward that means my friend , wendy , is here right now next week , it will be my parents i have more treatments scheduled for next week i'm not a fan of babysitters , but i understand the need i am feeling a little bit better , not a lot better , but a little bit better i could n't imagine staying in the hospital over the weekend , as there is little to occupy one 's time , so i was anxious to get out of there today i had big plans for this weekend , anyway the twin cities marathon is on sunday if i choose to do so , the doctors have cleared me to run i am feeling quite ambivalent about it after all , i 've done absolutely nothing for the past days i believe the last time i ran was a short outing last sunday my energy followed my mood right down the toilet , and i'm sure i 've gained a few pounds sitting on my butt all week i'm not sure i'm in ideal condition to run a marathon i also worry how running a marathon would look to outsiders peering in , especially my coworkers i imagine them thinking , if she ca n't work , how can she run a marathon ? i ca n't blame them i hope they know i 'd rather be working and running ! so i 've yet to decide on the marathon at this moment , miles seems like an awful long way to run i'm not sure i 've got it in me that 's about all i have right now like i said , i wish i was feeling better than i am i hope being home with jet , getting back into my routine , possibly running a marathon , and continuing with ect combine to bring me out of the darkness
