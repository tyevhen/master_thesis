i promise you , proper posts are coming soon ! how soon i cannot say , since i seem to be coming down with a cold and may not have much energy in the next few days , but they are coming some possible likely topics are drug use among young people , parental trust , and bodily autonomy you know you 're an unschooler when a post on the relationship between anarchy and unschooling ! until then , i give you a collection of the cool stuff i 've found online in the last while , for your perusing pleasure sex , gender , glbtq , sexism the following reasons do not make it okay to call someone a slut the opinion pages of the new york times has this article entitled the disposable woman about the media , and societies , reaction to charlie sheen and his long history of abuse and violence against women i 've been really shocked and distressed to find out that and year old girls are getting all their pubic hairs waxed off by their mothers i think if i have any purpose at all , it s to stand up there and say , oh , no , no , no , no , girls you totally have a choice you can wax it , you can shave it , you can grow it out , and this really is up to you that s the way that i feel about everything , that you just need to know there s a choice out there amanda palmer gives pubic hair a shout out ! good vibrations magazine women 's breasts , originally intended to nourish babies , are greatly fetishized by men in a patriarchal culture , this makes them sacrosanct , so they must be covered up as something dirty dirty arousing to men men s chests might be similarly arousing to women , but in a patriarchal culture , what is arousing to women is regarded as being of no real importance unless it suits male fantasy of course , as fetishized objects , boobs must also be made into ornaments just like cars , also fetishized by men so , they are primped and prodded , alternately bound and pumped up , displayed like prize ponies even if you don t want to have you tried to buy a non wire bra recently that didn t look like a playtex cross your heart ? good luck with that when i first wrote the subversive scholastic essay , i got a lot of reactions from males who said , basically you wanna take off your shirt ? hey alriiiight ! do it , babeeeeeee ! no , no and no if i should take off my shirt , i want you to be as lackadaisical about that as if your best male friend took off his shirt are you saying hey alriiiight ! to your best male friend and encouraging him to take off his shirt ? then i don t want that either optimally , it would be nice if you didn t even notice hey , says authoritative male voice , you can t expect guys not to even notice , okay ? question do women act like asses when men shed their tops ? you know , we might be as excited about that as you are , has that ever occurred to you ? but we have learned to behave ourselves i am utterly confident that men could learn the same , if expected to women should have a right to be shirtless so many liberal dudes consider themselves political revolutionaries but then ignore or devalue gender politics as less important than other causes or they talk a good game about gender politics but then do the complete opposite in their personal lives you think subcultures are going to have better more equal power dynamics , but then they usually reproduce the same fucked up power dynamics of mainstream institutions it happened in the civil rights movement it happened with hippies it happens in indie and punk it happens in everything when men are the only ones in recognized leadership positions i wish that it never happened , but it does rather than bury our heads in the sand we must choose to engage with it , to figure out why it happens and how we can work on it molly lambert , in which your ballroom days are over baby unschooling , education , anti school , youth rights it 's not that i feel that school is a good idea gone wrong , but a wrong idea from the word go it s a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens , cut off from the rest of life john holt i'm in the process of writing an unschooling zine tentatively entitled free the children ! , and would love your input on the ideas i have so far usually when adults say teens need to be responsible or complain that they re not responsible enough , what they re actually talking about is being submissive a teen is called responsible when they shut up and do as they re told without complaining or questioning what the point of what they re being asked to do is elisha this article from jeff sabo is worth a read he talks about how teaching can definitely be a part of unschooling unschooling is about freedom of choice , not about learning everything all by yourself ! this page is from a terrific book entitled abc 's of anarchy , which you can see the entirety of here a new unschooling website called why unschool ?

it would be a decision to think for yourself rather than following blindly it would be a rejection of hierarchy , a refusal to accept the god given authority of any nation , law , or other force as being more significant than your own authority over yourself it would be an instinctive distrust of those who claim to have some sort of rank or status above the others around them , and an unwillingness to claim such status over others for yourself most of all , it would be a refusal to place responsibility for yourself in the hands of others it would be the demand that each of us not only be able to choose our own destiny , but also do so from days of war , nights of love crimethinc for beginners from xkcd random cool shit have any particularly cool stuff you 've found online lately ?
