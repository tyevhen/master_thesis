in the previous clinical tip august we discussed the nature and functions of the triple burner as the activator of the yuan qi based primarily on the nan jing in this clinical tip , i will discuss the second nature of the triple burner , i e as a system of waterways which is primarily from the nei jing the triple burner as a system of waterways the view of the triple burner as a system of waterways is found primarily in the su wen but also in the nan jing from this point of view , the triple burner is a fu organ , i e it has a form you will remember that the triple burner that is the activator of the yuan qi has no form , i e it is a set of functions and not a fu organ chapter of the nan jing describes the triple burner as the avenue of water and food the triple burner is the avenue of water and food , and the beginning and end of qi the upper burner extends from below the heart and diaphragm up to the mouth of the stomach it is charge of receiving and it does not discharge it is treated via the tan zhong point ren the middle burner is located at the central duct of the stomach zhongwan it does not extend any further up or down it controls the processing of water and food and it is treated at the sides of the umbilicus st ? the lower burner starts above the upper opening of the bladder it separates the clear from turbid it controls discharge and it does not intake it acts as a transmitter it is treated one inch below the umbilicus ren or ren ? hence , one speaks of three burners it collects at streets of qi qijie , st this chapter mentions three aspects of the tripe burner first , the triple burner as the avenue of water and food secondly , the triple burner as the beginning and end of qi thirdly , the triple burner as a three fold division of the body this chapter of the nan jing clearly relates the three burners to a system of food and fluid digestion , transportation , transportation and excretion therefore this function of the triple burner would encompass that of the stomach , intestines and bladder note that this function of the triple burner really has little to do with the triple burner channel in the arm in other words we do not stimulate the transportation , transformation and excretion of food and fluids through the triple burner channel but mostly through ren mai points ren shanzhong for the upper burner , ren zhongwan for the middle burner and ren for the lower burner of course , there are other points too that affect the digestion function of the triple burner , such as st tianshu for example these will be listed below from the point of view of the triple burner as the organ of transformation of fluids and food , there is therefore a convergence of views between the concept of triple burner in the nei jing and that in the nan jing , i e between the triple burner as an organ and the triple burner as a function , even though the starting point of these two classics is different however , the nei jing emphasizes the role of the triple burner in its letting out function , seeing the three burners as three avenues of excretion or letting out the nan jing , on the contrary , places emphasis on the function of receiving , rotting and ripening and excretion of food and fluids , seeing digestion as a process of qi transformation activated by the yuan qi through the intermediary action of the triple burner chapter of the su wen which describes the functions of all the internal organs comparing them to officials , says the triple burner is the official in charge of ditches this means , that just like the government official who is in charge of irrigation , the triple burner is responsible for the transformation , transportation and excretion of fluids this is one of the most important functions of the triple burner the terms used in chinese in connection with the triple burner influence on the body fluids are often shu which means free flow and tong which means free passage therefore the triple burner is like a system of canals and waterways to channel irrigation water through the proper fields and then out this ensures that body fluids are transformed , transported and excreted properly the triple burner function in relation to body fluids is closely dependent on its function of controlling the transportation and penetration of qi see point below as described below , the triple burner influences the ascending descending and entering exiting of qi in the qi mechanism it is the coordinated and harmonized ascending descending and entering exiting of qi in all organs and structures that ensures that the body fluids also ascend descend and enter exit in the proper way in all places essentially , the transformation and movement of fluids depends on qi the end result of the complex process of transformation , transportation and excretion of fluids leads to the formation of various body fluids in each of the three burners the fluids of the upper burner are primarily sweat which flows in the space between skin and muscles those of the middle burner are the fluids produced by the stomach which moisten the body and integrate blood those of the lower burner are primarily urine and the small amount of fluids in the stools i the upper burner is like a mist the main physiological process of the upper burner is that of distribution of fluids all over the body in the space between skin and muscles by the lungs in the form of fine vapour this is an aspect of the lung diffusing function for this reason the upper burner is compared to a mist the ling shu in chapter says the upper burner opens outwards , spreads the flavours of the food essences , pervades the skin , fills the body , moistens the skin and it is like mist ii the middle burner is like a maceration chamber the main physiological processes in the middle burner are those of digestion and transportation of food and drink described as rotting and ripening and the transportation of the nourishment extracted from food to all parts of the body for this reason the middle burner is compared to a maceration chamber or a bubbling cauldron the ling shu in chapter says the middle burner is situated in the stomach it receives qi , expels the wastes , steams the body fluids , transforms the refined essences of food and connects upwards with the lungs iii the lower burner is like a ditch the main physiological process in the lower burner is that of separation of the essences of food into a clean and dirty part , with the excretion of the dirty part in particular , the lower burner directs the separation of the clean from the dirty part of the fluids and facilitates the excretion of urine for this reason the lower burner is compared to a drainage ditch the ling shu in chapter says food and drink first enter the stomach , the waste products go to the large intestine in the lower burner which oozes downwards , secretes the fluids and transmits them to the bladder clinical application there are many points that stimulate the triple burner s transformation and excretion of fluids i will list them according to each burner upper burner ren shanzhong , lu lieque , l i pianli , l i hegu , du renzhong also called shuigou , i e water ditch middle burner ren zhongwan , st liangmen , ren shuifen , ren jianli , st guanmen , bl pishu lower burner ren shimen , bl sanjiaoshu , st shuidao , bl shenshu , ren qihai , sp yinlingquan , sp sanyinjiao , ki fuliu , bl weiyang when fluids stagnate , dampness , phlegm or oedema may arise in order to activate the triple burner to move fluids , i activate each burner using some of the points above , using more points from the burner where the fluids stagnate for example , if there is dampness in the lower burner , i would use several points from those of the lower burner plus one or two from the upper and middle burner this usually means that when i stimulate the transformation , transportation and excretion of fluids , i do not hesitate in using more points than i would normally for example , if there is dampness in the lower burner causing a urinary problem i would use these points lower burner ren , ren , bl , bl , sp , bl middle burner ren upper burner lu to give an example from the middle burner , if there was phlegm in the stomach , i would use these points middle burner ren , ren , st , bl , ren upper burner l i lower
