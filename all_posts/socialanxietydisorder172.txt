ill read whatever you have to type , not matter how long i want to know about this because i am pretty sure i ve got a mental illness and bipolar is on the top of my list of what s likely and im not an idiot , i know i can t just say that i ve got it , i need to see a psychologist but i can t for a while so information would be nice answer everyone has moods like those of bipolar disorder because everyone has mood swings , momentary loss of judgment , likes to go shopping , likes sex , feels down sometimes , gets angry now and then and is hyper on occasion the difference is that all of these symptoms in bipolar are so intense that they interfere with your ability to function think of a pole bipoler with at the center being normal and at one end manic and at the other deep depression most people have swings but stay within to i have fairly severe bipolar but since my psychosis is mild i go from to also depression that comes and goes is not bipolar but just recurring depression , you have to have mania for it to be bipolar you have to go to both ends of the pole rapidly changing emotions or becoming angry or sad easily is not all there is to bipolar that is just having emotions people with bipolar disorder do not just change emotions quickly , they go through periods of depression followed by periods of mania or elevated mood mood affects everything about you your energy level , self esteem , sleep patterns , appetite , sexuality , emotional response , judgment , etc not just your emotions and while rapid cycling is possible , it is rare the average person with bipolar only cycles two or three times a year and the moods last for weeks or months it is considered rapid cycling if they cycle or more times in a year while everyone with bipolar has a different set of symptoms and a different severity of symptoms , this is what bipolar is like for me depression too tired to get out of bed , shower , even to brush my teeth cry all the time , sleep hours a day feelings of self loathing and guilt that drive me to think of suicide but i m to tired to even think about how to go about killing myself it makes you feel small and worthless and completely insignificant it makes you think about how big the world is and how meaningless you are in it and it refuses to let you have any good thoughts or see any good things when you look in the mirror all you see is pain , you don t even see yourself , you don t taste your favorite foods anymore , see that flowers are blooming , whether or not the sun is out , you become so inward that you hardly even notice your surroundings you don t even feel love for people anymore positive thoughts are just not possible it is a deep dark hole with no way out and no light for hope and most of all it makes you feel sooooo alone and even if there were someone who cared about you they would be better off if you killed yourself because all you will ever be is a burden this can last from a couple of weeks to a couple of years mania way too happy ! party girl ! love drink and drugs talk really fast and pressured because my thoughts are going faster than my mouth can keep up with hypersexual like i sleep with strangers and guys i just met on the internet or i masturbate times a day i once became bisexual because there were twice as many people to sleep with down load porn and spend tons of money on sex toys spending sprees i once spent my mortgage money on african violets , yep , on african violets then i got depressed and let them all die quit my job because i wanted my vacation pay for lottery tickets and i was so convinced i would win that i started shopping and writing bad checks because i d be rich as soon as the numbers were drawn decided that i could replace the furnace in my home by myself i mean how hard can it be only sleep or maybe hours a night for months on end and never feel tired in the end i was unemployed , , in debt , and had almost lost my home , which needed a new furnace because i had removed the old one or parts of it anyway this can last for months i also have mixed states when i am depressed and manic at the same time which are truly the worst by body and mind are depressed but there is this undercurrent of energy running all the time i m highly emotional but the emotions tend to be negative guilt and anger i have intrusive thoughts and urges to mutilate myself like wanting to stick my hands in the garbage disposal or cooking them on the bbq , and i also have psychotic episodes where i hallucinate this is when i am most suseptible to suicide because i am depressed , wanting to hurt myself , and i have the mental energy to plan and carry it out question what is the dating outlook for a thirty five year old man with bipolar disorder ?
