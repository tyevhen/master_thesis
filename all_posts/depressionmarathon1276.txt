here is the summary of my seventh week of training for the garry bjorklund half marathon it was an interesting week the weather could not make up its mind whether it was spring , summer or winter ! my brain was tired one day , my legs tired the next multiple motivational naps were necessary but i persevered ! week seven april , ran days miles long run miles split into shorter runs speedwork miles at tempo pace hills x seconds each miles each found money i was even able to run and swim yesterday , and swimming felt easy ! who would have ever thought i 'd say that ! feel my legs are getting stronger , but that right achilles tendon is starting to whisper , too i 'll have to keep an eye on that from here on out have a happy , safe and injury free week , everyone !
