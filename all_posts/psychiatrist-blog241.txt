i'm not a psychoanalyst and i 've never been in analysis however , our blogger world friend , psychpractice , is a psychoanalyst in new york , and she has a post up on what becoming a psychoanalyst entails i think the final answer is an enormous amount of time and money see her blog post , the couch , first session psychpractice writes i interviewed with different analysts , times each i do n't remember for sure , but i think each of the interviews lasted at least an hour , maybe minutes or it might have just felt that long the first interview with each analyst was a get to know me session the second involved more getting to know me , following up on things i spoke about the first time around and i also had to present a case , which seems like it would be the hardest part , but it was n't it was the easiest i bought two suits i wore one to the first interview with dr g , and the other to the first interview with dr e then i had them dry cleaned , and i switched off for the second interviews i also prepared two different therapy cases , each of which reflected certain challenges , and the ways in which i work with patients , and my ability to think analytically i had a lot of internal debate about how i wanted to come across specifically , just how neurotic did i want to appear too much , and they 'd think i was unstable too little , and they 'd know i was lying i had an intuitive sense that i was about the right amount of neurotic for this kind of training you do n't train to be an analyst if you 're not at least a little screwed up but i wanted to make sure to seem like it i discovered pretty quickly that how i wanted to seem was irrelevant and that discovery made me want to do psychoanalytic training all the more because the people i interviewed with did not shy away from asking difficult questions about my family , my motivations , my conflicts and they did not settle for pat answers and they pursued important topics and they did so with kindness and without judgement and i realized that i wanted to be able to do what they were doing wow , psychpractice has her suits dry cleaned each time she wears them ? ! does everyone else do that ? even if nothing gets spilled on them ? all kidding aside , i found her post to be interesting and enlightening
