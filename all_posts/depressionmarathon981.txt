i had no business running a race today , but i did it was the local , annual women 's miler , and a lot of very fast runners showed up ! i decided to run it last night although i'm in no shape to race , i'm hoping this race will springboard me into more regular training it 's a get back on track technique i 've used in the past with some success racing when i'm not prepared also carries some risk , but today i decided the potential positives outweighed the negatives so i ran a race today the primary risk of running today was poor performance there was the possibility of performing so poorly that i 'd feel defeated beyond measure fortunately , that did n't happen i did n't perform great i did n't perform up to my expectations in fact , i worked so hard and was in so much agony , i had to hold back tears at the finish line but in reality , my performance was not poor i was out dueled over the final miles by a friend in my age group , and i did feel defeated that was very frustrating i usually enjoy such duels whether i win them or not i usually enjoy the mental games and psychic toughness required to even participate in a duel , but today it was just hard today it was just work , and i could n't wait for it to be over nonetheless , i stuck with it sticking it out was definitely an accomplishment to stick it out i had to put up with a barrage of negative self talk lots of if onlys today if only my mood had n't been in the toilet lately if only i was training more consistently if only i was lighter and less fatigued blah , blah , blah my brain worked overtime throughout the race ! nevertheless , i held back my finish line tears by reminding myself that running in and of itself was an accomplishment and in the end , i did n't run terribly i ran like someone who has n't been training regularly i ran like someone who 's felt bad , been tired , and feels heavy i ran a and finished th out of runners i'm trying not to write about how fast i used to run this race instead i will say this , i ran fairly well today despite the pain , i felt good in the end i 've spent much of the rest of this day in bed , wiped out from the effort , but the positives did outweigh the negatives today i'm happy about that hopefully , this will be more than a blip on the map hopefully , this race will mark the beginning of feeling better and of running regularly again
