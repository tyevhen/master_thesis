here 's a rare poem in my recovery , as i have n't been able to write a lick no need for a narrator the shadow of a raven s wing sweeps across the garden like a scythe hummingbirds sample the centranthus , hearts beating a thousand times a minute , prehensile beaks straining for nectar , sucking twice their weight in a day bumblebees hover in poppies , those frilly bowls of pink whose bottom petals are marked with four bloody dots for two days of high summer they bloom until the northwest wind strips them , leaving green bulbs behind , strange spheres suspended on pipe cleaner stems not opium poppies although their milk is just as bitter himalayan blackberry , each purple branch thick with thorns , encroaches on the buddleia they will smother anything if not pruned back gloves help but not enough a heron flies over , gangly in flight , its thin legs trailing wasp like beneath the great gray wings its bullhorn honk silences sparrows , even the ubiquitous squawking of jays no need for a narrator in listening for the thrush and the call of sea lions echoing up the dell above the ocean s thrumming all anthropostulates have disappeared as to my mental state , to my great surprise , i had a good day yesterday , though i did n't do anything different the new antipsychotic medication , combined with a therapy session where , through my thick neanderthal skull , the therapist managed to communicate to me that i had a choice , may have something to do with it i am not merely a molecule in brownian motion this molecule can choose she also pointed out that i had taken my marbles and gone home , said fuck you ! to the universe , that i refused to do anything required of me beyond absolute necessity i concur i do walk the dog , take out the trash , last night i cooked nevertheless i am much like a self centered infant who wo n't have his freedom abridged by potty training or any other requirement or limitation of my oral gratifying , chain smoking self i do still go in the toilet ce
