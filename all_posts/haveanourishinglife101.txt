ingrained in every woman s heart is the desire to be a mother however , not everyone is called to be a mother some women become nuns , sisters , or consecrated lay women and live out a spiritual motherhood and some women are never able to have their own children due to medical reasons yet , adoption is becoming more and more popular and accessible which is awesome , in my opinion personally , i realize that i have a deep desire to be a mother yet , this knowledge does not take away my fear of motherhood if anything , it makes me even more afraid i ll give you two examples of what i worry about when it comes to having kids my first major concern is my scary what if thinking i am worried that i will not able to handle having kids that i would be in the middle of life , throw up my hands , and run away from it all because i was having a break down i am scared i will quit when it matters the most i know kids can be a lot of work i know they can really stress you out and i know they can take a lot out of you i heard someone recently refer to them as life suckers i have these scary thoughts about being a mom i am afraid of hurting my kids i am afraid of leaving them at a park and running away i am afraid of injuring them , or even killing them , if i can t handle it i am afraid of going crazy and messing up my children for life i am afraid of being a failure and , most of all , i am afraid of not being a perfect mom i have so many expectations to live up to i have so many ideals of what my perfect life has to be like what if i didn t live up to my standards ? what would people think of me ? the anxiety tapes that i have talked about before have helped me to confront my issues with these anxieties and scary what if thoughts ok , so i have these thoughts they re just thoughts i also learned helpful coping skills to get me through the most difficult times when fear is rolling over and over my brain it s called the seven steps to calm , click here for more info most importantly , i learned that many other people have the same worries that i do maybe , you are one of them many mothers have gone through the same scary thoughts about having kids and come out on the other side it is such a relief to know that i am not the only one with these twisted , messed up thoughts also , the tapes helped me realize that even though i have scary what if thoughts , doesn t mean i am going to act on them i ve learned to separate myself from my thoughts thoughts come and go , like the weather i cannot control them thoughts do not determine who i am my thoughts do not dictate my actions just because i have scary what if thoughts doesn t mean i have to obey them my second major concern is my eating disorder history body image issues to put it lightly , well , i am deathly afraid of gaining weight pregnancy is going to be a challenge if only for the growing belly i have always been concerned about my appearance and my weight , so this is no surprise to me i heard something a while ago that really struck me i can t stop thinking about this phrase when i think about being pregnant my body is not my own i read this line while reading my child , i love you blog and it hit me right smack dab in the heart i have such high expectations of myself to look a certain way it s been this goal that i ve wanted to accomplish ever since i was young i ve always tried very hard to be thin , to fit in a certain size , to be in shape , to run many miles , and to look a particular way this thin goal is a goal that offers empty promises it won t make me ultimately happy when it comes down to it , i have to remind myself that i am still going to get old like everyone else i am still going to die like everyone else i am still going to have to give an account for my life when i die well , god , i did fit into a size when i was doesn t that count for something ? sorry , sister , i don t think so i think the desire to be thin is a temptation from el diablo himself this thin ideal is an unrealistic , unattainable goal however , it takes up so much of our time , energy , and resources i believe the devil uses this trick to distract us from what really matters i will still respect my body because i am a child of god no matter how old i am , i am still his daughter i still belong to him and he has a purpose for my life god has given me this body for a reason he has given me life for a reason god has given me this body to be a mother not a supermodel my body is not my own remembering this phrase will help me to cope with pregnancy struggles when if that time comes god knows i am going to struggle i am going to have ups and downs and everything in between but , i know he knows what he is doing and that is a huge relief
