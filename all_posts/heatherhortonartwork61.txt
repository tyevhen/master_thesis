a view from the ferry , en route to vancouver island how badly i want that nameless thing ! first there must be an idea , a feeling maybe it was an abstract idea that you 've got to find a symbol for , or maybe it was a concrete form that you have to simplify or distort to meet your ends , but that starting point must pervade the whole emily carr there 's nothing like waking up with the sun in your eyes , and i mean that in a good way waking up with the sun in your eyes in a new city is even better in this case it is whitehorse in the yukon i am here on assignment for the next month and if this morning is any indication , it is going to be one heck of a beautiful month i arrived late last night from vancouver , where i have spent the last week i also ferried over to duncan on vancouver island to see my friend anne it has been two years since we have spent time together and it was such a pleasure to see her and her family once again cherry blossoms were out all over vancouver , lining the streets in pink petals i 'll try to keep my rhapsodizing about the western canada to a minimum here but each time i visit i fall more and more in love with this side of the country maybe it is n't the west , but the coast , as i the east coast of canada has it 's quality of unparalleled beauty the mountain trail that i ran walked each day i was in duncan the intent of this five week journey is multi faceted to reunite with friends , to paint , to write and to shoot reference for future paintings i have three commissions lined up , and this is a lovely part of being a painter you are creating something special for friends and clients , something they will always have and that is unique to their lives and history it is their vision , and as creatives we are a conduit to making that happen the best commissions are the ones where the clients give me carte blanche they say , here is the subject , i trust your vision do what you do how liberating ! nothing beats that feeling the view down from mount tzouhalem , the mountain that anne lives on looking up while on a walk through the forest intoxicating the weather in vancouver was cool and refreshing it was wonderful to revisit the neighbourhoods that i enjoy so much kitsilano and the west end i took the ferry over to nanaimo and stayed in duncan for three nights , each day going for a hike or run on the mountain trails behind anne 's house i remember distinctly going into town with anne 's son and her husband , and sticking my head out the back window to smell the air it was perfumed with the scent of flowers and spring it was remarkable i can see why they say that our sense of smell is most strongly tied to memory nefertiti , one of ian 's lovely cats whose company i will enjoy very much over the next month now i am in whitehorse , arriving late last night i can hardly wait to explore this part of the country waking up to snow capped mountains , fresh coffee and the promise of the unknown drives many a person , many an artist , many an explorer my main objective is to take care of my three feline charges , nefertiti , sneggy and pumpkin that , along with painting and working on the book about christopher mccandless will make the four weeks fly by i am thrilled to be underway in the north some of the changing faces of the landscape behind anne 's house in duncan , bc the only people for me are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be saved , desirous of everything at the same time , the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn , like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars jack kerouac
