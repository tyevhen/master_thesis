in a comment to how dinah thinks , i noted i'm starting to think that everyone is dinah 's neighbor , to which dinah queried , who else is my neighbor ? here 's my count just from a quick search of our blogs for neighbor hits how dinah thinks i liked that he starts by discussing the work of debra roter who studies doctor patient communication patterns why ? because debra is my friend and neighbor and it 's always fun to stumble across someone i know on the pages of a book my assorted thoughts on tara parker pope 's wellness blog today not long ago she wrote about headaches and referenced my neighbor , the johns hopkins migraine king a man with beautiful gardens , a lovely wife , who run circles around our neighborhood for exercise , but my conversation with him has been limited to mutual nods the shrink next door that being said , i ca n't say that i 've ever gone to my mechanic neighbor for car advice or to my hair stylist neighbor for coloring advice although dinah probably thinks i should but that 's not because i do n't think they 'd help me if i asked for it is it worth it ? she talks about the recommendations of david bucholz , the hopkins migraine guru and my neighbor avoidance of medications that can lead to rebound headaches and a diet devoid of food i'm kidding of course , but apparently caffeine , pizza , beer , and chocolate the foods shrink rappers love are out random facts x co bloggers my husband is not a transvestite , which was called into question by our neighbors okay , not so specific with this one when i published a novel that opened with a social worker stumbling upon her husband cross dressed risky business i did n't know dr fenton , i do n't think i even knew of him , but i learned of his death at a labor day barbeque i hosted , from one of my neighbors who is also a schizophrenia researcher and who did know him even if i do n't wrestle with crocs for a living , the reality remains that people with psychosis can behave in unpredictable ways as a child , i lived across the street from a neurologist his office was across the hall from a psychiatrist and one day , a patient walked in and shot and killed the psychiatrist needless to say , my mother thought i should consider another career i ca n't believe that i must be so bored to be blogging about dinah 's neighbors maybe i 'll do one on that new ptsd genetics study , instead or maybe about the recent passing of one of psychiatry 's giants , frank ayd i know , i 've also got the ray depaulo podcast to do , and work on the book thank you for all your comments , thoughts , and ideas about our book , btw we really appreciate the feedback dinah is always more than willing to help me keep my to do list filled just think if we were married
