hi all ! still sick over here to varying degrees , but it sucks nevertheless paige has been begging for weeks to have her hair cut short gasp ! ! ! and i figured we 'd take her for a trim but she wanted it cut short and much to my chagrin we went ahead and had it done she sat so nicely the whole time and never fussed or fretted she just sat quietly and did she was told she looks so sweet and she loves it she 's very proud and pleased i secretly cried at least i saved a lock of what was left behind of her babyhood that was scattered on the floor and time marches on here are some pictures to commemorate the day her curls are still there the stylist just gave her a blow out after she gets out of the bath , her hair is a mass of curls , thank goodness ! save
