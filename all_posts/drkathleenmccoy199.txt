a year ago , i started this blog with an invitation to come together to celebrate midlife and beyond i had no idea what blogging would be like oh , i had certain goals my literary agent wanted me to blog to increase my online presence i wanted to find my own voice again as a writer after more than forty years of writing to assignment and to varying formulas in preparation for writing a memoir , i wanted to practice and increase my comfort level with writing in the first person after many years of keeping my own stories inside first as a journalist , then as a psychotherapist in preparation for writing a book about my therapy cats , i wanted to try writing occasionally about cats my own and others in a way that was heartfelt but not cloying to varying degrees , i 've realized those objectives but there has been so much more i had no idea that my readership would be world wide i had no idea how many wonderful writers , thinkers , humorists and new friends were in the blogosphere i had no idea how much i would come to treasure each one and the warmth of the blogging community i had no idea how much fun it would be ! i had no idea that blogging would come to be a pleasant and worthwhile experience on its own instead of merely a stepping stone to another goal i had no idea how much i would look forward to another year of blogging thank you all for making this past year such a pleasure ! i look forward to many more shared thoughts , stories and adventures in the next year !
