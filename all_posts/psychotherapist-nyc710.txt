clients often come to me with longstanding problems that they have been unable to overcome often , these clients have had many years of talk therapy they might have gained some intellectual insight into their problems , but the problems still persist they usually feel frustrated and discouraged by the time i see them as a therapist who uses mind body oriented psychotherapy , i have discovered that using hypnoprojectives during clinical hypnosis often alleviates problems that have resisted change for many years a hypnoprojectives is a technique that is used in clinical hypnosis where a client , who is in a relaxed hypnotic state , can watch a movie or tv program in his or her imagination about a person who is very much like him or her with a very similar problem in this relaxed state , clients will often come up with creative solutions to their problems that they would never have come up with in their normal state of consciousness there is something about seeing a problem from someone else 's perspective while in this relaxed state that allows a person to see the situation in a new way also , being in a relaxed hypnotic state allows a person access to his or her unconscious where creative solutions often reside as i 've mentioned in prior blog posts , clinical hypnosis is not magic it 's not something that it done to you when you 're in a hypnotic state , you are completely conscious of everything around you and in complete control the entire time if you 're considering clinical hypnosis , always see a licensed mental health professional there are many people who call themselves hypnotists who might be trained in certain hypnotic techniques , but they 're not licensed clinicians if something should come up in the hypnosis that is disturbing , they will not know how to handle it , whereas a licensed mental health professional will be trained for these types of situations i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist who is certified in mind body oriented psychotherapy my specialities include clinical hypnosis , emdr , somatic experiencing and dynamic talk therapy i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website http josephineferrarotherapy com to set up a consultation , call me at
