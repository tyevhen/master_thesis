time to regroup my blog is a very personal place , and because of this , i try to be as open as possible so it s important that i say this i am not doing well right now it s happened in the past two weeks or so and i really can t pinpoint what has pushed me over the edge i am depressed as my close friend and coworker said to me this week when i said i didn t know what i was depressed about , duh ! and she is right , i technically have many many reasons to be stressed , anxious , depressed that being said , what has changed ? i am not dealing with anything new yes , i am starting another round of interventions with nate , yes , it s the beginning of the school year , and yes , we are coming up on the two year anniversary of nate s regression but this is nothing different than what i have been dealing with so what gives ? i had my first individual counseling session in a long time with our marriage counselor yesterday and spent much of the session sobbing as i think about it now the tears are welling up again the last time i was in that room i was in such a good place , feeling so strong that we basically had our termination conversation john and i are going to need long term support we are dealing with way more in our marriage than most and it just helps to have a safe place to hash it all out but at this point it s a maintenance thing , something we can do every weeks or so even through this session , i just couldn t put my finger on what is going on it s really weird , but it came back to the almond bread for nate again after my issue in the grocery store last week , i came home , resolving to make the bread sooner rather than later just to get it over with and to prove to myself that my life would not magically transform back to the crisis period it was in when i was doing this in the past let me put it this way the almond flour has been sitting , untouched , in the food processor for a week now i still can t bring myself to do it so i think my feeling of depression may be stemming from the realization that there will be no end to this when the boys were first diagnosed , i was focused on taking each day as it came , with the hope that there would be recovery well , i guess you could say that emotionally i am settling in for the long haul there will be no quick fix or miraculous intervention there will be at best , slow progress don t get me wrong , this is of course much better than no progress just not what i was praying for my parents took the boys for the night last night john and i spent our first night in our home without children since jack was born years ago what did i do ? watched bridezilla s , stared at the wall , cried , slept john and i shared a meal together , but after that , all i wanted was to be alone bottom line i need to accept the fact that i need a break that i am burnt to a crisp , have compassion fatigue , am ready to throw in the towel , whatever you want to call it last night was nice , and this morning has been peaceful , but i need to accept more help from family , friends , etc i always feel guilty because i am not with my children all day , i am working but that does not count as a break it most certainly is not a break and i am always working on something for the boys while i am doing my job i am never , ever single tasking the boys can benefit from being with other people , and most certainly they will benefit from having a mommy who isn t near tears all the time , like i am now it s time to give some of this over to my husband , to my parents , to my mother in law , to friends this mama is at her breaking point i am finally saying it loud and clear i need some help
