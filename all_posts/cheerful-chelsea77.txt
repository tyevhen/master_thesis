not the best of photos , but a rare good day was captured on an especially bouncy tree ! i may only be years old but i 've come to the point in my life where i need a mid life breather i 've already had to deal with some very testing moments and some dark struggles unfortunately for the past or more years i 've been in pretty poor physical health , my immune system has been shot to pieces and i 've also been experiencing mental health issues i will go on to write more about my mental health in future blog posts as the primary focus of my blog is to address conditions such as social anxiety , panic attacks and depression , all of which i have and still experience daily i'm not expecting a huge following of this blog , if i could help just one person feeling a bit lost , struggling with the pressures of daily life in our hectic modern world , i 'd be ecstatic i think this is what was missing when i was a young girl struggling each day feeling incredibly low without knowing why , i 'd see other people my age having the time of their lives , living without fear , living in the moment and having fun before heading off to university and the workplace i just did n't understand what was happening to me and why i was different one thing i 've learnt so far in my slow recovery and acceptance of my mental illness , is that difference is brilliant , no two people are exactly the same we all have different qualities , and we search for people with the qualities we lack in ourselves depression has next to no perks as such , but having lived through some incredibly dark days , feeling pretty crap and hopeless means that any good day and good experiences i have will be appreciated so much more now the contrast between the horrific and the good is great obviously i 'd love to help anyone , especially any young people living with mental illness with this blog , but its also an attempt to save myself , to give me something to be held accountable for , to get up for and to occupy some of the time in my belated gap year a href http www bloglovin com blog ? claim wvvtzy follow my blog with bloglovin a
