there 's a story i 've been wanting to tell you i 've been waiting , trying to give it some distance from the real life tale , figuring i 'd get to it i 've been writing it in my head , thinking of ways to manipulate the story to get it to reflect my emotions and my experience while disguising the real story i always feel a bit ill at ease when i write about my experiences with patients , and with this , our nd shrink rap post , i 've only written about real life tales a couple of times i wrote once about a patient who was a criminal , and trust me , my patient would not have recognized himself at least not by description , all that rang true from that post was the following i have a patient in some illegal means of obtaining money and knowing this makes me uncomfortable i could have just written that sentence , purged myself of the feeling for the day , but the story you 'd like to read is in the character , real or fictionalized , who gets us to that point i 've wanted to write a post about resilience and to say , without a vignette , that some people are pretty resilient well , it 's pretty hollow i 'll point out that my pseudonymous co bloggers clinkshrink and roy pretty much never talk about patient encounters , except when clink quotes her patients as saying she walks like a psychiatrist she does so why the fuss ? i 've been thinking about my post for a little bit , feeling ill at ease with the patient part of it yes , the patient will be fictionalized but my response to the tale is not if this particular patient read the very confabulated story on the blog , he might say , hey , you said that to me ! is that wrong ? a lot would be assumed here that someone actually listens to what i say and that i do n't say the same things to lots of patients umm , actually i reuse lines a lot the human condition bears lots of similarities amongst it 's members and if i can find something to say that resonates or offers comfort , you bet i'm recycling it , and that it would trouble a patient if i talked about what amounts to my is n't that interesting ? feeling about someone 's session or condition and so as i was about to post about resilience , i came upon ad libitum 's post on blogging about patients it violates confidentiality , it can erode trust , the physician becomes distracted by his never ending search for bloggable stories , the patient really owns the story and when the blog gets turned into a book movie , the patient does not share in the royalties huh ? if only ad libitum says we should obtain consent from the patient , make the patient unrecognizable or an amalgam , and best of all we should not blog about patients there are a lot of rules here , and these folks are blogging anonymously then came grunt doc who calls ad libitum a professional scold it 's okay , he says , to blog about patients who are sufficiently disguised , stories are shared , and so little of our lives are blog worthy that we wo n't be distracted anyway so how come it 's okay for patients to blog about their psychiatrists , without disguise , without permission , without hesitation ? interesting stuff to think about i think i 'll hold off on that resilience tale for yet another day
