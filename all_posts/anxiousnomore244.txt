picture of my backyard at am this morning i woke up early with a strong sensation of anxiety again i tried to fall back asleep and ignore it but it kept waking me up every minutes i was so grateful when my alarm went off and i knew i could start the day and shake it off i saw one of my affirmations on my bathroom mirror and that perked my spirits a bit it still wears on me though i did n't eat very much for breakfast today , and i feel tired from having such a disrupted night 's sleep i found a link to a really cool article on another blogger 's site about morning anxiety and i want to try to implement a couple of it 's suggestions to try to eliminate my morning anxiety one thing i definitely need to improve on is getting ready for the morning the night before i am always late to work and that would n't happen as often if i knew ahead of time what i was going to wear , etc something i could aspire to is waking up earlier and doing yoga before i go to work instead of after work in reality i know i do n't have the commitment i would need to actually do that , but it sounds nice i 'll think about that one some more , and maybe try it out for a little while this article also makes me want to buy new bed linens and i have a great excuse to do so ! ikea here i come ! i might also look into getting a little notebook to leave by the bed so when i wake up with those feelings i can jot down whatever it is that i am thinking its good to know that i have already implemented some of the suggestions such as the positive affirmations those really seem to help me shake off any anxiety so that it is manageable , maybe at a level on the anxiety scale or below those have made the biggest difference for me out of all the lifestyle changes that i have made i wonder if one reason i have morning anxiety is because of my anticipatory anxiety about starting the day all over update some additional and even more helpful posts on morning anxiety as i have continued to work through it even more about morning anxiety more about morning anxiety if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like level panic today what to do when feeling overwhelmed do n't have time for a game plan ? do n't back down , but be prevent panic have a game plan linkwithin
