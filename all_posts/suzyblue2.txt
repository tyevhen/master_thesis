ahh , new year the time where most of us wilfully vow to better ourselves whether that be through diet , lifestyle , personal finances i definitely need to jump on board that bandwagon or through a long list of regretful resolutions we know deep down we wo n't stick to past april flashback to the year i tried to give up fast food i lasted weeks in , i hold my hands up and admit i got lazy there was countless tasks i started but did n't finish , lifestyle choices i was so excited about , but only stuck to for about a month , and endless evenings and days off spent basking in my own little sloth world in my cozy corner of the couch under a blanket with a glass of wine in hand so , to curb my lazy tendencies and and habit of procrastinating , i 've decided i need to challenge myself more , and start doing things that i enjoy , things that make me proud of myself and most importantly , things that make me happy so , this year , instead of laying down strict , and admittedly unrealistic new year 's resolutions , i 've decided to set out a handful of personal goals i 'd like to achieve this year without putting any dates , deadlines or pressure on myself to be the best , most amazing , superhuman version of myself by the end of ! so , lets jump in eat better towards the end of , i changed my eating habits dramatically being completely honest , this was mostly due to a wager i had with my boyfriend that i could n't get in the shape i wanted to by december side note he loves me the way i am but was sick of me crying over ripped insta models and wishing my bloated belly away without actually doing anything about it after successfully eating much better , exercising and noticing changes in my body the good kind which made me feel so much more confident , i had proved to myself that the body image i longed for which i previously thought was so unattainable , was actually in my sights after all not only that i was physically feeling so much better ! no more stomach aches , strange bowel habits tmi ? and much less fatigue it was only after the christmas indulgence that i noticed just how bad my body feels when i fill it with junk ! so 's first goal is to keep up eating healthily and limiting my takeaway and alcohol intake everything in moderation right ? exercise similar to the above , became the year i attempted exercise after quitting dance at years old , physical exercise of any sort was n't on my radar i was a straight up couch potato , and at almost , i was finally starting to feel the effects bad diet and little exercise had on my body now , i 'd be lying if i said my main goal here was n't to have a shredded banging body , but i'm not going to beat myself up if i do n't get there i'm aiming for minutes of physical exercise a day , days a week doable right ? plus , the effect exercise has on my mental health is second to none i was always sceptical when told going for a run , or working up a sweat would make me feel better but i can wholeheartedly admit that i was totally wrong , and no matter how much i hate working out during the session i always feel better afterwards learn i have a creative mind , and lately i 've been missing learning new skills from a young age i taught myself how to use paint shop pro , then photoshop google image photoshop blends and you 'll see the kind of stuff year old suzy was into , then final cut pro , then adobe after effects and most recently light room yes , i'm a bit of a geek , but i hold the title proudly i love the feeling of mastering a new skill , especially if it helps me out with things i'm passionate about such as social media , blogging and photography this year , not only do i want to expand my skills relating to my blog and social media but i also want to expand my skills in makeup artistry my full time job the skill and technique makeup artists have these days is spectacular , and i'm dying to master the style of looks that are in demand at the moment watch this space ! create that being said i miss making time to actually showcase what i 've created , whether that be posting on my blog , sharing photography on instagram or gulp getting back in to making youtube videos one step at a time ! instead of just messing around and having a thousand practise runs , i want to start putting myself and my content out there again , and feeling confident in doing so nofear so in expect to see more blog posts , more on the gram suzycamlin if you 're interested and perhaps a youtube video or two read i 've seen this goal on a lot of fellow bloggers recent posts but it 's so true ! we are all guilty of reaching for our phones when we 're bored , or spending hours and hours a day mindlessly scrolling though instagram , or having a quick check of twitter before bed and i'm calling it enough is enough this year i am going to make a conscious effort to start reading books again realistically i'm going to try for books this year , and actually take time out of my day to escape to a quiet corner of the house and just read , no distractions say yes sometimes i feel like my anxiety limits me i often skip out on things because i'm afraid , but this year i am really going to try to say yes more there 's no better feeling than completing something you thought you could n't , or walking out of a situation you thought you were n't going to survive in so this year i want to challenge the part of my brain that keeps telling me i ca n't , start telling it i can , and start having more fun ! say no on the flip side , i know my limits i 've definitely been known to be a bit of a pushover , go with the flow type of gal , and this year i am going to stop agreeing to things that i know will make me uncomfortable just to keep face i need to try and learn its ok to be selfish sometimes and there 's no big deal in saying no once in a while okay , so , take what you will from these , if you are anything like me slothlife i hope this ignites some fire and inspiration in you to get up , get out and make your bitch ! until next time , s b x related posts things i 've learned in years suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue
