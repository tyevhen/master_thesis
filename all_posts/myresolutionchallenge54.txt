as i type this post i should be hanging my head in shame , i have been mia for several weeks and neglected my beloved motivational blog however , instead of the shame , i feel slightly exhilarated and refreshed many of you know that november is a crazy writing month for me , as i partake in nanowrimo national novel writing month this year i chose to write the first draft of the final book in my young adult trilogy on november th , i wrote my , th word and declared myself a winner ! i adore this competition it is the perfect platform to keep me one hundred per cent motivated on my writing projects if only i could be this motivated all year round ! so as i uploaded my manuscript and watched as my word count was validated , i began to think about my blog content and the topics i want to look at over the coming months confidence , organising your life and looking after yourself are the themes i will be exploring over december and into the new year but , to write about confidence , and being organised , and before i can attempt to look after myself , i needed to do it , live it and become it back in the summer i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety i ve spent the last few months putting myself back together and using the tools i ve learned over the years as a holistic health practitioner and tutor to help me my anxiety prevented me from leaving the house and so my confidence took a nose dive as a normally active and social individual , this was particularly hard for me to deal with over time , i have worked through this anxiety and pushed myself into situations that would make me uncomfortable a simple night out with friends could cause a string of physical symptoms to flare up popping to the shop turned into an sas mission done only under the cover of darkness my home became a haven where i could lock the door and hide away , but this wasn t helping my situation so , what did i do ? i had to start small pushing myself to get out and about began as a coffee with a friend at home then i worked up to meeting friends at a local coffee shop my sister in law together with my good friend , caroline , arranged a girls night out once a month where the three of us went out for dinner it began to work and my anxiety depleted last weekend , i took my three teenagers to the warner brothers harry potter tour in london this was a full day of trains , buses and busy venues i was so proud of how i coped with everything , even having to stand up for the two hour train journey home , as we were all packed in to the carriages like sardines ! the harry potter tour was truly magical , and it was as i wandered around the film sets that i realised how much fun i was having i d let my anxiety and depression control me instead of me taking control over it of course , it s not always easy to turn your emotions around or switch off from the low feelings , but i now realise that i ve come a long way the wondrous power of a caring family and supportive friends has been amazing too , and i m so grateful to everyone who has helped me over the past few months the magic of harry potter seeped into me as i flourished my newly purchased wand and vowed to allow myself the occasional time out revitalising your soul , chilling out and going back to the beginning are important things to remember when you feel the need to be mia so , i won t hang my head in shame i will relish the experience and be grateful for the darkness because it s only when we live in the shadows that we can appreciate the magic of life harry taught me that !
