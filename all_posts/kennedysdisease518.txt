ed meyertholen , ph d , our new kda president kda wrote the following report on a recent study these are ed s comments on the research report including the potential viability of the treatment for those of us living with kennedy 's disease genistein , a natural product derived from soybeans , ameliorates polyglutamine mediated motor neuron disease research report from sobue s group in japan essentially , genistein is a substance found in soy and may be able to reduce the symptoms of kennedy 's disease kd this is due to the property of genistein to disrupt the association of the androgen receptor with another protein known as ara this allows the cell to remove the ar more efficiently and this , it is argued , may help relieve symptoms of kd aka sbma or spinal bulbar muscular atrophy the group did two major sets of experiments , one in cell models and one in a mouse model of kd the results suggest that genistein reduces the symptoms of kd now , before we all rush out to buy soy products , understand that mice were treated with genistein at weeks , two weeks before symptoms were found to be expressed in untreated kd mice they did not test genistein in mice that already were showing symptoms the genestein did not eliminate the symptoms , it did seem to slow down the progression also , it is not known if it would slow down progression after the onset of symptoms as stated previously , this experiment was not done it is very unlikely that it would reverse symptoms that have already occurred the dose of genestein in the study used was mg kg day of mouse this would mean a typical kg lb man would have to ingest mg of genistein day from what i could find , soy powder has the highest concentration of genestein of all soy products it has a concentration of mg g of soy powder thus , to take in the same amount of genestein as the mice in this experiment , one would have to eat g of soy power per day this is about pounds ! you cannot eat enough soy powder daily to get the small change in symptoms seen in the mice if one buys the purified it is really just enriched genistein , it comes in g tablets one would have to take more than every day and the safe recommended dose is tablets day genistein has side effects talk to your doctor ! just because genistein shows positive effects in mice does not mean it will have that effect in humans conclusion more work needs to be done before getting excited and wasting money on genistein
