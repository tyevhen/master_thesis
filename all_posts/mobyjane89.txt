there is a great unrecognized problem with mania that is causing a great deal of violence and alienation in our society but it may be that events like school shootings , road rage , violent street protests , cop killing , and disgruntled employee shootings will sooner or later call attention to long overlooked mania the way out of mania is the same as the way out of depression brainswitching , directed thinking and meditation also work for mania in general , the public is much more aware of depression than mania because we are more than willing to buy drugs to lessen the pain of even a little depression for ourselves , and the pharmaceutical companies who know this continually bombard us with ad campaigns and info mericials about the least little nuance of anxiety and depression , with a different pill for each nuance pharmaceutical companies are not interested in mania because no one is going to buy medicine for that mania just simply doesn t hurt in fact , it feels good no one wants to cure themselves of feeling good for the most part , we do not recognize our own mania while it is in progress because it is never painful for us in the way that depression is for myself , before i got a good handle on my depression , i believed mania was my good days once i was able to recognize the pain and fear that are the underpinnings of mania , i was able to curtail that kind of thinking and behavior as well
