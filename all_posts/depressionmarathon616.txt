d just left my house he 's on his way home as usual , it was great to see him and difficult to see him go we had another nice weekend together , although his purpose this weekend was to assist me that was his idea he was going to do some work at his lake home this weekend , but he decided to come here instead he thought i needed help , and he wanted to be the helper that was nice i 've been receiving help from several people lately my friend therese has taken puck for several walks and short runs without her , puck would likely be going nuts by now d also took puck for a couple of long walks over the weekend my friend katie arrived at my home thursday morning with four boys and some rakes she and her boys raked my leaves and mowed my lawn my lawn now looks presentable even my parents got into the act my mom made me some good pea soup , three quarters of which i froze , before she and my step dad went south for the winter i'm not used to receiving so much assistance i'm not used to receiving help , and accepting help makes me uncomfortable after all , i'm a pretty independent gal this weekend d kept asking , what can i do for you ? i did n't know what to say he kept making me sit down so he could get me water , or coffee , or whatever i needed i was a little embarrassed when katie was here raking , i could n't sit down i kept wandering around outside , but with me on crutches , there was little i could do i just felt like i should n't sit when so many others were working even when therese is out walking puck , i barely sit it 's silly accepting help is difficult for me i always say thank you , but sometimes that just does n't seem enough i need to work on accepting help gracefully recovering from this knee surgery will give me that opportunity , i guess maybe that 's one of the things i'm supposed to learn while i sit on the sidelines i'm very grateful for the assistance i 've recently received but i ca n't wait until i am again the helper rather than the helpee
