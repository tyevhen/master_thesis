i got to sleep in this morning ! whew after weeks of am , getting up hours later feels luxurious ! it s been a few days since i ve written here i apologize for that i ve been busy , uh meditating ! well , not really , for i still suck at meditation i made it minutes yesterday , but that was the first time i actually attempted meditating this week ! do any of you meditate ? if so , i d love to hear how you got started or what works for you i m supposed to be doing this twice a day , ten minutes each time it s a requirement of this days of yoga course i m taking , and i d really like to learn to do it i just need to get over my reluctance to start , i guess discomfort mental discomfort is never my favorite state to explore i realize i need to quit avoiding the initial discomfort if i hope to bring meditation into my life and i do hope to bring it in i am now convinced it will only improve my state of being like i said , if any of you have suggestions , i am all ears ! thanks !
