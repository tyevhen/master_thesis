so you probably think my parents were a little over indulgent for flying me home at hours' notice and you probably think i'm over dramatic for going on and on about my unhappiness when i 've been given every opportunity in the world to have a master 's degree well , you 're either partly or completely right i am a rich , lucky , spoiled american who can quit a job to be a full time student without sacrificing a a day coffee habit and that makes me both the scum of the earth and exactly like every other student on my campus so am i redeemed by my pseudo liberal guilt ? i do n't know could that get me into heaven ? maybe , if i can still afford a good lawyer at the end of this but , dear readers , as somebody in the bible once said , to whom more is given , more is expected and for how much i 've been given , i have a universe of expectations to fulfill and since i'm so far not producing a good return , i get a little depressed sometimes ok , signing off i gotta go dig some talents out of the hole i was storing them in
