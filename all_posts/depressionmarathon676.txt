i was supposed to leave last friday , but i was n't ready on saturday i felt ready to go , but the doctor disagreed so i did n't leave i planned on leaving monday after ect , but my treatment team decided it felt too rushed my mood was still too low they encouraged me to stay until at least ect i reluctantly agreed , and here i am i will leave tomorrow i will leave tomorrow at pm to be exact ! and i do think i will be ready to go it will be day of this hospitalization by the time i walk out the door i will have spent three of the last four weeks in an inpatient psychiatric unit it was n't my plan i think back to early february , to my sobriety anniversary party , and to how great i was feeling then to how great i had been feeling for months ! it was only a few short weeks later when this depression episode , this relapse , began ironic and amazing it just goes to show how rapidly this illness can drag a person down i do feel better today the mood dive that began last thursday seems to have lifted a bit i felt lighter after my treatment yesterday , and despite not sleeping well last night , i still feel lighter today i am freaked out by how much fitness i am losing lying around in here , but even that makes me think i'm getting better i did n't care enough to be freaked out about it last week i am going to try to run on the treadmill today , but i ca n't wait to get back outside ! tomorrow i will be back outside tomorrow and the next time you hear from me , i will be free free of the confines of this healing place , and hopefully free of more of the darkness of the past weeks
