you know what they say about the best laid plans i had planned to go home yesterday i was packed and ready then the doctor came in she did n't like how sad i had been she was concerned about my thinking she did n't see the need to rush out the door she did n't let me leave instead , i am here until at least monday , when i will have my fifth ect treatment i say at least because i do n't know if i 'll be allowed to go tomorrow either my mood has really been in the tank since thursday , and that seems to be of great concern i guess that makes sense despite it making sense , i'm not happy to still be here my low mood is greatly concerning to me , too , but i still want to go home fortunately , the md gave me a pass yesterday to go for a minute run outside with a friend passes are rarely allowed these days , so i felt very fortunate to be outdoors , freely running , breathing fresh air , and sharing time with my friend i ca n't wait to get out of here and do it again ! i hope to get out of here tomorrow i'm not sure what else i can accomplish here that i could n't accomplish as an outpatient yes , as i was sobbing myself to sleep last night , it was nice to have someone sit with me but i can sob myself to sleep without a sitter as well if i have to sob myself to sleep , i 'd rather do it in a comfortable bed like i said , i am sad just plain sad i wonder when this episode will end i worry this episode will have no end i am trying to stay positive trying to stay present , but it 's tough keeping those negative thoughts at bay i pray for a boost in my mood soon as more and more time passes , i feel more and more disappointed and discouraged i want to be better i want to get back to my life i want to feel like me again i do n't want to feel so sad i do n't want to feel so sad
