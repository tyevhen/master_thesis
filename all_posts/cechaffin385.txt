my nascent thought posted last night regarding inductive vs deductive poetry needs some fleshing out first , i did not give any examples of inductive poets william carlos williams has to lead the pack , with gary snyder , frank o'hara , charles bukowski , wordsworth to some extent robert lowell late in his career life sketches , and from what i 've read of franz wright i might include him , and certainly the entire canon of chinese poetry , where emotion is provoked by events or surroundings that is , events and surroundings are not used to support an emotion the emotion arises from them keats was a deductive poet we should not be fooled by his ode to a grecian urn , where he is not responding to an experience so much as transmogrifying an icon the eve of st agnes and lamia are more typical poems organized around a legend or narrative , not in response to experience hopkins tried to get at nature through inscape , but even so his work is so doused in christianity that he cannot be considered inductive basically , confining ourselves to the west , deductive poetry ruled until the twentieth century donne and milton and jonson were all deductive , so was herbert sir walter scott epitomizes the deductive poet as he strives to communicate romances in verse ginsberg is an odd duck in a california supermarket is certainly an inductive poem , though a paean to whitman but ginsberg is best known for his deductive work , as in howl , where images are used to support his emotion , that emotion not being a response to immediate experience , but to years of psychic pain whitman is another odd duck he seems to be writing inductive poetry , reacting to nature and man , until he assumes that mystic voice where he merges with all , indeed , becomes all so he is inductive and deductive , because of the strong influence of transcendentalism throughout his work pound championed eastern verse in his youth and wrote some inductive poetry , but his cantos are primarily deductive , where his substance becomes almost preachy at times not to mention disconnected in summary , then , like rhyme , deductive poetry ruled poetry in english until the late twentieth century , with williams and lowell as pioneers and snyder and the rest following behind what i read in current literary journals strikes me as inductive nowadays inductive poetry is expected by teachers of creative writing that 's not real , they may say that does n't ring true or , have you ever actually seen an otter ? then you have no business writing about one i satirized this view in my poem , at the workshop anyway , i 'll continue to flesh out this thought until i can cobble an essay out of it i 've never written an essay this way , except for the interlocutions of my dear wife but here in a blog format anyone can help me , provide further examples , or simply tell me i'm full of shit which , of course , i am but just because my opinions may stink does n't necessarily make them untrue thine , ce
