depression is an illness it is not who you are i do n't have any other way to describe it other than saying , depression is a disease in your brain it 's complex , it 's confusing , and because of this , frustrating , but it 's there depression is not laziness depression is not ingratitude depression is not selfishness when you are suffering from depression , you are not a bad person depression attacks the brain and causes all sorts of problems that you cannot control , no matter how hard you try i actively tried to heal myself of depression for eight and a half years i dieted hard core i exercised my butt off , literally i took vitamins and supplements i ate so many gosh forsaken vegetables i meditated i prayed so hard i got callouses on my knees i graduated college i excelled at job after job i fell in love i got married i gave up smoking i gave up alcohol i gave up coffee i ran a marathon i volunteered gosh darn it , i did everything right you want to tell me i did n't try hard enough ? i 'll punch you in the face some people might even try to tell me that i tried too hard i just read several articles about the science of depression trying to formulate a summary when i sat down this morning , i was going to write a technological post that highlighted the facts that depression is a real medical problem however , i remembered feeling like those kind of articles really did n't help me when i was in the trenches what helped me was knowing that the proof was out there , and once my brain was healthy again , i could go back and read and understand if you want to read something sciencey , read this article from harvard health publications harvard , y'all let me remind you and myself over and over and over that i have an illness , and i am not just an awful person or lazy or spoiled or the worst kind of sinner depression is a real medical disease when you are suffering from depression , you are not the sum of what depression tells you that you are you are not the sum of your symptoms you are not the sum of what other people think of you similarly , but obviously obviously obviously way different , someone does not choose to have cancer it happens to you could you imagine telling someone with cancer that it 's their fault ? how heartbreaking would it be to hear someone say to someone with cancer that if you just would have done some things differently , you would n't have this health issue or that you could be cured of it if you just changed your attitude and tried harder try telling someone with cancer that god gave you this suffering and you just have to offer it up try telling someone with cancer that it 's situational and once you get a job , or move , or find love , or volunteer you 'll feel better i know cancer is a million bazillion times different than depression i will not pretend to understand cancer i have absolutely no idea what having cancer would be like i have absolutely no idea how difficult it must be but please let me draw the comparison that depression is like cancer in the way that you do n't choose to have it no one would ever choose cancer no one would ever choose depression you ca n't let cancer go and see if it goes away you ca n't let depression go and see if it goes away you need medical help , whatever that might be seriously , no one would choose depression no one is choosing not to just get over depression people who are suffering from depression are some of the strongest , most committed , most compassionate , most caring , most generous , most loyal people you will ever meet it is likely that they have lived through hell all alone without any support finally getting help for depression does not mean that you are giving up , it does not mean that you are a failure getting help for depression means you are acknowledging the great mercy of god i believe god allows bad things to happen so that a greater good can come from it he also works though other people and gives us the tools to help does he reach down his hand and cure someone right out in a dramatically miraculous way ? yes but , i also believe that he works his miracles through the means he gives us i think prozac is a miracle it has miraculously changed my life in the past , i thought i would die i wanted to die medicine saved my life i am not a failure for taking medicine i am not weak for taking medicine i am acknowledging god 's mercy and i will humbly take this little tiny pill because it helps me do n't tell me it 's all in my head i know it 's all in my head my brain is suffering , my brain is flawed , my brain does not work the same way other people 's brains work , and my brain needs help depression symptoms actually make you feel like a failure the symptoms actually cause you to think that you are a lazy , selfish , irresponsible , weak , angry , emotional , down right awful person depression makes you feel like other people think you are a failure too , whether they do or do n't something goes wrong in your brain it could be sudden or gradual the brain is so complicated i do n't know all the scientific facts and i'm sure that we , as a society , have not yet learned all there is to know about the human body but we do know that depression is an illness getting medical help for depression can save your life
