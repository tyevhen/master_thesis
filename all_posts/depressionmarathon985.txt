perhaps i mentioned this just a few days ago i know i 've written about it in the past it 's disinterest , and it is one of the subtle , invisible symptoms of this illness disinterest , unlike many of depression 's manifestations , is quiet and sneaky it hangs in the background a backdrop for depression 's more visible symptoms it is noticeable only when i notice the absence of other states the absence of interest , the absence of concern , the absence of opinion , joy , anger , or pain disinterest is not as blatant as the tears of sadness it does n't rattle the soul like anxiousness it does n't send me to bed like fatigue disinterest is more subtle than all that absence marks its presence disinterest works behind the scenes it 's the reason phone calls have not been returned talking requires interest in what you , or even i , have to say disinterest keeps the running magazines closed , the e mails unread , and the television channels jumping it 's hard to focus or care when one ca n't focus and does n't care that 's disinterest life , when disinterested , lacks meaning , direction , or purpose the body craves relief drinking , drugs , self harm , psychosis , sex anything which alters the monotony is preferable to the disinterested state feeling anything , we think , is better than feeling nothing the body , the brain need that relief it may be a subtle , invisible symptom , but disinterest often leads to very visible scars of relief
