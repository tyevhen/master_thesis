living with kennedy 's disease , or any progressive disorder , is challenging it is also a learning experience it is easy to become caught up in the 'feeling sorry for yourself mode but , all that does is make life for you and your loved ones miserable many years ago i came across this poem , the man in the glass , by peter dale wimbrow , sr when you get what you want in your struggle for self and the world makes you king for a day just go to the mirror and look at yourself and see what that man has to say for it is n't your father , mother or wife whose judgement upon you must pass the fellow whose verdict counts in your life is the one staring back from the glass he s the fellow to please , never mind all the rest , for he s with you clear to the end , and you ve passed your most difficult test , if the man in the glass is your friend you can fool the whole world down the pathway of years , and get pats on the back as you pass , but the final reward will be heartache and tears , if you ve cheated the man in the glass the point of this journey is the journey itself it can only be successful if you live in a way that allows you to enjoy the life you are given
