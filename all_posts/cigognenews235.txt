maybe it is hard to imagine a fetus suffering stress , but when a mother deprives herself of nutrients and the baby suffers , that is called stress he cannot voice it but his stress hormones shout it out all of the time because it may be the first stress , it comes to be what the baby expects and automatically changes his system to adapt to his new environment it is a completely na ve and vulnerable system it may be called first time learning , and it lasts it continues on because this is the world he first meets and he cannot know it can be any different just as if the mother is chronically depressed , where her system is continuously down the baby adapts and maybe years later gets hooked on stimulants , uppers , to galvanize his system which was depressed long ago if the early environment at home is suppressive and highly disciplined while lacking love and touch , we have the makings of a depressive the point is we must not neglect those early beginnings in our understanding of mental illness let s suppose he cannot concentrate in school at age eight this is part of a post traumatic stress response which we cannot see or even imagine he has been damaged in the first weeks of his life just the simple fact of a carrying mother having an eating disorder can disrupt the baby s eating habit later on i have written extensively on epigenetic change for the baby is traumatized even though he cannot show it it becomes imprinted for life it is called prenatal programming a personal experience to demonstrate the point at age five i was smacked repeatedly for crying by my father i remember everything about that event i learned and never cried again until adult life so you see how early life impresses experience into the brain and physical system if that had happened at age , i doubt there would have been such an imprint at age five he was my only friend i knew no one else and nothing else he was my whole world when he smacked me i thought i was wrong and bad it hung onto my system for decades i had no one to complain to and discuss with at that age he was my entire world my mother being psychotic since i have primalled about this , it lasted a very long time and who knows if it didn t play into my later add my system still felt those smacks all my childhood , and prevented me from crying i lived in a barren , sterile world with no love , but that was the only world i knew the earlier the trauma and deeper the imprint with great force so it comes out later as never needing love , never needing touch it reawakens the pain if love comes along thus it is avoided if the carrying mother continues on with crazy diets you can see the damage that it incurs so here we have a field concentrating on there and now while the greatest damage has happened back then how do we now ? as patients approach these very traumas all of the vital signs mount inordinately proper nutrition is one way the mother inculcates love but if she is on drugs , so is the baby the blood vascular system are in many respects , one worse , the baby can be born addicted he needs the drugs later on and if his system has been biochemically depressed , it may militate towards sex problems where libido has been suppressed , as well after all , so many individuals complain that taking pain killer suppresses their libido imagine taking in pain killers at age six months pre birth the dose of the tranquilizer for the baby is many times that for the mother the system begins to adapt to this neuro chemical state and it may be less aggressive , less able get and keep an erection it is all part of the imprint where passivity was life saving when shutting down was the only way to block the input of heavy painkillers if i had to measure how strong the imprint is , i would state that gestation is the most devastating , birth and infancy next , childhood later and then adult life so when we confine our psychotherapy to late years we neglect the key life experiences that formed us , those years when vulnerability to catastrophic afflictions set in this is a short hand observation of what impact life has on us at different epochs of our lives it is the reactions we see in our therapy by patients reliving certain events during different stages of ontogeny that indicate the strength of the pain they suffer and it is nearly always the gestational birth traumas that have a massive impact on us so reliving the lack of touch right after birth is critical , while reliving lack of touch at age thirteen is less critical so we cannot say that here and now therapy is progress in psychotherapy we can say that proper therapy must always address our beginnings
