look at me , bragging on here about how well i 've been doing , how functional i am these days , how i'm going to able to grad school and conquer the world when several months ago i could barely leave the house two weeks ago , before i went to see my counselor who i'm now only seeing twice a month , i told my mom i could probably stop seeing her at the end of the summer now i'm hanging by a thread till my next appointment that 's the trouble with counseling you have a set date and time so when you desperately need someone to talk to , you have no one , but when you feel fine and do n't particularly want to take time out of your day to go talk about who knows what , you have your appointment and squander it just talking about whatever comes to mind because the distressing events of the week before have subsided , along with the long standing issues they brought to the surface i do n't know why i ca n't seem to have a happy life every time i think things have finally turned a corner , i am plunged into darkness again maybe it 's my own fault did i commit some sin that i'm being punished for ? maybe it 's my selfishness i do n't know but i get frustrated seeing other people my age succeeding , winning their heart 's desires , finding their soul mate , falling in love , having people love them , gaining lots of friends , and i seem to fall so very short of everyone 's expectations i have my heart set on this grad school program , but maybe it 's poisoning my life ever since i went to the thesis presentations , i 've been miserable , anxious , and stressed i read the profiles of previous fellows and think , oh my gosh , how can i ever compare to these people ? ? i am dead in the water what the heck am i doing i know i have many skills , but i do n't present well on paper or in person a lot of the stuff i 've done has been outside of the academic environment , in church or things like this blog which i ca n't tell about and i hate being stressed should i enter this program and subject myself to this stress ? it might bring me down again but i also see in the program all the things i 've wished for these past several years camaraderie , mentoring , fellowship not just the money kind ! , the chance to know history and museums intimately and learn all the stuff i 've always wanted to and see the historic objects up close and personal that 's all i 've ever dreamed of since i was a kid but how do you express that without sounding trite or contrived ? and what does it count for ? i feel so overwhelmed i ca n't stop thinking about this guy i saw the other day i ca n't stop wondering what could be and trying to make sure that things could work out between us i do n't know how to turn my mind off i wish i could just let go of romantic hopes again because they just make me miserable , absolutely miserable and they make me change myself to try to win someone who does n't give a damn about me or in this case , even know i exist i do n't think anyone will ever love me or take notice of me i do n't think i can ever have a happy relationship i'm afraid of getting hurt if anything ever were to happen between me and someone and i'm afraid that i'm too insecure to handle a relationship healthily plus , look at all the baggage i come with posts worth all day , i 've felt all clamped up like every part of me is tensed for the future this does nothing to help me and i know i need to take a step back and calm down and gain perspective , but i ca n't seem to i 've been feeling unshakably blue the past five days , and it 's scary really scary i'm terrified of being plunged back into the living nightmare of major depression i do n't know how i can live like that again but i'm almost afraid of being happy because that seems to mean that a shadow is waiting to overtake you just around the bend i ca n't stand this constant grind of depression though the pessimism , the darkness , the fear , the self doubt it is suffocating i feel like i'm in a cage that 's slowly decompressing the question arises , why me ? but then i think , why not me ? there are people with even worse lives why am i so selfish ? but that does n't help to think either it makes you more miserable and self blame y
