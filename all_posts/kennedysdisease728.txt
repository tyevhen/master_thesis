my legs went into a slide in early november the quads and left knee weakened dramatically several times a day i felt the left knee was going to buckle on me i haven t experienced anything like this in years at times it was difficult not to become too concerned about my future capabilities compromise and compensation , leverage and innovation i tried everything i could think of i was not going to give up or give in some days i could only accomplish of my normal standing leg exercises i was also finding it difficult to pull up my pants after using the toilet several times it took attempts while having to rest for a moment or two between attempts occasionally i had to have my wife help frustration and even anger wedged its way into my normal positive attitude but , i am a stubborn cuss i never gave up trying to complete my standing exercises i pushed myself while always considering my safety over time i was able to regain enough strength to perform of my previous reps a week ago i wrote in my kd exercise journal that perhaps this was the new normal for me , but i still refused to accept it this morning when i first stood up i sensed a strength in my legs that i haven t felt in a couple of months when i began my standing leg exercises i could feel a difference a confidence in my leg muscles muscle memory kicked in and i found myself smiling i performed steps in place without a problem i then performed standing leg lifts without breathing hard i was on my way and life couldn t be any better i don t know what the new year will bring , but i can tell you it is ending in a most gratifying fashion be well and stay upright ! mule photo http likesuccess com topics stubborn happy new year photo http www wishespoint com
