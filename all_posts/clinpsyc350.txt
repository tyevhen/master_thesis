john mack at the pharma marketing blog has laid down the smack on cymbalta first , he points out that the depression hurts campaign sure looks like off label promotion , since cymbalta is fda approved for depression , not for pain associated with depression note that pain is not an official symptom of depression , so it seems quite strange to market a drug for the pain that allegedly occurs in depression , eh ? also note that the data on cymbalta for pain in depression are not impressive at all now that cymbalta has been fda approved for generalized anxiety disorder , mack wonders if some disease mongering is on the way , and he notes that the diagnostic criteria for gad are fairly vague , which makes it much easier to foist the idea that untold millions of americans are suffering from gad i 'd love to see lilly 's sales scripts for the new gad indication if they 're anything like the sales tactics for zyprexa , look for the rate of prescriptions for gad to skyrocket
