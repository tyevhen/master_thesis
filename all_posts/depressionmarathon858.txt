i promised i 'd write something worth reading tonight , but i'm afraid i might still be too pooped to think straight in fact , i'm supposed to be swimming a lengthy swim workout right now , but i think i'm going to save it for tomorrow my rest day i did my strength circuit before work this morning , but i just could n't get in the pool then either tomorrow other than being tired , life is still good my mood has been holding steady it 's so nice to visit my doc and psychologist and be able to tell them i'm doing well i wonder if they ever expected i 'd be able to do that for more than a week or two at a time i do n't think i ever did i also have good news on the job front first of all , i am enjoying my current job a hell of a lot more since one of my troublesome assistants left things are really relaxed and fun around our office now and then , out of the blue , i got a job interview the interview , this friday , is with the same home health company i interviewed with around christmas and the same company i almost interviewed with again about three weeks ago now there is a new program director , and she called to ask if i was still interested in working for them weird , but i 'll take it the funny thing is , if i get this new job , i 'll actually feel a little guilty about leaving my current job now it 's strange how life works sometimes , but i'm learning not to question it i 'll give you a follow up report after my interview friday now i'm afraid it 's off to bed for me hopefully tomorrow will bring renewed energy have a good evening everyone !
