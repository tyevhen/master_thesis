so for those of you who follow my twitter , you 'll know that i have recently become president of my university 's mental health society student minds i originally only wanted to run for vice president , but i was encouraged to run for president and after giving a speech and the votes all counted up , i was chosen to be president i then had to sign some paperwork to make sure it was all confirmed this is something i had been thinking about for a while , because at first i wanted to start my own mental health society until i realised there was one already in existence ! therefore , i joined up but there was n't much going on so , for my final year at university i thought i would take a step into the deep end and put myself forward for vice president as i really wanted to make a go of this society i wanted to have more members join , battle stigma and raise awareness because there will be so many people in my university suffering , but never talking about it turns out that i was encouraged in our meeting to run for president and now i can happily say that i am the president of my university 's mental health society i'm really hoping to make a difference by bringing in speakers , holding events , making posters and so on anything i can do , because i have a real passion to help other 's and raise awareness this is n't the only thing i have to do , though as president i have to make sure the society is running well , make sure the prices are correct , organise people and events and so forth i basically will be overseeing the whole running of the society and although it seems like a big task , i'm happy to get out of my comfort zone and see what i can do and what our committee members can do as a team best wishes , amy xx
