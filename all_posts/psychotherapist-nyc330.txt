to find former romantic partners see my article relationships romantic reconnections it 's no wonder that many people get stuck yearning for and idealizing how they think things could have been in their lives as opposed to dealing with how life is now getting stuck in the past and dwelling on what could have been of course , there 's nothing wrong with nostalgia and remembering good times these memories can help to get us through difficult times and remind us that there can still be good times ahead of us when we 're dealing with current challenges the problem is n't about nostalgia the
