hope in the dark is a short book of essays about the importance of recognizing small victories in the face of what seems insurmountable challenge solnit is a radical activist who passionately protests many issues such as nafta , the destruction of the environment , and war the book was beautifully written solnit surely knows how to compose a sentence the reviews of this book seem overwhelmingly positive , and i , too , thought the book had an important point however , i was not moved by the book as other people are i think part of the problem is that many of the issues were older it was originally published in and republished in with a new forward and afterward which address more timely issues unfortunately , i could n't get my hands on a copy since i was trying to get it read in time for the social justice bookclub still time to sign up ! which will read it in january i have too many other books in january to be able to fit it in then another issue i had with the book is it assumed prior knowledge of the issues such as why nafta is bad i 've never thought about nafta in the past in fact , i only became aware of it being a controversial issue when trump recently suggested nixing it perhaps that 's a lack of awareness on my part , but i would have appreciated more information but explaining the issues was not what this book was about this book was about hope , not about education because of this flaw , i found the book very boring in parts i'm a fan of educational books more so than uplifting ones that said , i totally understand why people are moved by this book , and i appreciate the timeliness of preaching hope in the appearances of failure
