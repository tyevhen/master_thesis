this post was originally published on patreon in october patreon is a crowdfunding platform i use which lets supporters like you pledge any amount you choose from to or more per month to support my work , and in exchange you gain access to my patron only online feed of exclusive posts , interviews , newsletters , behind the scenes updates , and more most of the posts i write for patrons will remain exclusive to patreon , but sometimes , many months later , one of those posts will make its way here i hope you enjoy this one , and i also hope that if you appreciate my work you 'll consider becoming a supporter ! something i see sometimes that makes me scratch my head we use a curriculum that 's really unschooling friendly ! which seems to be missing the point more than a little if a child chooses to do a curriculum of their own free will as in , there was n't strong parental pressure to do it that is still unschooling but if the adults involved have chosen a curriculum and are forcing their children to in any way adhere to it even if it 's a relaxed curriculum , even if it allows children to choose from a list of pre determined activities that 's still , well , schooling there is a strong cultural story of what school looks like it has separate classrooms separate teachers knowledge is transferred in a neat one way direction from teachers to students there are clear distinctions between periods clear separations between subjects there s a cafeteria and recess and homework to do afterward so when people choose to break away from this vision of school , and don t create an exact replica of school inside of their own homes , i think it can be easy to think that what they re doing must be un schooling and i mean , it almost certainly is better than school ! an important step many steps away from mainstream schooling ! but it might not be unschooling just yet and if a parent is enforcing any type of curriculum no matter how loosely on their children , it definitely isn t this isn t a criticism , so much as an observation of just how deeply we , as a culture , have internalized how education works based on a model of forced schooling , so that even when someone has shed the most obvious trappings of schooling the classrooms , the periods , the different teachers for every different subject , they re still usually harboring a lot of schoolish ideas they re still looking at things , as i once pointed out , through school coloured glasses there might not be a whole cadre of professional teachers , but an adult still has to be planning lessons of some sort there might not be periods divided by that old fashioned ringing of the bell , but there are still learning activities and activities from which children are apparently not learning video games , anyone ? for prospective unschoolers , it often takes a whole lot of deschooling , an unpacking of all the myriad beliefs of what learning is supposed to look like , and a gradual understanding of how freeform and ever present life learning actually is for those of us who are further along on that journey , whether by a little bit or a lot , i find myself often wondering even after many years now interacting with new unschoolers myself how to gently point out what isn t unschooling , and suggest a change of direction to those who are looking to embrace life learning it s a continuous process of learning to do better , and i think i will always be working on being clearer and kinder in my communication , but there are some things i try to keep in mind note that i m talking specifically about people who want to unschool , who are interested in learning more , and just don t have a very accurate grasp of just what unschooling is yet i am not talking about people who stubbornly insist they want to call their homeschool unschooling even when it s anything but , and have no interest in moving further in a self directed direction now that we have that out of the way be gentle maybe instead of a straight up that s not unschooling , a softer yet still clear approach is better unschooling is all about adult facilitated self directed learning , so if you re making your kids follow a curriculum or do workbooks when they haven t chosen to do so themselves , i d consider that to be eclectic or relaxed homeschooling if you and your family are happy with that , then that s fine but if you d like to move in a more unschooling direction , i d love to share some resources with you or tell you a bit about how we do life learning in my family there are so many great resources to share some of my personal favorite sites right now are living joyfully with unschooling unschooling mommom offtrail learning and of course my own archives may also prove helpful talk about your own breakthrough moments and successes that time you realized your child had started reading without you ever trying to teach them to do so how much more happy things became and how much more learning you observed when you ditched your curriculum how focusing on relationships instead of education lead to a wonderful family project whatever it was that made unschooling click for you might help someone else in their own breakthroughs , all while keeping it focused on things that work for you , instead of telling the person in question what they re doing wrong give concrete suggestions if someone is actively asking for help with a difficult situation , or bemoaning the fact their attempts at unschooling based on their potentially flawed views on just what it is isn t working , it can be really helpful to make some suggestions unsolicited advice is usually a bad idea , but when people are looking for help , so many unschoolers have so much wisdom to share and in my experience , phrasing things in the form of questions is often the most effective approach have you tried looking at things from her perspective ? i wonder how she feels about x thing ? are you focusing on your interests , too ? it s great for children to see their parents passionate about their own activities , and maybe he d like to join you ! have you talked to them about how you re feeling , and asked them how they feel ? if you work on having open lines of communication , it will probably be easier to find a solution that works for everyone i think there will always be times when we find ourselves frustrated with misunderstandings of how unschooling works and what it even is , but for those who want the benefits of a truly life learning educational experience , we re in a wonderful position to share our own experiences and help all the new folks find their own unschooling groove , in a way that s both kind and effective
