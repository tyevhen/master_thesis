i just came in from an mile run it was way more difficult than it should have been i am pooped ! i feel like i am starting over , which essentially i am , after so many weeks of illness and sloth during my run today i could feel the extra pounds i 've been carrying as a result of that layoff i could also tell my lungs are n't quite right , yet in fact , i went to my allergy asthma doc the other day , and he prescribed an antibiotic and a steroid inhaler hopefully that combination of meds will finally kill whatever has been ailing me my asthma has actually been flared up not only as a result of my lingering congestion , but also because of my new puppy , jet i am actually allergic to dogs , and cats , and many other things i built up an immunity to puck , and i expect i will do the same with jet , but it 's apparently going to take awhile once i do , i can get rid of the steroid inhaler , which i hate because it makes my voice strangled and squeaky hopefully i wo n't need it for long speaking of jet , he is doing wonderfully he constantly makes me laugh out loud he plays by himself by throwing his toys in the air , pouncing on them wherever they land , and then tossing his head back and letting them fly again he will romp , and jump , and race around the house doing this for up to minutes at a time ! it 's hysterical ! he is such a puppy ! jet has helped with my grief over puck in fact , recently several people have told me how happy i look just this morning one of my friends said it again it 's hard to look sad , i guess , if one spends so much time laughing i think both jet and i were lucky to find one another i think we 're both smiling a lot
