i 've been wanting to write about this for months here goes we know that antipsychotics are the new panacea for all things mental health related , including depression , , but critics kept pointing to a pesky lack of evidence that such treatments actually worked bristol myers squibb , manufacturer of abilify , has been running a disinformation campaign in medical journals to tout its drug as an antidepressant their attempts to paint a positive picture of abilify 's antidepressant properties and its allegedly fantastic safety tolerability profile have been simultaneously tragic and amusing , , we 're now moving on to something bigger it ai n't just abilify , folks it 's all the atypicals they are all antidepressants according to the authors of a recent meta analysis , for atypical antipsychotics at present , this body of evidence is considerably larger than that for any other augmentation strategy in the treatment of major depressive disorder in other words , if you are not prescribing atypicals for your patients who do n't show adequate response to antidepressants , you are not practicing evidence based medicine you are a bleeping cowboy who is willfully disregarding science you are denying your patients the best possible treatment the authors do n't actually say any of those things , but those are the implications if the evidence for using antipsychotics is considerably larger than the evidence for anything else , then the implications are clear cut and this is exactly how this study will be cited salespeople , from drug reps to academic psychiatrists , to practitioners looking to earn a few thousand extra bucks on the side through pharma speaking gigs , will discuss this study as if it were a landmark finding response and remission but the evidence is not all that convincing here 's why the authors pooled together the results of randomized controlled trials in these studies , patients had failed to respond adequately using various definitions to an antidepressant patients were then assigned to receive either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo in addition to their antidepressant outcomes were then tabulated somewhere between and weeks later the results seem clear cut if your brain is turned to off the response rates for atypicals was compared to for placebo the remission rates were for atypicals and for placebo the advantage for atypicals is statistically significant well , there you have it done deal ask your doctor about abilify zyprexa seroquel today but the most important thing in a treatment outcome study is the outcomes the authors of the meta analysis did not bother to actually measure change in scores on rating scales instead , they only used response and remission rates there is absolutely no good reason for doing this it 's potentially quite misleading doctors like remission and response rates because they provide the illusion that we are measuring depression exactly a responder got a lot better and is functioning reasonably well whereas a non responder is in bed hours a day while spending the rest of her time watching the e ! network , eating bon bons , and sobbing constantly but it 's not nearly that scientific a responder is usually defined as someone who got better on his or her depression rating score during the study period so bob 's depression rating score improved by he 's a responder , but amy 's score only improved by , so she 's a nonresponder is this difference really meaningful ? let 's look at the following dataset for participants in a fictional study improvements in depression over course of week study drug placebo using a improvement to determine if a patient is a responder , we get a response rate on drug and a response rate on placebo lazy logic says oooh the drug is twice as effective as placebo but is we take the average for each group , we get an average improvement of on the drug compared to on placebo see the problem with response and remission rates ? similar arguments have been made by smarter people than myself putting outcomes into convenient little categories makes good sense when the categories themselves make sense events like having a heart attack , getting pregnant , or dying if the death rate on a drug is compared to on a placebo , then the drug really reduced death by but if the remission rate or response rate for depression is on drug compared to on placebo , that does not mean the drug is twice as effective as placebo in treating depression if you need to score a or below on a depression rating scale to be in remission , but you score an , are you really much worse off than the person who scored a ? am i saying that the drugs really just squeaked by placebo in these studies ? well , i 've read the abilify studies and posted on them previously in those studies , abilify barely beat the placebo and in the opinion of the patients themselves , abilify did n't beat placebo at all and the studies were designed to benefit abilify , not to actually see if the drug worked as i noted previously patients were initially assigned to receive an antidepressant plus a placebo for eight weeks those who failed to respond to treatment were assigned to abilify antidepressant or placebo antidepressant those who responded during the initial weeks were then eliminated from the study so we 've already established that antidepressant placebo did n't work for these people yet they were then assigned to treatment for weeks with the same treatment ! and compared to those who were assigned antidepressant abilify so the antidepressant placebo group started at a huge disadvantage because it was already established that they did not respond well to such a treatment regimen no wonder abilify came out on top albeit by a modest margin here 's an analogy a group of students is assigned to be tutored by tutor a regarding math the students are all tutored for weeks the students whose math skills improve are sent on their merry way that leaves students who did not improve under tutor a 's tutelage so tutor b comes along to tutor of these students , while tutor a sticks with of them tutor b 's students do somewhat better than tutor a 's students on a math test weeks later is tutor b better than tutor a ? not really a fair comparison between tutor a and tutor b , is it ? i 've not read the other antipsychotics for depression studies i 'll even give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were not designed in the same biased manner as the abilify trials it is , however , worth noting that the benefit of abilify , in terms of response and remission rates compared to placebo , was about the same as for the other atypicals which leads me to think that the other atypicals probably show similar marginal benefits for depression but now , based solely on potentially quite misleading response and remission rates , an article appears in the american journal of psychiatry a piece that has the potential to ramp up the prescribing of antipsychotics for depression to an even more ridiculous level let the good times roll source of ironclad evidence that atypical antipsychotics are antidepressants until you actually read the paper nelson , j , papakostas , g atypical antipsychotic augmentation in major depressive disorder a meta analysis of placebo controlled randomized trials american journal of psychiatry , , doi appi ajp
