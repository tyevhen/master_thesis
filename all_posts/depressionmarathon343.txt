i'm transitioning back to my normal life today yesterday was the last day of my two week mood disorder program at mayo clinic it was a good program i liked it it helped i was very lucky my fellow group members and i meshed quickly and easily there was a high level of trust , disclosure and support between us with the assistance of our excellent group leaders , we did an enormous amount of work with each other it was a very good experience that being said , i am happy to be home , sitting with my feet up , sipping my coffee this morning i am getting prepared to run , in the morning hours , as i usually do my running was definitely affected by the hour per day programming over the past two weeks besides not being able to run in the morning , as i typically would have done , the mood program was mentally and physically exhausting by the time i returned home in the late afternoon , going for a run was difficult i am proud i was able to stick to my running schedule , but i am looking forward to some easier , more comfortable runs now that i will be more rested things are generally going well my parents are here visiting right now , as my step father 's granddaughter is getting married they are not thrilled with the below zero temperatures , as they spend the winter in the warm , southern u s i am not thrilled with my mother chattering in my ear as i try to write this , so if this post is a bit disjointed , blame my mom ! i'm kidding i am glad they are here it 's nice to see them in the middle of the winter , as i usually do n't see them for many months between fall and spring they are pretty happy to see me doing so well well , it 's time to run it 's cold and snowing , so it looks like i may be forced indoors onto the dreadmill it takes a lot to force me indoors , but today that 's probably where i 'll be regardless , it will be nice to be back on my normal schedule that alone should make for a good run and a good day have a great day , my friends !
