your first pigtails ! dear little p , today you are months old ! so close to being two ! your last month of being a year old i ca n't believe it sometimes i lay in bed at night and cry a little bit to myself , sniffling in the dark about how time slips right through my fingers and i ca n't seem to grasp it i think about how having you in our lives has blessed us in the most complex and profound ways each day presents new challenges as we try and work together , you and me , to help you grow and flourish i always end up realizing how happy you are and it always makes me feel better enough to sigh and fall asleep this past month you 've discovered your social side as you notice how much fun others can really be you smile and frolic with others in a way you never used to you are starting to enjoy pretending and actually playing with your toys you 've uncovered a big love of dinosaurs and roaring like them all over the house we got you your very own stegosaurus and brachiosaurus figures the other day and it was like the best day of your life who knew some dinosaurs would be like the second coming ? what a fun time we are having together ! it has n't been all roses and sunshine as you spent several days sick , sick sick puking every minutes for hours and then having days of residual illness afterward not so fun for anyone , least of all you i felt so bad for you and your poor listless body but now you are fully mended and filled with energy outside ! you scream half the day you do n't care that it 's arctic cold and windy until you get out there and promptly say all done ! we ca n't wait for warmer weather ! we 're having so much fun , my little love we make a great team you and dad make a great team together , we make a great family and that 's my dream come true i love you deeply now and forever more , mama more pigtails i know she 's playing with the blinds' cord and that 's a no no but , she was attended this is in my bedroom she just loves to make the blinds go up and down and then make them stay that way i'm always watching save
