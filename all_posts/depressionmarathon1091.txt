while billing a patient this week , i noticed she had a previous diagnosis of depression wow , i thought , she did n't look like someone with depression almost immediately , i began chastising myself ! i was shocked to have had the thought ! how could i , a person with depression a person who speaks , writes , and educates about the invisibility , stereotypes and stigma of mental illness how could i automatically assume that a young , healthy , attractive person did n't look like she could or should have depression ? i was surprised at and disappointed with myself i guess it proves , once again , how pervasive the stigma is , how ingrained our attitudes are , and how hidden this illness can be this incident was a powerful , not so subtle , reminder for me how are your thoughts today ?
