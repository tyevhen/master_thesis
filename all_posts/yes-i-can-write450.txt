i hate it when i do n't write here for a while i feel like there 's a million things i should be saying here , since so many days have passed , yet i feel i'm forgetting lots of interesting little things in the process i 've been cooking a lot nearly every day , actually , which is a huge jump from what i was doing before camp ! i 'll post some pictures as soon as i get them downloaded i'm also currently reading two interesting books , catch , which is hilariously funny and bizarre , and strangely like war the global assualt on forests by derrick jensen and george draffan , which is terribly sad and makes me very angry at timber corporations and the government that supports them oh ! and i started this new project that i'm really exited about , called one page story project www onepagestory blogspot com , in which i write as many single page stories as i can , and invite others to write one page stories and share the links to them as well actually , i should really write another one today , since it 's been a few days since i posted one this blog is also getting a bit more publicity , both on jake and anne o 's beautiful photo blog they have some seriously awesome shots up there http anneojakeo blogspot com , where a link to my blog was posted in the october rd post , and also on the canadian home educators blog carnival at http canadianhomeeducatorscarniva blogspot com where my post melancholy and beautiful books was featured thank you guys ! peace idzie edit i was just going through the home educators blog carnival list , and when i came across a post on teaching politics , i added this comment my sister and i are unschoolers , so haven t really ever been officially taught politics , but of course we ve done much learning about it over the years ! i enjoyed this post , since it really made me think of how much we do actually know about politics and the whole political system ! we ve been debating politics with friends and each other for years , we can tell you what each party stands for , how we feel they come across , our opinions on their politics etc i ve also started paying a lot of attention to media bias and add campaigns , both of which fascinate me and that s not even to mention all the discussion and reading i ve done on alternative styles of government , such as anarchy , communism , etc i find myself discovering daily how much i really do know , and feeling less and less that unschooling has stunted my learning in any way on the contrary , i feel like i 've had a much better and much fuller learning experience than many others are lucky enough to have ! you might also like how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! the value in writing for an audience , not a grade insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging melancholy and beautiful books linkwithin
