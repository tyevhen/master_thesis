i 've got a lot going on today for starters , i saw my doctor this morning she 's keeping me out of work through at least next week i feel relieved about that i just do n't feel ready to face the chaos my office is currently dealing with we struggled to get referrals for so long but now have the opposite problem too many patients , not enough clinicians it means i 'll be loaded with patients as soon as i go back , and i do n't feel ready for that stress yet my doctor agreed it was n't worth sacrificing my health for the benefit of my employer she also agreed that i 've done my last ect treatment i continue to feel better the only thing i currently struggle with is unending fatigue i ca n't get through the day without sleeping i dislike that overwhelmingly tired feeling , but i 'll take it over the debilitating mood any day of the week at least fatigue can be ameliorated by sleep as i 've documented over the past few months , my low mood does not respond to such simple intervention fortunately , my mood has n't taken a big hit by the unexpected and unexplained death of fellow runner , paul hardly a moment has passed that he and his family have not been on my mind since his death after the marathon last saturday his visitation is tonight the running group he belonged to is organizing a group run after the prayer service i was going to run my tempo run today , but now i think i 'll wait until tonight and join the crowd it will feel good to run with friends after such a somber event his funeral will be tomorrow it is still so unbelievable to have lost someone so young , so healthy , and so vibrant as paul he will truly be missed by many , many people
