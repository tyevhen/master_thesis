the japanese are purported to enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the westernized world , with one of the highest centenarian populations of any modern culture but it looks like this is almost certainly a myth approximately , people listed on japanese government records as being aged or older are actually missing and undoubtedly long dead in , japanese officials uncovered about , missing residents listed as at least years old , and were on the records as or older sogen kato , tokyo 's oldest man , as found on his th birthday kato did not respond to our requests for an interview japan 's justice ministry blames poor bookkeeping for most of the cases which is , of course , ludicrous the japanese , as a whole , are not known for poor bookkeeping more to the point , every city , town , and village in japan records births , marriages , and deaths among other events in a koseki , or family register the koseki system was instituted throughout japan in the s the koseki is supplemented by a regular census taken every five years the idea that a quarter million people could go missing in a system so census oriented beggars belief what 's actually happening , of course , is welfare fraud the case of sogen kato , tokyo 's oldest man , illustrates what 's going on in july , police requested a birthday visit of sogen kato , ahead of japan 's respect for the elderly day in september kato was born july , , which would have made him the police were repeatedly turned away by kato 's family eventually , officials entered kato 's bedroom and found his mummified body , dead for years , on the bed the family had been living off kato 's never ending pension the whole time in august , a few weeks after the kato incident , tokyo police located the remains of a woman thought to be years old in the backpack of her year old son , who never reported his mother 's death he had been living on his mother 's pension for at least nine years , probably longer the fact that there are , unrecorded deaths in the japanese population means the often touted life expectancy figure of years for japan now has to be considered suspect cia 's web page on japan 's death rate shows japanese mortality as having dropped by in one year , in this is also suspect , obviously if u s mortality were to drop in one year it would be a major headline news story for mortality to suddenly drop by in a country of million people who smoke like fiends simply is n't credible no one thought anything of it when japan 's centenarian population tripled in the space of ten years now we know the truth the japanese are n't living longer they 're just lying about their parents' ages
