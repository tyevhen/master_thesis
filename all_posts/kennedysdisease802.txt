why won t people listen ? i keep on telling them i don t need it i don t want it and , to keep it but , they won t listen my wife came down with some kind of crud cold ? and it really nailed her i told her , i didn t want it but , no , she just had to share it is day three and it is not pretty if she wanted to share something , why not her health ? my daughter , who lives in minnesota , has ridiculously cold weather right now i told her to keep it but , no , she sent is anyway it arrived and this next week will be degrees below normal for the entire week if she wanted to share something , why not her time a visit would be a lot better than the freezing cold i don t consider myself a complainer , but i go out of my way to avoid people that are sick yet , it is hard to avoid your wife and , since cold temperatures do a job on my muscles , i moved south to avoid it what s all the flack about global warming ? it feels like the beginning of the ice age i m done complaining back to my normal pma
