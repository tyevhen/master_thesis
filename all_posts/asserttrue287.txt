a common myth in biology is that genes coding for proteins need to have a shine dalgarno sequence upstream of the start codon students sometimes spout this as an inarguable fact a kind of molecular biology catechism i call it the ggagg reflex in fact , no sd sequence is required none at all it 's important to be clear on this in case you 're not a biogeek in the s , australian scientists john shine and lynn dalgarno were the first to notice that the tail end of the s bacterial ribosomal rna contains a short nucleotide sequence whose reverse complement is often found immediately upstream of a protein gene 's start codon the exact sequence varies from organism to organism , but the rrna trailer sequence is usually pyrimidine rich in e coli , the sequence is cacctcctta here , i am of course talking about the dna sequence in rna it 's cuccuccuua if you reverse the sequence , the watson crick complement is taaggaggtg some portion of the latter is often found a few nucleotides upstream of a start codon not of the time , but too often to be by chance the key intuition here is that watson crick binding of the tail end of the s rrna to the corresponding antisequence ahead of the start codon helps stabilize the ribosome so that it is more likely to translate the gene the degree of binding depends , of course , on the fidelity of the sd sequence ahead of the gene usually , the purine rich sd area is not an exact match for the s rrna trailer , and in fact the sd region quite often has no detectable sd signature whatsoever how often is quite often ? in , ma et al undertook a survey of organisms representing bacteria from all major taxonomic groups somewhat surprisingly , they found that in out of organisms , a shine dalgarno sequence was present at fewer than half of all cds protein encoding genes among the bacteria most likely to use sd sequences were bacillus subtilis and thermotoga thermophilus , in which of known protein genes have an upstream sd signal among those least likely to use sd sequences were low gc small genome organisms intracellular parasites , mycoplasmas , and pathogens , with many groups , like the actinobacteria , falling somewhere in the middle before taking these findings to heart , though , it 's worth noting some serious weaknesses in the ma et al study in obtaining the above numbers , ma et al used a rather permissive definition of sd sequence , based on a minimum binding energy cutoff g of kcal mol , which means they counted gagg as a sd sequence and also ggag and agga if one were to count only ggagg length and longer motifs , the percentages given by ma et al would be much lower i present some data of my own on this further below the reason this is a very serious issue is that the probability of random occurrence of short length sequences like gagg is substantial ma et al failed to report the expectation odds for the various signals they looked for hence , for short motifs , we have no way of knowing , for the various organisms , what the expected rate of occurrence of short signals was if an organism with genomic gc content of has a putative sd motif of gagg , agga , or gagg in the bp target region for of its genes , how does that compare with the random occurrence rate for those sequences , given the organism 's dna base composition ? we 're not told bearing in mind the weaknesses of the study , a number of nonethelesss interesting findings came out of the ma et al survey , including a sd sequence is rarely long or canonical many times it 's just gagg or ggag or agga putatively or a corruption of the expected form e g , ggtgg instead of ggagg sd sequences occur more often with highly expressed genes such as genes for ribosomal proteins and core energy metabolism genes than with low expression genes in some not all organisms , the sd sequence is more likely to occur in conjunction with an atg start codon and less likely to occur with gtg or ttg vanishingly few sd signals are located further than bases or closer than bases away from a start codon anybody with modest javascript skills can write scripts that verify some of these findings against public genomes i took a quick look at the genome for rothia mucilaginosa dy a member of the actinobacteria family and a common inhabitant of the human mouth first , i determined the most likely sd sequence for rothia based on the s rrna trailer of cctcctttct implying a sd sequence of agaaaggagg , then i had my script scan the genome in both directions , looking for any of the six possible length motifs within the full length sequence so , agaaa , gaaag , etc , in the base pairs upstream of every annotated open reading frame start codon in total , i found putative sd sequences within to bases of an annotated start codon since rothia mucilaginosa has cds genes , this means of protein genes carry a putative length shine dalgarno signal when i re ran the check using all possible length sd signal variants using the relaxed criteria of ma et al , i found positives thus , of cds genes in r mucilaginosa have a length sd signal per ma et al on a probability of abundance basis given rothia 's actual base composition stats , we would expect to see length sd motifs by pure chance in the genome 's bp regions the actual number is obviously quite a bit higher than expected , tending to validate the notion that these are , indeed , sd motifs we 're looking at for length motifs , the trend is even sharper the expectation is occurrences by chance the actual number is so at a length of , a motif has high odds chance of being real by contrast , the statistical expectation for length motifs calculates out at , which is only slightly less than the number found therefore , in dealing with shine dalgarno sequences , at least in rothia , it 's meaningful to deal with length and longer motifs , but probably not meaningful to deal with length when you spot a length motif , odds are very high you 're looking at a randomly occurring pattern if you enjoyed this post , please share the url with a friend thank you !
