i ran a local half marathon this morning it was at mile six that i began composing the title to this post , and the title most appropriate at the time was is fuck depression ! fuck this despicable illness fuck the despair and negativity fuck the lonliness and isolation fuck the emptiness and most pertinent this morning , fuck the heavy , paralyzing , immobility i hate this illness i knew running this morning was a dubious idea after all , with the exception of work , i had been stuck in my house all week depression had me tightly in its grasp i had hardly moved , much less run any miles but i was hopeful nonetheless i thought , if i could get myself to the starting line my fitness may prevail after all , i 've been running training for months i was hoping the missed week would n't bite me in the ass but i did get bit in the ass this morning depression ripped me to shreds i could do nothing to change what took place with the exception of the first mile , when i felt okay , every successive mile was painful and slow , and slower , and slowest the first time i contemplated dropping out was at mile three my legs were dead i could n't catch my breath my energy was already low i knew it was n't going to get better i knew the next ten miles would only get tougher , and they did i do n't know why i did n't drop out pure stubborness , i guess but i did n't have fun i did n't enjoy myself instead i was angry and frustrated , disappointed and uncomfortable i ran as much as i could , but i walked a fair amount , too i did n't want to walk , but there was no other choice my body and my brain rebelled the entire race today fuck depression ! today i ran the second slowest half marathon i 've ever run ever i'm not happy , but i'm glad i tried i think staying home and giving in to the lethargy would have ultimately felt worse
