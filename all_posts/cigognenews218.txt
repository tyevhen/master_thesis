dr janov , i have been admiring your work for such short time but , in this time i have learnt a lot things , i would n't have learnt anywhere else things that brought me to accept be open to my feelings rather than label them , repress them , and ignoring them it is because of a person like you i have come to be more human , more empathetic , and more understanding feelings are no longer the enemy my only hope is that your wonderful work wisdom be spread around the world as so to help other people who suffer rare are gems like you happy loving birthday !
