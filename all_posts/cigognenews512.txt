this article was first published on june , i just want to run it again , as it is so important how do we transform sadness into depression ? anger into rage ? fear into terror ? resonance the deeper we go in the nervous system the more unreasoned , out of control , impulsive feelings sensations there are for good reason the deeper we go , down into the brainstem the more survival , animalistic , immediate reactions are elicited rage and terror are there to help us react quickly to save our lives also there is deep hopelessness the basis for severe depression it is all there and can be triggered off in the present through resonance it seems to me that all basic feelings are held together through specific frequencies which unite such feelings as anger and rage rage and terror are the first line components of feelings that are triggered off , resonate , with by current feelings which are far less severe nothing in the present is ordinarily meant to be terrorizing yet giving a speech can be just that why ? because when one s childhood is ridden by constant lack of love and neglect and often hatred by parents , the defense system is weakened and resonance can go deeper without impediment because of weakened or leaky gates those early traumas when early and severe damage our ability to develop a good gating system so giving a speech elicits terror , which actually has nothing to do with what is going on in the present but what is resonated with is real and tells us a lot about what lies down there in that primitive salamander brain is there an immediate life threatening event ? often yes a mother smoking or drinking or taking drugs a pre psychotic mother can do it due to her high levels of mobilizing chemicals the excessive vital signs speak to us in the language of the body , and they tell us how severe the early event was this is particularly true in psychotics i treated a young man who was born on a marine base to parents who were divorcing the mother abandoned him and he was reared thereafter by a father who was nearly always absent , sent to war zones there was trauma after trauma , meaning no love the problem is that we often do not recognize the resonance factor and treat the top level as the problem in cognitive insight therapy the patient is convinced that there is nothing to be afraid of ay ay ay there is a lot to be afraid of only we cannot see it it is like anger management we treat rage through top level cortical pleadings when the real rage lies sleepily but stealthily down deep ready to pounce here is where words are but a weak , weak weapon for dealing with it we must understand resonance , for that is what we must treat we must attack what we cannot see the imprint that has been there for decades , something that will eventually give us cancer or a heart attack , and we will wonder why ? how can we be sure about all this ? one way is through vital signs we systematically measure all patients sessions before and after as the resonance factor kicks in , we find that the deeper we go in the brain the greater the vital sign measures so down in the brainstem where much of our birth trauma and prenatal trauma is registered is where we find the long slow wave brain signatures in our patients as they approach the deeper levels it is where we see blood pressure of over , and of resting heart rate of over thus , the terrific impact these very early imprints have is demonstrated every day in almost every session a patient comes in very hopeless and depressed and her blood pressure is very low another comes in with great anger and his heart rate is exceedingly high it is of a piece , and we literally see the contribution of each level of consciousness during the session we rarely if ever find a patient down on the brainstem level without resonance this alone should guide us in the therapy of those who are ridden by out of control impulsiveness someone comes to a doctor with chronically very high blood pressure and they immediately give blood pressure medication and they should offer medication it must be controlled in our therapy , we have an idea already of where the origins lie because we are a therapy of genesis , of genotypes , not phenotypes in fact the phenotype appearances is one way to arrive at the genotype if we suppress the phenotype with medication we can almost be sure the patient will not get well we know very little of the minute details of a malady but we know a great deal about genesis this tells us a great deal about the status of the gates , how leaky they are , how solid and impenetrable or refractory they are as soon as the patient comes in her body is sending out information if she is awash in first line input we know where we have to go in therapy either help her into the imprint or perhaps helping with the gating system through the temporary use of tranquilizers a new patient with very low blood pressure and body temperature already signifies parasympathetic excess we may have to boost her vital functions for a time with energy boosters we may have to offer something that enhances stress hormone output as i have pointed out , in our therapy we attack the conductor of it all , not the individual players such as blood pressure or heart rate and that is the difference between what we do and what other therapies do we have an overview we know the music and it often has no lyrics
