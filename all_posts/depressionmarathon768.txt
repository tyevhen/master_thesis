i ran i biked i painted i cleaned i laundered miles minutes three walls and a hallway my whole house an awful lot of clothes ! boy i had a productive weekend ! my fourteen mile run went really great yesterday do n't get me wrong , i was glad to be done but i maintained my minute per mile average throughout , and i was really happy with that ! it was a beautiful day for a run today i began the day by cleaning my house oh my , it was a mess ! i really love a clean house , but i hate cleaning perhaps that 's why i let it go so long before cleaning it i wish i would n't do that i hopped on my bike after that it was another beautiful day , but i nearly froze my ass off on my minute ride it was beautiful , but the air was much , much cooler than i anticipated ! it took me two hours to warm up once i got home after rewarding myself with some yummy ice cream , i watched my vikings win finally ! unfortunately , my twins lost bummer that 's okay , they 've already secured the central division championship ! and then i painted my basement while doing many loads of laundry eventually , i 'll be finished painting down there right now it seems never ending , though now my house is cleaned , my laundry is cleaned , and even my bod is cleaned i just got out of the shower it was a good weekend no worries about my mood felt good about my training and was productive around my house how normal is that ?
