understanding the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't is often the key to successfully making lasting changes in your life while i ca n't means you 're not capable of doing it , i wo n't implies a choice in other words , you 're not willing to do it see my article fear of making changes , making changes are you creating obstacles for yourself without even realizing it ? and making changes overcoming ambivalence understanding the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't often , when people really mean i wo n't , they say , i ca n't for instance , when someone , who he wants to give up smoking , says , i ca n't , he 's saying that he thinks it will be too hard for him to do it so he chooses not to do although he might not see it that way , if his psychotherapist explored the meaning of i ca n't , it usually comes down to choosing not to do it see my article becoming a successful nonsmoker while it 's understandable that change can be scary , when you say , i ca n't it tends to foreclose any discussion about the obstacles that are getting in the way whereas if you say , i wo n't do it because i'm afraid that i 'll fail or i wo n't do it because i'm too ashamed to admit that it 's a problem , that leaves an opening for an exploration of the internal obstacles getting in the way the clinical implications of i ca n't and i wo n't in psychotherapy people often come to therapy because they want to make a change in their life usually , they 've tried on their own to make changes , but they run into obstacles even though many people begin psychotherapy because they want to make changes , once there is a possibility for change , they often experience ambivalence because there are core issues that need to be addressed that are getting in the way if fear and shame are involved , and they often are , an inner conflict develops between the desire to change and the desire to remain the same and not work through the necessary obstacles to be able to change the other possibility , when faced with fear and shame , is that the status quo begins to look good to the client for a while maybe things are n't so bad in my life after all until the client realizes , once again , that he really needs to change at that point , the client 's psychotherapist can help the client , if the client is willing , to face the internal obstacles to making the change if the client is n't willing to explore his ambivalence , he might leave therapy prematurely see my article when clients leave therapy prematurely let 's take a look at a fictional vignette which illustrates these dynamics in therapy ed after ed 's father died , he became a compulsive gambler as a way to distract himself from his grief see my article overcoming grief gambling his gambling began with march madness and quickly progressed to other sports see my article compulsive gamblers beware of march madness at first , when basketball season ended and he began betting on baseball games , he told himself that he would stop gambling at the end of the baseball season then baseball season came and went and he was gambling on football games , and he continued to bargain with himself about stopping when the bookmaker refused to take any more bets from ed because ed owed him money , ed got panicky without the highs and lows of gambling as a distraction from his grief , he felt overwhelmed with anxiety and sadness , and this was a wake up call for ed he knew he needed help , so he contacted a therapist who specialized in addiction understanding the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't during the initial consultation , ed told his psychotherapist that he knew he needed to stop gambling because he was in debt for thousands of dollars and he did n't want to get any further in debt at that point , ed did n't make the connection between his gambling and his fear of facing his grief over his father 's death he only knew that he could n't go on gambling and getting more and more in debt when ed and his psychotherapist talked about when the gambling started , ed told her that he gambled a little when he was in high school , but nothing compared to his current level of gambling as they traced back the origin of his compulsive gambling , ed was able to see that it began soon after his father died reluctantly , he began to put the pieces together , and he understood that he used gambling as a way to distract himself from his grief his therapist recommended that , in addition to coming to therapy , he also attend gamblers anonymous groups g a , but ed did n't think this was necessary he told his therapist that he would just stop he believed , i can stop whenever i want to understanding the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't his therapist decided , at that point , not to challenge ed or insist on g a she told him that they could see how he did with coming to therapy and not attending g a ed managed not to gamble for the first week , but he felt overwhelmed by anxiety and sadness , so since his bookmaker refused to take his bets until ed paid off his debt , he told himself that he would just place one more bet on an internet poker site using his credit card after placing the first bet , ed felt he still had his gambling compulsion under control , so he placed another bet and another until he was gambling online nearly every day although he felt ashamed about it , he knew that if he was n't honest with his therapist , he would be wasting his time in therapy , so he admitted that he was now gambling online nearly everyday his therapist explained the brain chemistry involved with gambling and other forms of addiction and why continuing to gamble would make it that much harder to stop his therapist recommended that they work on coping skills so that ed could manage his urges she also recommended that he identify the triggers that made him want to gamble ed knew that he had a problem tolerating his anxiety and sadness related to his father 's death until now , he did n't realize the magnitude of his gambling problem and what it would take to overcome his problem he agreed to practice mindfulness meditation at least once a day , but he did n't follow through with his commitment instead , he gave into his urge to gamble , telling himself each time , this will be the last time when he returned to see his psychotherapist , ed acknowledged that he did n't listen to any of the mindfulness recordings that he downloaded on his phone he also admitted that he was still gambling , and he was beginning to feel hopeless about overcoming his gambling addiction he asked his therapist , is n't there any easier way ? see my articles beyond the band aid approach in therapy his therapist recommended that ed come twice a week to therapy , attend g a meetings and get a sponsor in g a she also explained to ed that , when he was ready , they could work on the underlying trigger , the grief that he was avoiding in addition , she discussed how , if he followed her recommendations , he would probably be able to build up his tolerance for his uncomfortable feelings so they would no longer feel intolerable to him see my article expanding your window of tolerance in therapy to overcome emotional problems at that point , ed threw up his hands and told his therapist , i ca n't i ca n't do this when his therapist explained the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't , at first , ed continued to maintain that he could n't do what needed to be done to overcome his gambling addiction but as they continued to explore whether he was really incapable of overcoming his gambling addition or he was unwilling to give it up , ed reluctantly admitted that he was unwilling at that point , his therapist and ed had a basis to discuss his unwillingness to give up gambling and unwillingness to deal with his grief over time , the more ed talked to his therapist about his emotional struggles , the more he was able to see that he was creating obstacles for himself so , he followed his therapist 's recommendations to practice mindfulness meditation every day , he began attending g a meetings , and he obtained a sponsor after attending a g a meeting , ed told his therapist that he was surprised to discover how many people were in a similar predicament specifically related to grief gambling when he heard other people in g a speak about their guilt , shame and overwhelming sadness , he understood what they were talking about gradually , ed began to talk to his therapist about his grief at first , he was afraid that he would be overwhelmed , but he was surprised to discover that he actually felt better after he talked about it understanding the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't as ed dealt with his unresolved mourning in therapy , he felt no desire to gamble he paid off his debts and even began to save money over time , ed was also able to see that he used the idea of i ca n't as a way to avoid dealing with his uncomfortable feelings now he could see the difference between i ca n't and i wo n't and it was an important lesson in other areas of his life conclusion even when people really want to change and they come to therapy to get help with making a change , ambivalence often sets in as the process begins see my article starting psychotherapy it 's not unusual to feel anxious or ambivalent at that point , they 're likely to say , i ca n't when they really mean i wo n't although making a change can be scary , it 's a conscious choice and , by the same token , so is not making a change fear and shame are usually the underlying obstacles as to why people are unwilling to take the necessary steps to change this is especially common for people who grew up in a family where they did n't have the emotional support they needed when faced with difficulties as a child on an unconscious level , they fear that they will be as overwhelmed by emotion as they were as children , but this is rarely the case for one thing , as an adult , there is a greater capacity to tolerate emotions as compared to when they were children and , for another thing , as an adult , they have the wherewithal to ask for help making a change that 's challenging is often a gradual process one step forward and two steps back along the way , there are usually setbacks before you succeed see my article setbacks
