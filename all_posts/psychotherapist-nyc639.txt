most people begin psychotherapy because they 're not happy with lives by the time they come to therapy , they have often experienced months and sometimes many years of being dissatisfied with their lives for many of them , it 's hard to imagine that their lives could be different in the future so , when i introduce the idea of the future self , some clients look at me as if i 've lost my mind which , by the way , is n't how you want to see your therapist ! so , the concept of the future self needs a little explaining experiencing your future self the self you want to become what is the future self ? the future self is a concept in clinical hypnosis whereby , in a state of relaxation where you have greater access to the richness of your unconscious mind , you can experience yourself as you want to be in a safe and relaxing hypnotic state , you have access to an inner world that you 're usually not aware of during ordinary states of consciousness experiencing the future self is n't just about visualizing yourself as the person that you want to be it 's also having the internal experience of the person that you want to be in your mind and in your body because of the mind body connection most people experience this as very exciting and empowering they 're also surprised that they can have this experience because , in their ordinary states of consciousness , this experience is n't available to them quite to the contrary , in their ordinary states of consciousness , they 're giving themselves negative messages , like i'm not good enough or life will never change the experience of the future self is often available to you in clinical hypnosis when you 've experienced your future self , in clinical hypnosis , as how you want to be , you gain a sense of confidence that will often enable you to pursue a more satisfying and enriching life in clinical hypnosis , there is a concept of anchoring where you can anchor this experience in your body so that it remains accessible to you you can anchor the experience either visually in your body or as a feeling state or both anchoring can be done with images or colors the idea is to make the experience as vivid as possible so you can re experience it in your ordinary state of consciousness this might sound out there and woo woo , but when you 're in a state of dual awareness the awareness of the here and now as well as the awareness of the hypnotic state , this often happens very naturally as adults , we often forget that many of us , as children , were able to use our imagination to experience ourselves as being whatever we wanted to be and although it might be surprising for many adults to experience the future self , it 's also relaxing , refreshing and very satisfying emotionally what if you 're not able to experience your future self in hypnosis ? everyone is different some people , despite years of misfortune and disappointments , can access the experience of the future self in hypnosis without a problem and , as i 've said , this is often a surprise to them because it 's so different from what they normally experience others , for whatever reason , have more difficulty experiencing a future self , but they often know someone , whom they admire , that is close to what they would like to be in those cases , i work with these clients in hypnosis to help them to feel into or embody the experience of this person as they embody this experience , they can feel what it 's like to be calmer , happier , more confident or whatever this person represents for them accessing the richness of your unconscious with clinical hypnosis even if you do n't know someone personally , there might be someone from a movie , a book or someone who is famous in history that you can imagine during a hypnotic state where you can use your imagination to embody his or her experience is n't it wonderful that these states of consciousness are naturally available to us and that we can anchor them so that we can access them at any time ? i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at photo credit alicepopkorn via photopin cc photo credit h koppdelaney via photopin cc photo credit href http www flickr com photos turatti jaci xiii via href http photopin com photopin href http creativecommons org licenses by nc sa cc
