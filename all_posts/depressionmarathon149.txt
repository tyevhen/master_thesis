i survived i finished my sixth , and hopefully final , week of my increased work schedule , and i'm doing okay not much will change this week , as i 've been surprisingly able to maintain a fairly regular exercise and meeting schedule despite the increased work hours however , i am looking forward to getting a bit more rest and hoping to feel a bit more rested this week my mood has remained stable i'm not exactly back where i was prior to this recent dip , but i'm happy i'm not where i was just over a week ago either i'm still pretty amazed at how quickly things turned around saturday horrible sunday better and better is still true like i said , it 's not perfect , but i'm satisfied with better for now i had a good week i exercised , made it to a couple of meetings , had a good visit with my sponsor , and of course , worked work went well i did n't have any of the irritability of the week before i happen to have some amazing patients right now , too , and that always makes work more fun and rewarding i also had the opportunity to speak to a college class this week i always enjoy doing that it was a class of future human service professionals , so they were an interested audience , easy to speak to i love educating people about depression and mental illness , but the truth is , i likely get more out of it than my audience working with others always lifts my spirits so i'm still kicking , my friends i'm so grateful thank you all for your incredibly generous and kind support over the last couple of weeks your words really do make a difference sharing your experience , strength and hope buoys me when i feel so low it reminds me i'm not alone kicking the symptoms of depression is a lot easier when done together
