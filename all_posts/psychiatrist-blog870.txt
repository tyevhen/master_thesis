the title of this post is a take off on the title of my last post , suprise ! i'm a shrink and i'm here to see you ! today , i went to work at my office , and mostly , i saw me all of my patients either did n't show up or canceled their appointments , except , of course , for my last patient it was a really weird day i do n't have an internet connection in the office and i do n't have a tv i do n't even have a desk my office mates were n't there it was me i made phone calls i texted my friends i vacuumed the carpet i made hot tea i talked to clink i thought about roy i listened to npr on the radio in the waiting room i went to lunch at a cafe in the neighborhood , chatted with the owners and checked my email on the free wifi i rested on the couch it was all kind of serene in my younger days , i would have been upset , and if i had my car , i probably would have gone home and fiddled on the internet and done housework i saw my last patient who said , you should go home now , it 's friday i did as i locked up the office , i thought , well i did n't have to cook and i did n't have to do laundry and with limited on line access , it was sort of like being on vacation
