the ability to distinguish between abreaction and a genuine feeling is an essential skill of good primal therapy the difference between the two is stark , but in practice it still can be deceiving feeling is the key to cure , while with abreaction there is no chance of getting well yet , despite this crucial difference , the therapist is often unaware of what is going on , and certainly the patient is equally unaware the insidious part is that abreaction feels like a primal , looks like a primal and smells like a primal , but is far from a genuine primal in clinical terms , abreaction is the devil because it does n't allow patients to get better they remain forever prisoners of their pain in an abominable , endless loop of hurt and hopelessness once abreaction sets in , it becomes a neurosis on top of another neurosis and it is unshakeable it takes months to even try to undo it the danger cannot be overstated we have now seen many patients who have gone to mock primal therapy and are stuck so badly in abreaction that it is almost impossible to extricate them from it if left unchecked , abreaction can even lead to pre psychosis and psychosis it is the job of the therapist to distinguish between abreaction and real feeling to some extent , that is a skill based on the instincts of a trained clinician and acquired by experience for some patients who are mired in abreaction , that skill can mean the difference between successful therapy and staying stuck in mock primals that lead nowhere the good news is that there are also scientific ways to know the difference we can often tell how if a real feeling has been resolved by changes in cortisol levels , vital signs and other biochemical indicators first , to avoid confusion , a definition is in order within primal therapy , the term abreaction means something quite different from its original meaning within freudian psychoanalysis in this psychoanalytic sense , abreaction is simply defined as the process of releasing repressed emotions by reliving an old traumatic experience on the face of it , that classic definition is close to what we would call a primal , although true reliving in our therapy is far beyond what freud had imagined in primal terms , abreaction has nothing to do with any genuine reliving experience on the contrary , for us abreaction is destructive to any feeling therapy because it becomes a defense against real feeling , as i shall explain in detail shortly i must emphasize that abreaction is a non feeling event it looks like feeling , often to both the patient and therapist , but there is a qualitative difference it produces awareness without consciousness , a difference i shall explore in detail in a moment to a well trained therapist there is a hollow ring to abreaction it doesn t smell right a patient may unconsciously use abreaction as a defense against feeling , slipping into crying the minute she lies down , or simulating a birth primal the key difference between abreaction and a true primal , of course , is connection , which takes place in a primal but never in abreaction before we delve into this , however , let me briefly review some of the basic principles of primal therapy these theoretical cornerstones provide the framework needed to understand abreaction as a deviation from a successful coarse of treatment the basis of primal theory and practice is the concept of the three levels of consciousness , corresponding to an individual s stages of development from gestation to adulthood the first line is pre verbal consciousness from the womb through birth and early infancy the second line is laid down in childhood as the brain is still evolving and the third line is current day awareness , the top level consciousness of adulthood those three levels of consciousness correspond to the structure of our triune brain the primitive brainstem first line , the limbic system second line , and the neocortex , our thinking brain third line pain is experienced and repressed at each stage , stamped into the brain as an imprint on the level where it occurs the essence of primal therapy is unveiling the old events so we can live in the present those embedded memories contain painful and frightful feelings that needed to be repressed and kept from consciousness due to their overwhelming valence but they are never forgotten they leave biochemical traces serving as markers that say there was damage here and a hurtful event there through therapy , we can retrace our lives and our embedded memories and revisit them in orderly fashion , undoing the traces and hopefully reversing history by obeying evolutionary dictates so we go back into those evolutionary stages methodically , feeling a bit at a time beginning with the lightest pain in the recent past moving down to the deepest brain levels in proper primal therapy , pain must be relived and resolved in the same evolutionary way it was created on all three levels , but in reverse if we neglect evolution and do not deal with lesser pains first , we will again make a serious biologic error and force a feeling on a patient that he is not ready for there is an adage in science ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny the history of the species is run again in our personal evolution we can see our ancient history in how we evolve from the embryo on fish fins , wings , tails , etc each evolving individual re runs the archaic life of the species we get rid of our tail and are left with a vestige , a tail bone similarly , we have vestiges of our old ancient personal life , which i call the first line that is , we have traces of our lives from a time when only the brainstem was our predominant brain structure and we can visit that ineffable life we lived before birth , and then eschew those traces though primal therapy , which can also be called undoing the imprints or on a molecular level , de methylation imprints mean precisely an event that was so powerful and so painful that it could not be experienced and integrated at the time however , we are older now and can more safely experience them but it takes years to be able to relive the past fully and make it part of us instead of a constant alien force a well ordered therapy begins in the present , anchoring feelings in the present day life over time this will lead to deeper levels along that same feeling path through a process i call resonance once locked into the feeling , the neuro biologic system will take charge enabling the patient to go deeper , traveling to more remote and archaic areas of the brain over months , as the patient follows that evolutionary path , different aspects of the feeling are gathered up at each level until reaching origins where very deep pain lies this process cannot be forced or decided in advance by a therapist who dictates where the patient has to go if feelings are forced out of sequence , no integration will take place i stress this methodical step by step voyage as a warning , because in no other therapy that i know of can interference into the primal sequence by untrained people cause such lasting damage they are meddling with the deep unconscious it took us many decades to understand what to avoid , which is as important as what to pursue we take great care to make sure that the patient descends the feeling chain in proper sequence so as to avoid abreaction , sliding off into pseudo feelings as a defense against the real pain in essence , abreaction is the discharge of a feeling disconnected from its source , making it in fact a defense , or at least reinforcing an existing defense it can be the release of a feeling from one level of consciousness into another level for example , first line into third line or it can be first line disconnected from any other level , taking on a life of its own to the exclusion of any other levels the defense system , in its crafty and brilliant way , can promote many forms of abreaction that may lead to strange ideations , crazy delusions and paranoia instead of leading to the undoing of neurosis , abreaction guarantees that neurosis will persist this happens when the therapist allows the patient to skip evolutionary steps , going through the motions of feelings without feeling them we must trust the feelings totally but first we must recognize them and be able to differentiate them from abreaction , which is the discharge of the energy of a feeling without connection our job is to provide access to feelings , following evolution every step of the way , from the most recent aspect traveling down to the very origin of the pain in the most distant past in this way , we go from an awareness of the feeling to its emotional content and then onto its preverbal base we also go from the lowest valence of pain to the most devastating it increases as we descend down the chain of pain in our ontology when we touch on our beginnings gestation , birth and infancy we see the deepest pain and the most danger to the system , which i call the first line if we do not know brain evolution we can be easily fooled and will rush in to prod a patient s nervous system to perform in ways it cannot hence , abreaction we will make the patient scream or pound the walls when the real feeling is elsewhere once a patient is channeled into abreaction it is almost impossible to pull him back it forms a groove defense that becomes encased , allowing no other feeling in it becomes a neurosis inside another neurosis it is the patient who loses , though he may convince himself he is really feeling or worse , he may be convinced by a therapist that he is feeling when he really isn t sometimes , this may all seem like some kind of plot , but it is simply unconscious reactions to avoid deep pain remember , it takes great skill to produce a connected feeling and no skill to permit abreaction gordon marshall abreaction a dictionary of sociology encyclopedia com july , http www
