i do n't know about you , but being ill exhausts me i have been feeling poorly for over a week now last week was brutal i had a fever , sore throat , stuffy head , and fatigue for days then the cough set in i 've been coughing day and night since late last week it 's exhausting it 's been a tough days besides being sick , which makes everything else more challenging , i 've been worrying about my knee and upcoming surgery i'm worried about how long the recovery will take , and if when i 'll be able to run again i'm worried about my finances , as i do n't have enough sick time to cover my extended leave from work after surgery i'm anxious about my physical condition , and not being able to exercise has compounded my stress i just feel like crap i hate to complain things could be worse and a lot of things are going well i am a little worried about my mood it seems to be sliding i'm not surprised i do n't think i'm dealing with things very well right now my friend , kate , was here this past weekend to run the twin cities marathon we were supposed to run it together it was nice to see her , show her around my state , and introduce her to my friends unfortunately , i think all the socializing we did wore me out and it was really tough watching a race i was supposed to have run by sunday night , i was wiped out i'm supposed to visit d this weekend at his lake home i'm not looking forward to the hour drive i'm still so tired , and i just do n't know if i have the energy to be social for another entire weekend that scares me like i said , i'm worried about my mood i'm finding myself wanting to stay home and sleep instead of doing just about anything else i 've contacted my doctor , and i 've let my best friends know i'm worried about my sliding mood now i'm letting you know , too i need to arrest this before i sink i think this upcoming surgery will be stressful enough i do n't want to add a depression relapse on top of it i 've got to be on guard and proactive i ca n't ignore it as my friend , cindy , told me last night , i have to keep moving forward , one step at a time , and do the next right thing if i can just focus on the next right thing , this too shall pass
