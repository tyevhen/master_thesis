back in the days when i used to do out of hours on call duties , christmas day was generally considered a good shift to have you got double pay for the bank holiday , and no one ever called social services on christmas day boxing day , yes , new year s day , yes , but never christmas day unless someone had chosen that day to go mad it was a snowy evening , very festive i had had my christmas dinner , and was settling down in front of the tv , confident i would not get a call , when my home phone rang robert was a year old man who lived alone he had only a minimal history of mental illness he had been referred to the cmht a few months before after having had an odd transient psychotic episode following general anaesthetic for minor surgery i had actually seen him on one occasion , and although i had found him a little odd , he had not displayed any overt symptoms of mental illness and had not been seen again his father , who lived in a village some miles from robert , had decided to invite him for christmas dinner since robert did not have any transport , his father had picked him up and brought him to his house his father had found him rather quiet and subdued , but robert had been like this for some months , so he thought nothing of it but as the day progressed , robert s father became increasingly worried about him he appeared very stiff , as if his muscles were seizing up , and had to be helped to the dining table his father would try to engage him in conversation , and got the impression that robert was trying to reply , but no words would emerge robert had sat motionless throughout the meal , staring at his plate , but had eaten nothing after the meal , his father had been unable to persuade him to leave the table he called the duty doctor , who gave him a physical examination and found nothing wrong with him , but was equally unable to persuade him to talk or move he came to the conclusion that mental illness was the only explanation , and called us i managed to locate the duty psychiatrist , who was surprisingly easy to persuade to attend perhaps he had had a fraught day with his family and we arranged to meet the gp at the house robert was still seated in the chair at the table the table had been cleared , and he seemed to be staring intently at the table cloth hi , robert , i began , sitting down at the table with him do you remember me ? his eyes flickered , as if he were straining to move them in my direction , and eventually they moved enough so that he could see me however , his neck and body stayed absolutely still i could see his throat quivering , as if he were trying to speak , but the only sound that came out of his slightly open mouth was a low gurgle we asked him a number of questions , but during the minutes or so of the interview the only words he managed to utter , and clearly with much effort , were my heart it was impossible to make a further assessment our impression was that it was a classic case of catatonic schizophrenia , which can be characterised by a complete inability to move or speak he clearly needed further assessment , was unable to give any indication of consent , and we concluded that he needed to be detained in hospital under section for assessment when the ambulance arrived , the crew had to physically lift him , still in a seated position , into the ambulance , and he remained in that position all the way to the hospital he did indeed have catatonic schizophrenia , and in fact i was called on a number of occasions in subsequent years to assess him , frequently with the same presentation but never again on christmas day festive postscript as i was collating the paperwork and writing up my assessment at the hospital , i suddenly noticed his date of birth it was the th december
