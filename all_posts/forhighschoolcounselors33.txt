as i was walking out of the gym one evening , i received a text from one of my former peer helpers she had reached out to me before when she was in a crisis and i suspected she was in another situation although she had a troubled home life , she never missed school , managed to keep all a 's , and had the goal of attending college basically , she was a great kid in a bad home situation when she first started in my peer helping program , she had just moved to our school and rarely spoke to anyone after a couple of months working in our counseling office , she started to open up , smile , and even participate in activities this was a huge milestone ! ! half way through the year , we discovered that she had a volatile home life and was on the urge of being kicked out of her house i ca n't go into the details of why this happened , but let 's just say that her home life really was unpleasant so when i received her text , i knew there was trouble to make a long story short , the student had gotten into trouble and her dad told her that she had to be out of the house it was just after her th birthday the student was forcibly made to leave her home by her dad with no place to go she was n't allowed to take her phone , she had no clothes or jacket and she was not able to take any of her belongings when she texted me she had bought another phone and had a friend to hold on to it , she told me that she was spending the night in the woods next to her house my heart sank here i am sitting my warm car , traveling to warm house , get to sleep in my warm bed and she is sitting in the woods in the rain ! my first thought was her safety and finding her a safe place to stay for the night after i worked on that task , my next thought was to get her into some housing i suggested to her that she go to mother 's house in another state , but she resisted although it made sense to me to be with her mother , she told me that she did not want to leave in the middle of her senior year and would have to start over in another school where she lacked friends or caring teachers asking her what she wanted was important because it allowed her to feel she had a choice and she was n't helpless her desire was to stay in our school and graduate with her friends it took several days and networking , but i am glad to report that she is now safe with temporary lodging until she goes to college next fall currently , there are so many students and their families who are homeless due to financial situations , domestic abuse , natural disasters , evictions , and many other unforeseen circumstances for teens who meet the criteria for homelessness each state has its own criteria for homelessness , referring them to your district 's homeless liaison is the first step in getting them assistance however , there are those teens who hide their homelessness pretty well by couch surfing or living with other families if this student never would have called me , we may have never discovered her homelessness until it was too late to help her helping homeless youth i ca n't tell you the number of teens i have who are living in motels and with other families we know they need assistance , but often we provide them with stuff without asking them about their needs asking homeless teens about their needs is important in helping them feel like they have some ability to make decisions in their own lives what constitutes a homeless student ?
