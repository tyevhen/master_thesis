the news is not good it 's not what i wanted to hear predictable , maybe , but nonetheless a blow to my emotional health once stated aloud my right achilles tendon tear is not completely healed i knew that the news that has me stomping around my house this morning is there really is n't much we can do about it there are no good healing or treatment options beyond gentle stretching , even more gentle strengthening , and time it 's just a confounding , time consuming , difficult to treat injury i ca n't believe it the new york city marathon is out i knew that but i was n't expecting the houston marathon in january , , to be out of the question , too ! it turns out , i may not even be running by january , ! i'm frustrated and disappointed beyond belief actually , disappointed is not a big enough word crushed might be more accurate yes , i am crushed and i'm worried how am i going to get through this ? my recent track record is not hopeful i 've spent at least of the months since this injury occurred in the emotional toilet i'm worried i'm just home from my doctor , and i'm only motivated to go directly to bed and pull the covers over my head and scream and scream i'm being dramatic i apologize not usually my style i just ca n't imagine another , , months without running it 's part of who i am , and no , i do n't want to change that hmmm dramatic and stubborn not a great combination i'm sorry i do know this is not the end of the world i think i need some time to garner a little better perspective but for now , you 'll have to excuse me i 've got more stomping to do
