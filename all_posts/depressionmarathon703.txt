if you are a regular reader , you 're probably a little surprised i typically do n't lead off with a downer like sometimes life is n't fair , but i had to go with it today actually , i planned to go with it yesterday , but i could n't muster the energy to revisit the situation and without further ado , here is the situation yesterday , i basically lost my job yesterday , i got a phone call from my boss she informed me that all patients from this moment forward would be assigned to my co worker , the full time physical therapist i did n't do anything wrong my boss says she does n't want to lose me she 'd like me to stay with the company , but until we get our patient census up , the full timer will be getting all of the patients for me , no patients means no hours which means no money so i did n't get fired or laid off , but i wo n't be getting any patients to work with until my full time co worker raises her productivity to that which is expected of a full time employee we are still a new agency in this area , and we 've been working hard to get our name out there but we 've been struggling to get enough patients to keep us all busy a full time employee is expected to have visits per week last week she had , and i had visits since the full timer also gets benefits , the company does n't want to pay her , and provide her benefits , for working less than full time they 'd rather not pay me at all apparently it does n't matter that i 've got more seniority than the full time therapist it does n't matter that i 've never called in sick or missed a scheduled visit it does n't matter that i 've been searching out and bringing in many new referrals it does n't matter that i was hired early in the company 's local history and was the only p t on staff for several months in a just , perfect world it all would matter , but sometimes life is not fair the phone call with my boss ended with me in tears she felt bad , but had no other choice the business people who made the decision , she said , looked only at the numbers i love my job i like my company i love my co workers , and i like and respect my boss i do n't want to work someplace else but i now have no other choice sometimes life is not fair i'm sad i'm hurt i'm scared i know i will get through this , but in the meantime it sucks it just sucks i 've already been living paycheck to paycheck , so i ca n't afford to waste any time as soon as i finish this post , i 'll be updating my resume and moving forward i do n't want to do it , but i will there is no other way to go one foot in front of the other one foot in front of the other
