hi friends ! my first bits of nesting instinct have kicked in paige has new goals with her therapists and it inspired me to reorganize her playroom to suit them i love the changes ! she had a book nook in the corner of the room that we moved out of there and into our family room she is always so busy playing in the room that she never takes as much interest in the books there and it took up a lot of space now that the book sling and cushion are in the family room , paige can be found over there reading through all her books aloud and participating in quiet play with her animals and dollhouse it 's much more harmonious and peaceful her play kitchen had been in our family room we tried to encourage her to use it there to no real avail , so we moved it into the playroom where the book nook was we moved her table and chairs to the center of the floor in front of the play kitchen to encourage her to cook and create tea parties the blue bookcase used to hold all of paige 's musical instruments she just tossed them onto shelves and it did n't make much sense organizationally so , i put them into a basket on the toy shelf unit and am now using the shelves for all the play kitchen food , utensils , baking materials , etc all of the kitchen related items are together in the corner and she 's already played with it a bunch of times in one day ! now , she is ready to learn about sequencing and extending her pretend play story lines to include filling the teapot and setting the table and pouring the tea into the cups and giving cookies to her guests you know the drill for language , she is working on prepositions in , next to , under , on , below , etc and number concepts a few , many , most of , some of , all of and we can work on this with the tea party theme too i will even put napkins in the area for her to work on her folding skills these are all skills that will transfer over well in social situations with other children when the time comes and they are skills that can transfer over to real life in the home at dinner time we 're excited ! save
