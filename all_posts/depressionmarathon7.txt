so i was minding my business the other morning , new year 's day morning to be exact , sipping my coffee and perusing my favorite websites , when i reached across the table and dumped my coffee onto my laptop i 've been sipping coffee while perusing the web every morning for years more than once i 've thought about the possibility of doing exactly what i did , but i never changed my behavior perhaps i 'll change it now , as i 've been without a computer for the better part of a week so i'm wishing you all a happy new year just a few days late with my luck over the whole of , i figured my laptop was ruined for sure it was an inauspicious start to the new year i quickly soaked up the coffee with one of my super absorbent dog towels and then took a blow dryer to the keyboard surprisingly , when i left for work a few minutes later , my computer was working i thought maybe my luck had turned ! unfortunately , by the time i arrived home later in the day that was not the case i could n't sign in my computer was toast but perhaps my luck has turned i can in no way afford a new laptop , so i took my computer to a repair shop of all the possibilities , up to and including my computer being toast , the diagnosis was relatively simple i just need a new keyboard ! cleaning up the coffee immediately and thoroughly saved the important inner workings for once , i thought , something went my way ! i'm hoping this is a sign of bigger and better things to come maybe my luck will turn around this year a coworker sent me a text just after midnight , new year 's day it was a picture of a sign which said , i do n't make resolutions all i want is for to be better than she thought of me , she said it 's always nice to be thought of , and i could n't agree more ! please , , be better than ! that 's what i'm working toward today happy , my friends !
