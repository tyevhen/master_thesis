mia the malpractice attorney is back , this time as a patient she needles paul he had an affair , did n't he ? he left his wife for a younger woman , did n't he ? he wishes he was close with his daughter , does n't he ? she 's uncanny mia remembers every detail of paul 's old office , and she holds him responsible for making the decision that she should have an abortion still childless and entering an early menopause , she feels he owes her a child she implies that maybe they could have a romance ah , she asked him out for a drink before asking him to come for a therapy session and paul 's boundaries are so much better than last season mia talks at length about her special relationship with her father , only to stop and announce she does n't want therapy paul notes that this is all he has to offer , and that perhaps he will once again disappoint her patients sometimes remember details in a way that therapists might not mia remembers the black and blue colors of paul 's couch years ago , the way the light fell in his office how paul goaded her into an abortion we 're left to wonder what exactly paul said , and i hope mia 's memory has distorted the events that transpired but who knows , paul 's done some pretty outrageous things ah , but at least he has his old notes from his year old sessions with mia april is back , she 's angry and wants to use the phone her iphone battery just died wow , an iphone at that she kicks paul out of his own office to use the phone she talks about ex boyfriend kyle , autistic brother , danny she talks about her fears of relationships and how she slept with kyle 's best friend now she 's hung up on her ex and i hate girls like this she thought of letting kyle help her schedule chemotherapy mostly , the session is about april connecting with paul she 's starting to trust him , to open up to him they can talk about her cancer in a more genuine way , she does n't run out and scream ah , but she gets heated when paul mentions he talked to an oncologist about her condition , without mentioning her name she yells , you had no right to do this oh , but he did if he gave no identifying information they make a deal he wo n't talk about her to anyone , she wo n't leave therapy without calling the session was about rapport it went well and paul takes note now , in a spiral notebook the guy 's never heard of patient charts ?
