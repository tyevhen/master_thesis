close encounter be still , old heart , the lord walks through the grass his porcelain feet divide the snaking mist you weep and worship as you feel him pass you wo n't look up your eyes have turned to glass your sin imagines some unholy tryst be still , old heart , the lord walks through the grass you almost raise your eyes , feel small and crass he turns toward you and all your muscles twist you weep and worship as you feel him pass you would look up you check the hourglass , timing the timeless , hoping he 'll desist be still , old heart , the lord walks through the grass eye contact seems too much of a trespass you hear him saying , stand ! do not resist you weep and worship as you feel him pass you dodge god 's love as if he would harass ! your faith ca n't get beyond his mailed fist be still , old heart , the lord walks through the grass you weep and worship as you feel him pass this poem approximates how i sometimes feel toward the almighty i ca n't look , i ca n't even raise my head up because i am so beset with my own sins this is unfaith i should believe christ has taken all my sins upon himself and gaze at god with confidence but what i believe and what i feel are divided when i last wept in church , i do n't know if it was because i felt god had failed me or i had failed god mostly it is a feeling of being cast out of the garden , of being unable to believe that god would accept me in his loving embrace the psyche bleeds into spirituality without doubt the fact that my mother never held me affectionately , but took care of my needs in a semi robotic way , certainly influences my inability to accept grace , god 's unmerited favor toward sinners it 's hard for me to imagine , psychologically , a god so loving that he suffers all and forgives all christianity is hard to grasp partly because it 's too simple you mean all i have to do is believe this is true ? as i said , believing by no means translates to feeling , and humans need feelings to back up their beliefs in one such as myself , who suffers from a disease of feelings , it 's particularly hard perhaps that makes my faith more noble , perhaps less i ca n't say i only know , dimly , that there have been times in my life when i did feel whole , forgiven , cleansed , bathed in light usually these experiences came in the presence of unspoiled nature rather than church i make no apologies for that the redwoods exceed any cathedral i 've visited a question for thought how might an autistic person relate to god ? someone the opposite of me , afflicted with no feelings , rather than feelings too intense and sustained here endeth the epistle for the day thine in timid faith , ce
