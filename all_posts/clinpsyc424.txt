a psychologist in the uk , lisa blakemore brown , is facing all sorts of trouble as i understand it , the british psychological society is in the process of examining brown 's purported fitness to practice psychology essentially , blakemore brown has taken controversial points of view regarding the relationships between vaccinations and autism as well as munchausen 's syndrome from my research on her case , it appears that this case is an example of a dissident being punished for offending the wrong people it would appear to have little to do with her actual fitness to practice psychology i'm not agreeing or disagreeing with her views i am stating that she 's got the right to state those views , regardless of whom is offended a much more in depth layout of the issues involved can be seen at the scientific misconduct blog to preview , much of this boils down to what appear to be unsubstantiated charges regarding brown 's mental state alleged paranoia , which then allegedly makes her too unstable to practice psychology i 've heard rumors that there is a lot more to come in this saga stay tuned
