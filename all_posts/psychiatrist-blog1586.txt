i came to talk about mood stabilizers and figured i 'd start by summarizing our sidebar poll what is your favorite mood stabilizer ? only every time i come on , the poll has gotten more votes , so i guess i'm waiting for the mood stabilizer poll to stabilize here 's where we 're at so far what 's your favorite mood stabilizer ? lithium depakote valproate zyprexa olanzapine other atypical anti psychotics carbamazepine tegretol gabapentin neurontin lamotrigine lamictal votes , lamictal has been consistently in the lead since the beginning both surprising and not surprising i talked about how a shrink chooses an antidepressant i have less to say about how a shrink chooses a mood stabilizer in fact , i'm not really sure i 'll tell you how this shrink chooses a mood stabilizer it 's not that much different , so click on the that post for more details history of past response family history of response patient preference this is a big one with mood stabilizers the gold standard is lithium and some patients just wo n't hear of it they think taking lithium means they 're really far gone , that it 's heavy duty stuff , that it means they 're crazy medical issues lots of them with mood stabilizers lithium can effect the thyroid and kidneys , it interacts with lots of other meds , depakote can effect the liver , so can tegretol , lots to think about , lots to monitor how strongly i'm convinced that the patient has had a full blown manic episode plenty of people say i'm bipolar but the history does n't reveal a story for episodic , syndromic co occurance of the hallmark symptoms of mania elevation in mood or irritability , increased energy decreased need for sleep , quickening of thoughts or speech , impulsivity with regard to spending , sexuality , religion , hallucinations , grandiose delusions , inflated sense of worth or well being none of these symptoms alone are enough to diagnose mania , ya gotta have a few and they have to occur at the same time as the other symptoms lots of people shop impulsively to cheer themselves up , lots of people have periods where they feel more energetic and productive , lots of people get happy when they win the lottery it 's sometimes hard to get a history for a syndromic diversion from a baseline or pre morbid personality if i think someone definitely has bipolar disorder , and there is n't a reason not to use it , i start with lithium it 's a good mood stabilizer it 's cheap i'm familiar with how to use it it 's also a good anti depressant augmenter despite all the hype about the awful side effects weight gain , nausea , tremor , cognitive slowing , renal and thyroid impairment , i 've seen lots of people have good responses and not have any side effects , so i start with that assumption and i use low doses if the patient gets better , i do n't push the level , even if it 's really low if the patient has intolerable side effects , i try another preparation of lithium eskalith , lithobid , and if that does n't work , i stop it and try another med why do i like lithium ? i think because i 've heard enough people put up resistance , then try it and come in saying i feel normal for the first time the down side is that you have to do bloodwork every months even if the patient is well and has no symptoms if i'm not so sure about the manic component as a real , syndromic entity , and the primary complaint is depression , i start with lamictal the upside it 's well tolerated , people like it , there 's no routine labwork and there 's no stigma the down side slow going to build up from a dose of mg to the therapeutic range of around mg another down side that fatal rash risk and the final down side i 've heard a couple of anecdotes of patients who have ended up in the icu with rashes , liver zorkout , life threatening problems not a lot , but it only takes one such story to make you hold your breath when you write a prescription and i have a friend who says i 'll never be able to prescribe lamictal again it 's not science i actually tell patients this story from hell when i prescribe it , and they 'll still take it over lithium mostly , it 's a good medication , it 's well tolerated , and it helps if a patient does n't want lithium , i prescribe depakote it 's associates with it 's own issues , including weight gain , needs lab monitoring , and if the patient does n't have insurance , it 's expensive and hard to get samples of i have n't prescribed tegretol in ages and i wondered if the reason it 's so unpopular on our sidebar is because it is n't used so much i prescribe anti psychotic medications to people who are agitated , acutely suffering , not sleeping , in need of something quicker than lithium depakote or lamictal these medications work , they 're well tolerated , patients like them and i worry about the metabolic effects and wish there was some free ride sometimes i use one of the older anti psychotic navane may be my favorite if there is no history of substance abuse hmmm , that 's rare in people with bipolar disorder , i may prescribe some ativan or klonopin for the short term i have n't used trileptal , i do n't know why i have a patient or two on neurontin , i stopped prescribing it when studies showed it did n't help with mood stabilization perhaps i was wrong and i have n't seen very many people tolerate topamax , though i have seen it work wonders for migraines lithium is my favorite okay i know there are lots of people out there who 've had bad experiences with lithium i'm not advocating that anyone re try a medication they did n't tolerate i'm just suggesting that everyone responds differently and before the medication is prescribed , your doc does n't have any way of knowing if you will have problems or be one of those people who has a wonderful response and no side effects and to one of our anonymous commenters who wrote in anonymous said i hope you have a really great reason for purposely for gathering useless data yes , anonymous , i had a really great reason i was curious , wondered if i 'd learn something and i did and i thought i 'd use the information for a blog post rest assured , i have indeed gathered completely useless and out of context data it still makes me happy when my useless information is quoted by the wall street journal
