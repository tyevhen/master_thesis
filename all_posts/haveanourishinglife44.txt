personally , i have a problem with categorizing food as unhealthy vs healthy i understand that there are different foods they re not all the same and i realize that there is a hierarchy of food some foods have more nutritional benefits than others but unless you re eating cardboard , your body will metabolize whatever you eat into energy , muscle , necessary fat , etc likewise , i think it s harmful to teach kids about unhealthy vs healthy food the danger lies in the rhetoric , what we say , how we talk about the topic the problem is that young kids learn in black and white if you ve ever been around kids , you know this is true they take things very literal they don t yet have a developed vocabulary to understand all the gray area found in food hierarchy when you re teaching kids about right and wrong , you use words like bad and good they learn what these words mean before they can understand abstract concepts such as sometimes or depending on the situation if you re going to teach kids about unhealthy healthy food , until they are in about the th grade , they will translate your words into black and white statements , wrong and right , and bad vs good tell a little kid that certain foods are unhealthy and they will look at you and either stare or say what or ask you what that means you might say , well , unhealthy means it s not good for your body to eat that all the time kid translation , not good means bad this is a bad food or you might take a different approach and tell them that unhealthy food will make you feel sick no one likes a belly ache if the kid is old enough to understand this , he might follow your advice but a stomach ache is still bad in his mind , and he will still think of that food as being bad the problem with learning that some foods are bad is that it becomes a moral decision if you eat a bad food then you committed a bad act does it merit a time out , a spanking , or something worse ? it would be better to let children learn about how food affects them on an individual basis kids learn about their bodies and their appetites through experience they develop preferences and likes and dislikes over a span of many years telling a kid that a food they like , i e ice cream or candy , is unhealthy will create confusing signals in their developing brains how can something i like and that tastes good be bad ? some kids , if they aren t ever allowed to have bad or unhealthy food , might resort to hiding food , hoarding food , obsessing over food , or lying about what they ate this causes unnecessary shame and guilt for a little kid because in their minds it becomes if you eat bad food , you become a bad person even as adults , we tend to think this way because of our thin obsessed culture , foods that could potential cause you to gain weight are deemed bad or , have you heard the phrase sinfully delicious foods that could potential cause health problems are called unhealthy regardless of scientific backing or not the bottom line is food choices are not moral choices food choices are preferential , like favorite colors , picking out furniture for your home , or listening to certain music as opposed to others you are not a good or bad person depending on what you choose to eat and , actually , if you think about it , food choices have more to do with social status because some foods are more expensive than others , i e organic brands , food choices can become another way to separate the society s classes but that could be a whole other post in and of itself no one should tell another person what to eat or not eat each person is so intrinsically different and has his or her own needs , preferences , and individuality if certain foods make you feel physically ill , give you a headache , indigestion , etc , there is no reason to ignore your individual reaction however , other people might have no problems with those foods the problem lies in using blanket statements categorizing food into black and white , good and bad lists in reality , we don t know everything there is to know about nutrition , healthy , and preventing life threatening diseases i think healthy problems are more related to genetics and hereditary factors than to what someone does or doesn t eat whether or not that s true , the state of someone s soul does not depend on what they do or don t eat the truth is everyone is going to die at some time or another instead of obsessing over your food choices , spend more time getting your heart and soul in shape if we all spent as much time in prayer as we do thinking about unhealthy vs healthy food , the world would be a much better place
