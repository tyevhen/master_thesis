because we are undoing and redoing your life ? because we are opening up the gates of repression and allowing access to deeply embedded pain ? because we need to open the gates slowly so that the patient is never overwhelmed by what is buried down below it takes skills and patience it is so easy to open the patient up and get dramatic results results that resemble a primal but are largely a release of the pressure of the feeling without its content it feels good and can fool the patient and the doctor i teach all of the time how to avoid all this and keep the patient sane when we reach down into the unconscious that predates words and feelings and parallels the archaic brain , we are touching on a primitive brain that deals in impulses and reptilian movements it emanates from millions up millions of years ago with a brain that can be rageful , or terror ridden , and ultimately can register deep hopelessness labeled as suicidal depression it is largely the brainstem and the lower reaches of the nervous system it is an area that takes great care and does not support a booga booga approach , where anything goes we adhere to science and facts and try not to concoct theories that do not correspond to reality remember we are attempting to put together a disconnected brain system where nervous impulses were severed from their counterpart so that feelings had little or no access to corresponding ideas and beliefs feelings stopped being a guide for behavior and left the person bereft of guidelines
