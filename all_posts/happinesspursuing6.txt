this is something i really haven t given much thought to if you were to look back at this blog , which constitutes pretty much all my thinkinhttp www blogger com img blank gifg about depression since i started it , you d probably find that around of it are posts featuring me whining about my self diagnosed chronic depression , around about one or another alternative cure i ve considered , about miscellaneous stuff , and the remaining about how bad i am at math but , actually coping with depression , living day after day with this dark companion , is something that i ve avoided altogether both in my head and on this blog , at least as an explicit topic of conversation i ve been so concerned about how much it sucks and how great it will be when i get over it that i ve missed the obvious to quote jack nicholson s line , what if this is as good as it gets ? what then ? how have i coped and survived until now and how will i continue to do so ? a few weeks ago , i got an email from a teenager in australia let s call him tom he is also depressed it appears to be chronic and he s getting help he s not hiding it and , under the australian health care system , he has access to real help so good so far , right ? he emailed me because he felt that i , being someone more than twice his age with roughly the same set of problems , could provide some insight that the best of his counselors haven t so far to paraphrase because i didn t ask permission to quote him , he basically had two questions based on the single premise that , since he seems to be stuck with this depression thing for life is it really worth it to go on ? if so , then how does he cope with it because all the meds and counseling in the world , though they can help , might never make it really go away i didn t ask his permission because i didn t know if i would respond at all i m still not sure , as i type this sentence , if i can come up with something worth saying i ve been pretty flummoxed since i got his email given that i ve never really considered question , it gave me a lot to think about how have i coped ? do i really know or do i plod through the day , fearful of the alternative ? i m still not entirely sure let s tackle question first we re talking about suicide although he never said it it s something to talk about most professionals and patients seem to treat suicide as the no no , hush hush alternative that we must never speak of or even allow ourselves to consider i don t really have a problem with it , i really don t who s to say that a person in a severe depressive episode is in any less pain than something who s body is failing from a terminal disease your conclusion about whether or not someone in the latter situation should be given the ability to kill herself may be different from mine but , in the post kevorkian world , i think that we can all agree it s something that should be considered and discussed ah , you say , depressive episodes pass and the person has the chance at life beyond it true , but a life punctuated by random , unpredictable depressive episodes may be too much for one to deal with ultimately , the moral positions on suicide are not unlike abortion they are too wrapped up in personal ethics , religious beliefs and societal mores for there to be a clear , universal answer i believe it should be a personal choice i do not consider someone who commits suicide to be immoral or even wrong the exception in my mind is when one commits suicide when he has obligations , financial or otherwise , to his friends or family it is condemnable to leave behind someone to clean up the mess that he was too cowardly to clean up himself but , none of that really addresses tom s question , does it ? is it worth it to go on ? here s the answer that seems to have evolved in my life yes , for the most part , it s worth it to go on i have more good days than bad and , most of the time , i m hopeful about the future i m also curious about the future i really want to know how things will turn out it seems a little silly to base my mortality on seeing the plot through but it works for me , somehow i m also damn scared of killing myself at my lowest moments , the thing that kept me from doing the deed can only be described as pure cowardice so , is it worth it to go on ? as i said before , so far , for me , it beats the alternative okay , then , on to tom s second question how to cope with it ? this is the bit that really stymied me i really don t know how i ve coped as i turned this question and the answers i could think of over in my head i began to realize that i was writing a commencement address seek your happiness , be true to yourself , love your family , blah , blah , blah like i said , tom s a teenager and he s set to graduate soon enough i ll leave the platitudes for the c list actor who happened to graduate from tom s high school and gives that speech the year he graduates so , i tried harder to come up with real answers the thing about depression is that it is our problem it is fairly well defined and we kind of have a list of things it does to us however , everyone has problems , right ? i heard of a study a few years ago that says that babies and toddlers feel the same level of anxiety over their little dramas as we adults do it seems silly to consider that a missing toy leads to the same amount of stress as trying to figure out how to pay the utilities on a limited budget but , apparently , it does my point is that i think humans tend to look for and focus on points of tension in our lives we depressives are lucky in a twisted way in that we know the source of our tension and we sort of know what to expect from it other people with a different set of less definable problems are trying to deal with them as best as they can i m not sure if i m making my point very clearly here or if i even really had one to begin with let s move on as i ve stumbled through life , i seem to have settled to two key points that guide me the first is to know your depression this means that it s important to learn when depression is making you feel a certain way or real life circumstances are rage , anxiety and sadness are all occasional symptoms of depression they are also symptoms of the human experience whenever you feel extreme emotions , take a beat and try to identify if it s a result of real life or some meaningless , internal storm i ve lost friends and alienated family members over not being able to tell the difference innocent comments can be misinterpreted when observed through a depressive filter and turned into insults my second best bit of advice is never blame your depression i m talking about both externally and internally externally is easy just don t do it never use your depression as an excuse for your actions if you are an ass to your best friend because you misinterpreted an innocent comment while you were having a particularly low day , don t say you did it because you are a depressive your depression might have influenced you but final decision to lash out was yours apologize , hope he accepts it and move on this isn t to say that you never talk about your depression your friends might be a great source of support for you just don t rely on it as an excuse for your bad actions more importantly , never tell yourself that you acted a certain way or made a bad decision because of your depression once again , depression might have influenced you but , ultimately , you are responsible for what you do blaming depression becomes a crutch , relieving you of all responsibility and that can become a vicious cycle i m even more depressed now because my life sucks because i made bad decisions because i was depressed at the time so now my decisions are going to be even worse and my life will suck all the more depression may be a part of who you are until the day you die but never let it define who you are i tried to avoid platitudes but that last sentence came dangerously close , didn t it so , tom , there s my answer i m sorry it took so long but you really threw me on that one you gave me a lot to think about and i hope i gave you a little insight , too best of luck , brother ! this blog post contains a sponsored link
