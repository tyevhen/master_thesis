viruses have two modes of reproductive existence in the familiar lytic cycle , the virus infects a cell , replicates itself until the cell bursts , and hundreds or thousands of virions are produced but there is also a lysogenic mode of viral existence , in which the virus inserts a copy of its dna in the host 's own dna the viral dna thus inserted becomes known as a prophage , which can remain dormant for long periods of time the prophage can often be induced to enter a lytic cycle by exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide or mitomycin c induction of phages in this fashion is thought to occur when a phage repressor protein is cleaved by reca after the latter is upregulated in the sos response prophage genes are seen in a wide variety of bacteria a paper estimated that over of bacterial genomes contain prophage genes , and in fact human dna is thought to contain at least retroviral gene remnants there 's reason to suspect that certain large dna animal viruses such as herpes and vaccinia have a lysogenic cycle certainly , viruses like varicella zoster which can produce shingles many years after a person 's initial infection can remain dormant for decades before suddenly undergoing induction to a lytic phase viruses that live an exclusively lytic lifecycle have relatively few opportunities to co evolve with the host , because they spend little time in the host such a virus might spend years hanging around in the environment before encountering a host cell then the lytic reproductive cycle may last only minutes or hours , and it 's back to hanging around in the environment the situation is much different for a temperate virus i e , one that has a lysogenic cycle a lysogenic virus essentially becomes an integral , first class component of the host dna and undergoes the same replication and repair processes that apply to host dna accordingly , we should expect to see a much different pattern of evolution in the genes of lysogenic viruses or prophages and indeed we do the phylogenetic tree below was prepared using viral phage and bacterial genes for dna adenine methylase dam , an enzyme involved in dna repair and replication what 's interesting about this gene is that many bacteria have their own native copies of this gene plus a prophage copy and they differ , but not as much as , say , lytic phage thymidine kinase versus native bacterial tk i showed phylo trees for viral and bacterial tk enzymes in a prior post if you 'll recall , these enzymes differ so drastically that it 's not at all clear that one derives from the other , ancestrally dna adenine methylase genes from three enteric bacteria and two phages marked with asterisks the top branch shows very close homology between prophage genes and their bacterial paralogues the bottom branch shows that the native bacterial isoform of the enzyme is not as closely related to the prophage versions with the dam genes , we see an interesting segregation pattern there are two main branches to the phylo tree in the upper branch are the phage dam genes along with bacterial paralogues of these genes the bottom branch shows how the non paralogous non prophage dam genes segregate to make these relationships clearer , here 's a chart showing the overall g c content as well as the gc g c content at codon base for the various genes the entries shaded in grey represent prophage genes notice that the g c percentages are significantly lower for the prophage genes , but are higher than in free living lytic cycle phages where gc , in particular , is often less than dna adenine methylase genes for enteric bacteria and their temperate phages base composition stats for prophage isoforms are shown in grey organism gene g c gc shigella sp strain d zp e coli ehw s enterica aal e coli ehw salmonella phage re yp shigella sp strain d egj s enterica etb fels phage yp if you compare the phylo tree shown further above with the phylo tree in my earlier post about thymidine kinase genes , you 'll note that the prophage dam genes cluster very tightly with bacterial versions of these genes that 's because , as a fully integrated part of the genome , the prophage genes benefit from the host 's dna repairosome they evolve gradually over long periods of time by the usual mechanisms the genes are notably host like because they 're continuously repaired and groomed in the same manner as host dna the takeaway here is if you create a phylo tree for a set of genes from hosts and viruses , and the genes cluster tightly with host versions , you 're probably looking at the result of longterm lysogeny on the other hand , if the virus genes do not cluster with host genes as they usually do n't ! , that means you 're looking at viruses that have a predominantly lytic mode of existence viruses that probably got their genes from a far distant ancestor of the modern day host , if not from a primordial precellular precursor of some kind
