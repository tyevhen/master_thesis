my friend joann and i have talked about this several times lately the fact that parenting jack is infinitely more difficult than parenting nathan it doesn t make intuitive sense nathan is clearly way more affected by autism than jack , or to an outsider , it may seem that way honestly , i don t think it s so i think jack s life is impacted severely by his autism as he gets older , it s getting harder and harder to watch the issues that jack faces are considerable , but of course when one looks at the fact that nate cannot yet communicate well , that he is so impacted every second of every day , and jack is in mainstream first grade , it may not seem that way i want to make it clear that i am extremely proud of my boy he was recently dismissed from his special needs reading group , which mean he has caught up to his grade level how huge is that ? especially for jack i talk about all of the noise that there seems to be for nate , how many distractions there are in his own little head the same is fully true for jack when john and i went away for a night last year it hit us just how quiet our hotel room was that is because both of the boys almost continuously hum it s verbal stimming jack also does quite a bit of physical stimming jerky movements , still some flapping of his arms , lots of jumping i ve grown so used to it , that i forget how significant it is until we are out in public do you ever wonder what your child must be feeling ? what compels them to do this ? i know they are seeking input , but i often wonder what that experience is like jack s obsessions have driven me crazy for a long time when he talks about something , he talks about it all the time , it never , never , ever stops he repeats the same things , lines of text or quotes from movies about the subject over and over again and then , since he is smart enough to know that you might tune him out , he requires you to respond to him he will repeat the same thing in your face over and over and over until you respond for a long time , it felt like john and i had lost our bond , because when we finally got jack to sleep each night , we fled to separate corners of the house , really didn t interact much at all it s taken a long time , and lots of counseling and reflection for me to realize that we are running to opposite ends of the house because we literally don t want to hear anyone talk our ears are ringing ringing it is that intense , almost all of the time with jack when someone new meets jack , you can literally watch the progression it starts with wow , he really knows a lot about blank , he must be really smart then a few minutes in , there is the amused smile fast forward a few more minutes and the smile is frozen on the person s face this is not to say that they don t like jack , but that they realize he is not going to stop and he doesn t i can redirect him a million times it has little to no effect it is really , really hard and the thing is he is not being naughty he is rarely naughty how do you scold a child for something that they cannot control ? this impacts jack s life and well being greatly he is happy in his world , i think but the more and more i watch him , the more it breaks my heart how must this feel ? to feel literally incapable of thinking about anything else ? to be this compelled to talk about the same thing , use the same words , over and over , to never feel satisfied or done ? if his words are this intense , how intense are his thoughts ? i don t think i could tolerate living that way and he is , jack is living with this , and is in mainstream first grade it causes many issues for him he has a full time aide to help keep him on task this includes his walk to and from the bus he struggles to complete his work and quite often doesn t and socially ? he has been invited to two birthday parties all year one party was for a little boy he met as cisco center last summer , one for an old friend of mine s daughter so , in fact he has been invited to no birthday parties by kids at school he told me for weeks that one little boy was his best friend at school , but then in a moment of conversation , when he was really sharing with me he said that the boy told him that he sometimes likes him , but that he won t invite him to his birthday broke my heart he does not recognize these social snubs for what they are , but i do and i want to help him , but how ? i work full time i wish i could be in the classroom volunteering and keeping an eye on how things are going from a social perspective , but i can t i wish i could be that mom that has time for play dates on a regular basis , but i m not most of my friends at this point are in the special needs community , which makes perfect sense considering our situation , but those are the main people who we socialize with on the weekends i mean , nate has a birthday party to go to at least once or twice a month , because all of the families at his school are special needs families and we all invite all the kids because we know what it s like not to be invited it s because jack is with typical kids when he is in fact , not typical , that he struggles in this way he may not feel the impact now , but at some point , i am sure he will so even though jack is functioning , with assistance , in mainstream school , his struggles are many and significant i sometimes get caught up in worrying about nate and lose sight of this , so i guess i am giving myself a bit of a wake up call here it is so hard to strike a balance with these two kiddos with such different , yet substantial issues
