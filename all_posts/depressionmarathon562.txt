i'm sitting here with my feet up , drinking my coffee , computer on my lap , espn 's sportscenter flickering on the tv , dressed in my medical scrubs , dreading going to work minus the dread , this is my usual morning routine i get up early specifically so i have time to relax , gather my thoughts , and prepare myself for the day the dread , as i suggested , is new it sucks to dread going to work the dread began after the big boss threw me the curveball , by demanding i change my schedule , a week and a half ago last week was okay because he was on vacation but on monday , he was back , and the tension was palpable his office is just down the hall from the therapy department i pass it , back and forth , probably times per day in addition , we often meet in the hallway we met more than once on monday he did not have a word to say , and his glare was menacing really rather immature , i think , but no less disturbing so what does one do when the boss is a jerk ? i tried my best to ignore his pettiness , but i could n't help but expect to be called into his office again thankfully , i was n't but will i be summoned today ? i do n't know it does n't pay to worry about it , really i ca n't control whether i will be summoned or not i ca n't control his thoughts or his petty behavior perhaps today he wo n't be such a jerk , but i think that 's wishful thinking it sucks to feel such dread i 've got to get going now i 've said my prayers , and i think i 'll say a few more i 'll try to focus on my patients , enjoy them , stay positive , and have fun i 'll do my best to ignore what i should n't have to worry about and i 'll make that follow up phone call regarding the job i interviewed for last week ! that 's one way to deal with a boss that 's being a jerk , i guess
