a common myth about psychotherapy , especially among people who have never been in in depth psychotherapy before , is that clients primarily complain to their psychotherapists about their families and their lives or come in to fix a particular problem this is a very narrow view of psychotherapy and does not take into account the full richness and experience of the in depth psychotherapy process as a place where clients , in addition to resolving particular problems , often find balance and gratitude in their lives , their relationships and for themselves as well during this thanksgiving season , when we tend to be more aware of the people and things in our lives that we are grateful for , i 'd like to focus in this post on how in depth psychotherapy often leads to a greater sense of balance and gratitude often , when people first begin psychotherapy , they either come for a particular problem or they have a sense that something is wrong in their lives , but they do n't know what it is in our culture , our tendency is to approach problems in a logical , linear way identify the problem , analyze the various options , chose an option , fix the problem , and the process is finished there 's nothing wrong with this approach and , in many instances , it works very well it also often works well for some specific problems in psychotherapy and hypnosis , like smoking cessation or overcoming a particular fear or phobia however , in depth psychotherapy can be so much more than this for people who are interested in finding a greater sense of balance and contentment in their lives how contemporary psychotherapy has evolved over the years as psychotherapy has evolved over the years , there has been more of an emphasis on cultivating and building a more balanced sense of self as opposed to more classical ways of working in psychotherapy where the emphasis was primarily on uncovering and working through problems , contemporary psychotherapists also help clients to build a stronger sense of self this is done , in part , through the development of clients' internal resources these internal resources can take many different forms sometimes , they 're coping abilities that clients have had all along but have been overlooked and under utilized often , they 're internal resources , or parts of ourselves , that are discovered and developed during the psychotherapy process when people are depressed or anxious , it 's common to focus on what 's wrong or missing in their lives this is understandable often , under these circumstances , their view starts out being narrow until they begin to feel some relief from their anxiety related or depressive symptoms in a supportive psychotherapy treatment environment in contemporary in depth psychotherapy , clients can begin the process of building a stronger sense of equanimity a greater capacity to soothe themselves , love and value themselves more , appreciate subtle and richer aspects of themselves , and develop a stronger sense of identity with a greater sense of balance for themselves often comes an increased capacity to value and have a greater sense of gratitude and compassion in their relationships , their work , and other important areas in their lives so , what might have started as a narrow view at the start of psychotherapy begins to open up and broaden to include a more holistic and nuanced view of themselves and others not just what 's wrong but what 's right too keeping a gratitude journal i often recommend to clients that they keep a gratitude journal as a way to start developing a greater awareness and appreciation for the positive things that occur in their lives on a daily basis the gratitude journal can be a simple list of two , three or more things that you feel grateful for each day over time , cultivating a sense of gratitude , even for the small things in life , can help to create a greater sense of balance , appreciation , and compassion in how we see our world as well as how we see ourselves i wish everyone a happy and healthy thanksgiving i am a psychotherapist and hypnotherapist in nyc i have helped many clients to develop a greater sense of self and an increased sense of balance and gratitude in their lives to find out more about me , visit my web site josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , please call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com
