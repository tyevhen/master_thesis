i wrote a few months ago about the option of putting jack on medication for his adhd like symptoms as his pediatrician stated , these symptoms are very common in children with asperger 's she was supportive of us either way jack 's teacher has had the very frustrating task of trying to help him focus in class and not hyper focus on things like airplanes she was supportive of a medication trial as well so we took the plunge hesitantly so more like we dipped our toes in and have now yanked our frozen feet out of the water and decided to go another route there are a bazillion adhd medications on the market of them are stimulants , which has always seemed counterintuitive to me our first attempt with medication was to try one of these focalin we started with a low dose and gradually increased and here is where the issue lies for kids like jack he has major sensory issues right ? these stimulants take these issues and multiply them for these poor kids my baby wore headphones all day every day at school for nearly a month because of this medication and he was sleepy most of the time i called the pediatrician and said next ! so then we tried the medication in the other intuniv a non stimulant adhd medication that originally was prescribed for hypertension in adults this medication has for the most part been used to enhance the effects of the stimulant drugs , but our pediatrician and others have had some success using this agent alone in asperger 's kids one caveat jack had to learn how to swallow a pill mommy tried everything i thought to aid in this process we tried pudding , applesauce , ice cream , chocolate sauce , etc and mommy also sat and stared at jack for hours after he had accidentally chewed these slow release pills checking capillary refill and level of arousal as i was afraid he would have a hypotensive episode guess what worked ? juice gulp , gone he can take and pills at a time , who knew ? the result of this medication you have been watching me live it , you just have n't known the reason first , jack has been falling asleep in school multiple times a day second , his ot was in tears at one point because he just was n't jack anymore and i agreed third and most disturbingly the sleep issue jack 's anxiety at night was through the roof waking times a night i have slept at the foot of his bed more nights than i care to admit out of desperation for a little rest and if i so much as shifted like i might get out of bed , jack woke up and called out for me he had other side effects as well , although we ca n't be sure if it was truly the meds or if it was lack of sleep he was being mean to the whole family , using bad language , just not himself although when at school and awake he was supposedly focusing a bit better on his work i doubt this was actually the case , although i am sure he was quieter because he was exhausted i cried uncle about weeks ago now and we started weaning him down , and giving him clonidine for sleep his doctor warned me to give him only half a tablet initially which would probably knock him out try full tablets , and then he would stay asleep for about hours last night i finally saw a light at the end of the tunnel he only woke up twice granted i fell asleep at the foot of his bed and stayed there but he did n't wake up this morning until i cried so if you are wondering why i am being so diligent and adding so many different biomedical interventions it is because i want to avoid medications unless absolutely necessary they are too rough on jack and frankly , how can i be sure that these adhd symptoms are really that ? it 's more likely that his sensory issues , lack of over all core strength and hyperfocus on his areas of interest are what is causing these issues medication is not the answer for that school intervention is enter iep advocate
