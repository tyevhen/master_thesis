are we living in the twitter end times ? i do n't mean to imply that twitter will cease to exist any time soon it may well hobble on , broken and vanquished , like yahoo or aol , forever and like aol , it may well find a loving foster home or caregiver organization that can suck the lifeblood out of its marrow before kicking it into the ditch , as the case may be what i mean to imply by end times is that twitter has long since peaked in popularity and is now clearly on a difficult path , a trajectory of travail dick costolo has had almost two years since the ipo to turn twitter , the public corporation , into a money making business that effort has failed the company continues to burn through million a month in net losses while struggling to keep its user numbers above million meanwhile , over a billion people have tried twitter , and most of them have moved on ben thompson gives a good summary of twitter 's problems in his blog post of april he points out twitter s mau monthly active user numbers are not necessarily what they seem , particularly from an advertising perspective the company disclosed last year that of its maus never visit twitter s website or apps rather , these users have connected rd party applications and websites that don t display twitter ads for example , you can log into twitter from instagram in order to post a link to a photo moreover , that number doubled over the previous year , a stark contrast to facebook s figure worse , a sizable portion of those users may be lapsed completely according to twitter approximately of maus are due to applications that automatically ping twitter without any user involvement one example of such an application was ios safari in twitter s q results the company blamed its slowing user growth numbers on ios , which ended safari s practice of pinging twitter for its shared links whether or not the logged in user ever read that section the proper interpretation , though , was not that twitter s user growth numbers were accidentally and temporarily slowed , but rather that the company had been over counting maus for at least a year add in the fact that , according to twitter , up to of maus are likely spam accounts , and it s fair to wonder just how many people are actually being served ads from twitter s advertisers the real numbers are probably far worse than ben thompson is saying the idea that only of users are fakes , bots , or scammers is ludicrous it 's far more likely to be north of as i reported last month , of ceo dick costolo 's own twitter followers are abandoned accounts , bots , fakes , or otherwise defective also , there 's the problem of duplicate accounts many of twitter 's most active users including advertisers , of course for example , google have multiple accounts one spammer recently created over , individual accounts twitter ceo dick costolo looked haggard as he tried to explain the data leak that allowed last quarter 's results to leak to the outside world prematurely , on april and then there 's the bot problem people buy and sell bot created twitter users by the thousands now and then there 's the adult content problem if you 're an advertiser , you probably do n't want your promoted tweet to land next to a spread eagle shemale selfie , or other explicit material the problems go on and on , but the main problem is advertising on twitter does n't seem to be making financial sense for a lot of advertisers this is a hard issue to dodge , because with modern analytics , it 's possible for an advertiser to calculate and track , to the penny , what a customer acquisition costs because of the google inspired auction system used by twitter , a single click on a link or order button can cost an advertiser as much as or maybe it 's only but the point is , either way , that cost gets tracked , and roi gets calculated , and at the end of the day there 's absolutely no uncertainty around the question of whether a given twitter ad campaign was successful or not if you read ben thompson 's analysis scroll down to his worrying signs from advertisers , it does n't sound like advertisers are seeing proper roi and then there 's twtr , the stock ryan terpstra , founder of selerity twitter 's quarterly results famously leaked to the outside world shortly before the close of trading on april results were broadcast via the twitter account of data mining company selerity , sending the stock down almost the stock had been trading at before the leak it was at three days later and still has n't recovered around billion of market cap vanished what was a billion market cap company is now a billion company for twitter stock to come back , the company barring a sudden merger , massive layoffs , or change of management would have to do two things at the next earnings announcement , the company would have to show evidence of a turn toward profitability and it would have to show evidence of a pickup in user numbers a failure on either one of those items will result in the stock going down a profit alone wo n't save the stock a growing user base speaks to future earnings prospects that 's what wall st cares about that 's how the stock is valued i expect to see two things happen , in the coming weeks first , more ads in more timelines costolo and his cfo , anthony noto who has taken over marketing , are probably going off the rate card right now with big advertisers , cutting special deals right and left they know they have to bring more money to the bottom line that 's a no brainer the second thing i expect to see is some kind of purge of the user base maybe beginning with the much anticipated porn purge to remove bots , fakes , inactives , and undesirables this will stir up a lot of dust and allow costolo to do a reset on user numbers sure our numbers are down this quarter ! he 'll be able to boast of course they are we purged the list ! it will be impossible to know , meanwhile , what the true dropoff in users was , for the quarter attention will focus on earnings per share or so costolo will be hoping update dick costolo announced on june , that he would step down effective july i do n't think these things will be enough i 've talked to operators of several mid size twitter accounts k followers and they agree with me that engagement numbers seem to be going soft one of them said six months ago , i had , followers and could count on , impressions per tweet now i have over , followers and i'm lucky if a tweet gets past , impressions another person asked me if i thought twitter was throttling traffic , the way facebook now does i doubt it , i said those of us who 've been with twitter a long time since , for me know that twitter is its own peculiar beast it should n't be compared to facebook or other social sites and that 's true , but it 's also true that in any product space , there 's rarely room for more than two players at the very top coke and pepsi , for example , and if it comes down to facebook being coke , the only pepsi that makes sense is linkedin , which unlike twitter is all business , with great demographics and a great story for advertisers if advertisers decide to write only two checks a month in the social space , one will be to facebook the other wo n't be to twitter and to that extent , we may be living in the twitter end times have you checked out
