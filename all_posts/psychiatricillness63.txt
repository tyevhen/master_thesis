i am staying at home today , i have had a really good nights sleep and i even took an afternoon nap yesterday maybe my body just needs time to adjust after taking quetiapine for several years the quetiapine made me sleep to hours per night , sometimes longer so it makes sense that hours will not be enough during the transition i took an extra mg of quetiapine yesterday as i could not settle and sit still i am staying at home today , maybe do a little work from home once i start to get bored i think i could go back to sleep right now o !
