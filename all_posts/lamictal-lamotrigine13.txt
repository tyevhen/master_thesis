tonight is my final mcbt class our homework for this week was to come up with an action plan in the event that , in spite of our best meditative efforts , our depression recurs we were told to make a list of our usual depression symptoms because they 're usually the same in each person , write down three things we like about ourselves that we might forget when we become depressed , and create an action plan if we become more depressed , what will we do to care for ourselves ? as i 've written before , the symptoms i 'd long ago learned to identify have changed here are the symptoms i used to have when my depression was getting worse feeling the edge of the pit feeling of falling feelings of excessive sadness excessive tearfulness irrational guilt catastrophizing thoughts taking things too personally anhedonia lassitude lack of motivation insomnia overeating oversleeping and here is what was going on with me last fall and winter troughs or crashes in mood between the times of and pm become more frequent troughs or crashes in mood between the times of and pm become worse tearfulness , paranoia about relationships , pessimism running to despair troughs or crashes in mood lengthen beyond the to pm range tearfulness , sadness , or anxiety due to trivial or nonexistent things such as cheezy songs , movies , tv excessively bizarre thoughts or anxieties such as worrying about the balance or destruction of photons in the universe feeling the need to act on excessively bizarre thoughts , or take action on the basis of bizarre anxieties needing to turn all the lights in the house on to keep it balanced increased irritability sudden , frenzied activity , especially late at night such as suddenly feeling the need to clean the house at pm dramatic upsurge in energy after or pm hmmm not only are those nothing like my previous symptoms , but they do n't look much like depression at all , do they ? good thing i'm seeing my pdoc in two weeks i will bring this to him and show him it for kicks , here 's the rest of my action plan three things i like about myself that i tend to forget when i get depressed my sense of humor my curiosity my creativity my action plan for mood symptoms consists of the following steps breathing space use breathing space to check in would meditation be helpful or harmful at this time ? what is the best self care i can give myself right now ? what steps do i need to take next ? make a choice of what practices are most helpful to me and start using them be nice to know what these are take specific actions , including the following steps inform spouse inform pdoc if spouse is traveling , this is step determine what would be the best action toward self care and do it immediately as you can see , my action plan is not much of an action plan that last one is pretty non specific , and might not be enough to go on in a crisis do you have an action plan ? do you have comments about mine ? please let me know in the comments !
