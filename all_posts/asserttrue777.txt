i just wrote a blog on this subject for cms watch , available here the basic premise just to boil it down is that monitoring , auditing , enforcing , administering , and just plain dealing with seat based licensing of enterprise software is a huge , huge problem , in a world that does n't need more problems more to the point , it 's out of step with reality it 's certainly not how large it organizations want to do business these days everyone i know hates seat based pricing it 's antiquated in my cms watch post , i did n't specify what i would propose as an alternative to per seat pricing that 's because my proposed alternative might strike some people as a bit radical imho , the way to price enterprise software going forward is to charge a monthly subscription fee for support that 's right give away the software for free charge only for support and maybe charge something here and there for high value specialty add ons your connector du jour , but mainly for support to account for scalability , maybe set fees on a per server or per installed instance basis but certainly not on a per cpu or per core basis install an instance of xyz cms on one box , pay one monthly fee that 's how it should be the era of million dollar lump sum front weighted capex accounting enterprise software deals is over it 's gone , just like the newspaper business dead , finished , done i have blogged on this before oh sure , there are still million dollar deals being cut as we speak it 's like the tail of a dead brontosaurus still flailing around , days after the brain has died can big software vendors survive by giving software away for free and charging only for support and services ? actually , yes , i think so it will be a painful transition for many big name software giants but in the end , i think it will work a number of commercial open source vendors have proven , in fact , that it will work but also , the cable company has proven that it will work as i told a colleague at cms watch , the cable company very wisely does not charge you , for a cable box instead , they give you the cable box and even install it for free , on site then they charge you a nominal monthly fee if a month , plus or minus , can be called nominal for content after years , you 've paid the cable company , but you 've paid them in a manner that 's acceptable to you and in the meantime , you 're free to switch to something else , or cancel big software vendors who get this will survive those that do n't , wo n't this is a time of structural change for many businesses such as , for example , the newspaper business , and the world of enterprise software is not immune serious changes are ahead the survivors will stay out in front of these changes , starting yesterday the non survivors well , they 're still flailing their tails
