dear ms curtiss dear mrs curtiss the depression hits me yesterday and i am still working on it till today i do not know why it takes longer time to disappear r dear r it will pass get interested in your chores , your family , do something nice for your wife you 'll get over it when you concentrate on others or on your work we forget that depression comes from our brain turning in the direction of downer thinking we are n't always aware of this when we realize we 're depressed we believe that we are thinking negative thoughts because we feel negative it 's always the other way around you have to insist on pushing your thinking to more positive imagery the minute you realize that you are down anything helps any thinking other than the thought you do n't feel so good do n't think about your feelings , think about anything else down does not feel good you do n't want to push yourself to think better thoughts just do it anyway , in small ways think a little nursery rhyme , a dumb song then get to work at something , anything go outside and take a walk watch a movie you need to distract your brain and get it off it 's negative thinking track it is not easy to do the brain is stubborn and gets dug in to its thinking you have to dig in and start pushing your brain around so it quits pushing you around just keep it up and your brain will soon let go of its negative direction depression is just a feeling it will ultimately end get it to end sooner by jumping in the way of negative thoughts hold up another thought and say to the negative thought you shall not pass a b curtiss
