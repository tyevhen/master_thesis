i 've seen many clients in my psychotherapy office in nyc , both individuals and couples , where personal insecurities were having a negative effect on their relationship often , this takes the form of one or both people needing constant reassurance that they are loved by their partner when needing constant reassurance in your relationship becomes a negative habit needing constant reassurance about your relationship can become a negative habit this dynamic can ruin a relationship fast it can be exhausting , especially when the person doing the reassuring realizes that no amount of reassurance will alleviate his or her partner 's insecurities are your insecurities ruining your relationship ? the following fictionalized vignette is an example of where one person 's insecurities in a relationship can have a negative impact jane and bob after jane and bob were dating for three months , they realized that they had fallen in love and decided to become exclusive with each other as soon as jane realized that she was in love with bob , she started feeling insecure did he really love her or was he just telling her this ? would he meet another woman at work , where there were so many attractive women , and leave her ? when they were together , jane was vigilant as to whether bob was looking at other women if she thought she saw him looking at another woman , she would panic and ask him for assurances that he loved her at first , bob was flattered and reassured jane but when it kept happening nearly every time that they went out , he began to feel irritated and he told her she had nothing to worry about , and it was annoying for him to feel pressured to constantly reassure her this only made jane feel worse jane 's insecurities got worse over time if bob did n't call her back immediately , she wondered if he was with someone else when she mentioned this to bob , he got angry he asked her if he had given her any reason to think this when jane calmed down , she knew , in reality , that bob would n't cheat on her but once doubt crept into her mind , she had a hard time containing her worries and keeping it to herself she felt compelled to ask him about it after a while , bob got frustrated and told jane that she should go to therapy to deal with this jane knew that bob was right she was having a problem and if she did n't overcome these insecurities , their relationship would n't last so , she sought the help of a licensed mental health professional during her therapy , jane realized that a lot of her insecurities stemmed from feelings of abandonment from childhood jane 's mother was in and out of her life from the time jane was born so , jane needed to work through this early loss and her fears of abandonment so she would n't displace her fears on bob jane also developed better coping skills in therapy as she was working on her earlier trauma , she learned how to contain her fears and insecurities so she no longer blurted them out to bob soon , they were getting along much better and talking about moving in together getting help assuming that your romantic partner does n't give you any objective reasons to feel insecure about your relationship , your insecurities might be linked to unresolved childhood issues it 's hard to see this on your own because your fears and insecurities often feel so real in the current situation , even though they 're really part of an earlier trauma you could benefit from getting help from a licensed mental health professional who can assist you to work through your fears and insecurities i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individuals and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com photo credit href http www flickr com photos tzofia brittneybush via href http photopin com photopin href http creativecommons org licenses by nc nd cc
