from the when it rains it pours department my first words this morning were , uh oh as soon as i threw off my bed covers i felt it cold ! i quickly checked the thermostat and my worst fear was realized no heat after throwing on multiple layers of clothing , clamoring to the basement , and fiddling with a piece of machinery of which i know nothing , i made the dreaded call now here i sit , typing with gloved fingers , waiting for the furnace experts to arrive i can only imagine how much this will cost me ! with every ounce of my being i want to scream , why ? ! ! why me ? why now ? did n't you notice that previous post , the one about financial stress ? why ? but screaming those thoughts would be futile so here i sit , with gloved fingers , waiting for the experts to arrive this bothers me on so many levels i hate being cold , and i 've been cold a lot this winter i 've been turning my heat up lately i hate being incapable , and i am incapable of fixing this i hate having to rely on others , especially others who can take advantage of the situation and charge you an arm and a leg just to show up ! i hate having to wait the expert may show up in five minutes or five hours and most of all , i hate being stressed about money ! like i said , this situation is a multi faceted pain in the ass ! life ai n't it grand ? and did i mention i'm running miles today ? outside ? in the cold ? ugh ! ! ! this is not how i wanted to start my day ! ahhh life
