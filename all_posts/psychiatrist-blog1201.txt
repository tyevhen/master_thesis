oliver and his parents present for family therapy only the family has split and oliver prefers the company of his over solicitous mom there 's not much to say about the session looks like a family session to me paul does nothing too unusual , and family therapy is hard there are many agendas and many subtexts , often an overwhelming amount of material to deal with so far , what we know is that the personalities are all strong and the issues are complex mom makes the point that dad is irresponsible he plays wii with his friends and parties all night and he does n't stock the fridge for his son dad makes the point that he makes the bucks and mom is a perennial student we 've already been set up for the idea that the face one puts on may betray the reality of the behavior mom hovers , she moves too closely to the boy and does n't even suggest he carry his own backpack , and oliver sucks it up and plays the two of them off each other it will be interesting to see what comes of the family walter is a big shot ceo in a cashmere coat , or so he tells us he ca n't sleep and he wants his problems solved quickly , even if he has to pay more for more intensive sessions in fact , he seems to magically want paul to know what the cure is without being very forthcoming about what the problem is walter seems to want to spar with his new therapist , and he 's quick to be condescending at some point , he becomes downright angry when paul does n't agree that walter should rush to rwanda and 'rescue' his daughter who is working in a clinic walter begins to leave in a huff he came for relaxation exercises and an insomnia cure , not to talk when he falls to the floor clutching his chest paul tells him to breathe finally ! and gives him some water no one calls , and walter tells him , in a gasping , pathetic sort of way , that these episodes always resolve walter 's persona is too overtly grandiose i ca n't help but wonder if his blowhard narcissism is n't a defense for an underlying insecurity there , i'm finally sounding like a real shrink ! what is n't he telling us and what secrets are still to be had so walter insomnia , panic attacks , is he really as important as he tells us ? an edge of paranoia ? and , okay , i admit , the 'bipolar' word crossed my mind when he talked about taking a one hour nap and then being good to go for there 's energy and there 's energy too soon to tell paul returns to maryland to see gina she 's being deposed in his lawsuit paul had decided he 's going to lose his license and go bankrupt and , oh , i 've decided i'm sick of sitting in a chair day after day listening to peoples' problems we find out that paul 's office is in his apartment and he sleeps on his couch and never sees his kids he 's a disaster , and he confesses that by the end of his patient 's therapy , he hated alex he 's come to gina for clarity they have a drink and a lot of ground is covered paul and gina so like what is this ? sometimes they call it friendship , sometimes they call it therapy , sometimes supervision they flit in and out of different modes and the conversations are the same , no matter what they call it he does n't want therapy , and then he does want therapy they 're sitting next to each other on a couch , sipping vodka , when they decide to resume therapy
