i am so fortunate to have so many people pulling for me , cheering me on , visiting me , and supporting me in many , many ways i am filled with gratitude tonight for all of you thank you and guess what ? i'm feeling better ! my mood has lightened slightly i have more energy i'm sarcastic again , which is always a good sign , and sometimes the first sign that i'm feeling better in the past two days i 've been told by my treatment team , nurses , friends , and family that i'm looking and acting more like the etta they all know apparently , and of course i have no memory of this , i was almost catatonic all the way up through last week i had no idea ! since the last day of september i was apparently a blank , slumped , slow slate i 've been told i made little to no eye contact , had no opinions about anything , moved very , very slowly , expressed my limited thoughts very slowly , and showed no emotion of any kind on my face now i'm making eye contact , having and expressing opinions and humor , and moving and speaking at a more normal speed i feel lighter it 's weird and frustrating having no concept of what people are telling me about my very recent history i wish i had a picture or a videotape , because i just ca n't imagine it regardless , i am relieved to be feeling somewhat improved i'm certainly not out of the woods , but i think i may have at least found the trail thank you all again for your continued support i 'll keep you posted
