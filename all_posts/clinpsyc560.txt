i 've been informed that the seroquel sponsored editorial also appeared in the july issue of the journal of clinical psychiatry granted , jcp has recently published articles which either did not report data fully or used highly suspect statistical analyses so i suppose i should n't be surprised that the editorial board would allow commercial editorials the recent call out in jcp for more research on atypical antipsychotics for anxiety also fits nicely with the sponsored editorial , does n't it ? hat tip to the anonymous reader for informing me about the july sponsored editorial
