photos from maldives trip september the sun is shining , the sky is bright blue and i'm just as 'blue' as it for the past few days i 've been trying to adapt to a new routine , and despite it only being a few days i'm already exhausted and have been on the edge of breaking i try my best , i eat as best as i can , take some energy supplements and stick my nose into some women 's health and fitness magazines to find more sources to help my energy levels and stomach problems alas , no luck so far perhaps i just have to find the right combination some days i feel so weighed down by depression that it feels like i 'll fall through my bed and continue to fall through the levels of the house like an anvil in a cartoon i really love writing this blog , its my way of dealing with some of my problems and feelings , and hopefully in the process i help others too i 've had some feedback from people from school , sixth form and university , all of which has been incredibly supportive i 've also had feedback from people i 've never even met who now feel like they know me , which is incredible obviously you all only get a snapshot look into my life which could present a skewed image things are n't always rosey , but they 're also not always incredibly tough depression is n't always constant , it has its ups and downs and just loves ! tripping you up when you least expect it unfortunately i 've stumbled recently and despite my efforts to hide it , the worries have been breaking through the facade i'm certainly not faking good moods because i'm afraid of what people will think , if anything i'm more interested in protecting the feelings of those i love hopefully i 'll be back with a slightly more informative and exciting post soon , i have a few lined up but i was lacking the correct mood to post one of those today enjoy the sunshine if it has managed to reach where you are !
