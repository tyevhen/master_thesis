i am strong i am free that 's my new running mantra i came up with it weeks ago during my first mile training run that 's right , i said first i used i am strong , i am free again during my second and final mile training run a few days ago and tonight , during a very strong , very free tempo run , i used it again , and i ran fast ! i am strong that 's self explanatory i am free that 's the more important , meaningful half of my mantra during that first miler i was so thrilled to be running and feeling good , i felt free free from worry , free from despair , free from fatigue , and free from depression ! it was a magical run , a run i could n't have predicted or completed just a few short weeks earlier i had another great miler this past sunday i was n't sure what to expect , as i did n't run the entire week prior i was resting my sore achilles , which had flared up again during the week i got my miles in on my elliptigo and bike running the second miler was really important to me , though i felt like i needed to do it in order to build confidence for my upcoming marathons again , i was thrilled with the result a good , solid , not too difficult mile training run freedom , once again my confidence continues to build tonight i ran miles at pace that 's a good seconds per mile faster than i ran the same workout weeks ago ! and it 's likely faster than i 've run that distance in years ! i used my mantra i felt strong , and i definitely felt free my mood continues to be good , but the confidence i gain from running these key workouts without too much difficulty is priceless running well reinforces that i'm doing well i'm so grateful to be feeling free free to work , free to socialize , free to run , and free to take care of my responsibilities i begin my final week of tms treatments on monday i 'd be lying if i said i was n't a little nervous about what may happen when the treatments stop , but i'm doing my best to stay in today i 've strung together a nice , long string of good days free of depression at times i still ca n't believe it it was a long way back i'm trusting the good runs and the good days will continue i am strong and i am free
