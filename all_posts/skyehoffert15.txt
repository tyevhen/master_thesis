this is going to be one of those nonsensical posts , that i write and post without editing or any cognitive thought it will probably get more views than the ones i outline and spend two days on , as per usual growing up , scary words for anyone even though it 's something we are all doing , whether we want to or not we do n't get a choice and with it comes change growing is change , and i wish someone would have told me that , i wish someone would have told me that it would happen that it was okay , it 's okay to change it 's okay to drift away from people and things you used to love instead people tend to say the wrong thing , they say you 've changed they say it in a way that makes you feel like you 've done something wrong like you should fix it i have tried , believe me i tried to get back the person , everyone said they missed she 's gone , that person does n't exist i'm here though and i wish people would accept me as i am , maybe i am a little rough around the edges , maybe i am a little cynical a little broken this me , has been through things , has seen things , i ca n't go back to the carefree person i used to be i think i came out on top , my faith is stronger than it ever was , and i am more resilient to people 's unasked for opinions instead of seeing my accomplishments , people always seem to see my mistakes and downfalls they seem to rate me on them my mom remarked to me that i used to be very black and white , i saw evil as evil and good as good i would like to state that i do n't think me changing on this was a bad thing i think that god is the judge , and that yes most things are black and white , but people people are grey , because we are born into sin , we are naturally inclined to sin we do bad things only because of god 's grace can we be free of our sinful nature , so yes my view on how the world works has changed she thinks the books and media , i enjoy are too dark she 's probably right , but i relate to broken people , i prefer reality to some cleaned version of the world the girl i used to be would be horrified at that , never thinking that one day i would curse , cry , and scream at god that i would question the things that had once seemed so simple i think the thing to remember is that i never doubted he was real because once you grow up you find yourself tossed into this uncensored version of the world suddenly it 's a lot colder , darker , and nastier then you thought people are all clawing their way to the top , people really do fake it , they fake everything finding a genuine person is like winning the lottery , because no one wants to admit that they do n't have a clue once you get over this , the loneliness sets in you start to feel very alone in the world , or maybe this is just me i am floundering through life and adulthood like a disabled squirrel broke and unsure , i make bad decisions financially , futuristic wise , and fundamentally ? i have become more indecisive , if that is possible i have moments where i want to delete all of my social media accounts which is silly because , i tend to keep most of my issues to myself and i only post when things are going really good i ca n't seem to focus , or dedicate myself to anything i want to be one of those people , who everything they touch turns to gold i want to succeed but i am the person holding me back i guess this is just me telling you guys that i'm struggling , but it 's okay if anything i am starting to think it 's normal their growing pains i'm not going to let my problems stop me , so do n't let them stop you sorry if this post was illogical
