it 's waaaaaay overdue , but figured i 'd post some pictures from paige 's birthday party we had it on a saturday the week before she turned and invited her little buddies from her playgroups about or other toddlers were in attendance her close family also came to celebrate we had lots of brunch food and chose to do it between am noon that way , the kiddos could go home for their naps and not be overwhelmed from a long party it proved to be just right and they all seemed to have fun running around playing it was pouring rain outside , so we just put out some toy stations and let the kids go to it i put out some dollar store wooden masks and washable markers for the kids to decorate with , but they were mostly interested in just playing glad we kept things simple ! paige seemed to have great fun and had a lovely long nap afterward i still ca n't believe she is two sigh this is paige 's outfit and hair she went barefoot this is as fancy as she gets this is rocky my parents gifted this beautiful cherry wooden duck rocker to paige my dad 's friend from work designed and made it ! he used wood from a tree that had fallen on another friend 's land i love that it is huge paige 's feet barely touch and she 's very tall i love that she can grow into it as she loves it already and rocks at different times through the day most rockers are too small for her you ca n't see , but it has a gorgeous natural wooden seat that just gleams we imagine that rocky will be well loved and we hope one day our own grandchildren will enjoy him tear here paige is getting sung happy birthday she was enjoying a cracker at the time obligatory family shot she 's wondering who these clowns are who keep bothering her while she has her delicious cupcake cupcake goodness nom nom nom after her nap , paige opened her gifts this wooden train was gifted to her by chris' parents another great heirloom toy keepsake paige loves it the box car in the back has a sliding door and she can put things inside the circus car has a gate at the back that lifts up and again , she can put her little animals inside it the engine for the front has a little peg that is removable that is the train conductor she loves pushing it all over the house and it rolls very easily check it out here you can choose from a plethora of different train cars and even add to it for different holidays and birthdays it 's hand made by a friendly artisan i find that super cool here we are opening a present she was saying woooooooow ! i have to laugh at the post nap wild hair from having taken out the two pigtails hee hee and here are some little details i got little drawstring bags and bought iron on inkjet transfer paper i designed alphabet letters for each party guest 's first name , ironed them on and presto ! customized favor bags inspired by this although mine are n't as cool our theme was animals on parade chris had given me these cupcake toppers for christmas and i based the party around them they were made by meri meri , and i found a whole line of party decor based on them we even used their invitations i could have made everything myself but i'm just not that ambitious these days we stuck a banner on the mantel and we stuck a banner in the middle of the kitchen over the island i could n't forget to use the banner from her first birthday it will make an appearance each year we also included tons and tons of balloons everywhere pink , yellow , and a teal blue to add to the festive feel hope you enjoyed our mini show from her party ! i left out all the photos of the guests to protect privacy but if you 've been to one family kid party you 've been to them all a big thank you to everyone who came to celebrate with little p ! we had fun with you ! save
