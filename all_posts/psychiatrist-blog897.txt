over time , i 've noticed some trends among our blog commenters some readers comment on the content of our posts , others link us to viagra spam , and finally , some readers talk directly to us we hear about their own experiences of the topic we 've blogged about , or simply about their day this is good , though i could do with a little less viagra or airjordan spam in my life sometimes readers inject enough of themselves into their comments that it becomes clear they have opinions about us , the shrink rappers , feet , ducks and all sometimes it seems like readers are poised to like us , and other times it feels like readers are lying in wait , looking to attack i was particularly struck by the comments people made on my post about the texting shrink rachel says i have a kind heart and another commenter ? i think it was retriever noted that i do this to increase my availability to patients dr steve put it bluntly i am idiot ! i hope i do have a kind heart , but i text with patients because i 've found this to be to my convenience it 's a quicker way to deal handle brief messages , and none of it 's about being more available my life is better if i get a stuck in traffic text and know i have time to run to the restroom or eat a snack and if a patient needs me to phone a pharmacy or return a call , it 's so much quicker to click on the texted number than it is to re listen to my messages and try to decipher that phone number times by replaying voicemail and oh , i do n't have a pen and can i memorize it quickly enough ? am i an idiot ? i believe i 've thought it through , but i may be the texting shrink was only one example in our years of blogging , many posts have inspired strong reactions , and i 've come to be very careful about my choice of words , especially when discussing medications sometimes it feels like no matter how gently i word things , someone is poised to simply say , psychiatry is bad , no one should see a shrink , no one should take psychotropic medications , all shrinks care about is money some people think their psychiatrists do n't care about them and for all i know , they may be right others believe their doctors think and care about them a lot , in a way that may not be realistic obviously , doctors think and care about their patients oh , i hope , but docs are people with their own lives and problems i'm hoping for a happy medium somewhere like dr steve says , i may be an idiot
