thanks , a b i do n't know why i dialed it 's not something i 've ever done , i tried to retract it asap i feel stupid i guess you 're right , it was an act of manipulation anyway , the last thing in the world i imagined was the police arriving as i said , i hung up the phone before they answered it 's embarrasing too , because i'm sure the neighbors saw the police come husband go i agree w your analysis , but do n't know how my husband views it i am willing to wager he is pretty livid about it , but he may see it as an act i took on my own behalf when i filed for divorce , i did n't do it to manipulate , it was for real , but it seemed to send him a message that i would n't put up with his antics forever alternatively , he may see it as so humiliating that he ca n't or wo n't get past it also , this was the very first time i ever agreed he should leave usually i would plead for him to stay if he suggested such a thing this time i encouraged it i do understand what you 're saying about taking care of onself , diffusing the power of the anger to control it 's never a good idea to say this is not acceptable ? when someone rages at us for pressing a wrong button or something equally inane , we just slither away act like it did n't happen ? i 've been more or less doing that most of the time , but felt at the end of my rope last night ! i received a note from my sister yesterday she thanked husband i for helping supporting her i felt upset reading it , due to the fact that my husband 's behavior behind the scenes at that time was so appalling he yelled at me on the way to almost every visit i still ca n't believe he could be that heartless i think reading the note lowered my tolerance for his outbursts , since the other incidents related to her were fresh in my mind would you ever tell your spouse that you had been disappointed by them ? guess it would n't matter in my case he 'd just deny it , blame me for his behavior somehow it always ends up being my fault i know your husband threw tantrums , but i do n't think your husband is a narcissist ! i see your husband as a very manly man who eventually matured out of throwing tantums since you wisely made them less fun for him i think he has the capacity to empathize exercise compassion remorse , not just when it 's convenient i hear what you 're saying in the last paragraph though i do n't know if my husband will return home tonight , or if so when , and if so , what state of mind he will have he 'll more than likely not wish to speak to me i wo n't know what to do or say anyway thanks again ! ginger your question when someone rages at us for pressing a wrong button or something equally inane , should we just slither away act like it did n't happen ? i 've been more or less doing that most of the time , but felt at the end of my rope last night ! my answer your question cannot be answered in the same sense that you write it because there is no specific right thing to do in such a situation this is the trouble with trying to understand things at the periphery you need to get to the center and you will see a bunch of interconnections that you do n't see at the edges of things in any situation , whether you act out of fear of something or love of something will decide your specific action whatever that action , if it comes from the center of your core values and not from fear , that action will be somehow appropriate slithering away and acting like something did n't happen is acting out of fear when you are afraid you behavior is reactive , not proactive your question would you ever tell your spouse that you had been disappointed by them ? guess it would n't matter in my case he 'd just deny it , blame me for his behavior somehow it always ends up being my fault my answer i might say such a thing if i said such a thing the outcome would be appropriate to my life if i said it out of love for something the outcome would be inappropriate to my life in some way if i said it out of fear of something and remember , it is not so easy , sometimes , to see the difference between love of something , and fear of something it is a pursuit of excellence , and seeking your core truth , rather than some check list you could refer to wisdom is not easily come by the more i think about it the more it suggests to me that calling was an act of uncontrolled rage on your part that things did not turn out to be the way you wanted such anger comes from a deep sense of helplessness and repressed fear that does n't mean that the outcome of calling will not turn out well in some way , thus making you come out the winner see how difficult it is to live life of self awareness ? but then , as socrates insists the unexamined life is not worth living
