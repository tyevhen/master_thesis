in , ludolf luehmann , an it manager for shell , warned the world petroleum conference in doha that the company had suffered an increased number of cyber attacks luehmann said shell and others in the industry were experiencing a new dimension of attack which could leave physical machinery at serious risk this was no idle speculation in , a council on foreign relations report , citing data from a houston based security company , alert logic , stated that the u s energy sector , including oil and gas producers , was hit by more targeted malware attacks from april to september than any other industry see this reuters story and also this esecurityplanet com story exxon 's torrance , california refinery blew up on february , la times in , symantec described a russian cyber attack , named energetic bear , in which malware got into computers at power plants , energy grid operators , gas pipeline companies , and industrial equipment makers most of the targets were in the united states and spain the rest were across europe story by cnn money here in the best case scenario , the hackers only took sensitive information at worst , they gained the ability to hijack control systems prior to , oil and gas cyber attacks , such as the series of chinese night dragon attacks , were mainly focused on stealing proprietary business data but post , attacks have gotten progressively uglier in , chevron reportedly discovered a version of stuxnet virus in its systems stuxnet targets siemens control systems it was allegedly used by the u s to attack iranian uranium enirchment centrifuges also in , iran blamed israel for a cyber attack on its oil drilling platforms an august , cyber attack on aramco was successful in wiping out what aramco said was the hardware on of the oil giant s devices , according to a wsj report a saudi consultant working with government and telecom internet security experts , speaking anonymously , told wsj the virus had been introduced by a hand carried usb memory stick the council on foreign relations report mentions that oil and gas malware can now , in theory at least , cause the flow of natural gas through a pipeline to grind to a halt , trigger an explosion at a petrochemical facility , or do damage to an offshore drilling rig that could lead to an oil spill story here but maybe it 's not just theory the exxon explosion in february , an explosion ripped through exxon 's refinery in torrance , california , injuring four people and causing damage that will take at least six months to repair the investigation into the exxon explosion has thus far focused on overpressurization of an electrostatic precipitator a pollution control device at the refinery side view of exxon refinery unit showing both sides blown out reuters how overpressurization could happen , though , in a state of the art refinery with millions of dollars of process control monitoring equipment in place , measuring every aspect of plant operation in some refineries , there are even sensor systems capable of monitoring metal corrosion as it 's happening , in real time , has not been explained the idea that something as basic as a pressure excursion could go undetected by sophisticated safety systems strains credulity exxon is not saying if cyber terrorism is a possibility in the torrance incident but how could it not be ? exxon claims on its corporate website that on average , our cybersecurity screening programs block more than million emails , million internet access attempts , and , other potentially malicious actions each month how vulnerable are refinery control systems ? refineries are managed through industrial control networks icns consisting of industrial control system ics devices , such as control components plc , dcs , scada , rtu , hmi , etc network components , fieldbus network , control network , routers , switches , firewall , etc as explained , in broken english , by the sesamo security and safety modelling group , funded by a multinational consortium called artemis in recent years , advances in ict have enabled the construction of systems for monitoring and control of industrial processes to allow remote and centralized administration of facilities distributed in the territory by using wireless and internet connections to achieve this , was broken the isolation that has historically characterized the process networks doing that these were connected to corporate networks , resulting that typical of these problems , virus , trojans , malicious code , denial of services attacks , os vulnerabilities and applications exposure , etc become a problem of industrial systems in a significant increase in risk of cyber attacks , always more sophisticated and targeted , to impaired production processes english translation to achieve remote monitoring , industrial control systems that were previously air gapped physically isolated have been brought onto wireless networks but doing so has , of course , made the systems more vulnerable to attack but it 's worse than that , because in many cases , industrial control systems are required to run continuously for months , without interruption that means not allowing automatic security updates or any updates , generally speaking nuclear reactors , for example , typically run on month cycles , and any downtime can be extremely costly in some countries , fines of , an hour can be imposed by the industry regulator in case of a shutdown according to a story by computerweekly com , it is not uncommon for organizations responsible for critical infrastructure to continue running control systems even though a malware infection has been detected many industrial control systems , of course , run on microprocessor boards with extremely limited computing resources , making it impracticable , in many cases , to run even custom written antivirus software , never mind bloatware from mcafee or norton going naked what makes the situation particularly dire not just for corporations but for their stockholders is that oil companies are uninsured , in case of cyber attack in insurance parlance , this means energy companies are going naked energy companies have no insurance against major cyber attacks , reinsurance broker willis group holdings was quoted as saying in a reuters story most insurance products currently available will cover minor things such as data losses or downtime caused by it issues , but not major events like explosions willis said the lack of coverage stems , specifically , from a clause included in most energy sector insurance agreements over the past years that explicitly excludes loss or damage caused by software , viruses or other malicious computer code covered or not , oil companies are bringing unprecedented quantities of oil to market , and there seems little question that the stakes , in terms of cyber threats , are getting higher by the day moscow based security firm kaspersky was quoted by bbc as saying we certainly are in a different world than where we were months ago what we 're starting to see is an increase in targeted attacks we know critical systems , like those in oil production , are vulnerable to attack copyright by kas thomas contact the author at authorzone hushmail com in other news yesterday a story at the daily beast reported on the fact that china now officially admits what we all knew was true all along , which is that china has a massive cyber warfare capability dwarfing the north koreans and is engaged in digital mayhem worldwide daily meanwhile , various people myself included have noticed that china traffic has slowed to nothing , in recent months , in google analytics , for many u s sites have you checked your analytics lately ?
