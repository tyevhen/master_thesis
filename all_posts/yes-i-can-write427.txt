ages ago , like the beginning of this blog ages ago , i started a collage on my wall and put pictures of it on here when i got home from nbtsc , i added a painting i had made there and that i'm now getting around to showing on here actually , i believe in my not back to school camp post i actually have a picture of the painting in progress it 's abstract , and nothing special really , but somehow it just really appeals to me shrugs i also took pictures of my family today below are emi fresh from a shopping trip today , and wearing her brand new gloves which she loves , and my father they are both made of pure awesomeness peace , idzie
