i was sent a book to read by someone who thought it could help me in my struggles with anxiety its called truth heals by deborah king its all about her journey of recovering from abuse as a child her belief is that by hiding truths we are physically hurting our bodies she developed alcoholism , sexual promiscuity , and eventually was diagnosed with cancer by the age of she got into the practice of healing and the book describes the chakras of the body and how you can hurt yourself with disease by not keeping the energy flowing through these areas i go back and forth about how much i believe in her notion of actual physical harm being done to yourself due to repressing feelings i do think that stress can do damage , and i often wonder about the long term effects that my body will have due to all the stress from my anxiety and i do believe that my anxiety itself is a direct result of repressed feelings when i was younger but do you will diseases like cancer upon yourself ? it 's interesting to think about i do believe that damage is done to your soul by withholding the truth your soul can be broken and lost and by coming forward and facing the facts and working through traumas we can eventually heal our souls i can relate with this author in the fact that i grew up with some things kept secret deep inside and overtime they took their tole on me my soul was heavy in my early 's every once in awhile i would burst out sobbing and become very sad that i had these things in my life it was n't until i faced them head on and brought all the truth to the surface that i started to feel better about all of it my soul found peace whatever you believe , the book offers a lot of great insight and advice and its a good , quick read one of my favorite parts is where she talks about how journaling is a great way to get the truth out she says to get a journal or laptop and write be completely truthful in your journal say it like it is if you 're angry , be angry write it out uncensored be who you are the point is to be authentic when you can trust yourself and be truthful on the pages of your journal , you can trust yourself to be truthful in the world just watch how your whole body relaxes as you express your truth you 've given yourself permission to be you to speak your mind , to give voice to the truth of who you are if not now , when ? journaling is so therapeutic as i have said before , thats what this blog is all about its my journal , my therapeutic outlet and when things were really bad , this was the only thing holding me together and i really like this part trust life , trust god in this moment , do you trust life ? do you trust that you are loved , protected , and supported ? do you trust that everything is working out for your higher good ? if you do n't , ask for more trust speak it show me how to trust more ! then watch for signs that your life and god is listening with anxiety , you are always worrying about the worst happening we are so fearful and fear does not come from god if we can have more trust that our heavenly father will protect us , maybe that would help our anxiety i 've thought this before but never really knew how to have more trust and here she says it so simply , just ask him for it overall , i think its worth taking a look at i still think that the anxiety and phobia workbook by edmund j bourne you can see it on my sidebar is the best life changing book for dealing directy with anxiety and how to work on managing it , but this book is a nice side read with a different perspective on the topic if interested you can find it on my sidebar as well enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
