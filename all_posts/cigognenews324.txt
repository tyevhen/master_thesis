we are all part of nature the end result of evolution not only are we bound by evolution but are the embodiment of it we are evolution therefore , we must pay attention to it when we practice therapy when we ignore evolution we always will make a mistake in treatment the brainstem was in place before the neonewcortex and when we plunge patients into the brainstem in rebirthing , it is far too soon and premature in terms of neurologic evolution we unleash primitive material far too soon in therapy the result is an overload of high valence imprints which suffuse the entire cortex and scatter thoughts , concentration and focus what happens then is the concoction by the patient of weird ideas , bizarre notions and non reality based thoughts as the lower levels feelings drive the cortex to manufacture something that will help suppress those very same feelings so heavy feelings cause the production of indigenous tranquilizers thoughts and ideas to shut down those very same feelings in this case those ideas are the result of repression and is also the agent of repression the dialectic and now we see one key factor in evolution the ability to fabricate ideas in the service of repression and it may well be the one key reason for the evolutionary development of ideas to be able to escape the enemy from within feelings now let s turn it around the therapy that involves ideas and insights as its key mode cognitive therapy gets stuck in the last stage of evolution and neglects feelings and our history both personal , ontogenetic , and historical , phylogenetic so on the one hand we have a therapy that dives into heavy primal material long before we are ready for it , and on the other hand , we remain on one level , in one mode that neglects evolution completely both are dismissive of evolution and , remember , we are evolution and we can perform this neglect when we ignore feelings too deep too soon or too late , too late we must never be asked in therapy to express or say our feelings because that is an oxymoron there are many pre verbal feelings that have no words putting words to them negates those specific feelings it uses one level to get to another words to express feelings when they are separate and independent so when we anchor the patient in the present and make a slow descent into feelings it will all be natural and in evolutionary order we have to return to the past because that is where feelings first evolved repeat the natural order helps us become natural and normal we are no longer estranged from our nature and what that means is that we feel a commonality with animals and plants and flowers we can again see beauty that is one effect of a feeling and evolutionary therapy that is one effect that cannot be achieved in cognitive insight therapy so long as the feeling band is missing we cannot be at one with nature rebirthing does nothing to re establish the feeling band feelings do that all this means is that our history lies inside of us we respond to two worlds at once the outer world and the inner one if there is too much input from our imprinted history we cannot take much from our outer world we cannot stand much stimulation when there are imprints from gestation and birth that are lying in wait , trying to get out , moving relentlessly upwards and forwards , putting pressure on the neo cortex , there is a tendency to be easily overwhelmed here lies add and confusion added to it is addiction , deep , deep addiction in accordance with very deep imprints here lies hysteria and over reaction here lies impulsive tendencies here lies weakened cortical control and leaky gates the gates are in an endless battle to keep too much input away so it cannot be overloaded and , here lies impatience and intolerance here lies a mess
