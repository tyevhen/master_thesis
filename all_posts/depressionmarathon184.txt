it 's the first day of a new month thank god ! october was not kind to me , but i'm done focusing on that now it 's november it 's time to let go of the challenges of the past month and move forward moving forward that 's what i 've been doing lately , one foot at a time , one moment at a time i'm not necessarily enjoying it , or happy , but i'm not paralyzed , or low , or descending into the abyss either sometimes , living in the moment is all i can do whether i like or approve of the moment i'm in does n't matter one bit i just need to live there and keep moving forward , inch by inch , step by step , moment by moment , and day by day because i 've kept motivating forward , i made it to the gym of the last days i feel better every time i leave the gym , even if i have to force myself to get there initially , so i'm grateful for the motivation and energy to continue working on my physical self i'm also working on getting back to regular work i saw patients for hours per day for days last week it was nice to be back among my co workers and patients it was nice to feel productive again working allowed me to get outside myself and to stop worrying about my physical health for awhile every minute spent helping someone else was one less minute spent focusing on my recent challenges i needed that i'm happy to report my mood has remained stable despite the recent health challenges as i stated earlier , i'm not necessarily feeling light and joyful , yet , but putting one foot in front of the other has at least kept me from sliding backward my movements are purposeful and planned taking the next right action is what it 's all about right now it 's not necessarily easy , but it 's not as difficult as i know it will be if i do n't keep focusing forward onward and upward , my friends
