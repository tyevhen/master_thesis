question we have two dogs that we had before we were married , one is my husband 's , the other mine somewhere along the way i decided that i did not much like my husband 's dog i thought he was lazy , only cared about food , not as smart as my dog and chewed up some valuable items , etc , etc i realized one day a few years back how ridiculous it was to not like a dog he 's just a dog after all yet over the years i have not been as sweet to him and wasted energy thinking negatively about him the other night , i made a decision to fake liking my husband s dog i walked up to him and petted him vigorously and talked excitedly funny thing was , it took only a few minutes and i actually felt it more genuinely toward the end , i was not faking nearly as much i really felt closer to that dog then , i thought maybe i can apply this to my happiness practice you have said to fake it even when you do n't feel it that has proven a challenge for me now that i see it can work on some level i am going to keep trying it on myself lying to my brain to achieve a better mood wish me luck am i fooling myself ? do you think it will work ? answer i do wish you luck and of course it will work you are certainly headed in the right direction it 's a true tenet of cognitive behavioral therapy fake it until you make it but the make it doesn t really refer to behavior , it really refers to making the proper neural patterns in your brain so they will later be available for your use so you are not really lying to your brain you are simply insisting on your own on purpose , pro active behavior instead of reactive behavior based on old patterns of thinking which your brain pops up on its own and you are actually changing your brain because you are making new neural patterns about liking instead of disliking we like the things that we invest our interest in we dislike accidentally based on fear we can like what we formerly disliked on purpose based on our own loving energy which is given us by our creator a b curtiss
