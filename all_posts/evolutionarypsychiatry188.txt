perhaps a month ago , zooko tweeted me some papers one of which i had seen before both papers were done on the same group of obese dieters half eating low carb and half eating an isocaloric low fat diet for weeks zooko presented a puzzle and links to the free full text notice anything about the data ? paper number i'm adjusting the name for simplicity 's sake low carb vs low fat cardiometabolic and weight loss effects paper number low carb vs low fat mood and cognitive function so , have you taken a look and found the interesting thing about ketones ? yeah , zooko had to point it out more explicitly to me as well though to be fair i was distracted by some issues i have with the second paper 's conclusions all right , here 's the important bit the first graph is from the first paper , showing levels of ketones in the low carb and isocaloric low fat dieters over the months the low carb dieters were advised to increase carbs a bit after weeks , which is no doubt part of why their ketones drop at that point note also that both the low fat and low carb dieters have higher plasma levels of ketones in the first weeks than thereafter now here 's a graph from the second paper , showing beck depression inventory scores at the same time points a higher score corresponds to a more depressed individual though none of these scores are high enough to indicate even a mild depression those first eight weeks , with more ketones for both sets of dieters and since they were losing weight , ketones in the low fat group especially would have been from burning stored fat , corresponded to a point drop on the bdi for both sets of dieters i have no idea if the correlation between the two sets of data in that first weeks or later is statistically significant , so do n't run to the bank or anything it 's just rather interesting most obese dieters will be pretty happy to be losing weight , especially at first now the distracting thing i find objectionable about the second paper is that , even though both groups had identical depression scores at baseline , of the low carb group were on antidepressants compared to of the low fat group at the beginning of the study the authors discounted that bit of data somewhat , saying it was non significant they go on to suggest that on explanation of the low carber 's tendency to move back toward baseline levels of depression as opposed to the low fat dieters is that low carbers are more isolated in society as the eating patterns are far from the norm the low carbers were instructed to consume no more than of their calories from saturated fat that means they had to be downing a bit of olive oil or lots of pufas , so you do wonder about a massive omega load over time the low fat dieters , on the other hand , were consuming the palmitic acid from all the stored carbs of yore and presumably not adding as much dietary omega to the party as they were instructed to eat low fat cognition wise , though the authors had found some problems with cognition measures in the low carb group in the first weeks compared to the low fat group , there was no difference between the groups after weeks , suggesting the adaptation period may have led to some temporary cognitive problems in the low carb group that then resolved low carb flu ? personally , after hours of fasting which i am quite adapted to at this point , i find my thinking is sharper , i'm less distractible , and more motivated for the next several hours i 've never fasted longer than hours anecdotally , others have shared the same experience what i'm trying to sort out here is what the ketones are doing in order to achieve seizure control by changing oxaloacetate concentrations with a ketogenic diet , you need to be in pretty deep ketosis and it would take more than a hour fast to get there glucose is preferentially sucked up in the brain as it is the last place in the body to become insulin resistant in starvation or high fat conditions while some folks seem to love deep ketosis and thrive there , i have always wondered if the more evolutionary model of intermittent fasting though there may have been high fat seasons also would have a beneficial effect via ketones , despite the fact that most ifing does not leave us in ketosis deep enough or long enough to change the amino acid handling in the brain in a way that lowers seizure threshold in cells of the brain with mitochondria , i'm still assuming one would get boosts in energy efficiency from partial utilization of ketones , as i 've discussed before there 's a lot to sort out and a gazillion variables , but i thought the graphs were cool enough to put them out there for your perusal thanks zooko ! here 's the weight loss , in case you were interested while we are discussing ketones , zooko also tweeted news that a young man who started a ketogenic diet after being diagnosed with brain cancer is now in remission happy news indeed ! zooko noted in a later tweet that we ca n't know the ketogenic diet helped bring on remission , but it is certainly plausible that it may have helped
