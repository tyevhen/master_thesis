on sep , we started an experiment including a single google ad block usually ads on each page , primarily for the purpose of generating money to upgrade our podcasting equipment which currently consists of three tin cans connected by string to my macbook 's usb port what we 'd like to get is a mixing board and quality condenser mics anyway , as of sept we 've made wooo ! we 've heard from one reader that an ad was served that went to an off shore , drugs w o a prescription site google allows us to block ads from certain website , so if you find an an objectionable ad , please copy the url right click on the ad 's link and let us know the url in a comment on this post note , the url will look ugly , like http pagead googlesyndication com pagead iclk ? sa l ai binocroprtarlzcattcocwqiifpmicwiaccadbabgaegiqppbigcoabqqlxpyajgycsiyikhbcyarwcljaglhdhjpcqtymxvzyibgncbvdcjbaqoxmjbmjqwxfzyaebgemahrcdovlbzewnoawfcmlzdcibgnlmjsbdzcglmnvbs oawgwakvoabiawfoaafaoa gdhgxawgaaadawaaiaa num adurl http www the road back org weight loss htm client ca pub clkt nm , but that 's okay just paste it in and we 'll block it thanks !
