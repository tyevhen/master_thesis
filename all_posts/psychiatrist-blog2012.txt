posted by maybe it started last fall when i went to louisiana as part of the katrina assistance project i came back a little edgy , feeling very little and powerless , aware that the world can be changed in a day by forces beyond us i did what i do when i get edgy i wrote about my experience i 'd love to have you read about it then i finished , and it was time to move on maybe i stayed edgy , maybe i'm remembering it all wrong , or maybe it had nothing to do with my trip to louisiana , after all , my life was intact and i 'd always known that all it takes is one small hurricane , one burst vessel , one evil terrorist , one moment of hesitation when pushing for the brake pedal it was n't my house , was n't my family , though having seen it up close , it felt a little more personal than the rest of the world 's tragedies , and somehow that 's where this story starts in my mind it was a hard winter , i'm not sure why , but it seemed like work was hard , patients were struggling , and i was distracted at first i could n't write then i could n't stop after several months hiatus , i resumed writing the novel i 'd begun the summer before by spring , i was about to finish now the fourth unpublished novel that sits on my hard drive and i worried i would lose my mind when i finished i decided i wanted a blog i 'd never read a blog , was n't really sure what one was , but whatever it was , i wanted it i looked at michelle malkin 's blog i still did n't know what a blog was i still wanted one i asked clinkshrink and roy to help me , then i invited them to co own the blog with me it took me over i love the blog , love having a forum to write , not having to worry about the seemingly endless rejections , the frustations of agents , publishers , editors who cares if my audience is small ? who cares if i do n't get paid ? who cares if i ca n't put the posts on my c v actually , i do n't care about any of it i love to write for its own sake , but i do want an audience i started reading other medical blogs i 've written already about my preoccupation with fat doctor i like her , i worry about her , and i'm glad she 's changing it all reminds me of the days before the blog , when roy emailed me asking if i wanted to join some on line networking thing why would i want to talk to people i do n't know ? i wrote back so , why do i want to talk to people i do n't know ? must be this transference thing good or bad i finished the novel this is the one , i was sure of it , i'm still sure of it if not , then the next one my husband loved it my cousin loved it i showed it to an agent , a man who has been talking to me for ? eight years , and still wo n't represent me he did n't love it it needed work i showed it to my friend , peter owens writer , professor , guest blogger here and he gave some suggestions i'm paralyzed maybe only a little i get bursts of motivation , i 've made some changes in the book , but i do n't know what i'm going to do with it next i may take a writing course i 'll proably take a writing course i filled out the application , sent in the fee , requested my college transcript told i 'd need to submit writing samples , i responded how many hundreds of pages would you like ? i wonder if anyone in the blogosphere would like to pay my tuition while i would n't think twice about educating my children , it 's a mind boggling sum of money to spend on a grad school course for me the energy that used to go into my fiction , it 's now funneled into the blog or should i say blogs i 've taken to commenting on other people 's blogs and then , of course , i have to return to check the responses sometimes i still wish i 'd picked a handle , wish i could hide just a little i tell myself it 's a summer thing , like my learning to be a gourmet cook project if anyone in the blogosphere would also consider subsidizing my grocery bills the school year will start , my life will be a whirlwind of patients returning from vacations , varsity football , field hockey , parent whatevers , and even grad school for now , it 's august , i'm addicted to the blog , and my husband sits sucked into his yearly down hill spiral with the red sox as they sink from first place the blog , i promise myself , will soon be just a blog all this whirling around in my brain , smooshed in there with today 's menu of dinah made shrimp salad over a bed of greens requiring an unbelievable number of ingredients , and i began my round of book marked blogs at first i thought i 'd clicked on shrink rap there was that damn logo that clinkshrink is so enamored by i liked it better when she had a duck thing then i realized i was on dr a 's blog now he was tormenting me , too very weird fat doctor , too , has a giant dinah logo ! if i was prone to paranoia , this would have put me over the edge maybe it should just some affectionate teasing from my friends in blog o land ? it makes clinkshrink so happy when she gets to gloat
