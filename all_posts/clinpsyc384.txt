i'm not sure if this means i can say my site is award winning , but i can say with pride ? that one psychiatrist i mentioned on this site recently has been awarded the prestigious krusty the klown award the award went to dr siegfried kasper in the words of furious seasons' philip dawdy , who presented and invented the award cpp had a post last week about siegfried kasper who likes to affix his name to studies he 's never written once upon a time , this same clown also stuck his name on a paper david healy refused to slap his name on for a phamra sic company and while i know it 's fun to bitch about docs doing shady unscientific things and then call the result double blind , peer reviewed gold standard science , i think i need to get into the proper spirit of how medicine really works and give out awards for such behavior it is in that spirit that i bestow furious seasons' first krusty the klown award upon dr siegfried kasper and you remember krusty , right ? i heartily endorse this event or product was his mantra i'm sure kasper knows it by heart i only know for sure that kasper put his name on one paper he did not write , but given that he has purportedly authored over research reports and reviews , i think it is certainly possible that some of his other work is ghostly for a little background , see an earlier post here for more on krusty endorsed products , see here more on the krustification of psychiatric research coming soon , hopefully
