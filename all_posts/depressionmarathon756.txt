i raced a half marathon today in mankato , mn it was their inaugural marathon , half marathon , and k , and boy they did a great job ! it was an excellent race course , with excellent organization , plenty of port o potties , and great goodies at the finish even the weather cooperated it was overcast and in the 's i think nice job , mankato ! i 'll definitely be back i was up before am in order to get to the starting line on time i felt good even though i did n't taper for this race , my legs felt ready not having a clue what to expect from myself , i decided to jump in with the per mile pace group i figured that was a pace i should be able to handle based on my speed work , tempo runs and quick long training runs but again , i really did n't have a clue we got off right on time , and i fell in with my pace group i even ran slightly in front of the group for awhile , as i felt really good the course was very nice mostly on a long , wide , paved trail around mile we descended a very long , steep hill i remarked that the marathoners would hate this hill , as they would hit it at mile , and it was a quad buster at mile five ! shortly thereafter , we descended another steep hill okay , my legs felt that , but the pace felt fine there were about of us men and me still hanging with our pacer when we passed mile seven somewhere between mile and mile we began a long ascent i'm not sure what happened , but i got dropped , big time ! just a few minutes beforehand , i had been conversing with my fellow runners , but when that hill started my legs just would n't go i believe i blew up i regained my stride , briefly , within the th mile , but i felt like crap ! my legs felt like wooden stilts i think those downhills really tore me up by mile , i really went boom ! i walked through some water stops and up some small hills before again regaining my stride in the last mile i was an unhappy camper from about mile onward that made for a very long race i was so very glad to cross that finish line and be done i finished in , which was per mile i was disappointed , not with my time as much as with the incredible , painful effort here are my splits , , , , , , , , hill , , boom ! , , when i reviewed my splits , i was actually surprised to see that i pulled off a few sub 's after blowing up i felt as if i was running so much slower like i said , my wooden legs just would n't go considering how poorly i felt , i guess i should be pretty happy with my time i'm trying i'm trying to be kind to myself there are a lot of reasons my legs would n't go up that hill i did n't taper i ran miles just last weekend and did my usual speed work during the week what did i expect ? well , you know me , i always expect more but really , this was an exercise in perseverance , and i proved to myself once again that i can persevere i'm glad i did perseverance deserves a reward , and i'm rewarding myself with a big , juicy steak tonight i think my muscles need some red meat to rebuild ! then it will be back to speed work on tuesday and miles either thursday or saturday i may even run a k next saturday , but we 'll see how i recover first i got my tickets , so look out dallas i 'll battle with you in december
