i do believe this marks the longest time i 've gone without blogging since i started this blog almost three years ago part of me feels like i should apologize , but a much bigger part of me is down with the whole blogging without obligation idea , and even more importantly , realizes that i 've been mentally emotionally not really able to blog i just have n't been in the right head space i 've been dealing with some pretty high levels of anxiety and stress , and have felt a strong need to retreat from more public areas of expression and instead focus on spending time with friends , meeting new people in real life , and otherwise trying to maintain and build my community i'm not sure what most of the things i want and need to change in my life are , though i'm well aware that some changes need to be made , but i do know that having a strong community and network of friends is one of them so now that you know a bit about how i 've been feeling , i figured i 'd update you on what i 've been doing since last i posted anything here near the beginning of this month , my sister and i went to a small nbtsc gathering in new york state a friend swung a few hours out of her way to pick me and my sister up , and we had a nice little roadtrip through the mountains to a small and really lovely town there we stayed , with a handful of other people , at the house of the friends who were hosting us and what a lovely house it is ! which for me , someone who absolutely adores old buildings , was quite a big plus i did n't take many pictures , so i'm afraid the few i have are n't so hot a skatter of instruments and luggage i think this shot is atmospheric , but some might say it 's just dark how come new houses do n't have awesomely long hallways ? emi has a ukulele ! part way through the gathering , emi picked up a ukulele , and asked her friends to teach her some chords then she proceeded to not put down a ukulele for the rest of the time we were there except for brief breaks to use the bathroom and sleep ! in three days , she went from having never played a stringed instrument to knowing several songs on the uke well enough that she could sing along with them as she played ! i 'd say that 's passion driven learning at it 's best , and yet another example that passion driven learning is the best kind there is on the day we left we stopped at a music store , and emi picked out and bought her own ukulele before we headed out of town , so we were serenaded frequently on our drive home her playing has become less frequent in the couple of weeks since we got home , but we 'll still hear the sweet sound of the ukulele at least once a day , so it seems to have become a real part of daily life so i decided to record her playing , and singing , one of my favorite songs in her repetoire , over the rainbow over the rainbow on ukulele from idzie desmarais on vimeo now , a few years ago i heard about couchsurfing org at my first year of not back to school camp , i believe , a website that is a worldwide network for making connections between travelers and the local communities they visit things i love about this site is the sheer size of the network it provides it 's the biggest and best known site of it 's kind , the fact there are multiple safety thingies built into the site , and the fact that it 's free as in , the hosts do n't charge their guests , just offer a spare bed , futon , couch , or floor space to travelers because they want to meet cool people from all over the world ! i also really like that you do n't set up an account as either a host or surfer , and that most people on the site seem to both host and surf so anyway , i think the idea is really cool , so i got an account as soon as i was able to , which was at i could have just lied about age as everyone does on most sites , of course , but since there 's real life verification stuff involved , and i was n't planning any couchsurfing adventures just then , i figured i 'd just wait ! but then for a while , it just sat there the traveling i was doing was to conferences and the houses of people i already knew , and no one contacted me through cs about surfing , so i pretty much forgot about it but in the new year , i actually started getting contacted by people through the site , though not many and nothing worked out , until something did work out and we had our first couchsurfer here for the montreal anarchist bookfair , which was just this past weekend ! i find it really cool that though she found me through couchsurfing , she 's a former unschooler and nbtscer not back to school camper , so we already had friends in common ! we hit it off really well , and for the five days she was here , i had a great time we wandered the city , helped set up for the bookfair , ate yummy food , chattered through long bus rides , hung out at the bookfair a bunch , met lots of cool people , bought some cool shit , lay around in the sun , went to a seriously awesome punk show photos would probably make things look more interesting , but i have none anyway , a very good time was had , which is good , because i was really looking forward to the bookfair this year , and also really looking forward to my first couchsurfing hosting experience , so it 's lovely that everything actually met my expectations which does n't happen as often as i 'd like ! sadly , after that week of partying around people bringing germs from all over the continent , no less , i got sick so i 've had a sore throat for a few days now seems to be getting better , but even just a few days of not being able to talk are hard for my chatterbox self ! i think that 's what finally spurred me to actually write a post , really if i ca n't use my voice , i'm forced to talk in other ways ! even then , this post took me three days to finish like i said , i have n't been able to easily write publicly lately right now , i feel like i might be ready to write a bit more on this blog again , but i'm not sure whether that feeling will change or not lately , hell , for months really , i seem to be swinging between yay i love my friends , i love the world , life is great ! and everything sucks , i really suck , i ca n't handle anything except basic hygiene , maybe a bit of time with people , and reading fantasy novels so i suppose time will tell i hope all my readers are doing well , and i want to let you guys know how much i appreciate you all , the support you 've provided over the years i 've been writing this blog , and the fact you stick around even when i go long periods without writing much or at all !
