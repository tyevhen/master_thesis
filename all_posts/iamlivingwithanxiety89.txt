several unfortunate events have happened to me lately my car has been acting up , costing me in unexpected repairs my favorite pants ripped i have an ugly strain of grass growing in my newly seeded lawn surprisingly , these problems are not stressing me out what is making me anxious are all the silly things i worry could happen i clearly can handle the present , so why should i worry about the future ?
