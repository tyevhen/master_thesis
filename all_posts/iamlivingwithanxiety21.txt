last weekend i went to the movies with a friend when we entered the theater , i experienced a little anxiety we nervous people often become tense when there are many choices , and we have a tendency to work up even trivial situations , such as selecting the best seat in the house we chose one location , but i thought it was not ideal , as it was near the aisle i suggested we move to a more central position , which we both agreed was better as the previews began i heard a baby whimper behind me that 's when i began to work myself up i felt a mixture of anger and fear i was angry that someone would bring a child to a movie that , although not adult oriented , was not a film marketed to young kids how rude , how inconsiderate , i thought i wanted to move but also feared that the family behind me would consider me rude and inconsiderate for displaying my displeasure for a moment i did not know what to do i felt my heart beginning to race i then realized any decision would steady me , as dr low suggests i decided that the seats were still in a great location and that the baby was not being too loud in fact , to my amazement the child was very quiet throughout the movie dr low reminds us to not work up a situation in the preview in fact , a couple of his outbursts were a bit comical given what was going on onscreen a few days later , i realized that i overcame my fearful and angry temper by not allowing the situation to spiral into a vicious cycle yes , this was a triviality , but these everyday occurrences , not life 's real emergencies , are what usually give us the most symptoms i endorsed for being group minded to my friend and the people around me recovery served me well during a night at the movies
