how come the unconscious is constantly neglected i know no one knows what it is or what it contains best to let sleeping dogs lie , especially since we don t know what kind of dogs we are dealing with one could be dangerous but that cannot be true cause all we do is dredge up our own feelings how dangerous could that be ? well , let s see no one likes or loves me nothing will change there is no hope to ever be loved by two people who cannot love i know those feelings and have relived them they are painful but they cannot drive you crazy because you are feeling them that means that your compulsive behavior , migraines , high blood pressure , epilepsy will go away for good because there is no residue of pain to drive the symptoms again what a relief no recidivism the end of criminality but but you need to feel a lot of the pain and not stop in the middle otherwise , there is that residue so let me ask you this why is all this love , this hugging and kissing so important ? why is it the linchpin of primal therapy ? because it is essential to our life , longevity and healing nothing matters when we lack it and success means nothing without it life is empty not because you don t have it now but because the lack of love was imprinted even during gestation and overshadows everything in life so even when someone comes along who is warm and kind we cannot feel it because the imprint dominates and colors our lives and what happens ? the person thinks it is others fault and seeks out love from others alas , it will not happen what will happen is divorce so what really happens to us when there is no love , even during womb life ? your brain shrinks and you no longer play with a full deck i should add that most brain studies are on children but the results play an even more important role for the evolving brain of the fetus so how do we love a fetus ? correct nutrition , careful behavior while pregnant no very hot baths or sweat cabins , no flying , no extreme sports but most important you need to be normal what ? janov is nuts , it seems but if you are chronically anxious or depressed it seeps into the fetus and affects is functioning it will be either uploaded or downloaded not normal and the physiology of the mother will be visited upon the baby he will end up with many of the maternal traits but wait a minute how do we get normal ? get rid of what makes us abnormal and that means imprinted pain better yet , be born to loving parents aah look after we make for the best gestational life possible , we need to sleep with the child , hug and kiss him and help him feel wanted and welcome to this planet talk to him , approve of him and lay off all the criticism not so hard ? when it does not happen you have a brain that does not function well does not remember well and cannot focus it is a smaller brain this is a brain that underwent serious neglect and abuse early on what they found is that the smaller brain has a right hemisphere , the feeling one , that lacks some essential elements the larger is nearly always the smarter one and the more socially adept when there is no close bond with parents , starting with gestation , there will be faulty relationships throughout life but why do those with smaller brains seem smart ? because they become intellectuals and that ain t smart for more on all this look up the health freedom alliance april , , and also proceedings of the national academy of sciences , early edition when we think about smart we need to think about emotionally smart , yet neglect causes the limbic structures to become smaller as they get smaller we find adhd and lack of good focus not surprising , there is diminished growth of the left hemisphere all this from lack of love ? yes yes when scientists discuss this research why do they not follow suit and address those very early events that lay imprinted deep in the brain ? instead of using the higher level neo cortex to suppress it ? why do we need to plunge into the abyss of the last frontier ? when there is inadequate stimulation early on we do not get the full quantity of neurons we need the half full deck and , i might add , we lack the full arsenal of repressive chemicals we need to block pain hence anxiety as a chronic state chemicals such as serotonin get used up in the battle to keep the gates closed as a result the gates get leaky pain passes through the porous brain , and we are very uncomfortable and can turn to drugs so where does addiction come from ? those in pain who need to kill it we usually address taking drugs and never why the key element is left out of the equation pain and the rest of the equation is where does the pain come from ? neglecting need , the most basic physiologic need to the needs of a growing child it is those very early needs we cannot see and never know exists if we leave those early imprints untouched we can sure addiction will thrive again do gooders help with higher levels but never the deeper levels lo and behold the one with the smaller brain is much more likely to be addicted and he will be violent why ? because the early damage can exist on the deep brainstem level where violence is organized and imprinted this means very early and deep damage we have found a way to go deep and we hope others will allow us to teach them and there abort so much suffering we need to travel where there are no words and even no tears into our prehistory that is what this has made it all such a mystery
