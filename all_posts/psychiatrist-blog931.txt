a psychiatrist i know is going through a phase of life change it 's one you only get to once he 's made the comment that in looking back , he made some mistakes and said some things he should n't have to patients who were going through this same phase of life change , long before he did the event of it has made him more empathic to what his patients were feeling , something he did n't comprehend until he was in the same shoes i know the feeling people look to their psychiatrists for wisdom , and you know , we do n't always have it patients will ask for suggestions about marriage or child rearing from psychiatrists who may be single , childless , or on their eighth divorce it does n't mean we do n't have the answers sometimes these things are better dealt with from a safe distance but sometimes it might i look back at some of the things i said to the parents of teenagers , back when mine were oh so cute and loving toddlers and i wince oh , my , i was so clueless back in the day can i recall my patients ? i'm sorry , i said some stupid things back then i shrug a lot more than i used to i do n't know if it 's helpful , but i do know it 's more honest
