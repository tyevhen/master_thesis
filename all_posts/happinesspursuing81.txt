if i m going to blog every day then i can t continuously write about depression that would just be too depressing besides , there are vast stretches of time where nothing particularly interesting happens and i don t want a series of entries that say nothing more than yup , still hate myself which i do , by the way predictably i completely screwed yesterday up after doing my hour s worth of running from am to i came home and stewed about it then finally got to work around pm and afternoons suck for me so what little i did get done i ll have to redo this morning i have a phone interview this afternoon i m not really worked up about it yet it s am as i write this but i m sure that as the time draws nigh i ll have a nice lather going i haven t conducted too many interviews although i m trying to do more i hope i ll get more comfortable with them as time goes by but that isn t likely it still takes me a few days to mentally prepare for a damned haircut and the event ruins my day sometimes those pills the therapist offered me sound pretty good
