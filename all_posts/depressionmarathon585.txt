just a quick note to let you know things are looking up as i said in my last post , we changed some of the ect parameters on friday , and so far that seems to be making a difference i 've had two treatments with the new parameters , and i'm definitely feeling brighter at this point , i may be able to head home as early as thursday i have another treatment tomorrow if things go really well , i 'll just stop the ects at , rather than , and go home thursday , rather than saturday i 've been here a very long time , and i am definitely ready to go after all , i need to begin training for boston very soon , and that 's almost impossible for me to do in here ! we 'll see how tomorrow goes if i do n't think doing one more ect will provide any more benefit , i may be home the next time you hear from me !
