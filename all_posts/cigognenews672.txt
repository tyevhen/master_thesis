that is the wonderful thing about imprints they are a fountain of truth , which is exactly why we can count on its veracity when we see a patient with access who is reliving incest we can believe it when we see loss of erection it is telling the truth despite our will power , which is why we cannot will an orgasm , man or woman , without good deep access the inability to become erect in a man speaks the truth of the system we too often are trying to correct this so called problem when it is in accord with internal reality we are trying to tear it away from reality with our newly found psychological techniques we can also count on its truth through measurement when the body temperature rises or drops some three degrees during a session , we know the patient is re experiencing a major trauma , either a major second line limbic system trauma , or a significant first line or more likely , both we have found that such memories are quite accessible through the use of proper techniques without those techniques , memories seem inaccessible nature is a good protector such memories should not be easily accessed , as the lower centers of the brain hold survival functions and adaptation strategies that must not be tampered with though a trauma may be long past , it remains within the body , imbued with the full force of the original event it continually creates havoc so long as the body is young and strong , there may be an absence of symptoms but as it ages and weakens , symptoms will be manifest once the imprint is blocked away from conscious awareness , it is always a danger , a foreign element to be reckoned with the danger is that it will intrude upon awareness and send the vital signs skyrocketing the alien intrusion , such as being abused or abandoned by one 's father , for example , makes the child feel unwanted , unloved , and unsafe under the experience created during the child 's early years , the child becomes terrorized and repressed trauma then creates a splitting of the self it drives a wedge between the real pained self and the unreal , or unfeeling , repressed self the self presented to the public because of the split or disconnection we can no longer will our bodies to do our bidding in sex , that means the body is out of our control our will remains on the top cortical level and cannot reach down to tell the penis what it should do , so it cannot stop it from ejaculating too quickly , for example very early trauma has compromised the development of the controlling orbitofrontal cortex , which could slow ejaculation being disconnected means losing a bond with many of the processes that are mediated by lower levels thus , we have no way to control heart palpitations or lower our blood pressure , or will an orgasm no willpower on our part can make a difference we are trying to harness forces with which we have lost contact years ago they are sending out orders in their peculiar silent language , shifting resources from one place to another and trying to warn us of danger to illustrate , the level of the stress hormone , cortisol , may be raised to a high level , but all we will feel is the vague sense of impending doom , and we do not know from what doom was in the offing during perhaps a birth experience with too little oxygen or worse , we do not feel anything at all this is a problem , and the essence of which i call the janovian gap the wider the distance or disconnection between a deep imprint and the conscious awareness of it , the more susceptible we will become to illness the space between feeling sensation and the cortical , thinking acknowledgment of it , is a precise measure , and in my opinion , a gauge of our longevity one can say , yes , but the man developed lung cancer because he smoked packs a day i would say that the man smoked because of the gap between what he was experiencing physiologically and his conscious awareness of it it is that gap that compromised his system , and his health because of this disconnection between feeling sensation and the thinking mind , the penis has a mind of its own , a sense of urgency to release pent up tension we need to experience the imprint , the level of consciousness where the disconnection took place , which may have nothing to do with sex to feel the disconnect is to reconnect
