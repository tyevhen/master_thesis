when i say work i mean that they can make us feel better if they didn t , they would surely fade away there are many explanations for this what we learn from placebo medicine that is sold as a pain killer but is inert research helps this understanding aside from the merits or their lack in religion or psychotherapy , one reason they make us feel better is because we expect them to do so in placebo research the subject is put in pain and then told that the drug they are injecting will kill it and it does in most cases so expectations cause the very same neurojuice secretion as when the drug is really given but there is more the placebo stimulates the brain circuits in the same area where the real drug works the brain does not know the difference the dentist can go on drilling to his heart s content because belief is producing pain killing chemicals in the same circuits where painkillers work the brain has deceived itself the result is no pain if you can produce the very same chemicals that exist in a tranquilizing pill how can you ever tell the difference ? that is why thinking you are getting well is not the same as feeling it thinking is malleable feeling is not i treated a man who was getting to very deep and painful feelings we suspected for some time that he was a victim of incest as he got close to this memory he sat upright and told me that he just saw god and was saved by him he didn t have to get to the feeling he felt much better what he saw was relief his brain manufactured something that wasn t there and eased his pain something that was there was his brain s ability to manufacture symbols that was a reality that he conjured up , and it became real to him so on the verge of horrific emotional pain he produced painkillers , and they produced images and thoughts and killed the pain what comes first ? pain , then images and thoughts , then relief so belief is one excellent way of blocking pain that is why the alcoholic can give up booze when he finds god he simply has found another convenient way to inject chemicals into himself from the inside if i believe in psychotherapy and go to a warm concerned therapist i am likely to think the therapy works because if you think a psychotherapy works , it often will you think you are getting better because you think you are getting better the belief is all diabolic , but true
