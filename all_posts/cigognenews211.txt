to be fully loved during childhood gives a person enduring peace i mean this literally since very early love brings our internal supplies of the gating neurotransmitters up to normal a loved child will have no need to believe in ideologies full of hope and magic someone at peace with herself has no reason to go to faith healers or to be born again she does not need to retreat with a group of people to an ashram or a cabin in the woods to meditate , chant , deep breathe in order to find peace children need to be touched , caressed and soothed they need to be heard , protected and made to feel safe they need parents who will allow them to express their feelings and who will help them with those feelings when these needs go unmet , the foundation of a personality that will grasp at belief later in life is being built one key biochemical reason is that love enhances the secretion of oxytocin and serotonin both are the juices that suppress pain and keep us comfortable lack of love means a lack of those precious biochemicals hence lack of defense against pain beliefs follow the needy person may well become devoted to a deity who promises to understand everything , to nurture , to protect , and to supply all the unfulfilled needs of a lifetime this was the lure of est some years ago discussed earlier a template for all later weekend emotional workshops the leaders , who with the charismatic werner erhard , said they cared , while at the same time castigating and swearing at the members massed in a weekend retreat in some hotel room they were called losers and useless , but if they tried hard they wouldn t have to be , and the leader and his adepts would see to it that they got over those feelings that they actually instilled of course , they instilled ideas that matched how the people really felt and the believers desperately wanted to feel differently they gave erhard a fortune , to not end hunger in the world , but to end the idea of hunger in the world meanwhile the money went to some caribbean island in a secret bank account and still they believed one of our patients , formerly into belief systems , said that he used to fly into a rage when his wife did n't understand him he felt like it was life and death that she understands him he had an urgent need for a mother , a wife , a god who would fully understand , hold and soothe him he relived the trauma a deep seated need to have his needs understood , beginning at birth , a wrenching abandonment when he was too young to comprehend what was happening he could feel it , despite no understanding on a cortical level a need to be understood back then really was a matter of life and death his professional field was communication one way that defensive belief systems come into being , even fairly early in a child 's life , is when that child is taught not to express feelings , not to speak thoughts that are unacceptable , not to express resentment , jealousy , or other negative thoughts , not to speak badly of others , and never to say what is in her heart once installed , the censoring process continues automatically the child comes later on to substitute ideas for what he or she really feels having unreal ideas as an adult is just a logical extension of what happened in early childhood
