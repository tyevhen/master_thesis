the nine lives of jacob tibbs , by cylin busby disclaimer i received a copy of this book from the publisher via netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review jacob tibbs is the runt of his litter he watches as , one by one , sailors buy and bear away his brothers and sisters to be ship cats on other ships leaving only him and his mother the captain 's daughter begs her father to save jacob despite his small size and his white paws that are glow in the dark beacons to the ship rats and it 's a good thing the captain saves jacob , because he has his mother 's talent for predicting weather and a huge storm is brewing i know i bragged about how awesome my last netgalley book was , but this book was equally awesome for different reasons this was just an adorable and fun book to read i actually learned some interesting tidbits about ships from this book busby must have done a lot of research i'm a cat person , and i loved the way jacob always explained his actions with cat like anthropomorphic reasoning instead of just sounding like a human mind in a cat i was surprised at how much action could be packed into a book this short there was always something going on that made me want to read the next chapter this book was so sweet and fun ! i wish i had an appropriately aged kid to read it to i highly recommend this book for middle grade readers starting with precocious third graders while you 're getting it for your child , read it yourself you wo n't regret it
