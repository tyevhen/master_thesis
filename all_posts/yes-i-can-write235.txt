for the last while , the posts on this blog have been almost entirely about unschooling my political views on other things seem to have taken a back seat and i wondered why is that ? unschooling is the subject i'm the most passionate about , so it seems logical i write a lot about it , but there 's more to it than that when i think of writing something to do with my green anarchist views , i shy away from it , mentally it kind of scares me to talk about it each time i open my mouth to state my views , or start to type a highly politicized post , i feel a rush of nerves why is that ? i think it just comes down to the fact that i hate arguing like , really hate it and if i am going to be dragged into an argument some call it a debate yes , yes , i know they 're different i just do n't like either ! , i want it to be a subject i have absolute confidence in my knowledge of unschooling , for example i still hate debating that subject , but it 's the one subject i hate debating very slightly less than other subjects and , of course , i can safely post about unschooling on this blog with very little risk of arguments or debates i know that what i'm most likely to get are just a few differences in opinions , honest questions , and interesting discussions good things when things get into political views , and general worldviews , however , nowhere is safe anymore many people find it strange that i hate debating they say , often with a certain measure of disapproval , that debating is good for you , good for solidifying views , and is cowardly to avoid well , no one has actually ever said the last one to me , i 've just gotten that feeling our culture seems to put a lot of emphasis on debating , and i actually find myself feeling slightly embarrassed when saying i hate debating , and usually avoid it but really , just like anything else , people do n't learn or develop in only one way for some people , debating is very helpful in their learning process for others , it 's not i just wish people would recognize that ! when i let myself get sucked into a debate an argument to determine which arguer is right , as if right ness was somehow objective , i feel a spike in stress levels not a pleasant mental jump in alertness , just a spike of stress and unhappiness really , that 's how much i do n't like debates discussions , however , i consider to be a respectful exchange of opinions and ideas totally different from an aggressive debate discussions feel good to me , energize me , give my brain a pleasant workout , introduce new ideas and ways of looking at things , help build friendships debates stress me , anger me , make me feel defensive , make me feel like my words are being judged and like my opponent is trying to rip everything i say to shreds , because , well , they usually are is n't that what a debate is ? i also find that i'm far more open to new opinions and ways of looking at things in a respectful and friendly discussion than in a competitive debate i really do n't mind at all if other people are happy to debate but if someone tries to start one with me , and they push when i say i'm not into debating , it really bothers me and do n't even get me started on people playing devils advocate when talking to me when i argue something , i really , truly , and with all my heart believe in what i'm saying i'm often talking about things that are vital to how i live my life , and are very close to me heart if someone else is just arguing something they 're not invested in at all , just for the kicks , i find it incredibly disrespectful again , have the sense to argue with other people who enjoy it , not with people who really care about what they 're saying so , having gone off on a major tangent , i come back to the reason why i'm nervous about posting things to do with green anarchy links to other things are fine but when it 's my own words , what if someone says something i disagree with so much in response that i have to tell them they 're wrong , then i get sucked into a debate , and get stressed , and and and you get the picture so maybe i should just close comments on especially political posts ? but i love comments , generally , and want to hear what people have to say i do n't want to do that you see the dilemma so that 's a main reason i write less about politics but i want to change that there are thoughts and musings and views i really want to put out there i just have to take a deep breathe , and be brave enough to do so ! peace , idzie you might also like green anarchy finding community against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference life happening linkwithin
