posted by dinah blogger wo n't let me post a pic i am off shortly for a few days of 'relative' festivities no blood to be shed and then a week of real vacation in case i do n't post while away season 's greetings to all ! this post is dedicated to roy , with affection from the new york times , penelope green writes in say yes to mess about how clutter is good , organization over rated january is get organized month , but we 're told their 's a counter movement of people fighting the get organized trend , people who shun staples and the container store , organizing items and the pursuit of neatness mess tells a story you can learn a lot about people from their detritus , whereas neat well , neat is a closed book neat has no narrative and no personality as any cover of real simple magazine will demonstrate so why on our psychiatry blog ? i ca n't tell you how much time people spend in psychotherapy talking about how they wish they were more organized , how they have all these household chores to do , how they regret the time they spend in front of the tv or computer blogging , no doubt , sleeping , gaming , doing other non organizing things it 's the funny dilemma they want things changed , but they do n't want to change them do you realize , i never say , that in the space of this therapy session , an entire closet could be dealt with ? and if it 's not enough to loathe ones self for all drawers not organized , yet even more hours in psychotherapy are spent talking about the spouse partner roommate whose sense of neatness is mismatched there 's the can you believe what a slob she is ? side and the what a neurotic freak who can never be pleased side so , yes , say yes to mess fits right in with psychiatry themes so i am pretty neat i love the container store i only like planned clutter everything has a place , my children 's doors are kept closed and i mentally write those rooms off i stock decorative boxes and ottomans with removable tops so mess can be scooped , dumped , and lidded throwing things out makes me happy sorting is the key to the good life with kids and a dog with a social life , neighbors with keys , and more remote controls and sports equipment than sports authority , it 's really more idea than fact , but i am pretty neat but not as neat as camel it s a movement that confirms what you have known , deep down , all along really neat people are not avatars of the good life they are humorless and inflexible prigs , and have way too much time on their hands umm , gee thanks time to clear out the psychiatric journals be well , eat well , love well , and do n't worry about the clutter
