well , the money continues to fly out of my wallet this month first the root canal repair , then the truck repair , and yesterday it was the furnace after a few hours freezing my buns off , the furnace man showed up yesterday around am he was here for a grand total of minutes , and it cost me ! but at least i have heat , and i'm quite grateful for that my mother offered to loan me the money to pay for the furnace , but i said no it really would make things easier if i accepted it , especially since i received a quarterly bill for my health insurance yesterday another large chunk of money but i have such a hard time borrowing money from anyone , especially my mother i guess it 's a pride thing i do n't know i thought a lot about it today , but i just feel like i need to figure this out on my own i have other options , and even though it would be easier to let my mother help , i think i 'll pursue the other options first in other news , i completed my mile run yesterday it was tough as usual , but it was also quite pretty it snowed for over half of the run the flakes were light and fluffy and lasted for a couple of hours after it snowed , the sun came out for the rest of my run lovely i think i may have even gotten a little tan ! it was a good run i ran yesterday instead of my usual saturday because i'm going to be busy this weekend two old friends are going to be nearby , and they invited me to spend the entire weekend with them their treat ! we 're going to go out to some shows , maybe do a comedy club , perhaps hit a spa , spend the night in a hotel , and then do brunch on sunday it 's been an awful long time since i 've done anything fun like this , so i'm really looking forward to it ! it will be great to spend time with them , and it was incredibly kind of them to offer such an opportunity i 'll let you know how it goes and now it 's time to pack
