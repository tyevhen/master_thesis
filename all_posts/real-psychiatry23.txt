in follow up to my previous post and before i saw blade runner , i wanted to post a more modern take on the turing test based on a coherent theory of consciousness by tononi and koch both experts in the neuroscience of consciousness their theory is the integrated information theory iit of consciousness i have included the reference and a graphic from their public access paper on the theory and there are also several very useful videos available to listen to the verbal descriptions of the theory i have been following consciousness research for at least the past years including the two main listservs on this topic until they shut them down when a topic is so specialized , barring any breakthroughs the arguments become repetitive and a lot of time is spent bringing novices up to speed the videos fill a useful gap that these listservs previously addressed although i must admit that i am always biased toward the written rather than the spoken word because it is a much more efficient information transfer for me the videos listed at the bottom of this page also serve another useful purpose the viewer is able to see how researchers in this area define consciousness and describe their theories i think that it is possible to notice that some of the definitions and descriptions are so vague as to have limited utility that is one of the reasons that i like the approach by koch and tonini i will also also say from the outset that i am not sure whether they view the theory as a joint venture or not as an example of what i mean looking at this specific search on consciousness finds that tononi has been working in this area for at least years a similar search on koch goes back even years earlier i do n't know either of the authors but based on reading this paper it seems like a joint effort and that seems to come across in the available videos of their presentations see addendum in the paper , that authors outline phenomenological definitions that are more exacting than any that i have seen in the past from other authors they are also neuroscience based and that makes a difference to me in various venues people often faintly praise but then lament psychiatry 's emphasis on biology that is obviously not true or at least without reason and it also illustrates the lack of research that people do when it comes to critiquing psychiatry psychiatrists have actively researched practically all forms of social , psychological , and biological etiologies of mental illness since the specialty was founded any cursory review of a general psychiatric text illustrates that point so if a psychiatrist is focused on brain biology , it is certainly not without reason i previously posted a breakfast that i had with a mentor and after a long career as a psychiatrist he summed it up the way a lot of psychiatrists do it is all about the biology critics take that to mean some kind of medical intervention they are certainly studied , but every other non medical intervention has been studied as well it is common to read about non medical interventions psychotherapy , meditation , etc altering the brain in some way in psychiatry that has been known within the field for at least years there are two levels to study the work of tononi and koch the first is at the purely descriptive level that is the level that you will find in the first reference the second level is at the level of neuroscience and mathematical theory the authors have produced this work as well and reference it in this paper , but for the purpose of this post i am going to stay at the descriptive level and possibly post a more technical article on the advanced theory at a later date i will add that there are several competing theories of consciousness that i am not going to mention here i have studied several of them and think that they have less to offer than the integrated information theory iit of consciousness i am admittedly a reductionist seeking to close the explanatory gap between brain biology and how conscious states are generated in some of the videos available online where there are panel discussions it is clear that the proponents of the other theories think that their own theories are correct and iit is wrong i have been down the rabbit hole with a few of those theories and do n't want to take time to criticize them feel free to look them up and form your own opinion for now i will focus on iit if you have never heard of tononi , koch , or iit the first task is to read the paper i found it to be very clear in terms of definitions , postulates , and a clearly stated theory they point out that every experience will have an associate neural correlate of consciousness ncc there is currently an explanatory gap at the level of how conscious experiences are actually produced by the ncc they discuss the axioms necessary for a coherent phenomenology of consciousness from there they move on to the postulates eventually they discuss how a conceptual structure that is maximally irreducible conceptual structure occurs in the brain these states are also known as quale they give a couple of examples about how conscious states occur within their theory they provide and example of how to calculate the quality and consciousness given a particular state containing elements figure they provide a clear example of the physical substrate of experience complex , and a set of maximally irreducible cause effect repertoires concept , and a maximally irreducible cause effect structure in cause effect space made of concepts or conceptual structure qualep the quantity of experience or consciousness is specified as max the quality of experience is the form or shape of the conceptual structure distinct shapes occur with different experiences a more accessible example is discussed on page and that is seeing jennifer aniston in a movie in that case , the complexes at the neuronal level affects the probability of past and future states consistent with neuroanatomy many specialized neurons are firing or not firing in the visual system that are associated with jennifer aniston as an invariant concept other neurons are associated with other invariant concepts that allow for a fuller description in terms of appearance , age , etc all of the elements of the complex are intrinsic information and do not depend on visual inputs for example if dreaming or imagining the actress the authors also briefly review some of the experimental evidence that is consistent with the theory they find that the theory is predictive in number of experimental paradigms transcranial magnetic stimulation tms can be applied to to conscious individuals and unconscious dreamless sleep , general anesthesia individuals in the conscious state there is a widespread pattern of activation and deactivation noted with high density eeg in the unconscious state cortical response is local or global and stereotypical integration and information are lost a metric called the perturbation complexity index pci a measure of the eeg compressibility from tms stimulation can be used consciousness and it decreases in states that lack it tonini has been very explicit about the issue of machine consciousness it does n't exist no matter how sophisticated the machine is any machine recognizing inputs that the human nervous system would recognize and producing identical outputs , even if that machine duplicates the structure and function of the human brain is not conscious tononi uses the consciousness science term zombie to characterize such machines by definition a zombie system is one that lacks consciousness and they are described as being subsystems in humans when they are active outside the sphere of conscious recognition that brings us back to the ability to detect machines from humans if a machine is a perfect human zombie in terms of its input and output , we would not expect an empathy or turing test to throw it off iit theory acknowledges that what appears to be human input and output can be perfectly simulated the original blade runner protocol seems more than an empathy test specific questions about past memories illustrate an attempt determine if there is continuity between any current and past experiences , even though in the case of rachael the memories are false and implanted that being said iit states there there is no turing test for consciousness by now it does seem that fairly basic programs like self learning neural nets can replicate a narrowly defined human skill in that case many people speculate that there is an intelligence or even human consciousness behind it on the other hand the perturbation complexity index pci seems like a potentially useful test based on current
