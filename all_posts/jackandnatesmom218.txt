we have a new best friend in our house and by in our house i mean in mr jack 's life and it is just about the sweetest thing ever i have mentioned that he recently has taken an interest in horses he loves the black stallion movie and black beauty he has a horse book that i bought him and he looks at it all the time anyway , about a month ago , we went to buy a birthday present for a little friend at the disney store and jack saw the stuffed horse angus from the movie brave he had to have it i am a sucker for anything that is not an airplane , shark , robot , you get the idea , so i caved i figured it was something he would play with for a few days and lose interest in instead , i am watching jack claim his first true wubby it 's a beautiful thing he has carried airplanes and robots all over the place , true , but these things were always just objects that he was obsessed with he has renamed angus black like the black stallion , although he does still answer to angus when mommy messes up for the past two nights , jack insists that we plug the sink and run water when he has his bath so that the horse can have a bath in the sink too he carries him everywhere we go and sleeps with him every night when he got sick the other night the first thing he wanted me to do was make sure angus was ok this is so different from his usual frantic fixations on things it 's more like a relationship ? he worries about him and loves him this is really huge sweetest boy
