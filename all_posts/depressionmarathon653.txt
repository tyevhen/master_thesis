what a bummer i went for my mile tempo run at am this morning i was back home by three blocks from my house , when my right foot hit the ground , my right soleus muscle lower calf cramped and then pulled actually , it felt like it tore , but i'm trying to remain optimistic i stopped immediately i had to and i hobbled slowly and painfully home what a bummer ! after spewing a few choice words , i set to work i iced i took ibuprofen i put on a compression sleeve it did n't matter i could barely walk for most of the morning i'm definitely done running for awhile no mile tempo run today no mile long run on saturday and probably no runs at all for the next couple of weeks i'm not sure what i'm going to do to stay in aerobic shape my health club is closing the pool for cleaning for days beginning tomorrow really bad timing i'm not sure if i can bike yet , but even if i can , i wo n't want to bike every day i'm concerned about maintaining my fitness this will be a challenge for me i have n't been injured in a very long time hopefully , i 'll heal quicker than i'm expecting i 'll certainly pray for that but until then , i'm a grounded sole what a bummer
