photo from my yesterday 's adventure yesterday was an interesting day i had to start the day driving around downtown salt lake city to find the utah board of education building i was going to install our software on one of their computers well , the address that was given me was wrong driving somewhere that i ve never been to before i hate , but even worse is getting lost and being late to something important i started to panic i quickly called tyler and explained the situation to him luckily his new job had him right around the corner and he was able to come and help me i was able to get there only a little bit late it was a stressful experience but i made it through just fine on my way back to the office i picked up some fast food i tried to eat it at my desk but kept getting interrupted and soon it got cold but i was full anyway so no big deal than a couple co workers and i decided to go take some photos of the fall colors in a nearby canyon on the drive down there they decided to stop and get some food this instantly made my heart start pounding and i felt the back of my neck get hot they both knew i had already eaten so they weren t expecting me to get anything so why was i panicking ? we stopped and i decided to wait outside and try to control my breathing i was doing my deep breathing techniques but i didn t have my clonozapam with me which is a rarity and that too had me worried i was trying to think about positive affirmations but it wasn t helping everything that usually works , didn t so i made a very quick decision i decided to go in to the restroom and just get it over with so that i could go on with my day it all happened so quickly and so matter of fact that it was a little weird but sure enough , i felt better afterwards also this morning i woke up with morning anxiety again haven t had that in awhile here is why i think it happened with tyler s new job we haven t had insurance for about a month my zoloft ran out and i have stopped taking it stupid , i know , but for some reason the consequences never seem to register to me , no matter how many times i have to learn the same lesson over and over again so i think it is out of my system and things that wouldn t bother me normally are now more sensitive i am learning that anxiety just like anything else is full of ups and downs and i can never get too comfy with the ups to not be prepared for a sudden down tomorrow is blog against abuse day for bloggers everywhere i think i am going to talk about my stance on medication because i know it is a controversial subject if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like dealing with unexpected anxiety setbacks even more about morning anxiety its all about your attitude they 're here how stress affects the body linkwithin
