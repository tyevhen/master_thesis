it is now years since the three treasures remedy chemo support was introduced this remedy aims at lessening the side effects of chemotherapy by tonifying qi and yin , clearing heat , resolving dampness and allaying nausea and vomiting it has been used by hundreds if not thousands of patients world wide the newsletter of summer explains the use of chemo support and this is the link http www three treasures com newsletters summer html it is always disappointing to hear about oncologists that still advise their patients against taking chemo support , even after i provide a list of ingredients with their pharmacological effect one reason oncologists advise against taking this remedy is the old chestnut of the alleged conflict between chemotherapy agents and anti oxidants the theory behind their opposition is that chemotherapy works by oxidating cancer cells and therefore one does not want to do anything that would prevent that the spring newsletter on chemotherapy and anti oxidants deals with this question and i will not repeat the arguments here suffice to say that it is far from proven that anti oxidants interfere with chemotherapy indeed there is some evidence that they may even work in synergy with it and lessen its side effects the link to the spring newsletter is as follows http www three treasures com newsletters spring html the second question is even if anti oxidants counteracted chemotherapy , does this apply to chinese herbs , or at least to the herbs in chemo support ? does the remedy contain anti oxidants to a level that allegedly might counteract chemotherapy ? the answer is an emphatic no there is therefore no reason whatsoever to avoid taking chemo support during chemotherapy it pains me to have to tell patients who frequently write to me that , if they really have misgivings about taking chemo support , they should follow the advice of their oncologist i also find it upsetting that , in this age of integrative medicine , an oncologist may know nothing about chinese herbs and yet advise patients not to take them i hear this all the time my oncologist said that he or she does not know anything about chinese herbs and that therefore i should not take them i would have thought that it is their duty to inform themselves about chinese herbs anything less is poor care
