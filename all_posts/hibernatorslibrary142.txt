the chimes , by charles dickens , narrated by richard armitage when trotty 's daughter brings him a happy surprise tripe and news of her engagement for the upcoming new year , he is quickly disillusioned by a group of wealthy people who delight in putting down poor folk that evening , trotty explores his beloved bell spire and sees things that he never expected to see this story was hard to read at first because it was so darned depressing i mean , here trotty was as happy as a clam because we all know clams smile all the time and suddenly these horrible wealthy men stomp all over his happiness as the story goes on , the family becomes even more downtrodden in fact , i was wondering if the story was going to turn around into a happy christmas story until the very end this was n't my favorite of dickens' works it 's nice to read another of his lesser known christmas stories , but i guess it 's lesser known for a reason it was quaint and a good poke in the eye to the strong who put down the weak but other than that , it was kind of a meh book for me
