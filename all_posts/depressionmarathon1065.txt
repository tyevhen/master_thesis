this morning , on the way to my usual aa meeting , i could n't wait to talk to stan about the vikings new quarterback we both loved the vikings , and we both hated last season 's qb options it took a couple seconds before i remembered i would n't be sharing any thoughts with stan i looked to the sky i could almost see him smiling with optimism for next season the vikings stan and i discussed them a lot he was one of few men who did n't flinch when , on occasion , a woman knew more about sports than he i never told him how much i appreciated that i never expected i would n't sit with him , share chili and the game , and yell at the tv again i 'll miss that we never know , do we , when our exit will come just a few days after stan died , my yoga instructor said , tell the ones you love tell them today what they mean to you tell them now , because even though you are planning to come to class tomorrow , you may not make it here that 's the reality of life , is n't it ? and yet , even with my recent experience , i 've had difficulty taking her suggested action why is that ? how about you ? have you said , i love you , or thank you , today ?
