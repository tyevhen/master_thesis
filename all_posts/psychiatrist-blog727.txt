for those who do n't follow the comment sections of posts , there have been commenters who have been telling us about the awful experiences they have had as psychiatric patients in particular but not exclusively as hospital inpatients commenters have used terms like abuse and humiliation and describe awful scenarios one person asked why the mean nurses do n't get fired , everyone knows they are mean including the staff others throw the baby out with the bath water , one bad experience there is implication by at least one commenter that he she would rather die presumably permanently rather than face a days on a psych unit again the suffering in these posts is palpable to those who feel better after leaving comments on shrink rap , by all means , feel free to continue , but this will not change the world may i put in a request ? if you 've had an awful experience as a patient on a psychiatric unit , please tell the hospital one commenter said she he ? complained to the hospital administration and heard that some changes were made my thoughts ? you go girl ! if the commenter was a male , i'm at a loss way to go , joe ! perhaps ? complain , it ca n't hurt oh , you say , no one listens to psychiatric patients , they just say we 're crazy so they do n't have to listen for an isolated complaint , you may be right , especially if the complaint is about something that is not egregious but if everyone who feels wronged complains , then it wo n't be an isolated complaint , and i can tell you that for administrators , one person accusing is a fluke or a psychiatric patient they do n't need to listen to but at a very low threshold of two or three complaints , it quickly becomes people are complaining about such and such and someone starts to notice if the complaint is egregious my nurse punched me then a single complaint should have an impact who should complain ? if you were upset over something that happened and it continues to linger , you ca n't let it go , and you continue to feel angry , wronged , and injured , then you should complain so let me tell you how to complain call the hospital and ask where to direct a complaint and get a person 's name and postal or email address also send the same letter to the chairman of psychiatry , and the head of the hospital why not ? address the letters to specific people by name dear sir , to whom it may concern , or to the sadist creep on the psych unit will not go far just the facts , ma'am tell the administrators when you were hospitalized and that you continue to feel distress angst anger whatever you feel about things that happened while you were in the hospital and give a bullet point list of the things that continue to trouble you include specific examples , if you can , names of those who were involved if you do n't recall specific examples , it still seems to me it 's valid to say shrink john treated me in a harsh and disrespectful manner say how you felt it was humiliating to be stripped and placed in a seclusion room this is not the time for name calling , hater rants , or discussing the care of other patients this is why everyone hates psychiatrists , you people over medicate everyone , pretty much guarantees that the recipients shut down stick to your problem be polite and respectful and try not to compare the mental health professionals who treated you to serial killers sign your name and leave contact information show it to a friend first and wait a day to send it i do n't know if you 'll get a response or a change , but if everyone who feels as wronged as our commenters do writes to complain , then things will change it may take time do n't be hater , be a changer thank you for considering my suggestion happy father 's day to all , and remember to submit your grand rounds post now
