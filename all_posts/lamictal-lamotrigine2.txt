in a recent post , i wrote about how my husband and i were kind of stuck in a netherworld of wanting another cat , but of not feeling ready last weekend we took a trip to the spca to test the waters by that point i felt i was ready , but my husband did n't then , we met our cat it was a cat i had seen before but never visited every time i saw her , she already had a visit tag for that day , so i needed to visit cats who had n't been visited but i felt like i wanted to get to know her better i liked the way she looked at me as if she knew me she 's still adjusting , of course , but still seems very different from our previous two cats she does n't say much , for instance , even when she 's hungry our other cats would wail and complain , and when we told them they 'd have to wait for dinner time , they 'd start nipping our feet however , she 's a sweet kitty and is already proving herself to be a lap cat i knew that cats were an important part of my self care , but i 'd forgotten how much since the arrival of sc , my anxiety levels have plummeted by a factor of ten , at least i'm less depressed i'm more hopeful i do n't just love cats , i need cats
