an apology for bad poems i ve been talking at you for years like a deaf grandfather i don t mean to lecture , that s death for poetry but if poetry can t compete with the wall of death , at least it can be a ferris wheel at the zenith of our revolution together , your head jerking like a gopher sitting sentry , i d like to hear , grandpa , what s that ? that s where the a bomb hit in nothing grows there except man eating radishes really ? and grandpa , over there , over there ! that s a whale sunning himself in a tree those are sea otters flying about the gleaming carousel is made of abalone and there , grandpa , what s that ? that s the red giant , gouty antares limping out to milk his apatosaurus really ? what does the milk taste like ? like vanilla ice cream smothered in caramel and melted into a thick , sweet soup we descend and dismount carnies bark from booths overflowing with kitsch sorry , son , the poem is over i penned typed this one first thing this morning notice how deafness recurs as a metaphor for me incidentally i stole the title for today 's poem from robinson jeffers i'm trying to loosen up my verse a little but there s always a catch the tradition of parnassian verse , as in homer , virgil , beowulf , spenser , shakespeare ignoring comedies and comedic interludes , milton , wordsworth , shelley , tennyson a type of poetry matthew arnold wrote of as containing high seriousness seems clearly over yet much of the magic of poetry depends upon such high seriousness , since we must take poetry seriously to set up heroic expectations , or even anti heroic expectations see the hollow men by eliot , out , out by frost , or roan stallion by jeffers the moderns could still do high seriousness what am i trying to say ? there must be a point between the conversational voice of billy collins and the often elevated voices of milosz , larkin , yeats and the like i think eliot mixes the conversational with the parnassian better than anyone from gerontion the tiger springs in the new year us he devours think at last we have not reached conclusion , when i stiffen in a rented house think at last i have not made this show purposelessly and it is not by any concitation of the backward devils i would meet you upon this honestly i that was near your heart was removed therefrom italics mine i find the conversational more effective when set up by the serious , the empyrean , or the parnassian , but so few poets can do this change voices in mid stream successfully you have to be very good to do this most of us can only write well employing one voice in reading jane lately , as good as she is , she does n't even attempt this most poets don t again , without form verse libre is impotent without seriousness the conversational becomes banal the necessary dualisms of great writing are in the very nature of writing , just as shakespeare relieves the political machinations of henry iv with falstaff here s a different example of coming from the conversational to a conclusion of high seriousness yeats crazy jane talks with the bishop i met the bishop on the road and much said he and i 'those breasts are flat and fallen now , those veins must soon be dry live in a heavenly mansion , not in some foul sty ' 'fair and foul are near of kin , and fair needs foul , ' i cried 'my friends are gone , but that 's a truth nor grave nor bed denied , learned in bodily lowliness and in the heart 's pride 'a woman can be proud and stiff when on love intent but love has pitched his mansion in the place of excrement for nothing can be sole or whole that has not been rent ' italics mine since first being enamored of poetry , i have been enamored of poetry of power i find plath powerful at times but not collins dylan thomas is powerful , as larkin can be , but walcott rarely milosz can do it , though he is a bit jagged coleridge 's rime must be the most powerful poem ever written in the sense i mean i wrote an essay called power lyrics several years ago in which i tried to develop this theme more clearly , but i doubt i 'll ever explain it properly it 's like what blackwell said about pornography i know it when i see it what is even more powerful is when the poet has the skill to interrupt serious verse with a snatch of the intimately conversational , even ridiculous , or vice versa , which takes us completely by surprise and works despite and because of the momentary jarring of switching inputs if you are confused by these points , it is the fault of the author , not your brain maybe i ll nail the concept another time all for today , ce
