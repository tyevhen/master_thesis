i have my appointment with my orthopedic surgeon tomorrow to see what 's going on with my hip i have not run since the garry bjorklund half marathon in colorado , i was able to climb , and raft , and swim , but every attempt at running felt wrong i had hip pain with every step my therapist asked me today if i was anxious about the appointment the question caught me off guard it was a totally reasonable question , but in that moment i realized i was actually looking forward to the appointment i find it much more stressful not knowing what 's causing my pain in fact , i did n't say this , but i realized i am much more likely to go for a run after my diagnosis regardless of what the diagnosis is ! yup , sounds screwed up and backwards , but hear me out since i do n't know what 's going on now , it 's pretty easy not to run i do n't know what i might be damaging which otherwise could possibly be saved i also do n't know if the damage is already done so why would i continue running on a sore hip ? but once i know exactly what 's happening in that joint , i can make an informed decision about my body i can protect my hip from further damage if the doc tells me doing so would prolong my running career likewise , i can be belligerent and say screw it , if the doc tells me the damage is done and my options are limited i am hoping for the first scenario but expecting the second so it makes sense that my therapist asked the question part of me thinks , why the hell are n't i anxious ? there 's a lot riding on this appointment if my labrum has torn again , i do n't believe a third surgery will be a plausible option that scenario plays out with my running ending and a hip replacement sooner rather than later i am hoping my labrum is not torn , maybe just irritated , which pushes back a hip replacement while my running continues the worst possible scenario would be to come out of tomorrow 's appointment and still not know to return home without an answer would be the worst case scenario ! i guess i am anxious about that possibility !
