this past weekend was the canadian thanksgiving celebrated on the second monday of october , so i wanted to write some type of what i'm especially thankful for post , even though i do n't really consider the holiday all that important , myself , but honestly i was n't feeling all that thankful it 's been a rough few days , with lots of family drama , so the only thing i ended up really feeling thankful for is the fact that i have my family , whom i love dearly , despite it all all up to and including the fact that my father said yesterday that he thinks homeschooling at all was a mistake thanks papa , thanks a lot however , i do n't want to dwell on that , and i do still want to recognize both of the holidays that passed this weekend thanksgiving and columbus day , so i 'll share something for both i wrote this post on a bunch of things i'm grateful for close to this time last year it 's overly soppy , but made me happy to write , and makes me happy re reading it , as well ! and as for columbus day , well , i have a feeling that many of you already know the dark side of columbus , and perhaps are also rather disgusted that there 's a holiday celebrating a genocidal slave trader firstly , this article is simply a long excerpt from howard zinn 's a peoples history of the united states , which starts with stuff specifically about columbus also , this post gives ten reasons to not celebrate columbus day i'm thinking lots , trying to figure things out in a slightly different way from the way i have been trying to figure certain things out , and just generally have a lot going on in my head as i start to get those things a bit more straightened out , they 'll probably make it onto this blog ! peace , idzie you might also like thanksgiving gratefulness a year in posts christmas ' linkwithin
