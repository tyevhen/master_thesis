we have to keep elbowing depression anxiety angst despair or whatever you call it out of our life and we have to find an uptick wherever we can this morning i woke up in the old dark pit as usual i picked some dumb phrase to thoughtjam it while i got up , made my bed , got on my inversion table for ten minutes while letting the the hot water run in the tub for my bath after i swam but before i swam i took out the recycles , walked the dogs , checked on a leak in the irrigation system , took the book boxes out of the car since i did a booksigning this weekend my husband helped me , asked my husband to get out the blower so i could blow off the patiowhich i would do later then i took off the pool cover i just kept doing one small task after another which is why i can t remember the dumb phrase i picked for thoughtjamming pretty soon my brain turned completely off the phrase because it had to keep up with all my little tasks which i made sure i was concentrating on as i did them otherwise i know that sneaky mind of mine might try to dump me in the pit again i never forget that the mind can only concentrate on one thought at a time and the brain always follows the direction of its most current dominant thought i keep a pool cover on the pool to save the water from evaporating since we have a drought here in california and , as i said , i have other leaks in my yard then i swam my laps and during that time i had no thoughts except keeping count of my laps one , one , i ve just begun , two two , zip de do and so on i always feel virtuous for doing laps but that doesn t mean i want to do when i finished my laps , i started to pull the cover back over the pool before i got out and was surprised that it seemed more difficult than usual wasn t i doing enough weight lifting ? not that i do all that much but i do some by the time the pool was half covered , i realized that the reason it was so hard was that one of my large german shepherd dogs had been sleeping on the cover and was enjoying the ride i laughed the joke was on me then because i m always looking for possibilities to raise my mood in the morning i decided to really laugh hey , thanks for the joke , god i went in and told my husband about the dog we both had a good laugh now i m feeling good again sorry depression , no room for you this morning see you tomorrow or whenever
