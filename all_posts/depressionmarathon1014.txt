which comes first , the heavy fatigue or the sliding mood ? am i feeling lower because my energy has plummeted ? or has my energy plummeted because i'm feeling lower ? which came first ? does one cause the other ? is the low energy responsible for the falling mood ? is the falling mood causing the low energy ? or are these simultaneous occurrences , each a bit part of a much larger scene ? is the depression back after a long reprieve ? or did i simply over extend ? twenty miles carrying bricks am i simply tired ? or were these enough to start a tailspin ? is this a tailspin ? perhaps it 's too soon for that
