pictures must not be too picturesque ralph waldo emerson knives was painted in my final year at sheridan college our assignment was to do a still life painting classmates and friends assembled all sorts of interesting things together for their projects there were vases and fruit , clothing and shoes , action figures even appeared in one or two paintings i wanted to paint something that interested me as well something that would be fun and challenging to render i decided to paint my knife collection my grandfather collected knives and you can see some of his collection in the painting grandmother with knives my father also had a small collection of knives and i had built up my own collection too in fact the straight razor was my father 's from when he was a teenager and there is one of my throwing knives in there too my friend scott lent me his katana to complete the grouping i lay out the knives on a white sheet to best show their form and contrast and away i went looking at this painting now i realize how differently i applied the medium back then there are still some similarities of technique but i do paint more expressively now , with more evident brushstrokes and almost no blending on the canvas , as i had done in the knives painting it is all about learning what works best for you , how you best accomplish your goal of rendering a subject matter to your satisfaction i enjoyed trying to capture the craftsmanship in each knife i like how each knife has its own story , its own maker who took pride in its creation , its own travels that had brought it to my studio this is one of my favorite paintings for the reason that i have a connection with these objects , have held them in my hands and studied each one they are works of art in and of themselves it serves a good purpose i believe to look back at older works that you have done , to re asses your technique and see where you have come from academically , intellectually and emotionally through simple observation you can mark your progress and see areas where you might improve i do occasionally still paint still life subject matter , for they have as much of a story as a person does , in many ways in fact , commonplace objects can reflect so much about a person again , objects are just that objects however they can also be much more than that it is energy and emotion , nostalgia and attachment that we place upon these things that imbue them with a greater sense of their place in the world painting should never look as if it were done with difficulty , however difficult it may actually have been robert henri
