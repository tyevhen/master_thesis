i'm continuing to put one foot in front of the other today i'm keeping it simple and focusing on each moment i worked a few hours , napped , ran miles , and napped again the fatigue is frustrating , but at least i'm still moving forward and accomplishing what i need to accomplish i had a long weekend alone complete with a dip in my mood i should n't spend so much time alone , and i know that , but it still takes a maximum amount of energy for me to get out and socialize , so i often do n't i did n't expend the energy over the weekend , and i paid for it with a slow descent of my mood my mood was still a little low when i awoke this morning , but being around people , working and running all helped i'm glad , actually , that i did have to work this morning it forced me to get up , shower , and get out of the house i needed that and that 's all i have to report today i'm looking forward to a simple , quiet evening with jet he makes me smile and laugh , and that 's always helpful do n't know what i 'd do without him
