it 's amazing how many people have the intense fear that if people really knew who they were , people would n't like them see my article learning to feel comfortable with yourself overcoming the fear that people wo n't like you if they knew the real you in my psychotherapy private practice in nyc , over the years , many clients , both men and women , have come to therapy because they feel they 're defective in one way or another although their fears that others wo n't like them if their real self became evident is projection of how they feel about themselves , before they recognize this , this fear feels very real and , unfortunately , they live their lives as if it is true many of these therapy clients feel that they 're hiding this part of themselves from others and it makes them feel unhappy and inauthentic although there are many reasons why people have this fear , it 's often rooted in unconscious issues from their early childhood it 's very painful to feel that you 're hiding some aspect of yourself that 's defective and that others would shun you if they knew about it for many people who feel this way , they think they have to put on a facade for others , which is not only emotionally , mentally and physically draining , it also makes them feel inauthentic , which exacerbates the problem let 's take a look at an example of this phenomenon , which , as always , is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality nina when nina , who was in her mid s , began therapy , she felt like she was almost to the point of exhaustion in her interactions with the people in her life overcoming the fear that people wo n't like you if they knew the real you in order to always seem like she was positive and engaging , she tended to people please most of the time in order to do this , she tended to acquiesce to most of the demands that friends and coworkers placed on her so that they would think she was nice nina felt she had to people please so people would n't know she was defective often , these demands would be at the expense of nina 's time , energy and finances that she needed for herself but , no matter she wanted to others to see her as being kind and generous all of the time so , it was very rare for nina to say no to the people in her life , unless she was sick and , physically , she just could n't do even when people were n't making demands and most of them were n't , nina would go out of way to be extra helpful and extra kind as we talked about this dynamic , it became apparent that , although she was , in fact , a kind and generous person , she was also defensively fending off any possibility that these people would see her as anything but kind and generous by going above and beyond in her interactions with others the emotional risk for her if she did n't engage in this dynamic was that if they did n't see her as being always kind and generous , they would , instead , discover that she was really a 'fraud , which is how she felt about herself and , more than anything , she wanted to avoid this as we continued to explore her dynamic with the people in her life , nina realized that she could n't go on doing this because she would wear herself out and all this focus on others and not enough on herself was making her feel emotionally depleted and deprived nina came to realize that there was a lot more going on for her emotionally under the surface than she ever realized before she came to therapy and , given her fear of being defective , exploring this dynamic in therapy was a big challenge for nina as with any client in therapy , we had to proceed at a pace that she could tolerate if not , nina would be emotionally overwhelmed and might drop out of therapy rather than work through this issue her ambivalence about exploring the underlying issues in therapy was strong for instance , sometimes , especially in the beginning stage of therapy , she would forget to come to therapy and when i contacted her , she would be surprised that she missed our session it was less of a challenge of her to pay for the broken appointment , which she already knew was my policy , than to appear for the session and deal with the underlying issues but , over time , nina and i worked together to develop the kind of therapeutic rapport that is necessary to work on these kinds of issues when she felt she could trust me and trust our work together , we began to make connections between her family history of growing up with highly critical and punitive parents and how this history affected her sense of self of course , just knowing this is n't enough to change the kind of people pleasing dynamic that nina was engaged in we had to work through the original childhood trauma , which took time and then , nine had to stop trying to ingratiate herself with the people in her life in order to fend off what she saw as the possibility that they would see she was defective in our work together , i helped nina to separate her life as a child from her life as an adult see my articles working through emotional trauma learning to separate then from now overcoming trauma when the past is in the present only when she was able to develop an awareness of the dynamic she was engaging in by people pleasing , work through her emotional trauma and learn to interact in a healthier way with others , was she able to have healthier relationships of course , there were some people who were accustomed to nina being willing to bend over backwards for them , and they did n't like this change in her , at first this was especially hard for nina there were times when she reverted to her old behavior to fend off these people 's disapproval over time , she was able to catch herself before she reverted to her old people pleasing behavior but a surprising number of her friends and coworkers told her that they sensed a change in her they felt she was more present and authentic with them , which they really liked some of them even told her that they much preferred this way than when she was that she was overly solicitous and self sacrificing , as she was before , because it made them feel uncomfortable this made nina feel happy , and it helped to reinforce her new dynamic with the people in her life overcoming the fear that people wo n't like you if they knew the real you over time , she also learned to choose people who would n't expect her to be so self sacrificing , and she eventually let go of the existing people who could n't accept the positive change in her getting help in therapy the example that i gave in the scenario above is one of many possible dynamics that people engage in when they feel that people would n't like them if they knew the so called real person who is defective getting help in therapy aside from people pleasing , there are many other dynamics that people who have this fear engage in to compensate for their feelings of low self worth if you recognize yourself in the composite vignette above , rather than continuing to suffer on your own , you could benefit from getting help from a licensed mental health professional who
