shakespeare said of a man who seemed all repressed and unfeeling , that man hath no music in him how true it is because music lies down in the limbic system and if you cut off the top level cortex you can still respond to music and feeling you wonder why we remember songs from our youth and still know the words ? because we still did not have a fully functioning , repressive neocortex because we still responded to the music out there and in us there was music in us until it got crushed out it was feelings that sealed in our memories of the music and words , and they meant a lot to us , expressing our lives at the time it all lies down below our later development which covered over the essentials , the guts of our lives then was when our emotions were strong , everything was new , including love our reactions were strong , often exaggerated but they engulfed us and gave big meaning to our experiences some keep that music alive , keep the access to feelings , while others let the music die and lose access having to struggle in life , with children , with job or school all help dampen our music and as time goes on we listen less and less to it , outside and in , particular , inside music helps keep our feelings alive , and vice versa they are companions in life we can tell who has that music still there are those with no warmth , no kindness , no concern nor empathy who understand so much and feel nothing and it shows in their demeanor in their dry unemotional relationships , in their lack of perception of the feelings in others it is a solipsistic world for them in the absence of music they relate to themselves bereft of song and harmony they have no sense of emotional harmony in the way they relate , dress , furnish and make choices their friends are also bereft and are chosen for that manqu their philosophies of child rearing their weltanschaaung are similar because they hear the words but not the music they can t dance but they move to the unseen and unheard music of their lives beware a president who can t dance we need a human president just as we need a human parent someone may move too fast to that unheard music and therefore does not take the time with his thoughts and decisions nor do we want someone who dances too slow and who cannot make up his mind we need something between a waltz and rock and roll
