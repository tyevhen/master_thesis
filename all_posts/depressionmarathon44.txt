fight it , my friend exclaimed i had just told her how i was feeling nobody , especially my close friends , wants to see me slide into the abyss once again it 's too dark the road back is too steep and so distant certainly i'm not at all interested in visiting that space again , but i fear it 's on the way fight it , i scream to myself ! fight it ! simple but is that all there is to it ? those of us who know , know it 's certainly not as simple as that in the best of times , it 's not as simple as that that 's the myth fight and depression will relent peace , serenity and happiness will reign that 's the cruel , believable myth and that 's in the best of times but that 's not depression in depression 's advantageous times , times like this , of injury or illness , when everything i typically use to cope , everything which brings me joy , and meaning , and purpose battling depression is definitely not as simple as , fight it ! when removed from my joyful , meaningful , and purposeful activities , fighting is an uphill battle on a peg leg with one arm tied behind my back it does n't work i flail , and fall flat , and suffocate in the mud yesterday was rough in my analysis , i realized this injury has disconnected me from everything i hold dear my coping mechanisms , my life , are so distant they feel lost i'm spending many , many hours alone i 've been disconnected from the very things which not only allow me to battle depression , but also allow me to be me working running biking hiking playing traveling and taking care of my responsibilities i'm on my own , which normally would be fine , but there 's only so much or in this case so little i can do on my own right now it 's no wonder i 've been sinking my friend 's words keep ringing in my ears fight it ! no , it 's not that simple , but maybe i can do more than i 've been doing maybe i 've been too willing to wallow in what i ca n't do rather than what i can i'm not a fan of self pity if depression is going to take me down , and i'm not saying it will , i at least need to battle no matter my infirmities i 've got to fight
