i 've been awake nights worrying about saying the perfect thing i invited all of my professional treatment team to my cake night tonight see previous post , and almost all of them are going to be there now i'm worried about what to say i want them to know how important they were , and still are , in my recovery i feel so strongly my gratitude is so great i do n't want to leave any words on the table but i'm realizing there 's no way to say exactly what i feel i 'll never be able to say enough webster does n't contain words powerful enough to convey my feelings so there 's about an hour to go before cake night , and i 've now got three pages of various versions of things to say yet i think i may throw it all away once i hit the podium none of it is good enough i 'll let you know what happens i had a busy day today i began the day with a am breakfast with a bunch of runners at my friend renee 's house renee is a famous cook extraordinaire , so of course everything was delicious ! i attended my am aa meeting where i got to see my sponsee get her month sobriety chip that was cool then renee joined me on my last long run , miles , before the austin marathon it was a warm day and a good run after that i rushed to a nearby town to get my haircut i did n't want to look shaggy for tonight 's big event after cake night tonight , we plan to go out for pie i love pie ! and that will be a great finish to a busy day it started with food with one crowd , and it 's going to end with food with another crowd i feel incredibly blessed i am so lucky to be surrounded by so many wonderful people today i'm grateful for all of the people in my life hmmm maybe that 's all that needs to be said
