are you a woman who usually falls for men who are considered so called bad boys and neither you nor your friends understand why these guys are so irresistible to you ? what makes so called bad boys so irresistible to many women ? it 's seems counterintuitive women who are usually stable and responsible fall for bad boys often , it seems completely counterintuitive because the woman who falls for bad boys is often the woman who is the most stable , responsible and kind person who never gets into trouble herself , but who falls in love with guys who are edgy , constantly in trouble , emotionally and sometimes physically abusive , and constantly breaking her heart just a note before i go on i'm using the phrase bad boys as a shorthand expression that most people understand without having to go into a lot of detail but , in fact , i have a lot of empathy for these men , who often have a long history of trauma , and underneath that tough exterior , there 's often a lot of fear and shame of course , working with them as a psychotherapist is different from being in a romantic relationship or married to them and in a lot of emotional pain why are so many women drawn to bad boys ? there can be as many reasons as there are women who fall for guys who have a reputation for being bad some psychotherapists believe that women who are drawn to bad boys are working through unresolved trauma from their family history , especially if they had a father who was unreliable , irresponsible , and emotionally abusive other psychotherapists believe that this dynamic involves a woman 's need to rescue the man , who is often traumatized and in need of a lot of emotional support other therapists believe that women in these types of relationships are masochistic what makes so called bad boys so irresistible to many women ? all of the above theories , either individually or in combination , might apply to some women sometimes , but it often does n't explain this dynamic for many women who had loving , stable fathers and who are not masochistic or in need of rescuing most people the brain reward circuit and an irresistible attraction to bad boys another interesting theory , proposed by richard a friedman , md , in his article , i heart unpredictable love ny times is that this type of attraction involves the brain reward circuit see link below for the article according to dr friedman , the brain reward circuit is a primitive part of the brain that is exquisitely attuned to rewards , whether they are rewards of money , sex , or food when the reward is unanticipated , the circuit releases dopamine which gives the person a pleasurable and exciting feeling unpredictable love and the brain reward circuit as a result , when you 're involved with someone who is unpredictable , as so called bad boys tend to be , you get a sense of pleasure and excitement from the brain reward circuit this , in turn , fuels your attraction and obsession , from the brain reward circuit it can feel like an addiction in much the same way that people who gamble compulsively feel addicted to gambling the difference is that you 're gambling with the unpredictable nature of the relationship as well as your own well being often , you 're unaware of this sense of pleasure and excitement that 's being generated by the brain reward circuit in fact , your rational mind might be telling you that this guy is n't at all good for you and you should stay away but when the brain reward circuit is releasing the dopamine , you might find yourself with this bad boy despite what you know rationally does this mean that you 'll always be attracted to bad boys for the rest of your life ? i 've worked with many women who found themselves irresistibly drawn to so called bad boys and who were able to overcome this problem unfortunately , for some women , it takes a lot of emotional pain before they change unfortunately , for some women , it often takes a lot of emotional pain before they override their brain chemistry to make healthy choices for themselves but just because you feel a sense of pleasure and excitement does n't mean that you ca n't make healthy decisions for yourself you can getting help relationships with bad boys can take its toll on you physically , mentally , emotionally and spiritually that 's a high price to pay and many women discover that , after being in a few of these types of relationships , they are n't as emotionally resilient as they used to be and it gets harder to move on if you have tried on your own to stop getting in emotionally unhealthy relationships , but you ca n't do it on your own , you could benefit from getting help from a licensed mental health professional if you 're motivated to change , you can learn how to override the impulse to get involved with men who are constantly hurting you i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com also , read my blog article the heartbreak of the on again off again relationship i heart unpredictable love by richard a friedman new york times photo credit saad faruque via photopin cc photo credit pamela machado via photopin cc
