for years i have been discussing limbic fear versus brainstem terror that is , as we go deeper in the brain the responses become more exaggerated mild hopelessness becomes suicidal hopelessness , fear becomes terror , anger becomes rage , and on the responses become more primitive as they emanate from a brain that is more primitive older and pre human those deep responses go way back in time to when they were the reigning animal reactions extant that brain is still alive inside of us and it provides all of the responses that existed millions of years ago in some respects we are still that alligator or shark with no pity or remorse , just instinct those primitive animals are pre emotion before caring and concern existed they do allow us to murder they also permit panic attacks and where do those attacks come from ? ah they seem to come from a brain where panic is life saving where rapid and ferocious responses meant survival and where someone overwhelmed by his brainstem can react exactly like the alligator does and kill he is acting out of his brainstem the panic victim feels threatened but he does n't know what he is afraid of or , believe it or not , that he is even afraid it sometimes does n't feel like fear it is some unknown feeling that seems so alien i know what he is afraid of whatever lies in his brainstem oh my , what might that be ? that is the rub as my friend old willie shakespeare noted when i was in graduate school i learned about antecedent consequent reactions all it meant was that if there is a response something caused it well in rage and terror something causes it and it is not ordinary reactions they are primitive in the full meaning of the term so far we have not known what that meant stay with me now as it starts to get interesting what is clear in my writing is that there are three brains in our head , the triune brain , but we have ignored the first one , that i call first line in the first line lies all of those primitive reactions when there is trauma at birth or during gestation , long before we have an an intact emotional brain , our reactions are coded and stored down on the first line , the brainstem and the ancient parts of the limbic system when we suffer great trauma during those early times the gating system weakens and we have leaky gates the trauma causes us to use up major supplies of repressive chemicals , such as serotonin , that impairs the proper functioning of the repressive gates our defense system not only does trauma use up serotonin it damages parts of the brain that produce it , as well as dopamine and epinephrine this is especially true of smoking mothers , in my experience we are less defended , so when we arrive at age thirty with a panic attack it is such a mystery no longer , we can now understand its provenance it comes out of a remote nervous system , so remote as to be constantly ignored , yet it is responsible for so much of our aberrant behavior who would dream that inside us lies all those primitive instincts that can surge forth when our defenses weaken ? and up comes terror from a carrying mother who smoked and drank and who was effectively killing or damaging the baby from diminished oxygen that and many other configurations conspire to inculcate terror in the baby that is imprinted and sealed in as a primal memory when there is a panic attack or rage attack we must look to that brain for understanding and cure it is only with that brain that we can find causes and answers and the cure involves reliving , as i have explained at length in my books and blog articles if you all are interested i will go over it again but i think blog articles ago i discussed in how to make a cure now comes the fascinating part some recent research by justin feinstein at the university of iowa city nature neuroscience , did a study with those who had a damaged amygdala , the hub of the emotional system they did not have normal fear responses but if oxygen supplies were lowered and carbon dioxide supplies were increased , mimicking suffocation increasing acidity of the blood there were panic attacks where in the world did those attacks come from ? certainly not from the usual emotional structures they believe it includes the brainstem ! because the lowering of oxygen supplies and adding carbon dioxide provoked the lower structures to sense the danger and reacted appropriately very much like what happens to a fetus when the mother smokes during pregnancy and produces those same effects what all this means is what i have been writing about for decades fear and terror are two different reactions involving different brain structures emanating from structures million of years apart in evolution however the emotional reactions have some similarities which allows resonance that is , enough fear can travel down in the brain and trigger off those primitive panic terror responses that i call first line it is not ordinary fear it means a life endangering cause and that come from our time in the womb and at birth in the experimental patients , it meant and means terror of dying that is what it feels like to the sufferer because that is exactly what it is in the memory he is dying and the fear it evokes has a reason a reason that is knowable and therefore explains the reaction and once known can lead to understanding about first line and a cure if all this is ignored there will never be a cure , no matter what the technique use to treat it it is interesting that suffocation has such a great terror reaction associated with it and not so oddly in the panic attack there is often a feeling of suffocation , cannot catch one 's breath , the heart beating so fast that it is about to jump out of the chest and these breathing problems are again brainstem originated included the medulla of the brainstem it is all an ensemble of reactions originating deep down that later on set the stage for many kinds of pulmonary problems , asthma , shallow breathing and other malfunctions one other part of this reaction is that there may be a certain vulnerability for the suffocation feeling during birth that is , if a mother smoked during pregnancy there is already a groundwork for the suffocation feeling at birth it becomes compounded , the anesthesia at birth in the mother and the background of a smoking mother we must keep in mind that this is all an imprint from the beginning of life that will affect so many parts of us including constant nightmares again where one cannot catch one 's breath a nightmare of being in a dark room with no air or someone putting a pillow on our head it is fine to treat the nightmare , even to drug or medicate it but we cannot medicate an imprint that remains to go on causing damage so nightmares , panic attacks , breathing problems pulmonary dysfunction are all part of an ensemble , a gestalt , if you will that must be considered as one problem , not many many problems yes , there are many , many symptoms each must be treated until until we go to the generating source where it is all treated at once and permanently what we must understand is that the physiology memory comes up intact with the whole panoply of feelings there is often too much terror to feel it all at once and integrate it that is why it needs to be revisited time and again so how does the patient know where it comes from ? often not at first but after many relivings it becomes comprehensible clearly it is so remote an experience that it can be experienced but not immediately understood for what it is it is the same when reliving a gestational trauma we can experience it long before we understand it , and experiencing it is crucial for integration non verbal experiences can be relived and experienced on their own terms and in their own way they can be integrated , nevertheless let me explain further there are times when a patient can remember when his dog died , being hit by a car what needed to be experienced and expressed was the repressed emotional aspect of the experience the pain needs to be unleashed and finally felt it is the same with preverbal pains they need to be unleashed from their biologic constraints and fully experienced they then are integrated and become part of us that is the essence of a primal we don t have to know exactly where it comes from because the fetus did not but he experienced it and repressed the pain it needs liberating it is what we do to reiterate because it is now established that lowered oxygen levels in the fetus creates panic in him , it should be clear that a carrying mother who smokes is damaging the baby severely can he really feel terror ? i recommend to you the work of k anand he did an amniocentesis on fetuses and found as the probe invaded fetal space all of his stress hormones rose he also grimaced and show signs of distress he felt pain and terror we have successfully treated panic attacks they are anxiety attacks , and they are terror attacks and rage because we address the first line it is not a mystery it just belongs to an ancient brain system that we have ignored for too long if we want to help those in danger of acting out in rage and to help those who suffer panic we must travel to millions of years of phylogenetic history , deep in the brain to find our answers
