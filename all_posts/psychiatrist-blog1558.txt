i thought roy was going to write about the psychiatrist drug rep who wrote about his year of selling his soul in today 's new york times magazine apparently roy went shopping , and then he got eaten by a leopard is that the new apple thing ? in dr drug rep , daniel carlat , a psychiatrist in newburyport , mass , talks about the year he worked for wyeth pharmaceuticals he visited the offices of primary care physicians and talked about the wonders of effexor he describes his ambivalence and conflicts the money he made was good oh , never mind , the money was great he was getting up to an hour to talk to docs over lunch but he felt like he was minimizing the risk of hypertension and withdrawal symptoms dr carlat writes i wrestled with how to handle this issue in my effexor talks , since i believed it was a significant disadvantage of the drug psychiatrists frequently have to switch medications because of side effects or lack of effectiveness , and anticipating this potential need to change medications plays into our initial choice of a drug knowing that effexor was hard to give up made me think twice about prescribing it in the first place during my talks , i found myself playing both sides of the issue , making sure to mention that withdrawal symptoms could be severe but assuring doctors that they could usually be avoided was i lying ? not really , since there were no solid published data , and indeed some patients had little problem coming off effexor but was i tweaking and pruning the truth in order to stay positive about the product ? definitely and how did i rationalize this ? i convinced myself that i had told most of the truth and that the potential negative consequences of this small truth gap were too trivial to worry about and on another note , clinkshrink mentioned to me tonight that writing does n't come easily to her huh ? ! some words of encouragement anyone ? and roy , quicker on the uptake here ! hope you enjoy the new purchases i hope you do n't mind that i stole your topic
