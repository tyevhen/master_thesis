every story needs an antagonist there has to be some kind of force that works against the protagonist , preventing her from reaching her noble and lofty goal until the story 's epic climax an antagonist can be a person , a circumstance , a force of nature , an oppressive society , a hungry bear , a glittering vampire , a tornado full of sharks , or any other unpleasant thing you can think of to throw at a character , but without an antagonist present , all you have is a plotless mess of aimless wandering and banal , asinine navel gazing from a self absorbed protagonist and really , who would publish such a thing ? the best kind of antagonist , in my not so humble opinion , is a villain it 's all well and fine to have your hero struggle with poverty , or morality , or a crotch rot disease previously unknown to science , but there 's just something indescribably delightful about packing all the world 's evils into one kick able , punch able , flammable human being every great franchise has a great villain harry potter has voldemort the lion king has scar the avengers has loki star wars has darth vader game of thrones has an inbred , mouthbreathing sociopath with a face that screams please bludgeon me to death with my own foot and feed my remains to the dragons but with so many great villains running around , stealing from orphans and kicking puppies , who should claim the title as 'greatest villain ever' ? i 'd cast my vote assuming such a title was awarded democratically for princess mononoke 's lady eboshi seen here using her ponytail as bangs , for some reason for those of you who are n't familiar with late s feature length anime movies , princess mononoke is the guilt tastic story of a forest in danger , a greedy mining corporation putting said forest in danger , and an exiled prince who would very much like not to die from his arm rotting curse specifically , the story is about askitaka , a young prince whose reign is cut short when he attempts to save his village from a demon giant angry thing made of worms , and gets himself infected with a curse for his troubles closer examination of the dead demon reveals that it was actually a boar god driven to infectious insanity by corruption from an iron ball lodged in his side unfortunately for ashitaka , the boar 's curse is fatal , and will take over his entire body at some indeterminate point in the future on the upside , while he waits to die a horrible , writhing death , ashitaka also gets to enjoy some nifty , demon strength fighting powers it made sense in the movie what happens when you shoot a boar with an iron pellet , apparently naturally , askitaka 's villagers are extremely grateful to him for saving their lives , and they all vow to ensure that his final days are as comfortable as they can possibly be oh , no , just kidding that does n't happen at all they just cast him out of the village to wander around until he dies at some point on his aimless quest for death , ashitaka learns that the great forest spirit has the ability to cure him , and he takes off into the woods to search for him in the process , he stumbles across irontown , an oh so subtly named settlement devoted to the extraction and processing of iron since they are n't living in 'treetown' , or 'happy organic crunchy quinoa earth hugging commune' , the residents of irontown spend their days clear cutting forests so they get at more of that sweet , sweet iron naturally , the forest gods are n't exactly thrilled about this as a cunning , last ditch effort to save their homes and their lives , they send a random feral teenage girl into irontown to assassinate the town 's leader , lady eboshi nature 's last hope , seen here marveling over a shiny object since the movie is more than ten minutes long , san the wolf girl 's efforts to assassinate lady eboshi fail miserably in retaliation , lady eboshi just continues the clear cutting and profiteering that she 's known and loved for , recklessly murdering enormous swaths of forest in the name of the almighty dollar if you 've ever paid attention to world news , or if you 've ever noticed that most able bodied adults are not frequently at home between the hours of nine a m and five p m , you might recognize this system as 'capitalism' this cartoon will explain everything so why , exactly , is lady eboshi so concerned with aggressively expanding her profits ? was her entire family murdered by trees ? what does she plan to do with the money ? is she building herself a fortress ? hiring an evil army ? saving up to purchase herself a set of fancy clip on bangs ? of course not ! she 's up to something far more sinister you see , lady eboshi uses the money she earns from raping mother earth to care for the lepers and former prostitutes that she takes in and provides for in fact , the lepers she cares for are so grateful for being treated like human beings , that they engineer super weapons to help her shoot forest gods right in their tree hugging faces everywhere ashitaka goes in irontown , residents sing her praises and hint at the unimaginable horrors they faced before lady eboshi saved the day the villainous lady eboshi , seen here with the disadvantaged women she single handedly rescued from a life of sex slavery and that 's what makes lady eboshi such a great antagonist do n't mistake her for a cuddly humanitarian it was lady eboshi herself who lodged a bullet in that boar demon , and she 's not particularly remorseful about what it did to ashitaka she 's blunt , she abrasive , and she commits environmental crimes that would make the lorax hang himself , but there 's no way to beat her if ashitaka and wolf girl choose to obliterate her , the hundreds of lepers and disadvantaged women she 's rescued will starve to death , turning ashitaka himself into the great villain of the story if , however , ashitaka chooses to stand by the iron lady 's leper and whore resort , he 'll guarantee himself an early death when lady eboshi slaughters his only chance for survival oh , did i mention that lady eboshi is planning to behead the great forest spirit ? because she 's planning to behead the great forest spirit in fairness , if you ran into this thing in the deep woods , you 'd probably behead it too everything lady eboshi does , right down to lopping off the head of the almighty red faced deer himself , is done to directly benefit the people she cares about yes , all villains have to have some sort of motive , but in that regard , an awful lot of other antagonists are on pretty shaky ground the joker is evil because he 's , uh , a disenchanted lunatic , i guess king joffrey is evil because inbreeding , maybe ? even the struggle between luke skywalker and darth vader , the good and evil struggle by which all other good and evil struggles are compared , can be summed up as something , something , dark side apparently the death star 's employee benefits package does n't cover visits to a dermatologist this is n't a case of a well meaning , but incompetent , ruler accidentally causing mayhem , either lady eboshi knows what she 's doing , and she 's damn good at it too if someone needs to be thrown under the bus so that her goals can be met , she 'll drive the bus over them herself , and save three dozen lives by doing so as a character , she 's a rich soup of villainous intent , heroic outcomes , and enough realistic utilitarianism to make everyone watching feel uncomfortable and ashamed you want her to die , but you do n't you want her to stop her assault on the planet , but she ca n't you want there to be some hero out there , ready to step in and save the day , but she 's the best they 've got if you 're so bad at governing that you make the rains dry up and the sun burn out , you may want to consider an alternative career path as much as i hate to spoil the ending of a sixteen year old children 's movie , as it turns out , there really is no way to defeat lady eboshi she gets the happiest ending that we can ever expect to get out of our own forest pillaging industries she recognizes that she 's perhaps doing a bit more environmental damage than is strictly necessary , gives the great forest spirit his severed head back , and promises to do better in the future does she completely cease her mindless capitalism and replace iron mining with tree planting and flute playing ? of course not she still has leprosy riddled mouths to feed on his part , prince ashitaka chooses to stay in irontown and help rebuild a better , more sustainable city , making lady eboshi the only antagonist whose the villain stays in power outcome is considered a happily ever after ending who is your favourite antagonist of all time ?
