the other day i was shocked to encounter a blatantly false headline at the independent , supposedly a mainstream news site the headline was obama turns decision on military action over to congress obama has not turned over any decision making to congress on the syria issue if you read the transcript of what he said , it 's pretty clear that the decision has already been made obama is merely seeking congressional agreement with the decision that 's been made , agreement he does n't technically need there is ample legal precedent for a president ordering military strikes unilaterally obama orders drone strikes all the time and that is not binding , one way or the other , in any case i see this kind of sloppy reporting all the time and it makes me sad for the current state and future of journalism , but it also makes me wonder how many sloppy thinkers there are in the world who do n't even know they 're sloppy thinkers in the end , it makes me wish more people would take the time to learn a little programming programming skills have practical value on their own , of course but the real value of programming goes beyond bits and bytes the real value is in how it changes your thinking it 's a subtle shift subtle , yet profound one of many things programming teaches is precision of thought digital devices are , at root , incredibly stupid as picasso famously said , computers are useless they can only give you answers they can only do what they 're told when you take command of the machine by writing code , you find out how true this is if you declare a variable as a string and try to use it as a number , the world comes to a halt it 's necessary to define what you 're doing , explicitly the machine is obedient but mindless it can only do what you tell it programming gives you a new vocabulary , which inevitably brings new ways of thinking read korzybski to grok the depth of this you gain not just a vocabulary of words which , in itself , would be rather trivial but a conceptual vocabulary as a side effect , you begin to think more crisply it 's not simply a matter of thinking more logically it 's far deeper than that programming languages have extremely well defined semantics attention to semantics is what good writing not just good programming is about consequently , anyone who learns a programming language any programming language will find himself or herself in better control of the written word generally learning a programming language inevitably also brings a need to learn a bit about computer science algorithms , machine design , language design , the nature and limits of computability again , conceptual vocabulary ways of framing problems ways of framing discussions about problems eventually , after you immerse yourself in programming , you begin to see there 's an aesthetic to code code itself , not just the things code can create such as user interfaces there 's correct code there 's good code there 's crufty code , there 's spaghetti code , there 's clever code you quickly begin to develop an appreciation for best practices again , an important part of your new conceptual vocabulary another thing programming teaches is humility there will be days when you 're absolutely certain your code is correct , and yet it 's demonstrably not you will learn that sometimes the things you think are absolutely certain , are n't that by itself is valuable you 'll create bugs out of necessity , you will teach yourself ingenious ways to force the machine to tell you what you did wrong and you will do many things wrong but always , you will find you did them for a reason and yet there 's a reason they 're wrong remember , the machine ca n't go wrong on its own it 's unable to do anything except what you tell it to do i can go on listing reasons why programming is not a narrow , arcane skill the truth is it 's a path to understanding it broadens not narrows you as a human being that 's how it is with learning any new language even a programming language it 's been shown that learning a new language brings about structural changes in the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus , and may delay alzheimer 's i think it 's likely your brain also changes when you learn a programming language programming teaches attention to detail , clarity of expression , crispness of meaning certainly , anyone planning to be a journalist or a writer of any kind should consider learning a programming language it might prevent you from writing sloppy headlines in your first real journalism job
