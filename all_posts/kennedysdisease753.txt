many of my friends and family believe i accept living with kennedy s disease better than most i m not so certain about that i know of many men that are well centered and accepting perhaps we just hide it better than others do or , we aren t smart enough to understand what is happening whatever the reason , i m comfortable being this way i have my down days i still wonder what the future has in store for me probably the only difference is that i don t dwell on these thoughts i am too busy living to wallow in the muck of uncertainty meditation helps put things in perspective there is something called noting that works for me whenever i find myself dwelling on a thought , i notice it acknowledge it , apply a label to it oh , that s a fear of what might happen to me , and move on i don t study it or try to understand it i just notice the thought and then discard it by refocusing on my breathing if i tell myself to forget it , or force myself to think of something else , it won t work but , by just acknowledging the thought and then refocusing on my breath , it no longer is important and stops nagging me i also have a couple of good hobbies and social events that allow me to focus on something productive if i m engaged in an activity or a conversation , negativity can t seem to wedge its way into my thoughts i ll give you an example of a recent event at the beginning of the year , i was in a long slide that had me concerned if things didn t change , my daily life would be transformed and not in a positive way after a couple of days of wallowing , i noted it , and then refocused almost immediately , my thoughts redirected to what i could do and what has helped in the past i gradually worked my way through the issue and am better now stronger than before i started we are all human we have concerns and fears however , that doesn t mean they have to control our lives
