i think i have esp last week , i was thinking about a patient i had n't seen in a couple of months , and he called , just as i was thinking about him it 's happened before with this patient today , i was walking to my car where i 'd left my cell phone , unsubmergered , and i started to think about a patient i have n't seen or thought about in some time i 've been treating her for over ten years , and issues of age and health have made it hard for her to get in to see me it 's been a year , maybe more , but every once in a while , she surfaces so i'm thinking about her , wondering how she is , and i get to my car and there 's a voicemail from her sort of eerie i have esp what i do n't understand is the whole shrinkrap with bacon thing on our sidebar i guess roy did this why does anyone want bacon with our blog ? it 's just sort of weird he could n't have put ducks up ? and for a final thought my husband is leaving on a jet plane he texted to say there is a comfort dog in the next row i ca n't wait to hear how the flight goes thanks to everyone who 's commented on our pre draft of a chapter i like the diversity of opinions and to anyone who thinks their middle schooler might get something out of it , that would be wonderful ! i 'll get a photo in later let me know if you have any special requests
