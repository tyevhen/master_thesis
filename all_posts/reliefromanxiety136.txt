i write everything in my journals from poems , wordly thoughts , struggles and special moments it 's always on hand so i can write something down if i need to and once i have , i feel a whole lot better people always say that if you 're worrying about something , you should write it down and although it does n't solve the problem completely , it sure does help along with a cup of tea ! suffering with anxiety often means that i feel a loss of control and by writing what i'm thinking down , i can come to a conclusion and feel relaxed in a similar way , if my depression is becoming too much , writing what i'm feeling reduces the pressure that i feel it 's not just journals that i would recommend keeping , but also a book of achievements , as i like to call it i bought a cheap exercise book off ebay and have filled it with my achievements best moments of and at the end of the year , i can review it and see how far i have come in my recovery i also did this in both of these have helped me immensely and it 's amazing to see the differences i have made why do n't you give it a go ? amy xx
