it 's time to change the description on my blog again when i first began this blog , it read , diagnosed with depression years ago , i lost the life i once knew and then it was years and then , until today , the number was ten it 's now been years since my journey with depression ensued around thanksgiving , , i first noticed i was n't feeling quite right eleven years ago not quite right was exactly how i described it at the time i knew something was off i knew i was n't myself having had depression as a teenager , the symptoms soon became all too familiar within a short period of time , i knew it was depression and it took me quickly it was only a few more months before my first hospitalization in the spring of if only i knew then what i know now at that time i thought a short hospital stay and initiating medication would get me back to normal i was hopeful i had no idea the journey that lay ahead i had no idea of the losses i would incur , or the depths to which this illness would drag me i never imagined losing my job and living on disability i never dreamed i 'd require ect in order to function i never thought my spouse would leave , nor that i 'd be alone those were not pictures i had of my life my life today looks nothing like the life i had years ago i look nothing like i looked years ago either , and i do n't mean physically in losing so much , i 've also gained i 've gathered some wonderful people , friends and professionals , around me depression forced me into relationships these are people i likely would have never known nor thought i needed today i trust them with my intimate details and count on them when i need assistance they keep me safe , and i am forever grateful in years i lost the person i used to be , but that turned out to be okay chronic , debilitating depression gave me a new perspective it 's true what they say illness makes a person see things differently i notice more and worry less i discovered living one day at a time , even though i do n't always practice it , and gained the gift of gratitude i'm less concerned about mistakes and less judgemental i'm more honest , trusting and empathic i'm a kinder , gentler , nicer person than i used to be that 's not so bad still , it 's been years , and i 'd be lying if i said i was celebrating this is a time of reflection for me some reflections bring sadness and grief , others produce satisfaction and even joy i'm proud of my resilience i appreciate my acceptance of change i'm pleased with this blog i 've accomplished some things despite this dreadful illness depression is a dreadful , debilitating illness it has , without my consent , irreparably altered my life for years , at its whim , depression has dragged me into the darkness , stolen my soul , and left me for dead but i'm still trudging along i'm still fighting i'm still living i'm especially proud of that
