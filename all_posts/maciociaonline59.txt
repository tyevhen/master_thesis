the triple burner is probably the most widely discussed topic on chinese medicine and , over the centuries , there have been many different theories on its nature in this clinical tip , i will try to elucidate the main ideas on the nature of the triple burner and it will probably take more than one clinical tip burner is a translation of the word jiao which means burned or scorched it is also called warmer while others choose not to translate it and call it the san jiao some chinese doctors distinguish between two basic views of the triple burner , one according to which is has no form which is primarily from the nan jing and another according to which it has a form which is primarily from the nei jing although this distinction is important and i will expand on it below , i think there are at least four different ways of looking at the triple burner , as listed below the triple burner as the activator of the yuan qi the triple burner as a system of waterways the triple burner governing movement of qi the triple burner as a system of cavities the triple burner as a three fold division of the body relationship between triple burner and pericardium the triple burner as the activator of the yuan qi the view of the triple burner as the activator of the yuan qi derives from the nan jing , primarily chapters , , and chapter of the nan jing says sometimes the cun kou is normal and yet the patient dies why is that ? the pulses of the channels all originate from the yuan qi this yuan qi is the root of the channels , it is the motive force dong qi between the kidneys , the root of the zang and fu and of the channels , the gate of breathing and the origin of the triple burner it is the spirit that guards against pathogenic factors or evil influences such qi is the root of humankind if the root is cut stalks and leaves wither when the cun kou is normal but the patient dies , it means that the yuan qi has been cut off internally this chapter establishes some very important principles first , it talks about the yuan qi it says that yuan qi is between the kidneys like the ming men and that it is the root of the channels , the triple burner and the zang and fu secondly , it makes a very important statement when it says that this yuan qi is the spirit shen that guards against evils this is a remnant of demonic medicine , i e the system of medicine in which disease is due to the invasion of evils spirits and the cure is effected by the shaman the clinical significance of this chapter is huge firstly , it establishes the idea that the yuan qi and therefore the kidneys is the root of the zang and fu , of the channels and of the triple burner secondly , it establishes the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi and therefore ming men later in chapter , the nan jing says that the triple burner is the envoy of the yuan qi in between the kidneys in this chapter , the yuan qi is also called motive force or throbbing qi or moving qi dong qi thirdly , this passage establishes the principle that the yuan qi and therefore the kidneys play a role in the resistance to pathogenic factors interestingly , it calls the yuan qi the shen that protect from pathogenic factors or evils this is of huge clinical significance because it means that our resistance to pathogenic factors depends not only on the wei qi and therefore lungs but also on the kidneys and the yuan qi and also jing due to the extraordinary vessels in any case , wei qi stems from the lower burner chapter of the ling shu this is of clinical significance not only in resistance to pathogenic factors but also in the pathology of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis , the root of which is also in the kidneys , the jing and the yuan qi fourthly , this chapter is significant because for the first time it gives the view of the triple burner as the envoy of the yuan qi stemming from between the kidneys from this point of view , the triple burner allows the yuan qi to spring forth from between the kidneys and perform its role in various parts of the body for this reason , bl sanjiaoshu is just above bl shenshu chapter of the nan jing reiterates the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi it says how come there are zang but fu ? there are fu because of the triple burner which stems from the yuan qi the triple burner governs all qi in the body , it has a name but no form , it belongs to hand shao yang , it is an external fu or extra fu that is why there are zang but fu this chapter actually describes four separate important aspects of the triple burner first , it is a fu organ which brings the count of fu organs up to secondly , it stems from the yuan qi thirdly , it governs all qi of the body fourthly , it has a name but no form , i e it is a function rather than an organ which actually contradicts the first point the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi is explained also in the rather obscure chapter this says the zang channels have jing , ying , shu , jing and he points but the fu have points , why ? the fu are yang , the triple burner moves in the yang channels , hence it has an additional shu point called yuan i personally think that the influence of the triple burner on the fact that the yang channels have an extra shu point is due to the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi and to the fact that the triple burner moves among the yang as this chapter says in other words , as the triple burner is the envoy of the yuan qi and it moves among the yang , it could be said to seed the yang channels with its yuan qi deriving from the space between the kidneys in fact , the nan jing says that the yuan qi comes out of the space between the kidneys through the envoy of the triple burner and goes to the zang and fu and the twelve channels the reason it seeds only the yang channels is due to the fact that it moves among the yang chapter of the nan jing is the main one that discusses the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi it says below the umbilicus and between the kidneys there is a throbbing qi dong qi which constitutes a person s life sheng ming this throbbing qi is the root of the channels , also called yuan qi the triple burner is the envoy of the yuan qi or it allows the yuan qi to separate into its different functions it is responsible for the passage of the three types of qi in the zang and fu yuan is a honorary designation of the triple burner hence the places where its qi comes to a halt are called yuan points when the zang and fu are diseased , select the respective yuan point this chapter is the main source for the view of the triple burner as the envoy of the yuan qi it allows the yuan qi to emerge from the space between the kidneys and it facilitates the yuan qi s differentiation into its different functions in different places thus , the triple burner mobilizes the yuan qi by making it differentiate into its different forms to perform different functions in different places and organs it is through the triple burner that the yuan qi can perform its functions the yuan qi is closely related to the ming men and shares its role of providing the heat necessary to all the body s functional activities the following are examples of functions carried out by the yuan qi which are aided by the triple burner the yuan qi provides the heat necessary to the spleen to transform and transport food essence and to the kidneys to transform fluids the middle burner makes sure that yuan qi reaches and assists the spleen to transform and transport food essences and the lower burner ensures that yuan qi warms the kidneys to transform fluids the yuan qi facilitates the transformation of gathering qi zong qi into true qi zhen qi it can do this through the action of the upper burner in transporting qi through the various passages in the chest the yuan qi facilitates the transformation of food qi gu qi into blood in the heart the upper burner ensures the smooth passage and transportation of qi in the chest for this transformation to take place thus , the triple burner helps the yuan qi to differentiate itself into different forms to perform different functions in different places the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi of the kidneys is reflected in the location of the back shu point of the triple burner bl sanjiaoshu just above the back shu point of the kidneys bl shenshu from this point of view , the triple burner has no form , i e it is a function and not an actual fu organ the nan jing says succintly it has a name but no form you ming wu xing clinical application the relationship between the triple burner and the yuan qi has important clinical applications it means that the yuan qi performs its warming and facilitating function through the triple burner thus , if we want to activate the yuan qi in the different burners we need to activate the triple burner as well and the points i use are as follows upper burner ren shanzhong to stimulate the diffusing and descending of lung qi and warm the lungs middle burner ren zhongwan and ren shuifen to stimulate the descending of stomach qi , the transportation and transformation yun hua by the spleen and the rotting and ripening by the stomach lower burner ren shimen and bl sanjiaoshu to stimulate the transportation , transformation and excretion of fluids in the lower burner for example , in case of dampness in the lower burner and specifically in the kidneys and bladder causing urinary problems occurring against a background of kidney yang deficiency , one can use ren shimen and bl sanjiaoshu to activate the triple burner or specifically lower burner and ren guanyuan and bl shenshu to tonify the kidneys and the yuan qi note how ren and bl related to kidneys are just below ren and bl respectively related to triple burner reflecting the view that the yuan qi emerges from between the kidneys through the triple burner
