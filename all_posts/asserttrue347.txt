if ever it were possible which it seldom is for sublime acting to elevate an otherwise unremarkable film to the status of a minor classic , it surely would have happened in the case of the last station , the well intentioned tolstoy biopic that brought oscar and golden globe nominations but no wins to christopher plummer and helen mirren for their commanding portrayals of leo and sofya tolstoy the performances were genuinely excellent alas , the movie was not it 's fair to ask why not , because on the surface , you 'd think any movie about the life of the greatest international celebrity of the th century which tolstoy surely was could n't fail to be a compelling tale but sadly , like tolstoy 's own final journey by rail , the last station falls far short of its ultimate destination , leaving the passenger the moviegoer stranded and wanting for a place to hang his or her shapka , so to speak the ingredients are there strong characters , conflict , intrigue , deception , drama leo tolstoy , at age , was trying desperately to simplify his increasingly complex professional and family life he had long since signed over his worldly possessions including the family estate , yasnaya polyana to the care of his wife but he also secretly conspired , with the aid of his devoted disciple , vladimir grigoryevich chertkov , to concoct a secret will that would have his literary properties go to the public domain of course , sofya was no fool and saw through her husband 's multiple attempts to write her out of the literary inheritance the last station is the story of sonya 's descent into near madness and leo 's final , abortive attempt to escape the madness as chertkov wrests control of the tolstoy literary legacy from sonya leo boards a train , at the end , seeking to put physical distance as much of it as possible between himself and his wife by the time he reaches astapovo , the last station on the rail line , he is deathly ill with pneumonia his wife arrives at astapovo just in time to see him die the problem with the last station , as a movie , is that writer director michael hoffman working from jay parini 's novel chose to give us an extremely narrow snapshot of an enormous subject , more or less like trying to capture the grand canyon with a brownie camera the movie not only does n't try to give us a significant slice of tolstoy 's life , it 's actually happy to focus in on just a few weeks the final weeks of the great man 's story what 's worse , the story is told through the eyes of a rather insignificant character , tolstoy 's replacement secretary replacing n n gusev , who was for a short time imprisoned , the young valentin bulgakov along the way , we 're made to suffer through bulgakov 's own irrelevant romance with a young woman who 's in no way related to tolstoy nor any other real world character the movie thus fails on several levels it fails , first , in not giving us a significant slice of tolstoy 's life it merely presents the year old master to us as a world celebrity , ready made , and expects us to bring significant knowledge of tolstoy 's backstory with us the movie also distracts us from the main story by as i said forcing us to watch an utterly forgettable romantic side plot that never intersects the main plot but the movie also fails to show off the true main character of any movie of whatever scope about any great russian writer namely , mother russia herself it may be unfair to compare a movie of the last station 's modest aspirations and equally modest budget million with david lean 's unforgettable cinematic rendition of boris pasternak 's doctor zhivago which cost million in dollars , but the fact is , no one who has seen doctor zhivago will fail , consciously or unconsciously , to make the comparison in his or her mind between the lean movie and any subsequent movie involving an iconic russian figure the striking thing one of many about doctor zhivago is that at no time in the movie can the viewer be unaware of the looming presence of that other main character , bigger than life , russia herself unfortunately , and crucially , we lose that essential character in the last station , and without it , the story of tolstoy 's final weeks seems like little more than thin domestic farce it 's easy to spew out criticism how to fix it ? what could the writer director have done to rescue the last station from the clutches of mediocrity aside from rewriting it as a stage play ? in particular , how could it have been improved without expanding the story into a zhivago like epic spanning the whole of tolstoy 's life ? i think first of all it 's necessary and sufficient , for this limited budget film to tell the story of tolstoy 's last ten years , rather than his final year by dispensing with the trivial bulgakov character and his meaningless romance we save many feet of film that could be better put to use telling the story through the eyes of tolstoy 's personal physician , dushan makovitsky , a decidedly pivotal figure in the drama the rewritten story opens february , at a train station in st petersburg , where nameless nobodies come and go , among them a young nobody who , while waiting for his train , carefully which is to say , first looking to see that no one is watching him slides a book out of his coat and begins to read it the book a copy of tolstoy 's banned the kingdom of god is within you a nearby church bell tolls we cut to the interior of the cathedral of our lady st petersburg where a grave looking metropolitan anthony ascends the pulpit to read the document officially excommunicating count lev nickolayevich tolstoy from the orthodox church cut to a villa at gaspra , on the black sea it 's september at the insistence of his physician , tolstoy has come to crimea to recuperate from malaria he 's joined at the seaside villa not only by his family but by anton chekhov and maxim gorky all of this is true , by the way chekhov , shaking his head , looks up from his newspaper it 's been seven months , lev nickolayevich , and they 're still writing about the excommunication ! at the time of his death in , tolstoy was arguably the best known celebrity in the world at this point , there is ample room to discuss the reasons for the excommunication tolstoy has been writing books and tracts most famously , the kingdom of god is within you blasting the church 's version of christianity , putting forth his own no nonsense , no miracles , no hocus pocus version of the gospels , emphasizing the sermon on the mount and its call for turning the other cheek and repudiating violence tolstoy has turned jesus 's teachings against the church , by pointing out that no one who advocates violence even in a just cause is adhering to jesus 's teachings tolstoy 's own fundamentalism has not only gotten him in hot water with the church and the tsar , it has spawned a christian anarchism movement that has , by , circled the globe in russia , believers in tolstoy 's version of christianity are refusing military service in significant numbers in england and elsewhere , acolytes have formed tolstoyan colonies one of tolstoy 's most ardent followers , at home , is of course vladimir chertkov , who will remain a lifelong disciple , creating the first english language editions of tolstoy 's works and publishing inexpensive editions of his books both in england and in russia resulting in ten years of exile for chertkov tolstoy 's religious fervor , seen by his wife as incomprehensible , is ultimately what powers the bond with chertkov , the rift with sofya , and tolstoy 's own mad quest to shed worldly belongings before he dies by making this aspect of tolstoy 's life clear , the last station properly remade could give life to the motivations of its characters and make clear why so many russians considered tolstoy a living saint as part of his creed , tolstoy advocated celibacy , vegetarianism , and repudiation of worldly goods he strongly agreed with proudhon that property is theft once this fact is known , it becomes possible , in a remake of the last station , to put tolstoy 's philosophy in historical context thus it becomes relevant to include in such a movie a scene for example of the , people who marched on the winter palace in st petersburg in january these were not card carrying bolsheviks but ordinary people , many of whom had been inspired by tolstoy 's not just marx 's philosophy i can think of many powerful scenes that would make sense in a film that attempts to capture tolstoy 's final decade rather than his final six months of life by slavishly adhering to parini 's novel , screenwriter director hoffman reinquished any opportunity he might have had to do the tolstoy story justice in the last station we end up with melodrama instead of drama , narrow provinciality instead of sweeping grandeur , and poor mother russia herself reduced to a forgotten stepsister , when in fact the stage like the characters could not , in this case , have possibly been any bigger
