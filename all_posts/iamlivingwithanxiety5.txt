this year i was on more than airplane flights i travel more than any of my family or friends , perhaps even among my co workers i ve been as far west as seattle and as far east as miami and had a five and a half hour trip between the two throughout these experiences , i have had symptoms racing thoughts , imagination on fire , heart palpitations , blurry vision , sweating , loose bowels classic anxiety yet i did not let this stop my travels at times i was extremely uncomfortable , but i would remember dr low s words that comfort is a want , not a need i never truly was in any danger perhaps the tool i used most frequently was that feelings are not facts i might have felt that the turbulence was intense , that the take off wasn t quite right , that the plane was in jeopardy , but the reality of the situation was always quite different the facts were clear i was usually experiencing normal turbulence and , at times , feeling panicky for no reason at all next year promises the same level of travel perhaps more i have fantasized about telling my boss i can t fly , that the symptoms are simply too intense but i recognize that the only way to maintain self esteem and overcome symptoms is to do the thing i fear and hate to do feelings and sensations cannot be controlled , but thoughts and impulses can be i can control my impulse to not fly again , and i can continue to change my thoughts using recovery tools to replace insecure thoughts with secure ones thus , i m going to give myself a hearty endorsement for practicing recovery in such uncomfortable circumstances this year feeling anxious on a flight is not a failure we endorse for the effort , not the outcome in years past i might have indeed told my boss that i can no longer travel by plane , but a life chained to anxiety is not how i plan to live
