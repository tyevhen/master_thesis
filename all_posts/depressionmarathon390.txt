tonight i have the briefest of brief notes for you i just returned from an extended weekend vacation in northern wisconsin with my boyfriend , d it was lovely it was relaxing i had a good mile run through the woods on saturday followed by a great miler on sunday we had good food , good friends , and quiet time , too i even got to start a new book i am a lucky woman but now it is late , and it is past my bedtime it 's hard enough to return to work after vacation i do n't want to be overly tired , too i promise a better update will be forthcoming
