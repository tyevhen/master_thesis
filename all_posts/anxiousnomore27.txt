lately i have been getting more and more nervous about delivering this baby with my first child , i was very oblivious to what labor was like let me preface by stating that i am a huge wuss when it comes to pain a lot of woman try to be tough when delivering babies and it seems like a contest to see who can go the longest without an epidural i commend the women who do it naturally if that works for you than great i on the other hand , just wanted to survive the experience before going to the hospital i had imagined that before any real pain or discomfort started surely in this day and age i would be pumped with pain medications but while waiting to determine if i was in true active labor , and while waiting for the anesthesiologist to come back to the hospital since they sent him home for the night , i experienced a lot of pain and was very much unprepared for the agony i felt while waiting for an epidural i have a distinct memory of burying my face into the bed , holding onto the bed rails and kicking my legs , literally writing in pain then after getting my epidural , the rest was a piece of cake but i learned just how unprepared i was for those first few hours now that i know better , whenever a small contraction starts i have immediately gone into panic mode yesterday i went to the doctor and they checked me and told me that i could go pretty much anyday last night , i had several contractions while trying to go to sleep i started shaking uncontrollably i had a hard time catching my breath or my thoughts i was petrified that i would soon experience the hard excruciating labor pains that i did the first time around i realize i am also worried about not being in control of the situation i tried to schedule an induction because that would help me feel more in control of the when and how , but unfortunately my doctor will only do those after weeks and she does n't think i will last that long i scheduled one anyway as a plan b , but i know that i am going to have to figure this out for the surprise middle of the night scenario because i am feeling extreme anticipatory anxiety i know i need to sort out all of my thoughts just like i would for any other trigger and hopefully that will help me my plan is to research more about breathing techniques related to labor that i can use as well as some helpful coping statements i can refer to to help control my thoughts i have attached my exercise i did to help address my fears i plan to print it out and keep it in my hospital bag so i can refer to it when i need it what am i telling myself to make me feel this way ? i am worried that i will be in a lot of physical pain and not feel in control of the situation i worry that i will panic and not be able to breathe or have my thoughts in order what if the worst case scenario happened ? what can i do ? if the labor pains start and they are super strong and i am hurting and feel the panic and i start to feel out of control , i will still be okay tyler will be there to help me through whatever is going on he can drive me to the hospital and even carry me if needed i can take positive affirmations with me to help me control my thoughts and do some breathing exercises to help me with my breath even if these don t stop the panic it can help me to know that i am proactive about taking care of myself positive affirmations i choose to control my thoughts i can accomplish anything i set my mind on this may be hard , but i can do this i can do this ! circumstances are what they are , but i can choose my attitude toward them if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
