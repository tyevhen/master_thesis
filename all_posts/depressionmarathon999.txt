i 've heard about it , and now i think i may be feeling just the beginning of it , maybe post marathon depression does that sound familiar to anyone ? i 'd love to know your story if you 've got one , as i do n't think there is much written on the subject i'm feeling a little let down , a little droop in my mood i'm trying to guard against a big post event plunge partly by just being aware of it other than that , i'm not sure what to do i'm guessing that focusing forward will help that 's why i'm already thinking about my next goal in fact , i'm thinking about another marathon ! given the result of this race , i'm convinced i can run a better race by fixing some of the weaknesses of this training bout running more miles on fewer pounds are two of the weaknesses i can easily address for example , i only ran around miles per week running at least miles would give me a more competitive base and then there are these extra pounds i'm lugging around i certainly will run better if i lay off the chocolate but i love chocolate ! fixing these weaknesses will make a big difference in a race any race racing that 's another thing i plan to keep doing to guard against post marathon depression i want to take advantage of my current condition , and stay motivated to improve my condition by signing up for more races i hope racing more often will help keep this one race in perspective after all , it was just one race other than that , i think i 'll keep talking to all of you since i began this blog months ago , my depression has steadily improved coincidence ? i do n't know , but if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ! have a good day everyone !
