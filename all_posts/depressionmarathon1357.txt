yippee ! yesterday , i washed the dishes ! then , i made it to my morning aa meeting , though i had to struggle out of my house after the meeting , i planned to swim , but the girls convinced me to go out for pancakes i am a sucker for pancakes , especially when i'm in a carbo loading rut ! so , i went for pancakes , but i told them all i had to go swimming afterward saying it out loud gave me no choice of going home to nap instead once in the pool , i pushed past the windedness and just kept going and going and going one mile i did it ! i swam one mile again ! that made me smile a very satisfied smile one of the beauties of my depression is it pisses me off ! when i am pissed off , i find pain rewarding , dammit ! ! i get that competitive fire me against the illness , and i do n't like to lose ! i do n't like to lose at all ! that anger and fire allows me to push harder , hold on longer , and beat up on my demon depression ! and , as i did yesterday , when i get to this anger point , i usually win ! ! ha ! ! okay , so i am still walking around the day old , clean , dry clothing hanging in my living room , but it 's progress ! besides , i'm running out of clean clothes i see those drying racks coming down any day now ! have a successful day !
