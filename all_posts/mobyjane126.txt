hello ! i bought your book at the del mar fair and i am on chapter thank you so much ! ! i have had many sleepless nights , and i tend to wake up feeling low , or depressed i loved your book explaining the passive mind , and that we tend to be turned inward in our thinking and are vulnerable to the least bump i the road wow it all makes so much sense when i exercise in the morning , or concentrate on things that i would like to get done , i am no longer depressed just like you said , we need to have directive thinking and not passive thinking i always wondered why i was so sad in the mornings , and felt so good in the evenings , and you helped me understand my brain , thoughts and feelings i can t thank you enough for your research in writing this book besides attending weight watchers , i also started attending a singles group that i tried to do years before unsuccessfully it has been a very good experience for me ! i have met some new people and hope to develop some good , healthy relationships thanks again ! s dear s thanks for your letter it was nice for you to take the time to write a b curtiss
