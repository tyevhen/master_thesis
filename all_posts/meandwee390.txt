hey there ! we added another fun activity to our day playing in paper ! i have taken all the tissue paper hanging around from gifts , etc and have crinkled it up loosely and put it on the floor in a pile for paige to play in i 've yet to take a photo of it i 've also found interesting bags made of different kinds of crinkly sounding plastics i cut them up into pieces so they are n't bags anymore and added them to the pile she loves to crawl slither through it and feel the different sensations in her hands she sits in the pile and just looks all around much like playing in the fall leaves ! and when she 's done , i just gather them all up and store them in a bag save your papers from holiday time it will be all the more fun for the little ones to rip and crinkle with well after the season and , as always , i doubt it is ever safe to leave a child unattended with these materials , so be sure to keep your watchful eye on alert ! save you might also like activities dollie toys ! linkwithin
