as a psychotherapist in nyc , i 've been seeing more clients these days , as compared to the past , who are experiencing crippling fears in social situations , and many of them are relying on alcohol to give them liquid courage , which provides a false sense of confidence in these situations see my article overcoming social anxiety fear and shame in social situations fear and shame in social situations there have been tons of article written about why people are having such difficulty overcoming their feelings of vulnerability and shame when it comes to socializing and dating see my articles overcoming loneliness and social isolation and overcoming shame fear and shame in social situations these articles give many reasons why this phenomenon is especially prevalent these days , including the fact that people are communicating more online than in person , and many people have n't learned the basic skills necessary to interact socially in person without experiencing dread fear and shame in social situations fear of socializing without liquid courage so , i'm not going to focus so much on the reasons for this problem , which have have already been discussed in many other articles instead , i'm going to focus on a social phenomenon that i 've seen with people of all ages , which is that they feel they ca n't socialize without liquid courage to get them through overcoming the temptation to use liquid courage to cope with social situations as i usually do in my articles , i 'll give a scenario to highlight the problems and some of the ways these problems can be overcome in therapy although the example that i give is about a man , this issue affects both men and women regardless of age , race or sexual orientation as always , this scenario is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality mike mike , who was in his early s , never attended any social event without having at least one drink before he went although , at this point in his life , he very much wanted to be in a relationship , he felt almost paralyzed with fear when he thought about talking to an attractive woman at a party before , he went , he imagined all the things that could go wrong and how embarrassed he would be what if there were uncomfortable pauses in the conversation because he could n't think of anything to say ? what if he looked stupid because he did n't understand what she was talking about ? what if she thought he was a bore ? what if he spilled his drink all over himself ? and he ruminated on and on , which escalated his fear at times , he felt so emotionally vulnerable when he thought about an upcoming party that he would agonize for days beforehand sometimes , his fear and shame were so great that he would cancel at the last minute rather than deal with facing a situation where he felt sure he would make a fool of himself but the immediate relief that mike felt from avoiding the social situation was often short lived within hours , he regretted not going because his avoidance kept him feeling stuck and lonely for female companionship he had plenty of male friends that he hung out with , but socializing with women that he had never met before felt like an insurmountable challenge for him although he felt confident in his career where he worked mostly with men and hanging out in a sports bar with his buddies , he lost all confidence in himself when he was in a situation where there were women he did n't know on those occasions when he did go to parties , he fortified himself with liquid courage one or two drinks before he left the house then , he had a few more drinks when he arrived at the party and he was able to loosen up enough to chat with women he did n't know overcoming the temptation to use liquid courage to cope with social situations with a few drinks in him , mike felt less inhibited and he was able to forget about being self conscious he was often funny after a few drinks , and women would tell him that he had a great sense of humor he also felt more confident about asking women to go out the problem was that , by the next day , without alcohol , he still felt the same crippling fear as before , and he was sure that when he called the woman that he met , he would be so socially inept that she would n't want to go out with him fear and shame in social situations without alcohol after struggling this way for a couple of years , mike realized that he had a real problem and he came to therapy in therapy , mike and i worked on the underlying issues , including a childhood with overly critical parents , that were at the core of his problems even though he was an adult , he continued to struggle with these old messages that made him feel worthless in social situations with women he did n't know aside from working through these underlying emotional issues , mike also needed to practice getting more comfortable approaching these social situations without fortifying himself with alcohol on a rational level , mike knew that he could n't keep relying on alcohol to get him through because it was only a temporary fix and , since his father had problems with alcoholism , mike also knew that a possible genetic predisposition to alcoholism could create a bigger problem for him if he continued to rely on alcohol but , on an emotional level , mike felt that alcohol had become his reliable friend in helping him to get through these situations even though mike was n't an alcoholic , he knew that his maladaptive ways of coping with social situations was n't going to be easy to change we worked on mike 's childhood history of emotional abuse using emdr therapy we also used the cognitive behavioral technique of desensitization for his fears related to socializing using a desensitization technique , we set up a hierarchy of mike 's fears and worked on them , step by step , one by one from low to high so that he could overcome his fears in addition , we used clinical hypnosis also known as hypnotherapy to help boost mike 's confidence in the meantime , mike cut back on his drinking he practiced going to social events without having a drink beforehand he also cut back on the alcohol that he drank while at social events needless to say , it was n't easy for him initially , he was so afraid that he just hung out with mostly friends that he knew and steered clear of talking to women that he really would have liked to meet but as we continued to work together , over time , mike became more comfortable taking small steps to allow himself to be more emotionally vulnerable in these situations as you would expect , some days were better than others but what was most important was that mike was willing to work on these issues in therapy and , even more important , he was willing to put himself out there in ways that were , initially , uncomfortable overcoming the temptation to use liquid courage to cope with social situations it was n't easy but , gradually , he overcame the near paralyzing fear and shame that had kept him feeling too vulnerable , and he was able to do it without relying on alcohol as a social lubricant at the same time , mike developed more confidence in himself socially , and he eventually met a woman he really liked and , a couple of years later , they got married getting help in therapy
