i went into richmond south west london yesterday andmet some friends from the social anxiety uk discussion board i had a really nice time and i am lokingforward to going again ! we are arranging something for two weeks time ! meeting other people with sa really helps my confidence , it stops me feeling like such a freak seeing all these normal people who are nice to talk to i do n't think i have ever met such a nice understanding group of people a friend i have known since my student days came to visit today , we wenttosee baby livia my honarary neice she is nearly weeks old already ! ! afterwards the two of us went to the pub and had a really good chat we talked about men and having babies and stuff i told her i have seen my ex a few times recently , i had not told ny of my other friends this incase they disapproved ! she was really understanding about me still thinking of him as a friend and caring about him although i would not want us to get back together i no longer fancy him and we want different things from life she said how well she thought i was doing i told her that i was going to get my teeth straightened she is one of the first people i have told she did ask why i did not get it done as a kid and i could comfortably tell her my mum would not take me to the dentist i tried asking my mum to take me once but she would not it was nice to talk about it though and my friend started to understand why i am not close to my family she thought it was a great idea and even agreed that there was no rush to buy a house if i wanted to spend the money getting my teeth fixed we spoke a bit about when i was ill , it was really nice to talk to someone about it , she is the first person who has not assumed that the break up with my ex caused all my problems and believed i was not right before all that happened apparently the day i rang my boss and told him i was going to kill myself i also rang her and sent her into a panic she said if it had not been for the london bombings she would have come straight round she alsosaid it was good that i called my boss as he called emergency services that led to me getting some help she does not think she would have been able to get me the help i needed it was really good talking to her , i feel like i got a lot off my chest which was nice we have also made further plans about going to new york is september o i have had a really good weekend ! ! o i have my mum on msn saying she wants to set up a second computer for stupid reasons such as dad has not installed word , will blame her if it goes wrong and all the rest of it i wish my parents showed some love towards each other it makes me really sad when they pick fault with each other i also get very sad that i will never be close to my mum and will never know why she refused to take me to the dentist or cared enough to ask why i sat in my room and never came out every evening after school for five years she is now and i think it is better for her to finish her years happy and content believing she is a good mother and my problems are all down to my ex leaving me she still argues with the psychiatrists diagnosis o my relationship with my mum makes me very sad i sometimes think the reason i can not get close to others is because i never bonded with my mum i do love her but we have no mutual understanding or respect o anyway bedtime for me , i will post again soon ! my mum has just signed off msn saying goodnight sweet heart , love you lots this makes me fell riddled with guilt about the way i feel about her o i love her but only because she is my mum not for who she is i will never express my love for her openly and never forgive her for the rose coloured spectacles she wears when she looks at me i will never forgive her for leaving me to cry when i needed her or not noticing how much i was suffering and making me feel guilty for taking medication even when i push her away i am not free of the guilt she imposes on me i feel i am either exagerating it and being unfair , pushing her away on purpose but i have tried talking to her but she only hears what she wants to hear and can not see past her tinted specs ! when i look at the situation i have the problem relating to others not her ! i do n't think i will ever be free of these feelings i wish i could get angry and tell her how i feel there is no good outcome from this though , she will either continue to select what she wants to hear or feel guilty about things in the past that can not be changed from the attempts i have made in the past i think she will go for the fist option there is nothing to be gained by trying to talk to her good night ! !
