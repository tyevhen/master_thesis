posted by dinah it took me a while to figure this out , from the headline , mental health chiefs blast 'dangerous' big brother , i somehow thought big brother referred to one of those altruistic organizations where men adopt fatherless boys to nurture and mentor finally , in my pop culture deprivation state , i figured out that big brother is a reality show where they throw a bunch of people into a house together and stick 'em on tv so people can watch them bitch at each other about who left the dishes in the sink or so i imagined not this show sam brodie , a pre operative transsexual , is thought to have mental health issues , notes the daily mail sam , , has already told housemates 'i'm the most paranoid person ever ' the article goes on to report , sam is among a host of vulnerable contestants put into the house shahbaz threatened to kill himself live on television before quitting the show , lea has tried to commit suicide and has undergone extensive plastic surgery because she was unhappy with her appearance , nikki has suffered anorexia and pete has tourette 's syndrome since i get paid to listen to such stories , i just ca n't fathom how anyone else might enjoy watching this for entertainment here in america , we 'd never stand for such things okay , i'm off to clear the sink before the cameras arrive links dare to dream
