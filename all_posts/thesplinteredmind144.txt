i get the feeling i should have stayed in bed on sunday and avoided this entire week i do n't know what was wrong , but i spent the better part of the week putting out fires open mouth , insert fanny ever have one of those weeks where you are n't looking for trouble but spend most of your time falling right into its lap ? this may not be ad hd 's fault , however it may be related to the other neurological troubles i have , but i ca n't really hide behind it whatever was the cause oh , sorry for the misunderstanding i'm not usually this much of a jerk it 's my disability no , not the most comforting of sentiments a rapier wit i wo n't bore you by detailing all the fires i singed my fanny on , but i can give you one example my brother massforwarded a funny email to me and of his closest friends i let him know i did n't want that to happen again oh , i meant to be diplomatic , but he suggested in his reply that i could use some work on congeniality that fire took several emails and a phone call to put out , and he was n't even mad at me i do work on congeniality but i'm a particular fellow i like things just right so i find being particular often is at loggerheads with being congenial unfortunately , when i mix sarcasm in congeniality goes out the window oh , i'm terribly clever the black adder would be horribly proud of my wittiness the trouble is we laugh at the black adder because the man says what we would never dream of saying in social situations on weeks like this one , i dare to dream sardonicism alert go back to bed what i 'd like to have is some sort of klaxon alarm that warns me when i'm not quite as witty as usual and that perhaps i should park the sarcasm in the back for a spell it could go off first thing in the morning the minute i look in the mirror then i 'd know to return to bed for a while on weeks like this what i think is sarcastic is actually sardonic this was a week that called for kid gloves , not horseshoes the end result is that i feel regret and embarrassment i did n't start these fires , but i did pour gasoline on them instead of taking the higher path people with ad hd do eventually learn to keep themselves in check when they become adults you know what they say about practice well , i'm really good at putting out fires now what depresses me most is that i did n't choose to make things worse i honestly thought i was fixing the issue the problem is that i was off neurologically my sarcastic wit , which usually entertains , became a source of conflagration i could n't have made things worse if i had called these people up and called them synonyms for moron out of the thesaurus i did n't call anybody names , of course , but i might as well have for all the good my diplomacy did me the funny thing is that i feel much better today and know the problem is past i 'll probably hold off on the jokes for a little while , though , just to be sure what do you think ? so i 'd really like to know if you have ad hd , have you ever had one of those weeks ? coping strategies install klaxon learn to recognize when i'm neurologically off and minimize contact with people until i can communicate better or just try to be as bland as possible too much spice spoils the sauce the same goes for conversation treat my family to milk shakes after this week they deserve it for putting up with me you might also like ad hd frustrated with frustration add you 've just got to laugh words a day is child 's play finding humor in adhd linkwithin
