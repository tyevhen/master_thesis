oh my so over on my twitter account , i tweeted a tweet that has now been favorited , retweeted , mentioned , ? distorted , and tagged such that i 've received over notifications on all sorts of stuff i 'd rather have nothing to do with so let me start the story at the beginning earlier in may , the new york times ran a column called this is my brain on pms it was a first person account of someone 's mental anguish and emotional instability during the premenstrual time jeffrey lieberman is a former apa president , the chairman of psychiatry at columbia , and author of a new book on the history of psychiatry called shrinks dr lieberman has previously tweeted sentiments that indicate that he wishes the ny times would publish more science oriented psychiatry articles and devote less precious space to these opinionator pieces or to anything with a sentiment that is critical of psychiatry , although i understand his book is rather critical of psychoanalytic practice it 's hard to know what is in someone 's heart in characters , and dr lieberman posted the following tweet jeffrey a lieberman drjlieberman may i guess the narcissist introspections repeatedly published by nytimes do provide st person accts of dsm disorders nyti ms owhyo drjlieberman why is a patient 's narrative of their difficulties 'narcissism' ? insulting perhaps public accounts are destigmatizing
