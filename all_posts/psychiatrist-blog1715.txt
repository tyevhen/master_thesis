it 's been a few days roy was on a roll ducks , darth , depakote , and hillary it would have been so illiterate alliterate , but for he 's back under the hospital floorboards again , to emerge soon , i imagine clinkshrink has been visiting middle america drinking whole milk , eating white bread with mayo , struggling at scrabble and now she has a new venture she 's writing prison fiction check it out bad fiction , it 's clink all the way jesse ventura in a kimona , dogs licking their private parts , it does n't get any more clinkable and i 've been posting segments of double billing thanks to all of you who 've stuck with me and have been commenting , i hope it 's worth the journey i 've added on a roll role in my real life as part of a professional organization and this suddenly is eating my time i woke up this morning thinking about a piece of office equipment that might need replacing this for an office i do n't work in and a piece of equipment i 've never seen i'm feeling a bit disconnected from shrink rap oh , and i grow a year older later this week i'm feeling a bit disconnected from that , too , but probably it 's just as well when it gets to me , i'm left to consider the alternative all day , i 've been thinking i want to post something that will shake things up , breath a little energy into shrink rap so far , it has n't worked that way i do n't post because i'm looking for something to write about i write because something has found me so what should i rant about ? drugs always work my seroquel post got a top number of comments , roy 's xanax post made everyone think i'm not in the mood for drugs i could use some chocolate , but what can i say ? the last psychiatrist sometimes incites me , but he 's ranting about the guy who flew after being diagnosesd with resistant tuberculosis not very shrinky okay , so here 's my post i did n't say anything did you notice that ?
