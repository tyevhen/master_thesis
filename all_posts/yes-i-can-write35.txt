i 've always been against the use of any type of curriculum that is n't chosen expressly by the learner themselves , but i found myself wanting to explain why i felt that way what was so irredeemable about externally mandated educational plans ? this is the answer i came up with a curriculum is stagnant it 's created as a solid , linear plan , detailing what facts , theories , and formulas an individual should know and in what order they should learn them it 's designed by people other than the learners themselves , it 's based on the idea that there is one core body of knowledge and set of skills that hundreds or thousands , or millions of children should all have , and that they should all learn it at the same age it does n't grow with the individual , it does n't bend or adapt it exists as a series of check marks , a string of benchmarks and numbers that have little to do with what 's actually best for the learner , what they care about , their unique strengths and quirks and ways of being in the world true , deep , and meaningful learning can never be contained in something so stifling as a standardized curriculum there are some words and phrases i go back to again and again to describe my own life learning experience my learning was always authentic , i say , because it was always learning that felt relevant and interesting it was personalized , unique to me and what i wanted and needed at any given point it was flexible , because i could always choose to learn different things in different ways with different people this kind of learning is pretty much the exact opposite of a pre packaged curriculum it 's learning that is constantly evolving and changing as the learners themselves evolve and change , alongside their family and communities it 's the ultimate in authentic , personalized and flexible learning , better in my mind than any faddish new curriculum or teaching methodology that 's taken those terms as handy buzzwords reading selfie ! if the learners themselves are n't deeply involved in the shaping of their own education , if they are n't able to make important choices about what and how they learn with supportive adults there to give a helping hand , find resources , play games , and otherwise enjoy the ride , then i do n't think learning really can be any of those things it becomes , instead , a pale shadow of what learning should be , as it 's strangled by adults' desire for control over a process they can never truly own , a bureaucratic need for measurable educational progress , and a deep set distrust of children and their innate abilities in this desperate attempt to make learning into something controllable and measurable , not only do we miss out on the richness that comes of learning for the sake of learning , but learning also becomes something that 's complicated in really unnecessary ways the more talk of methodologies and new teaching practices , or the latest curricular advancements and improvements , the more education and by extension learning starts to sound like something arcane and difficult , something that must be left in the hands of well trained experts lest ordinary folks mess it up by not knowing the correct approaches or methods this has always bothered me since in my own life , learning has never been complicated difficult sometimes , confusing on occasion , but never complicated you go where you need to go to get the knowledge and skills you want , which means that sometimes turning to an expert for a specific topic or trade is what will serve you best but the actual process of learning is n't nearly as complex and hard to understand as so many educational experts seem to think or at least seem to want other people to think if you believe that learning is complicated , then you believe that it has to be carefully designed and constructed , which means curriculum but when you realize how unnecessary and actively harmful a standardized curriculum can be , the whole world opens up suddenly there are so many different things you can learn about and explore and do there 's no rush , so it does n't all need to be packed into a certain time frame you can learn from many different people , not just teachers it 's exciting , fun , difficult , sometimes overwhelming , but it is always rewarding outside the confines of a curriculum , i 've been able to focus on what 's interesting and important to me , the things i feel genuinely matter i feel very good about my education , because it 's mine it 's not the education someone else thought i should have that owning of your learning , the authenticity and joy it can bring into your life , can never be replicated by outside forces with big plans it has to come from you , and your own exploration of the amazing world around you a big thanks to sol , chantal , and lua for their editing assistance on this post ! you might also like learning by doing education made real i do n't want to build my own curriculum , i just want to fun is more important than education building life on a foundation of untamed learning linkwithin
