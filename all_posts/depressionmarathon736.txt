it 's almost my birthday another year gone by , another number added to my age i'm not really thrilled about it i'm not too fond of this aging thing i think it reminds me , again , of my lost decade i have all the thoughts about not being where i wanted to be at this point in my life all of those depression resentments resurface and each advancing year feels like i have less and less time to get where i already thought i 'd be i'm trying to let tomorrow be a special day , but all of this garbage successfully sneaks in , too i'm attacking the garbage , and trying to make a special day , by throwing myself a little dinner party with a bunch of sober friends so far i 've got on the guest list i do n't think i 've had people in one place to celebrate me since i graduated from high school ! we 're going to a slightly fancy local restaurant with nice atmosphere i'm really looking forward to it ! i think i 'll bring my newly purchased birthday present to dinner tomorrow night i bought myself a new digital camera this afternoon i had a couple of best buy gift cards , so old i could n't remember when i got them , so i bought myself a sony cybershot it 's half the size of my current digital camera , which is exactly what i wanted i'm excited to try it out new toys , old friends i'm going to have a good day happy birthday to me
