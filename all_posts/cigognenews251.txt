so let s get it straight when we show a symptom such as depression there are two aspects to it the cause the reaction we need to keep this bifurcation clear because they are two different animals and must be treated differently nearly all approaches today are just that approaches , the therapy of reaction so the cognitivists try changing your reactions attitudes and thoughts , aiming at more wholesome ideas neurologists try changing how the brain reacts , i e , interfering with brain function and there are others who put wires in the brain to block deep brain reactions remember these are responses , not causes causes seem to be forgotten in all this , and why ? because the fields have despaired of finding causes and so focus on reactions why the despair ? because without a therapy of deep brain processes they will never find causes it will all remain a mystery they will turn away from origins and just focus on blocking or changing reactions and that can be endless because we need to change the biochemistry , the neurochemistry , neuron signals , overall brain function , psychological responses and on and on all because causes are avoided in the ny times are two articles one in the sunday june , magazine section , and the other in the tuesday science section , july the science section deals with brain function , namely transcranial magnetic stimulation tms see http well blogs nytimes com new approach to depression there are magnetic pulses to the brain from outside that stimulate those parts of the brain that are involved with depression powerful magnets are placed on the frontal area of the head those pulses seem to help many people and are often more effective than medication but it is attacking the responses while the generating sources are left intact , only to rear their ugly head again how could it not be ? it is a therapy of reactions not causes so we cannot expect to be rid of the originating sources it is a good amelioration and that is ok we do not help , but there is a way of getting to those generating sources , why is it paid no heed ? they have no theory for it , no therapy for it , and no psychological readiness for it easier to tinker and tinker they do , tweak this and then tweak that ayayay now the magazine section has a different twist it is called , uncovering the self destructive impulses that many people hide from themselves see http www nytimes com magazine the suicide detective html hmmmm self destructive ? what self might that be ? i guess it is the hurt one , the one containing all those painful imprints from years ago are we trying to destroy it ? wouldn t that be terrible ? they point out that more die of suicide than murder world wide there are one million suicides each year it is an epidemic they want to figure out how to figure out who might kill himself ? what are the signs ? and they add , we have never gone out and observed , as an ecologist or biologist would go out and observe the thing you re interested in page but wait ! that s what we do , and we find the answers when patients get to feelings , deep pain that makes them want to kill themselves and they say , my god that s why i wanted to kill myself all to avoid that feeling so what did the researchers do ? they called up soldiers and asked them to explain why they wanted to kill themselves they hoped to shift through the transcripts to find answers the problem is that they never knew really how could they when the imprints lie so deep in the brain this is basically the cognitive ideational approach it stays on the level of ideas they say that they have had theories of suicide but they want to work on the other end data ok but data from victims ? most of ten they never know i have seen many depressives over the years and they almost never know where it comes from some of them resist counseling because somewhere they understand that it cannot work then they are labeled resistant they don t really want to get well finally further in the piece they say , brain cells that regulate the stress hormone cortisol , leave the brain in a chemical state of increased alertness that causes a person to overreact to stress i am not sure that tells us what to do about it but the direction is right there is acknowledgment that depressives often suffer abuse as children but what from there ? do we attack and or address the abuse ? they go back to faulty thinking and they tout the association test which is again mental operations they are looking for biases against being alive by the victims it all came to naught as these tests were not so hot at predicting future suicide attempts how could they be if they avoid the key low brain level imprints that are at the origin of it all ? so what do they do ? they are tweaking it so they combine several cognitive tests together to refine what they do it is over and over again intellectuals focusing on thoughts and attitudes ignoring a big part of the brain and its function they are after changing patterns of thinking the cognitivists are ruling the roost yet they are the very ones who can never never never find answers
