i love this show i'm sure the style would turn some people off , but if you can get past that , it always has wonderful info , fascinating interviews , and is put together in an engaging way check out past episodes and other cool stuff at submedia tv this particular episode deals with some of the shit that obama has been doing , as well as having extensive info on the olympics and why they 're a bad thing the previous episode , blame canada , was also good i tried to embed the video from the submedia site , but since it 's not working from there , i embedded it from youtube to see the full video , you 'll need to go here my sister and i have decided that we 're going to check out the protest when the torch passes through montreal , since we both want to lend our support peace , idzie you might also like canadian olympics clear cuts political dump aka interesting stuff to my green anti civilization , and what that means linkwithin
