in my last article , i began a discussion about midlife transitions by defining it , giving some of the possible symptoms and possible challenges involved in this article , i 've provided a scenario to illustrate the points that i outlined in the prior article midlife transitions living life the life you want to live the following scenario , which is a fictionalized account that represents many cases with all identifying information changed , is an example of someone who is going through a midlife transition , the challenges that he faced , and how he was helped in therapy ed ed was in his life s when he began to feel a growing sense of dissatisfaction and unease about his life , especially his career after he obtained his mba , he chose a career in finance while he was still in his mid s because he enjoyed his finance courses in college and he wanted a career that would allow him a lifestyle that was different from his parents' lifestyle having grown up in a family where his parents struggled to make ends meet , ed knew he never wanted to live that way , so he chose a career where he and his family could live comfortably during his year marriage , he felt proud that he and his family lived a comfortable life and he put his two children through college without his children having to go into debt he was also glad that he survived many of the changes , including many rounds of layoffs , in his field but ed was aware that he was feeling an increasing sense of malaise at work what once made him happy in his career no longer held his interest midlife transition he began to question whether he was living his life according to his core values and the more he questioned what he was doing in his career , the more he realized that his career choice now felt out of synch with his core values during his time in high school and freshman year in college , ed was involved with volunteer activities that gave him a sense of satisfaction , including volunteering with a reading program where he read to young children in elementary school and volunteering at a no kill animal shelter both programs were important to him because he liked being around young children and he also liked animals during his early years in college , he thought he would choose a major that would be part of one of the helping professions but as time went on , ed decided that it was more important to him to earn a good living and never struggle financially like his parents did , so he majored in economics in college and obtained an mba in graduate school for a time , after he got married , he was able to continue the volunteer activities , which gave him so much satisfaction but after he and his wife began having children and he had to put in long hours at work , he stopped volunteering because he did n't have enough time now , just weeks away from his th birthday , ed realized that he was n't happy at work any more even though he had been promoted and well compensated over the years , his career and his compensation no longer made him happy , and he was n't sure what to do midlife transitions living the life you want to live as he became increasingly preoccupied with his dissatisfaction and after several nights of tossing and turning , he spoke to his wife , susan , about his sense of malaise susan told him that she noticed that he was irritable and grumpy , and she asked him what he wanted to do in response , ed just threw up his hands he did n't know what to do he could n't just quit his job in the past , ed tended to be a goal oriented person and he was n't usually at a loss about what to do when making major life decisions , so this was a new experience for him it was confusing and disheartening , and as time went on , it was starting to erode ed 's sense of self confidence susan suggested that ed consider seeing a psychotherapist to help him to sort things out and make some decisions but ed had never been in therapy before he was concerned that therapy would take a long time , and he felt he did n't want to wait a long time to deal with his feelings so , ed spoke with a close friend , bill , who had been to therapy and asked bill what he thought bill told ed that he was helped a lot in therapy when he was facing a major life decision similar to ed 's dilemma he told ed that there are different type of therapists and different types of therapy he told ed that if he wanted an interactive therapist who works in a dynamic way , he should ask about this when he called to make an appointment and get more details when he went for the consultation even though the thought of going to therapy made ed feel uncomfortable , the prospect of struggling on his own with this issue made him feel even more uncomfortable , so he started looking for a therapist and asking each one how s he worked after a few consultations , ed found a therapist who was interactive and dynamic they worked together to help ed to discover what he really wanted at this point in his life so that he could take action working together with the therapist , ed realized that what was once important to him , working in finance and having a high income , was no longer important to him he liked being well compensated , but the money did n't compensate for his lack of satisfaction at work exploring core values in therapy and developing goals he and his therapist explored ed 's core values and his current interests , and he was surprised to discover that he had been dissatisfied for quite some time , but he was n't allowing himself to feel it with continued self exploration , ed was surprised to realize that his volunteer work with children gave him the most satisfaction he realized that he wanted to set up his own volunteer reading program where adults would read to children to help them develop an interest in books and reading he knew that he could n't establish this program overnight and he would need to do research and write a grant proposal this would take time and effort to establish it would also take time for ed to see himself in a new way for most of his life , ed defined himself in terms of his career he wondered what it might be like for him to see himself in this new way after so many years once ed made up his mind to proceed , he was excited about this new prospect more and more , he could imagine himself happily engaged in this new endeavor he felt his old confidence coming back , and he realized that this new project would be aligned with his core values he and susan talked about this change and they realized that within two years ed could retire from his finance job with a compensation package that would still allow them to live comfortably while ed worked on his new project each week ed talked in therapy about how he was adjusting emotionally to seeing himself in this new way and how he was dealing with the challenges , both emotional and practical , that were involved as he came closer to his retirement , he discussed his idea with his boss and discovered that his firm was interested in contributing financially to the project midlife transitions living the life you want to live by the time ed retired and began his new program , he was feeling more alive and full of purpose than he had in many years he and his wife were also closer and enjoying each other 's company more than ever he knew he had made the right decision conclusion there are as many variations to midlife transitions as there are people who are going through these changes everyone responds to change differently ,
