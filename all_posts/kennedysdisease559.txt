this morning i found an article written by karen weintraub in usa today in a step that has implications for stem cell research , human biology and the treatment of disease , researchers in japan and at harvard university have managed to turn adult cells back into flexible stem cells without changing their dna biology textbooks say that once a cell matures to serve a specific role , like , say a red blood cell , it can never go back into a less mature state vacanti and his colleagues say their new research upends that dogma this study demonstrates that any mature cell when placed in the right environment can go back , become a stem cell , which then has the potential to become any cell needed by that tissue , said vacanti , also of brigham and women 's hospital in boston from a practical point of view , if all it takes is a a change in ph and a change in cell culture conditions , then this will make the process of making stem cells a lot simpler and lot easier to scale yes , there is more research that needs to be done , but if they can replicate the process in humans , this could be another major step forward in the healing process to read the entire article , follow this link usa today
