anybody who knows me knows i'm a sucker for a good meme i love the very word meme , because it contains me in it , twice now it seems a new meme is making the rounds pie started a snowball rolling with his blog post my first content management application , which begat similar posts by jon marks , johnny gee , lee dallas , and cherylmckinnon all telling how they got started in the content management biz i ca n't help but chime in at this point , meme ho that i am back in the paleolithic predawn of the internet , before there was a web , there was fidonet instead of web sites , there were electronic bulletin board systems , and in , i was the sysop of a bbs powered by the freeware opus system opus essentially put me in the content management business , although no one called it that at the time , of course opus was extremely popular not only because it supported the bandwidth efficient zmodem protocol but because it was a highly configurable system , thanks to a one off scripting language that let you exercise godlike control over every imaginable system behavior the opus scripting language was my first introduction to any kind of programming in those days , bandwidth was dear modems ran at and baud and you took great pains to compress files before sending them over the wire the most popular compression software at the time was sea 's arc suite , the code for which went open source in arc seemed adequately fast it would process files at around kbytes per sec on a reasonably fast pc , which is to say one with a mhz processor until a guy named phil katz came along with an arc compatible program that ran six to eight times faster in a matter of a year or so , almost every bbs switched from supporting arc to supporting pkarc sea sued phil katz for copyright violation katz had violated the terms of the open source license and a major legal fracas ensued bbs operators , unsure of their legal exposure , did n't know whether to stay with pkarc or go back to the much slower arc and risk losing visitors being young and foolishly optimistic , i decided to write my own compression and archiving software for the use of my bbs customers i decided it would be a good thing , too , if it was faster than pkarc of course , i would have to learn c first thus began an adventure that led toward the path that finds me where i am today , free ranging in the cms jungle as an analyst i 'll save the details of that adventure for another time suffice it to say , i did learn c , i did write a compression program , and it was faster though less efficient than phil katz 's routines , and in fact i won a bakeoff that led to my code being licensed by traveling software for use in their then popular laplink connectivity product katz lost the bakeoff he also lost the lawsuit with sea but he eventually did all right for himself perhaps you 've heard of pkzip ? so to answer a question no one asked except pie , my first content application was in fact a compression and archiving program that i wrote in to support users of an opus bbs that 's what started me down the path of learning c , then java , javascript , html , xml , and all manner of wcruft leading to the purple haze i walk around in today
