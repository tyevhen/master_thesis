crutch i like to drink my brandy mainly straight , a rock or two to cool it , a small glass , no snifter , i don t need to demonstrate by swirling and sniffing that i have class i think i drink less when i drink it straight to weaken it with cola or ginger ale tends to make me underestimate how much alcohol i will inhale i wonder , what with all the medication i m taking , why i need another crutch i m far beyond the help of education i drink because i drink , and i drink too much suffering is served straight without a mixer is that why i dilute it with elixir ? this morning i have that disgruntled feeling that no matter what i do it will be unfulfilling and trivial i ve already deleted most of what i d written in today s post that reason it s a feeling of restlessness , of casting about for the next thing , then discarding it for lack of interest of taking up a task only to quit halfway because it seems pointless this is a state i have recorded before in these pages , which often presages an ascent out of melancholy , for which i obviously hope that i can hope puts me at no worse than three kilorats at four one begins to lose hope at seven all hope is a cruel joke at nine the only hope , which is not hope , is a hope for death as i have said before , i have never had a major depression that sputtered so in recovery part of the reason is medication when my pain management doctor puts me on oral narcotics i find them hard to resist , as being out of pain is wonderful nothing else has ever worked for me but if i go off them my mood plummets this has happened twice in these seven months , and i ve sworn never to take them again for that reason , as physical pain is infinitely preferable to emotional pain , in my estimation but i m human , and as the poem above explores , open to temptation anything that may temporarily improve my mood , or ameliorate my physical pain , is hard to resist this writing about myself is tedious but it is a discipline in my depression , and however trivial i regard it , it is not nothing while occupied with my post i don t hear the voices arguing in my head and i don t have the space to hate myself at three kilorats , c e chaffin
