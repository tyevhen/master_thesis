i wrote a micro rant the other day at cmswatch com on the need for an industry standard syntax for plain language keyword search i , for one , am tired of learning a different search syntax for every site i go to i find myself naively assuming like an idiot that every search engine obeys google syntax not true , of course it 's a free for all out there for example , not every search engine ands keywords together by default even at this simple level a two keyword search ! users are blindsided by products that behave unpredictably at any rate , lars trieloff pointed out to me yesterday that apache jackrabbit the java content repository reference implementation , which underpins apache sling implements something called gql , which is colloquially understood to mean google query language , although in fact it means gql it does not implement google 's actual search syntax in comprehensive detail it merely allows jackrabbit to support plaintext queries in a google like way , so that if you are one of those people like me who automatically assumes that any given search widget will honor google grammar , you wo n't be disappointed it turns out , the source code for gql java is remarkably compact , because really it 's just a thin linguistic facade over an underlying xpath query facility gql java does nothing more than transliterate your query into xpath it 's pretty neat , though i'm all for something like gql becoming , say , an ietf rfc , so that vendors and web sites can begin implementing and advertising support for google like syntax first there will need to be a name change , though google already uses gql to describe a sql like language used in the google app engine there 's also a graphical query language that has nothing to do with jackrabbit nor google see what i mean ? it 's chaos out there in query land
