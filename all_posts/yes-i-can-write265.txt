in case you did n't notice , i just put up a new poll , asking what are you celebrating this holiday season ? go on and vote ! and by the way , i thought i 'd put a nothing option i know i was planning to when i posted the poll , but i forgot just so you know , i do realize that some people do n't celebrate anything at this time of year , it was just an oversight on my part , and now that people have voted , it wo n't let me change the poll in other news , i have tons of post ideas swirling around in my head , and if they continue to swirl around in there they will soon actually make it into blog posts ! some of the things i'm planning on writing about are a bio post for each of my family members , because they 're incredibly important to me and important in my day to day life , but i realize that i 've very rarely talked about each of them as individuals ! that means a post for my mom , my dad , my sister emi , the cat henry , and the cat minni as you may have noticed , i 've also put a tidy about me link at the top right of my blog following that , i want to have a link to a post talking about each of the labels i use most often , and that are listed in my blog description unschooling , vegetarianism , animism , green anarchy , and being a hippie a post talking more about my personal spirituality , creating your own spiritual experiences , rituals , and ceremonies , and similar stuff like that language usage , grammar , spelling , etc , how people look at people who use good versus bad grammar , how important or not i think all that is swearing , bad language , my feelings on all that and i know that i'm forgetting at least a couple of the things i 've been thinking about ! i'm rather tired and feeling a bit under the weather , so please excuse me for general poor communication s anyway , hopefully most of this will actually makes its way onto this blog soon p peace , idzie you might also like new poll ! several things of note bits and pieces linkwithin
