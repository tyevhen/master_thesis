hi friends ! lately i 've been working hard to juggle being an artist with being an at home mom boy , do i suck at it ! lol ! trying to put your full attention on several things at once has been a recipe for disaster in terms of stress , frustration , anxiety and overall dis ease sigh ! ! ! ! something always falls to the side the kids , or my art , the household tasks , my relationship with my awesome husband , or my sanity it 's something i pray about all the time and have been experimenting with for the past years i 've sort of come to the conclusion that there 's no easy way to do it all or do it all well so , i 've made a deal with myself to just set my art career onto the back burner until i can devote more time to it once the kids are in school , i will have more time devote the proper attention to my goals it 's not fair for me or on anyone else that i try and push a square peg into a round hole this means that i am going to paint and create when the mood strikes during free time as a hobby i will be cooking up ideas on the side when there 's room to spare this will free me from my own personal constraints and pressures and get me back to focusing on what matters most to me the well being of my children , our home , and my mental health it 's hard because i want to be able to do it all , but i need to have the strength to admit that i'm not able to do it right now i have to give myself permission to wait and be ok with it in that spirit , i did some painting on saturday and these are what i came out with early summer countryside x inches , acrylic on gallery wrapped canvas the storm lifts x inches , acrylic on gallery wrapped canvas both are abstract a style i am embracing with all its surprises i love to show the mood of a scene through light and color the landscape is always changing depending on the sky , the weather , and the time of year that is the beauty of nature and it 's just so fascinating i 've come to know that i want all of the art i make to bring joy and peace to someone else it 's that simple through my prints , my paintings or my cards i have a way to share a thought or image that might lift someone else up in some way and that is a wonderful blessing i hope you are well ! ! ! save
