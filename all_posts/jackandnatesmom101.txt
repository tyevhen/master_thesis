i have n't been mentioning nate 's progress much lately i do n't want to jinx myself so i am still not going to go into much detail about what we are seeing or not seeing instead i am going to tell you a happy little story when nate was about months old and infants and toddlers first came to our home for the initial therapy the therapist was able to ellicit one word from him she would say ready , set , and nate would say go ! then he stopped then he started then he stopped he has done this off and on for the last two years , but it 's been about months since i heard it last i was feeling inspired to push him a bit this morning while we were outside waiting for his bus so i started saying this each time he was gearing up to run a lap i dragged out the period between set and go a little more each time , and it did seem like he was pausing to wait for the word before he started running again so the next time we did it , i dropped go just to see what would happen did he say it ? he sure did ! this alone makes me very happy , it 's always nice to see something click , especially after such a lapse but it gets better as we went on , he kept saying it , but he looked at me like lady are ya gonna say it ? each time before he finally said it he was totally checking in with me , and clearly he totally got the concept because he never ran before the word go i know all the parents with nonverbal kids out there are cheering right now in fact i think i hear them short but very sweet happy friday !
