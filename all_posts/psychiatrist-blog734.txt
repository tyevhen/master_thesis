perhaps you remember that line from mr ed 's theme song ? a horse is a horse , of course , of course , he 'll give you the answer that you endorse i'm tired of talking about the same old things at shrink rap , so here 's a horse of a different color and you thought clinkshrink did all the bad punning ! over on the clinical psychiatry news website , there 's an article by m alexander otto about a study done in a state hospital in new jersey on horse therapy otto writes in all , patients worked with three specially trained therapy horses for weeks in a corral built on campus for the purpose they didn t ride the horses , but instead saddled , brushed , and put them through various activities the weekly sessions lasted about an hour the horses couldn t tolerate much more it was hard work for them , dr schleifer said the project was part of a larger trial in which patients were randomized to either horse therapy , dog therapy , standard care , or off ward group therapy , just in case the mere act of taking patients to a different part of campus necessary for the dog and horse groups made a difference in violence you can surf over there if you 'd like to read more i found it disturbing that this treatment was being tried if it bothered the horses
