i started this blog on january , , with a poem , called i have depression if you 've read it , you probably noticed the lines , i am not depressed i have depression sound familiar ? one of the problems with the perception and acceptance of depression as a biological , treatable illness , as well as the stigma surrounding this illness stems from the word itself depression it is a common , everyday word with common , everyday usage and meaning or is it ? from merriam webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary depressed adj low in spirits sad specif affected by psychological depression depression n c an act of depressing or state of being depressed as a a depressing down lowering b a state of feeling sad dejection a psychoneurotic or psychotic disorder marked esp by sadness , inactivity , difficulty in thinking and concentration , a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping , feelings of dejection and hopelessness , and sometimes suicidal tendencies c a reduction in activity , amount , quality or force a lowering of vitality or functional activity i have been speaking publicly about depression for at least years one of the main points of every single talk i give is this depressed is a feeling depression is an illness despite making that point a thousand times , this is actually the first time i 've looked it up ! phew ! webster 's confirms it ! depression is a noun it is a state of being depressed is an adjective it describes the state of being in other words , it is a feeling , and therein lies the problem everybody on the planet has been depressed ! just as everybody 's been happy , sad , angry , or frustrated , all of our family and friends have been depressed therefore , our well meaning usually family and friends think they know what it is we are experiencing ! a person without a cancer history would n't think to comfort a friend with cancer by saying , well , when i had cancer , all i did was because she never had cancer , and she understands she has no idea what the cancer patient is experiencing ! however , that same person , assumes he can comfort his friend with depression because he 's been depressed before hell , everybody 's been depressed at some point in time , right ? right almost everyone has experienced feeling depressed when i ask students if they 've ever uttered the words , ugh , i'm so depressed today , every hand in the classroom goes up when i follow that question with , yup , me too , but i'm not depressed today , i get self satisfying quizzical looks then i say , but i still have depression today after that statement , usually or light bulbs flicker in the eyeballs before me by the end of my talk , i make sure all of the light bulbs are aglow depressed is a feeling depression is an illness a biological , treatable , mental illness , which unfortunately shares its nomenclature with a very common feeling i never say , i am depressed when i talk about my illness , i talk about my symptoms i talk about how i am feeling about my symptoms i talk about my mood i talk about my thinking i tell my doctors about my eating , sleeping , fatigue , exercise , concentration , aches and pains i never say , i am depressed i am not depressed i have depression and by the way , depression sucks
