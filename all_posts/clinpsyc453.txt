a recent study tiihonene et al , am j psychiatry compared aripiprazole abilify , methylphenidate ritalin and placebo in the treatment of amphetamine addiction here are the study results quoting from the abstract patients allocated to aripiprazole had significantly more amphetamine positive urine samples than patients in the placebo group odds ratio , ci , whereas patients who received methylphenidate had significantly fewer amphetamine positive urine samples than patients who had received placebo odds ratio , ci my problem with the abstract the abstract concludes with a positive statement about methylphenidate , but says nothing about the drastic ineffectiveness of aripiprazole i ve not read the article , so i cannot say anything about what its actual text i can say , however , that when a drug is related to drastically worse outcomes than placebo , as was the case for abilify , then i think a statement should be put into the abstract s conclusion about this finding this is related to one of psychiatry s big problems focus on the positive sometimes in a distorted manner , and ignore the negative i ll have to get the full text and look further abilify s performance why would people taking abilify be so much more likely to use amphetamines compared to people taking placebo ? well , if i m big into amphetamines and somebody puts me on a drug that includes sedation , akasthisia extreme agitation , tremor , restlessness , and potential extrapyramidal symptoms movement disorder as side effects , i can see how someone who likes amphetamines might be tempted to jump back into the amphetamine habit methylphenidate s performance using a minor stimulant such as ritalin makes some sense in that you re following the same logic as replacing heroin with methadone replace a more dangerous habit with a less dangerous one ritalin might help some folks get the stimulant effect they re looking for without the dangers of methamphetamine use however , there s no free ride there are likely some issues with long term use of methylphenidate as well , though i d rather be a regular ritalin user than a so called meth head
