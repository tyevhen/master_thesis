this is part of a simultaneous site post on shrink rap today over on the psychology today website , i talk about how high volume , rapid care psychiatry shows us at our absolute worst , and i report on survey results about how psychiatrists in maryland are practicing please be forewarned , this was from an emailed poll and the data was not validated or verified , but it is interesting ! on shrink rap news over on the clinical psychiatry news website , i make a case for why psychiatry residents should be required to learn how to do psychotherapy even if they do n't plan to practice it when they finish training we really do n't even have a precise definition of what psychotherapy is , and cpt coding has defined it in terms of time spent in a session and reimbursements a minute session gets coded as which stands for minute psychotherapy session with medication management on an outpatient basis in a physician 's office the frequency does n't matter , nor does the content of what transpires at least not for the cpt codes but certainly , not everyone who comes for a minute sessions is actually in a formal insight oriented psychotherapy good care involves listening to the patient before making decisions about medications , and seeing patients an hour , lined up on a conveyor belt , hour after hour , regardless of the patient 's need to talk or the complexity of the case is no way practice psychiatry and i personally would n't have the stamina those who do it have bought in to an insurer 's idea of how the world should work in fact , very few psychiatrists in maryland reported that they practice this way , even if the media would have you believe that this is the norm in psychiatry i like to think of psychotherapy as a process over time where the talking itself is part of what heals certainly there is something about talking openly about things which may be troubling , embarrassing , or leave one feeling vulnerable , which is helpful , particularly in a setting deemed to be safe and free from negative judgment from the psychiatrist 's point of view , psychotherapy is about looking for patterns in thoughts , feelings , behaviors , or reactions , and bringing these patterns to the patient 's awareness in a way that may allow him to change obviously , i think psychotherapy is important to psychiatry please do check out the other posts on shrink rap news and shrink rap today you are invited to comment on any , or all , of the websites while you 're here , please take our sidebar poll and please do let us know if you have an active psychiatry blog or know of any for our list thank you for participating in today 's ring psychotherapy post !
