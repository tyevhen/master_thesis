i have been taking extra quetiapine and today i have reached a happy state i think about all the troubles , all the changes at work , the closer supervision and the thoughts leave my mind as soon as they enter to hold any thoughts in my mind i have to struggle and put some effort in i'm happy for now i feel so much better and relaxed i'm still a little concerned about work but maybe not concerned enough rather than too much , or maybe just the right amount of concern , who knows ! ! ! this is bliss i can rest it is just like my brain has gone on holiday i'm starting a list of things i need to talk to my new supervisor about next week my manager has not said anything about my diagnosis , i 'd prefer to know a little about whether he is being sympathetic or just looking at this as another problem to overcome still a little anxious here i 've decided to ask for help when needed and believe me if their attitude towards me changes i will take it all as far as i possibly can through any courts that will listen and the legal system i'm sedated but not stupid and not a push over this being patient and waiting is only possible because of the meds i'm worried that i am too self centred too ! all my effort goes into managing the illness i do n't often get time for anything else i went to see my friend tonight but i could not talk to her and she did not appear interested
