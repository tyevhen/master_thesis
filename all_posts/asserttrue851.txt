i finally had an opportunity to use yahoo pipes to do something useful the quest create a super feed that aggregates a bunch of different google developer blogs in all , including ajax search api , gears , gadgets , opensocial , open source , mashup editor , web toolkit , app engine , google code , igoogle , desktop , and data api blogs and show the most recent entries for each of the blogs also make a searchable version of same , so that you can do a search for let 's say atom across all latest blog entries in the categories i was inspired to create this pipes app plumbingware ? when i saw the recent press release concerning arnoldit 's google monitoring service the arnoldit aggregator is dubbed overflight for reasons known only to the cia , perhaps i was disappointed to find that overflight is not available as an rss feed it also is not searchable hence , i went ahead and mashed together my own version of overflight using pipes as it turns out , i was able to create the pipe app in a matter of minutes or so around half an hour longer than i 'd budgeted i did n't have time to aggregate all google blogs , so i focused just on twelve developer blogs the resulting app is at google developer blogs super feed , which you can subscribe to here the keyword search version is here it supports single words or exact phrases i confess i was skeptical , at first , as to whether the performance of a pipes app that draws together content items from feeds could possibly be acceptable it turns out to be amazingly fast even the queryable version is fast i have yet to run a keyword or key phrase search that takes more than seconds to bring back results if you have n't tried pipes yet , you should definitely spend a few minutes exploring it it 's a bit klutzy and constraining in my experience , and it 's sure to frustrate many a grizzled java or c developer but as a visual web app designer , it 's an interesting approach here 's hoping yahoo takes it a bit further
