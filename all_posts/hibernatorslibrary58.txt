well , i 've been absent from the blogging world since the election besides my pre scheduled nonfiction november posts which i 'd written earlier in the month i 've been experiencing some post election blues it 's hard with bipolar disorder to keep my mood within a reasonable range i went from reading books at once slight hypomania to having not picked up or listened to a book since the election my nonfiction november reads are definitely going to leak over into december now i 've chosen to curb my post election slump by picking up harry potter hopefully that will help out i also subscribed to the economist and the week , both are news magazines which i have subscribed to on and off for years in addition to reading the bible cover to cover next year , i 'll be spending a lot of time reading the news if i can dredge up the money and time , i might add in new scientist , since i love that magazine i know i'm dreadfully behind on answering comments and stopping by blogs i will be out of town this weekend , but i will focus next week on catching up
