last thursday , i went to see a doctor about the pain in my wrist and the numbness in my hand , turns out it 's the ulnar nerve that is compressed my non existent family doctor will need to look into it , in the meantime i am supposed to try and keep my elbow from being bent too long when i go to work , within the first minutes of being there i was crying and desperately wanting needing to go home i was at work from to and off and on all day i was either on the verge of tears or actually crying i need to say that i kinda ran out of the medication which was helping me sleep and keeping my pain level down so i have been trying to deal also my gerd is at an all time high , massive burning , another thing that my family doctor needs to look into so i am sensitive i hate myself for it , but it seems to be beyond what i can control at this point i am exhausted , ibs acting up trying to deal with my totally non compliant son life is too much and work , with the toxic situation i have to deal with there is making my anxiety flare so bad i just ca n't handle it anymore so friday morning i did not go to work took a sick day i do not consider this faking mentally i am not in a place where i am functional , where i can cope with toxic monday , tuesday , did not go to work either told them i will not be going in for the rest of the week i only have two days of sick , the rest will need to be vacation but at the risk of being called childish , weak , accused of not thinking things through , i must take a break i am seeing the psychiatrist on the th , seeing two of them actually , surely one of them will be able to attest that my mind was too fragile to deal with nasty people ok at least attest that i was not in condition to do my job in the meantime i have been keeping myself busy , i have been shopping for a house , trying to fill that void , that need also i have been spending quite a bit of time in my basement , doing laundry and sorting there is still a lot to do and i have not been able to keep at it non stop but i have managed to make a dent in the stuff i have i filled large garbage bags of donate stuff and filled garbage bags of trash from the basement stuff not good enough to donate i also go rid of two older dressers i plan on getting rid of at least that much if not more in the next few days i might move out of the basement and touch other rooms i have also done a lot of laundry i plan on washing all of the massively soiled items from my son 's room about loads of laundry , highly soiled , requiring at times two to three runs through the washer with oxyclean my son tends to not clean himself or his surrounding he also has enuresis , and does not take the soiled stuff out we have to fight our way into his room , risk injury with all the trash and electronic components to get to his soiled laundry hopefully i will have the time and energy to go take some trash out of his room too this is what i call taking a break because i have not been dealing with people much i have been cleansing my home , making it healthier i ca n't do this for long , the need to pay bills will win out , even though the jobs that pay the bills are killing me at least i have the last few days thanks for reading
