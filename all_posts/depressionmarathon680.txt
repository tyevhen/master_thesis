weekends on an inpatient psych unit are quite long it 's been a long couple of days here i have n't had a lot of company , there are n't nearly as many groups , and you can only watch so much tv i 've ridden the bike for an hour both days , and i tried to run on the treadmill last night unfortunately , that did n't work out too well i 've still not recovered from the boston marathon my quads just would n't cooperate and allow me to run i ended up run walking miles before i gave up other than that , i 've done a lot of sleeping besides boredom , i think some of the sleepiness is the result of ect i had my first ect treatment on friday it went okay i felt tired and wobbly afterwards , but i actually recovered fairly quickly i was relieved when i did n't get a migraine headache afterwards i 'd often had migraines after ect in the past basically , i just slept a lot and allowed myself to recover my next treatment is tomorrow that 's about all i have to report my mood is a little better i think being here allows me to relax and heal it is a safe place without a lot to worry about or a lot to do apparently , that 's exactly what i needed right now
