i planned on only having quarterly reviews of my dutasteride experience in the last two months , however , i received several emails asking how it was going for that reason , i felt others might be interested in an update two month update exercise i averaged minutes every other day with minutes on the alternate days strength my neck , arm and leg strength has been the best in over a year every day highs lows none ! i has been steady as you go every day that , in itself , is wonderful side effects nothing negative that i can determine overall i find it hard to believe how good i feel every day the best word i can use is amazing fourteen months and counting is has been fourteen months since i started taking dutasteride the day i started i also began a journal to record my experiences the journal has been helpful in evaluating how dutasteride works for me these last two months have been actually better than my first three months and those days were very good
