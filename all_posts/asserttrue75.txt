over at truth out org , there 's a tremendous interview with john perkins , whose well known book , confessions of an economic hit man , reveals how international organizations such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank actually operate in the s , perkins worked for boston strategic consulting firm chas t main , where he allegedly identified , and went after , international opportunities for lenders specifically , the imf his story is disputed by various establishment spokespeople of course on the other hand , it aligns quite well with specific case studies explored exhaustively by naomi klein in the shock doctrine , which tells a very similar tale of how imf and the world bank work hand in hand with a predatory corporatocracy as perkins calls it to subjugate debtor nations john perkins the perkins interview provides interesting background for understanding what 's happening now in greece and other debt ridden countries an excerpt is presented below be sure to see the full interview at truth out org and the video at the end of this post michael nevradakis in your book , you write about how you were , for many years , a so called economic hit man who are these economic hit men , and what do they do ? john perkins essentially , my job was to identify countries that had resources that our corporations want , and that could be things like oil or it could be markets it could be transportation systems there 're so many different things once we identified these countries , we arranged huge loans to them , but the money would never actually go to the countries instead it would go to our own corporations to build infrastructure projects in those countries , things like power plants and highways that benefitted a few wealthy people as well as our own corporations , but not the majority of people who could n't afford to buy into these things , and yet they were left holding a huge debt , very much like what greece has today , a phenomenal debt and once they were bound by that debt , we would go back , usually in the form of the imf and in the case of greece today , it 's the imf and the eu european union and make tremendous demands on the country increase taxes , cut back on spending , sell public sector utilities to private companies , things like power companies and water systems , transportation systems , privatize those , and basically become a slave to us , to the corporations , to the imf , in your case to the eu , and basically , organizations like the world bank , the imf , the eu , are tools of the big corporations , what i call the corporatocracy and before turning specifically to the case of greece , let 's talk a little bit more about the manner in which these economic hit men and these organizations like the imf operate you mentioned , of course , how they go in and they work to get these countries into massive debt , that money goes in and then goes straight back out you also mentioned in your book these overly optimistic growth forecasts that are sold to the politicians of these countries but which really have no resemblance to reality exactly , we 'd show that if these investments were made in things like electric energy systems that the economy would grow at phenomenally high rates the fact of the matter is , when you invest in these big infrastructure projects , you do see economic growth , however , most of that growth reflects the wealthy getting wealthier and wealthier it does n't reflect the majority of the people , and we 're seeing that in the united states today for example , where we can show economic growth , growth in the gdp , but at the same time unemployment may be going up or staying level , and foreclosures on houses may be going up or staying stable these numbers tend to reflect the very wealthy , since they have a huge percentage of the economy , statistically speaking nevertheless , we would show that when you invest in these infrastructure projects , your economy does grow , and yet , we would even show it growing much faster than it ever conceivably would , and that was only used to justify these horrendous , incredibly debilitating loans is there a common theme with respect to the countries typically targeted ? are they , for instance , rich in resources or do they typically possess some other strategic importance to the powers that be ? yes , all of those resources can take many different forms one is the material resources like minerals or oil another resource is strategic location another resource is a big marketplace or cheap labor so , different countries make different requirements i think what we 're seeing in europe today is n't any different , and that includes greece what happens once these countries that are targeted are indebted ? how do these major powers , these economic hit men , these international organizations come back and get their pound of flesh , if you will , from the countries that are heavily in debt ? by insisting that the countries adopt policies that will sell their publicly owned utility companies , water and sewage systems , maybe schools , transportation systems , even jails , to the big corporations privatize , privatize allow us to build military bases on their soil many things can be done , but basically , they become servants to what i call the corporatocracy you have to remember that today we have a global empire , and it 's not an american empire it 's not a national empire it does n't help the american people very much it 's a corporate empire , and the big corporations rule they control the politics of the united states , and to a large degree they control a great deal of the policies of countries like china , around the world john , looking specifically now at the case of greece , of course you mentioned your belief that the country has become the victim of economic hit men and these international organizations what was your reaction when you first heard about the crisis in greece and the measures that were to be implemented in the country ? i 've been following greece for a long time i was on greek television a greek film company did a documentary called apology of an economic hit man , and i also spent a lot of time in iceland and in ireland i was invited to iceland to help encourage the people there to vote on a referendum not to repay their debts , and i did that and encouraged them not to , and they did vote no , and as a result , iceland is doing quite well now economically compared to the rest of europe ireland , on the other hand i tried to do the same thing there , but the irish people apparently voted against the referendum , though there 's been many reports that there was a lot of corruption in the case of greece , my reaction was that greece is being hit there 's no question about it sure , greece made mistakes , your leaders made some mistakes , but the people did n't really make the mistakes , and now the people are being asked to pay for the mistakes made by their leaders , often in cahoots with the big banks so , people make tremendous amounts of money off of these so called mistakes , and now , the people who did n't make the mistakes are being asked to pay the price that 's consistent around the world we 've seen it in latin america we 've seen it in asia we 've seen it in so many places around the world this leads directly to the next question i had from my observation , at least in greece , the crisis has been accompanied by an increase in self blame or self loathing there 's this sentiment in greece that many people have that the country failed , that the people failed there 's hardly even protest in greece anymore , and of course there 's a huge brain drain there 's a lot of people that are leaving the country does this all seem familiar to you when comparing to other countries in which you 've had personal experience ? sure , that 's part of the game convince people that they 're wrong , that they 're inferior the corporatocracy is incredibly good at that , whether it is back during the vietnam war , convincing the world that the north vietnamese were evil today it 's the muslims it 's a policy of them versus us we are good we are right we do everything right you 're wrong and in this case , all of this energy has been directed at the greek people to say you 're lazy you did n't do the right thing you did n't follow the right policies , when in actuality , an awful lot of the blame needs to be laid on the financial community that encouraged greece to go down this route and i would say that we have something very similar going on in the united states , where people here are being led to believe that because their house is being foreclosed that they were stupid , that they bought the wrong houses they overspent themselves the fact of the matter is their bankers told them to do this , and around the world , we 've come to trust bankers or we used to in the united states , we never believed that a banker would tell us to buy a , house if in fact we could really only afford a , house we thought it was in the bank 's interest not to foreclose but that changed a few years ago , and bankers told people who they knew could only afford a , house to buy a , house tighten your belt , in a few years that house will be worth a million dollars you 'll make a lot of money in fact , the value of the house went down the market dropped out the banks foreclosed on these houses , repackaged them , and sold them again double whammy the people were told , you were stupid you were greedy why did you buy such an expensive house ? but in actuality , the bankers told them to do this , and we 've grown up to believe that we can trust our bankers something very similar on a larger scale happened in so many countries around the world , including greece read the complete interview here also , see john perkins being interviewed here have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ?
