there is more and more evidence that brain tissue at the extreme anterior front part of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for integration of emotional states work of a yale team , patricia goldman rakic and pasco rakic , focused on the corpus callosum the bridge between right and left brains , in which they developed a model of symmetry in the brain cells in the corpus callosum are marked so as to attach to mirror image cells on both sides of the brain there may be either a certain resonating frequency that helps each side recognize each other or there may be a chemical affinity that allows cells on one side to join up connect with cells on the other side connected memory may exist when lower level imprints resonate with the same frequencies higher up in the brain when the prefontal cortex and sub cortex meet , there seems to be a pattern of recognition it s kind of like finding a soul mate more possibly , the lower level imprints rise to seek out their other half higher in the nervous system once joined , they form an integrated , unified circuit in an excellent book by david darling called equations of eternity hyperion press , , the author discusses how nerve cells and more specifically axons behave different groups of axons must be able to recognize different signposts , or else most axons in the nervous system would grow in the same place evolution has sited many different receptor molecules on the surface of nerve cell , each of which will stick to only one specific molecule the result is that nerve cells have a guide that directs them toward connection with other cells all that is required for connection is that other nerve cells have matching receptor molecules the cells are able to ignore all other non matching nerve cells darling goes on to point out that these cells go on to establish a skeletal nervous system upon which all subsequent fibers can build this is one way that each new level of consciousness elaborates on previous levels thus axons grow from the lower level brain tissue to its proper target darling states that these cells know when they have arrived at connection because the receptors on axons are found only on the correct target nerve cell he continues by unfolding stages , the brain organizes and interconnects itself even in the womb , he believes , the brain is preparing itself for when it comes into daylight i will quote further because what he states in a neuro philosophic way dovetails precisely with our clinical observations already , the individual has recapitulated , while in the womb , the physical evolution of all life on earth now it is racing through the stages by which life evolved mentally the stages are from mindlessness to shadowy awareness to consciousness of the world , to consciousness of self each new level is an elaboration of the previous lower level until we arrive at full consciousness critical here is the concept of connection the merging together of related neural networks without lower level connection to higher levels , we are only considering the late developing cortical brain and not the brain as a whole he points out that in our personal evolution , the brain is racing through the stages of all of human history in primal therapy we race through the stages in reverse only it is not a race it is more like a crawl no one can make a connection insight for us it must come out of a feeling , and it must do so in slow orderly fashion when the patient has the connection , we know it is time when the insight is forced by a therapist , it usually is not the time organically it defies evolution ideas come after feelings , not before what darling points out is that truth is an unbroken reality neurosis manages to fragment that reality disconnection feeling therapy reestablishes that total reality there is a unity of nature that happens only with connection neuro psychologic laws do exist it is up to us to find them let us sum up some of the key points up to now early events even before birth are imprinted throughout the system and largely onto the right brain these events can occur before there is a functioning left pre frontal cortex to make sense out of them and by the time we do have that portion of the cerebral cortex the pain on the right , severe because it involves matters of life and death at birth and before , is repressed and results in a disconnection between the two sides , and from lower to higher brain centers moreover , the connecting links are not as yet matured this process is called repression or gating or , as it is often called in the scientific literature , dissociation the right brain , then , becomes the repository of the unconscious becoming conscious means reconnecting the pain to conscious awareness connection means awareness even when the event has no words or scenes we can be aware of a lack of oxygen during birth or of the agony of being twisted around due to breech presentation that awareness is every bit as crucial as an awareness of events at the age of six even though there are no words to explain it sensing the pain is awareness it doesn t need words connection cannot be achieved when the connecting cable corpus callosum has been impaired or thinned out due to early trauma once the event has been dissociated , the right lower brain areas have a mind of their own that is , the energy of the pain innervates the heart and key organs and begins the ever so subtle damage so that years later there is a serious illness and no one seem to know where it comes from suddenly the person develops high blood pressure or heart palpitations , or worse , a stroke because the origin is so remote , one could never dream that it was due to a birth trauma the treating doctor says , have you been under stress lately ? not that i know of i use the term crucible when referring to the womb because it encompasses various elements , molecules , and organ systems it is broadly systemic it forms and directs later development the prototype sets the tone or the stage for what comes later a twin i saw was left in the womb after his twin sister was pulled out they had no idea he was in there this was decades ago he waited a long time and death threatened later his parents never offered any love or touch he felt he waited for that as well , something that never came the urgency of that wait was based on the life and death struggle in the womb the crucible that gave the trauma its force later on he was sent away to boarding school at age six and waited years to come home to family the family rarely , if ever , visited the school as an adult any waiting was excruciating one night he was going to make love to his girlfriend , but first she had to go to the bathroom the inordinate wait put him back into old feelings he was waiting for love literally , and he lost his erection and could not get it back the wait triggered off waiting for his parents to come and take him home from school , and then set off the prototype of waiting to be born the original reaction during the prototype was that he could do nothing to help himself weak and helpless impotent there was an imprinted lower stratum of helplessness and hopelessness from that time on when the early pain was provoked , the precise early reaction was also set in motion it is not simply that the pain of the trauma is stimulated all the way down the chain of pain , but also the whole panoply of reactions with it they are an integrated whole
