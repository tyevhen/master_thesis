on march th , i wrote a post to aetna i am not in your network about how i was trying to reach aetna to clarify that i am not a psychiatrist in their network i wanted this clarified because i was getting so many calls from people asking to see me because i am listed on aetna 's website i called and called again , but the voicemail prompts left me with no where to go when i reached a live person , i was told that network services would contact me within hours that never happened i wrote in through their website nothing and finally , i contacted the maryland insurance commission , who contacted aetna , and a real live , very helpful person at aetna did in fact call me so i spoke to the real live person at aetna who had a name and an direct line phone number why did they think i was in their network ? people have to apply for this , and i had no memory of filling out paperwork the real live person , whom i fist spoke with on march rd , clarified that i had been an aetna provider through two clinics where i had once worked these are different from my private practice , and participation is based on the billing address so i was registered as a provider at an outpatient clinic that i left in , and at another clinic that i left in hmmm , so why did they have me registered at my private office ? well , apparently last may they received a claim form for out of network services and a clerk 'updated' my file , added my address , phone number , tax information , and voila ! i was an involuntary aetna provider no worries , the real live person would fix this and call me only that has not yet happened so the aetna referrals continue to come , and this continues to take up my time as i call prospective patients back only to explain that i'm not actually in their network so i called back the real live person it 's been weeks , and still i'm listed as a participating provider on their website how long can it take to remove someone from a website ? ah , they 'll work on it and call me the days go by , and then the weeks , and aetna , i'm waiting update on phone call from aetna saying they had taken me out of their system
