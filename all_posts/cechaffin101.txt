i have n't blogged in a while , have been to la and back first a poem from my old home town before the long beach grand prix stripes of light interrupted fall on shaded grass under the grandstands as if it were a highway marked in fluorescent green a faux lighthouse warns no one motor heads will come from bellflower , agoura , pasadena to watch man wed machine in a growl of gears and a squeeze of brakes topped in poles with chain link , concrete barriers line the course chances are no car will tumble over yet as in bullfights there is always the unspoken , hidden rush of cain down where we keep the dark things that keep us up at night , a burning body maybe the aztecs had nothing on us human nature does n't change , does it ? in individual cases we see moral progress , but mankind taken as a whole has not , by the average or median improved at all the numbers are larger , though it 's doubtful that the proportions have changed million in germany and poland , , in rwanda , god knows how many in iraq , mao and stalin directly or indirectly killed somewhere around million need i go on ? so many of us live with the delusion that we are getting better when the fact is that we have n't changed in years it is a delusion in most cases , still an optimistic override obtains for the individual what we call hope still a hope to be better is already the hope of one above average in charity as i said to my men 's group when asked what i wanted out of the process , i said i want you to help me be a better man i'm not comparing apples and oranges here exactly there is a moral law but absolute comparisons between sinners' relative virtues is prevented by one 's personal psychology and limitations , each person 's uniqueness , inheritance , and dna those who wish to improve themselves spiritually i salute know only that humility is the first grace without it we are lost and no one has monopoly on truth it can come from anywhere , truly from the mouths of babes and love is a gift of grace grace is god 's unmerited favor toward the human race notice unmerited , which reduces us all to equals just as the law was designed to do by its impossible demands now for another poem impostor i dreamed of a frail old man in a charcoal suit of expensive cloth of outmoded cut , hands spotted with age , for cuff links , crucifixes his thin white hair was combed back and his sympathetic visage made you feel as if nothing were your fault money was changing hands somewhere he sought to distract me with a grand fatherly smile i knew he was the devil this poem was based on an actual vision i had while chained to a hospital bed and shot up with haldol in a manic spell it still rings true to me the devil is kindness itself , save for the strings that pull you into slavery most of us give up a piece at a time few if any actually sign a contract the devil does n't need your signature , only your guilty deeds he is called the accuser of the brethren he 's that voice inside believers that intimates you have something special with god , or alternately damned forever both narcissistic traps , i might add i was in la to fight for grandparents' visitation rights for my seven year old grandson , jacob i have not been allowed to see him by his father since my daughter rachel 's death in july it all goes back to jacob being bitten by our dog while in mexico under my watch therefore i am not to be trusted with jacob in the father 's personal mythology and the biting incident in question occurred in , and jacob has no visible scars nor was he traumatized emotionally because of how we handled it he still loves dogs besides , kenyon had never bitten anyone in his life but jacob provoked him and kenyon only behaved like a pack animal , grabbing the smaller and younger pup by the head for discipline unfortunately it did not go well when the judge issued his ruling in court i broke out in tears and wept openly you are a cruel man , i said and walked out weeping it took a while to compose myself while my lawyer tried to encourage me that now we must go to trial to prove my bonding with jacob means our relationship is in his best interest and we need a judge with the balls to step out of line a bit from the traditional i has a premonition that this round was going to go this way as the court date approached i felt heavier and heavier i was not surprised at the ruling thankfully my daughters cheered me up afterwards because i felt as if i were on a precipice staring down into a depression , uggh ! cluck , cluck ! kazooey ! as it turns out , my tears were normal feelings and my daughters said they would have done the same i'm glad my manhood allows me to cry in public over things that need to be cried over man needs his jungian anima , his feminine side , to be complete this is the theme i 'll be suggesting for the next men 's retreat over and out at kiloneutral , ce
