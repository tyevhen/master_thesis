i 've mentioned it more than once you guys routinely mention it , especially recently so i guess it 's time to talk more about it it is isolation depression it is so isolating no matter how open i am about my illness , depression leaves me feeling detached , alone , and different whether at home alone , sitting in a room full of patients and coworkers , or participating in a busy , friendly outing or get together , i feel isolated isolation is painful unfortunately , my isolation is only increasing with each passing day the longer this depression episode continues , the more painfully detached i feel here 's the thing people , by nature , want to help but people , by nature , also expect consciously or unconsciously to get something positive from their efforts despite all of the words of wisdom , the encouragement , and the hugs i 've received from friends and professionals , i 've had very little positive to offer them in return i ca n't tell them i'm better , which i'm sure is frustrating if it 's frustrating for me , it 's got to be frustrating for them as a result i find myself wanting to reach out to others less and less the longer this depression episode lasts , the less i want to talk and the less i think my friends , family and even professionals want to hear it 's human nature when they do n't see any changes from their efforts , listening to my woes must become more tiresome and more burdensome what else can they do ? we 've done it all despite hospitalizations , med changes , ect treatments , and talk therapy , i continue to feel so , so low it 's hard to imagine continuing forward this morning the painful isolation really got to me i had to leave work before i even signed in i began crying on my drive to the office i stopped at a friend 's house within blocks of my facility i cried , we talked , and i attempted to pull myself together ten minutes later my friend sent me on my way and i soon walked into my office i was minutes late and feeling fragile , but i thought i could do it i was wrong feeling like an idiot and totally overwhelmed , i sat in my office in despair with tears rolling down my cheeks my assistant was kind enough to find my supervisor , and with her permission i left after a few hours home in bed , i returned to work this afternoon there were simply too many patients who needed to be seen for me to miss an entire day somehow i made it through four hours of patient care now i'm home again feeling exhausted and alone nothing else has been accomplished today , but nobody wants to hear that it is what it is i 'd like to sleep a long , dark , quiet sleep it seems there 's nothing else to do at least i'm out of ideas i'm tired i'm alone and i do n't want to talk about it anymore i just want it , depression , to go away
