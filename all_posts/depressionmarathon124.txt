i'm getting ready tonight to get away i'm going to visit family this weekend , which may or may not be a good thing is n't that the way with families ? i'm hoping for a nice , not too stressful weekend i 'll be in one of my favorite places on the planet , duluth , minnesota , so that should help it 's been a long week i'm still not quite right with all the recent stresses in my life i'm still not sure i'm coping the best on top of that , the antibiotics i'm taking for my tooth infection have made me so nauseous it 's been difficult to eat , and unfortunately , just as difficult not to eat i'm uncomfortable either way it 's exhausting i'm tired , and i 've not been able to rest i worked everyday this week , as i'm covering for my assistant who is on vacation so besides working days , rather than my usual , i 've also treated almost twice as many patients as i normally do feeling mentally stressed and physically under the weather has made staying focused and patient at work challenging i'm thankful tomorrow is my fifth and final work day and while i'm not looking forward to traveling tomorrow , i am padding my weekend with an extra day off so if the weekend turns out to be less than restful , i know i 'll be coming home to a quiet , totally unscheduled day i'm almost looking forward to that day off more than the weekend until then , i 'll keep putting one foot in front of the other and do my best to get through
