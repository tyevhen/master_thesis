in an earlier post , we defined pms and pmdd , and briefly discussed their etiology here , we will look into the treatment of pms pmdd while there are many pharmacologic treatments of pmdd , non pharmacologic approaches may often be considered first indeed , just like mild to moderate hypertension is often first treated with lifestyle modifications like exercise and a low sodium diet , pms pmdd is often improved with the following lifestyle modifications regular aerobic exercise times a week good sleep hygiene , i e , establishing a consistent sleep schedule dietary changes limiting alcohol , caffeine , salt , chocolate , red meat , and eating smaller , more frequent meals with complex carbohydrates avoiding stressful activities situations during the premenstrual period these interventions can often be started in the months or menstrual cycles during which a patient is completing the daily symptom ratings needed to confirm a diagnosis of pmdd , and for some women , they may be enough to control their symptoms we have had patients ask us about whether certain vitamins and dietary supplements like vitamin b , calcium , magnesium , chasteberry , soy are helpful for pms pmdd symptoms for most of these supplements , there is no consistent evidence from research showing that they are are better than placebo , and some may carry risks vitamin b at high doses may lead to peripheral neuropathy and there is only low quality evidence that it may help with pmdd symptoms , so it is not recommended calcium supplementation has benefits beyond those on mood symptoms , but high doses may increase the risk of heart disease soy was found to have reduced physical symptoms but not mood symptoms in women with pms pmdd chasteberry vitex agnus castus may also be more helpful for the physical symptoms rather than mood symptoms of pmdd some other therapeutic modalities that have been considered in the treatment of pmdd include group or individual psychotherapy , acupuncture , yoga , and bright light therapy there is little research evidence available for most of these treatments , but bright light therapy in particular has shown some promise , and psychotherapy has shown promise but with small effect sizes
