i 've been in corrections long enough now that my name has become inextricably associated with prisoners free society clinicians occasionally call me and the call goes something like this i was supposed to see joe blow and he did n't show up for his appointment could you check and see if he 's been locked up ? or joe blow 's sister called and said the police picked him up last night could you make sure he gets his medicine ? for all practical purposes , i 've become the local lost and found for psychiatric patients that 's ok i like talking to free society clinicians , particularly the part where i tell them yeah , he 's already been seen i saw him the day after he got locked up and his meds have been ordered there 's always a bit of a silence at the other end of the line , or a general expression of surprise people are so used to hearing stereotypes about correctional mental health care universally negative that they ca n't believe a system could ever possibly work well on my end of this process , i have a wish list i wish that clinicians who call me about their patients' medications would actually know the medications that the patient is on as in , the name , dose and frequency i wish the free society medication regimen would make sense granted , psychiatry is as much of an art as it is a science so psychopharmacological approaches can vary reasonably between reasonable clinicians , but i see some med combos that do n't come close to reasonable i get patients from free society who come in on subtherapeutic doses of two or three medications from the same medication class , or on meds with no proven efficacy for the diagnosis the patient has been given and i am responsible for making treatment decisions given this history sometimes i change medications from what a patient was given in free society i know this is heresy , and it tends to engender suspicion from my patients and or concern from outside parties , but i do it i do it when i want to give treatment that is consistent with current practice guidelines and research i do it when there are known contraindications or potential complications like addiction associated with the free society regimen i do it because sometimes the patient actually may require less or no medication once he she is abstinent from drugs and alcohol i do it because i am responsible for doing what 's best for the patient , even when the patient demands care that is outmoded or even inappropriate yes , i change things but sometimes things need to change not his real name duh
