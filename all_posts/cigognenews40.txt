recently i wrote on the dangers of hallucinogens one of the more long lasting and well known of them is lsd , lysergic acid diethylamide let us go on to examine what these drugs do i have noted previously that we have a chemical in our brains , serotonin , that fights off pain by blocking its effects and when serotonin gets depleted in the internecine battle against pain at the time it is imprinted , we begin to suffer our bolstering chemicals are empty usually , without too great a load of pain , our internal pain blocking system will manufacture more and we feel better but with many compounded experiences of agony , a carrying mother who is chronically anxious , or a drinker , we become in great deficit then we go to a doctor who writes a prescription for more of it he does not know that the chemical was the same that was depleted at birth or in gestation , but he does know it works and the level of pain engendered by trauma early in life , mediated in part of the brainstem , is so great that it takes powerful drugs to shut it down enter serotonin it makes its dainty step into the neural armamentaria to fight the good fight sometimes it is not enough , so we double it , or more often add to it with other tranquilizers and soon we become addicted too soon we grow addicted , and too soon we grow smart enough to know about the battle it is forever a losing one until we fight the right battle where on earth is that ? inside of us the fight between imprinted pain and its adversary pain blockers and what is another name for those blockers ? oh yes prozac plus dozens of others and what does lsd to ? it attaches to serotonin receptors to soften and mollify their effects in effect , it pushes down on the activating part of the hallucinogen and controls its egress it keeps us from feeling yes , that is what repression does it blocks feeling it does that naturally against great early suffering , even before birth so we see the cemented faces that portray a lack of feeling and we know there is pain there , in the same way that we see the faces of those on hallucinogens who block feelings i have written about this as blocking the gates of pain and the deficit in this blocking action produces what i call leaky gates it is leaky gates that help produce addiction they allow the ineffable lower level pain to escape its total capture just imagine when drugs blow the gates wide open then we see indescribable agony sometimes , we do not see pain we see what the pain does to te top ideational level producing bizarres ideas and beliefs god is a way by which we measure our pain several theories exist on how drugs actually act in the brain and body these are by attaching to cells called receptors , interacting with cellular enzyme systems , or affecting the chemical properties of the outer cell membranes goldenberg pages many drugs are believed to combine with chemical groups within the cell or on the cell wall these drugs combine with specific agents known as receptors the theory is that these receptors actually attract the drug by having a molecular shape that fits with the drug this is sometimes known as the lock and key theory think of the shape of a key that will only fit into a certain lock when the correct shaped key and lock are matched up then the lock can be opened the receptor theory is much the same a certain shaped drug molecule is attracted by a receptor site on the cell wall when the two shapes fit or line up together , the drug acts the same way as a natural body chemical does to set off a chain of events the key here is that the drugs mimic what our body should have done if we were loved as infants or even before let me repeat some tranquilizers somehow mimic what we should produce naturally for example , the naturally occurring body chemical acetylcholine combines with receptors in the membranes of muscle and nerve cells that are chemically specialized to receive it certain synthetic drug agents can duplicate the action of acetylcholine by combining at the cell wall these drugs are sometimes referred to as agonists they boost the action of the cell the antagonist , in this case atropine , competes for the receptor site which normally accepts acetylcholine it says , get out of the way i will now take your place for the moment it will block or dislocate the normal physiological function why dislocate ? because the energy and its tendency still exist but must be diverted somewhere it noses around finding another vulnerable place the person acts out by overeating , is made calm by drugs , and then suffers from high blood pressure sometimes the attack site is not apparent until years later there are drugs that can block the receptor site and interrupt its effect if there is too much stimulation and we feel that we are about to jump out of our skin , there are medications that can stop that stimulation the pressure is so much from inside that we literally feel that we need to get out of our skin it is the message lodged deep the nervous system that is doing it , mostly of not being loved or early trauma , a chronically depressed mother both while carrying and afterward , for example not being loved has always to do with not having needs fulfilled from lack of oxygen at birth to lack of touch right after birth there is a timetable of needs that form a critical window when they must be fulfilled once past that window needs can only be fulfilled symbolically feeling unloved cannot be eradicated in adulthood by more love primal pain blocks its entry one way to rid of the feeling of being so anxious and agitated is to slow down or stop the transmission of messages between neurons nerve cells so that the message of pain which stimulates does not reach higher levels we then feel calm even though a grand tumult is going on in lower brain centers we never change the pain , only the appreciation of it that is why we can take tranquilizers and pain killers and feel good , but damage is still going on no matter what we think or what we think we feel , it is an unreal state in cognitive insight therapy they change the way patients think they feel , not the way they really feel to change the way they really feel means pain if there is no pain there is no addiction or need for a drug that is calming the aim of therapy must be to establish fluid lines of communication among the levels of consciousness this communication is a given when we have positive experiences from conception on but when noxious stimuli pain intrudes , gating intercedes and blocks information between the levels communication is halted or misdirected , and one level does n't know what 's going on in the other levels the true meaning of holistic is when all levels speak a common language and contribute their share to a single feeling to make a patient whole is a desired goal so long as we know what that means in the brain this is , grosso modo , the overall scheme , the goal of our efforts to be human means to be feeling inordinate , noxious input very early on provokes repression and blocks an aspect of feeling fully feeling beings are not blocked off from any aspect of themselves , that is , there is no massive gating that has sealed away major portions of brain function from access thus , each level of consciousness is able to contribute its share to an experience this means being able to feel great joy as well as sadness it means to sympathize and empathize when a depressive tells us that he is not getting anything out of life , no interests , no joy , we know that he is carrying a load of repression and that repression is the underpinning of depression so what s wrong with taking tranquilizers and pain killers ? their primary job is to gate emotional pain it keeps feelings unconscious the result is that the cortex cannot signal emergency thus keeping reactivity within bounds the key here is that with pain killers reactivity is blunted in order to save the system from massive over reactivity or occasionally , under reactivity that reactivity , when enormous , can threaten one 's life this is what we see in our therapy when defenses are dismantled vital signs mounting to the danger area feelings are responding realistically to some unknown hidden force if we do not acknowledge that force we are helpless before it if we measure lower brain activity we will understand immediately there is tumult going on below decks that we never dreamed existed the ship is sinking there is water below decks and we carry on as if nothing were happening many of these so called soft drugs are ultimately killers quelling the deeper centers with drugs eases the so called thought disorders as our patients ease their defenses in a session , and great pain begins its march to prefrontal areas thinking centers , their cortex will ruminate about this danger or that until they actually lock into the feeling in short , there is an anxiety attack as the system tries to stave off the approaching pain great terror pressing against cortical centers creates paroxysms of obsessive thoughts there 's no space for me i am stuck and no one is helping these often are birth statements but because the actual feeling is so well buried , the person is left only with a vague anxiety she will manufacture things to be afraid of but it is all a rationale in the hierarchy of the nervous system the comparative force of imprints on the different levels diminishes as we move up the scale of evolution thus , something that happens at two months can alter the brain structure permanently , whereas if that same trauma , lack of touch , happens at age ten it will not produce serious brain impairment there is clearly a timetable of imprints depending on the critical period what characterizes the critical period is its irreversibility once the cortex is diminished it is not going to flower in adulthood and the brain scans bear this out there is less activity in the prefrontal area in certain impulse states in our attention deficit disorder research , hyperactive patients we have seen had elevated cortisol or stress hormone levels our research in salivary cortisol , st bartholomew 's hospital , london after reliving very early trauma , including the birth trauma , there is a normalization of cortisol levels so dampening of pain is no longer necessary because the pain is gone shorn of its original power it is now but a memory based on our own research , we can find no other explanation for chronically high cortisol levels other than the imprint there is also a normalized brain system with a better balanced right and left hemispheres we are all of one piece part of an organic whole thus , we cannot isolate one factor , serotonin , or another factor , time off drugs , to make definitive statements about addiction no can we attack only one aspect , lack of serotonin level , to achieve our goals we need to attack the central organizing principle , and then the rest will take care of itself the brain can no longer be considered an isolated organ encased in the cranium but must be considered part of an entire physiologic system thus , when the body is in distress , that distress can be found not only in the brain but in hormones and in the blood system it is our hypothesis that drug addiction is made up largely of early pain , i e , lack of love , and that pain sets in motion its countervailing forces , namely repression when repression is in place but faulty or failing , when the serotonin endorphin systems are inadequate to the task , there is suffering and the need for outside help in the form of drugs to dampen that suffering often the outside drugs utilized mimic the exact biochemicals we should produce internally , and that is what makes it so addicting drugs are normalizing the system we need them we will go to any lengths to get them , even risking jail the strength of internal imprinted pain can often be measured by its opposing forces the repressive system it is the dialectic again pain provokes its opposite and turns feelings into numbness then the person feels like she is in a bubble and cannot reach out of real life it is all grey and dull that is the price we pay for tranquilizers feeling no pain equals no life
