one difficult aspect of depression is trying to ascertain whether we are getting worse or improving in order to keep track of my second episode of major depressive disorder , i initially kept only a written record in my diary through this i was able to ascertain that i was getting progressively worse , but apart from reading dozens of diary entries written over many weeks and months , i could not see my progress at a glance when i finally went onto anti depressant medication in , which took three tries until my doctor and i could find the right medication for me , i wanted to be able to see at a glance whether the meds were working or not , and whether i was actually improving and as depression is characterised by cycles of 'good' days and 'bad' days of varying length and intensity , when i cast my mind back over the weeks , i could not tell if i was improving or getting worse so as well as keeping a written diary of depression 's details , i also began recording depression 's 'good' days and 'bad' days on a one year calendar i recorded the 'bad' days or parts thereof in green and 'good' days in yellow i also wrote down on which day i began each medication , and when the dosages were increased and the result was very encouraging even though i often feared during the periods of emotionally mentally painful and oppressively dark 'bad' days that i was not improving a simple glance at the calendar revealed that my fears were wrong the proof was right there before my eyes the number of yellow days were increasing i was recovering from depression at last below is the record i kept for and it was in mid feb that i mentally and emotionally collapsed , which was the lowest point of this bout of depression at the moment i am experiencing about three weeks of 'good' days for each week of 'bad' days and the 'bad' days are much weaker than they were previously here is a link for a printable one year calendar for printable calendar
