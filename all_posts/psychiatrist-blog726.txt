to me , it s a pretty poignant , honest question because there are some days that i m not sure how i d answer it to anyone , much less myself as a future educational psychologist , i m a fierce advocate for giving children all the information no , they might not be able to understand the full extent of what you mean at their current age and stage of development , but trust me , they ll appreciate it later one of the most common questions i m asked is about why i don t use the everybody s different response , and there are two reasons in addition to the ones outlined above the first is that i believe that the response undermines the intelligence of a child , and that s the last thing anyone wants to do during critical stages of development , and the second is that i believe that the only way children will learn and understand is to be inquisitive , so i appreciate that with everything in me jacqueline from laika 's medliblog gives us the low down on the question of does soy relieve hot flashes ? the other phytoestrogen interventions were very heterogeneous with respect to dose , composition and type this was especially true for the dietary soy treatment although some of the trials showed a positive effect of phytoestrogens on hot flashes and night sweats , overall , phytoestrogens were no better than the comparisons most trials were small , of short duration and or of poor quality one striking finding was that there was a strong placebo effect in most trials with a reduction in frequency of hot flashes ranging from to the med student at metropolis med posted on action potential about memorable moments as a first year medical student where she lost her cool losing cool hot ! that time the med school dorm decided to test every smoke alarm that time we were assigned pages of reading in one day sarebear posted on across and inside my universe about those times when the doctor patient relationship becomes heated before i get into specifics , let me say that as a patient , when you are sitting there on the receiving end of some heat , or ire , or intense aggravation , or anger , even , it is shocking , bewildering , and causes you to wonder what is wrong with you or what you did wrong , as the patient , to deserve what is happening you are shocked because , if you 've had enough dealings with this doctor about a year , in my first psychiatrist 's case , when this happened you know that he normally conducts himself much more professionally to see and feel such unfettered , intense , unpleasant emotion , directed at you well to say it is bothersome is an understatement rachael watman from the john a hartford foundation blog wrote about the hot topic of helping hoarders , profiling the work of monika eckfield rn phd i interviewed adults age and older , six men and women my oldest participant was most of them lived alone most had hoarding behaviors to varying degrees all their lives when you re living with someone there tend to be checks and balances , and the home doesn t get overwhelmingly cluttered when a person gets divorced or becomes widowed they no longer have the checks and balances other life changes can also exacerbate hoarding behavior julie rosen of bedside manner , from the schwartz center for compassionate healthcare , wrote about the passion behind massachusetts first lady diane patrick and her experience of compassion for the mentally ill submitted by petra langer today , mrs patrick s advice to those suffering from depression is to seek help and to be open to compassion because i admitted my problem , i allowed compassion to come to me , she says not only did i receive compassionate care from my wonderful therapist , i was treated with compassion by those around me and the abundance of compassion i received helped me to recover kimberly grady wrote life at grady stop , look , listen , posted on acp hospitalist the patient presents with a fever and leg pain after a bad pedicure i immediately covered my mouth , forgetting that i was in earshot of my attending then i said it again as i skimmed the abstract of that article the second time , i did n't even bother covering my mouth this damn was n't a damn , i should 've known that ! it was a damn , this dude knew what was wrong with this patient just from the bedside or better yet damn , when i grow up , i'm totally going to roll up on a patient 's bedside and nail a diagnosis just like that ramona bates from suture for a living tweeted her submission about the impact of obesity on breast surgery complications , which she swears is a hot topic in her field overall , of obese patients had a complication compared to only in the control group p after adjusting for other variables , the researchers found obesity status increased the odds of experiencing a complication by times elaine schattner from medical lessons emailed a related hot topic from wired , human milk for sale , where 's the fda ? as much as i think it s a good idea for women to breast feed their babies as best they can , i was pretty shocked to learn about this unreg u lated industry mainly because if a woman who donates milk is infected with a virus , like hiv or htlv , the milk often con tains the virus the infant can absorb the virus and become infected feeding human breast milk from an unknown donor is kind of like giving a child a blood trans fusion from a stranger , unchecked by any blood bank glenn laffel from pizaazz emailed the effectiveness of online health intervention programs , talking about the hot new trend of medical apps , particularly the online videogame , re mission re mission is intended improve medication compliance in teens and young adults with a history of cancer in the game , players control a nanobot within a dimensional body of a young person that has cancer play involves destroying cancer cells and managing chemotherapy related adverse effects like vomiting and bacterial infections by using antiemetics and antibiotics the game purports to help users understand their disease and its treatment and improve their sense of self efficacy they can take control of their disease and the last not quite last submission , from jessie gruman of the prepared patient forum , discusses a hot topic in health care check in the box medicine can the blunt instrument of policy shape our communications with clinicians ? i was impressed this is what every pharmacy should be like except , of course , for the dinginess , the creeping line and the fact that it was so crowded i could overhear these conversations maybe if we got federal legislation enacted requiring pharmacists to offer counseling with each prescription filled , this kind of attention would be the norm , adherence to medication regimens would improve and drug related injuries would be reduced wait a minute someone already had that good idea these last three posts were accidentally left out of the initial draft sorry guys the happy hospitalist was thinking about how to explain those unwritten bathroom etiquette and rules for public restroom to his young son get it ? always leave at least one urinal between you and another person do not look at others while urinating no touching beth gainer in calling the shots is a little steamed about the unintended fall out from a national cancer survivors day just when the marketing of cancer feel good gimmicks cannot get more insulting , there 's national cancer survivors day oops , i forgot to include that pesky little registered symbol romeo vitelli in providentia sent in a radioactively hot post on the history of radium in that healthy glow by , the united states radium corporation had patented the first glow in the dark radium based paint with the brand name of undark between and , the company employed hundreds of female workers to paint luminous watch dials under uncontrolled conditions the workers later known as the radium girls had been reassured that radium based paint was harmless and no industrial safeguards were in place to limit contamination the factory managers encouraged the workers to use their lips and tongues to wipe off the paint some of the workers even went to far as to use undark to paint their fingernails as an odd fashion statement by the time the toxic consequences of radium exposure became apparent , it was far too late for them okay , so that 's the end of our hot grand rounds do have a safe and healthy summer ! be sure to check out next week 's grand rounds host , colorado health insurance insider steve daviss md , co author of shrink rap three psychiatrists explain their work
