recently , i 've been experiencing multiple flashbacks from my youth and i do mean youth , , , and years old the memories first showed up in my dreams before gradually interrupting my daily activities as well for over a week , i 've been trying to understand why this has been happening and what it all means yesterday was particularly disconcerting i was restless , irritable and discontent i was being bombarded by flashbacks , good and bad , one after another i felt like i was going to crawl right out of my skin , and i could n't figure out what was going on by late afternoon , i was absolutely nuts i called a friend i texted with another i sent my doctor an e mail and that 's when it hit me thirty years ago today , , my year old step sister left the house to go for a bike ride with a friend she never returned pam was hit by a vehicle , which ran over her head and killed her instantly my step mother decided to donate all of her organs , so she technically died on september th , but years ago today , this evening , was the day her life stopped i was fifteen pam and i had only been sisters for or years , but we had grown close since the marriage of our parents we had little choice our blended family lived in such a small home , pam and i not only shared a bedroom , we shared the bed it was n't easy at first there was tension but within a short time , things turned around neither of us had a biological sister i had brothers she had one so we bonded i have memories of lying in that bed talking , deep , sisterly , girl talks , almost every night before we fell asleep it was our routine , and in our dysfunctional , unstable home , i know we both valued that time together pam never played sports she never cared but after my athletic , competitive family arrived , we discovered she was an incredible middle distance runner she joined junior high track and routinely ran away from her competition in both the and meters we spent the summer months prior to her freshman year , which she had just begun when she was killed , training together with her entry into high school just under way , pam 's death came at a time of incredible hope and promise it was tragic i do n't always remember this tragic date , but i hope i never lose the memories of my special moments with pam i 've been remembering her and thinking about her all day today she had unlimited potential i wonder what she 'd be doing if she were alive ? what would we be doing if she were here ? imagine miss you , pam
