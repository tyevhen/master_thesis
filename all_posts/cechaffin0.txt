for nearly a week now i have been essentially relieved of depression , but in october of i had a two week reprieve that vanished as quickly as it came , so i am loathe to trust the experience i am unspeakably grateful for these few days but equally concerned about relapse , a concern that curiously might lead to relapse if i let it my therapist says shrink the abyss embrace the abyss embrace the abyss ? the soul destroyer , the black hole , the unworld ? embrace the continuing crucifixion of consciousness ? the horror of unself ? she 's trying to convince me that i have power over depression , but in my experience i do n't it pisses me off that she thinks i have or should have control that 's like blaming the victim depression is mind rape it comes from a place i do n't understand and returns there when it leaves this latest reprieve is a direct result of a change in medication so how can i control the abyss ? i do n't prescribe for myself yet i must do something to insure , further , support my healing what do i do ? how should i act ? what do i say to myself ? in my last reprieve it was the thought of losing my wife that sent me down again that she was n't going to leave me did n't matter , despite all assurances the thought was so devastating that my emotions leaped ahead and took control of my brain and pushed me back into the unspeakable horror of depression i was blindsided where is the punch coming from now ? or is there some way to defend myself ? yet to think defensively is also to give depression power best to accept this day and my improved mood for what they are here and present best to be and not evaluate , not dwell , not presume , neither indulge nor repress but breathe in and out and tell myself that euthymia can be sustained i am so grateful for this relief , i cannot tell you just to have a moment without fear , where my mind is at rest just to go shopping and pick out a few foods i prefer , like anchovies for my salad and artichokes and to cook without the paranoia that i wo n't be able to cook to walk and not look behind me to have the condemnatory committee in my head shut up for once the silence is deafening curioser and curioser , grateful ce kilorats ?
