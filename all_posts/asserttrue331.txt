screenshot from klout com showing my influencers being generated so i was checking my moments interactors on klout com the other day , just like every normal person does every day , okay , when a wait message happened to catch my eye influencers are being generated wait , i said to myself , confused linkedin pre generates my influencers they show me my influencers every day this must mean klout instantiates influencers lazily , just in time which is probably the way it should be , because if there 's one thing you do n't want in your life , at this point , it 's day old influencers damn straight i want lazily generated influencers ! so what if you have to wait a few seconds for your influencers to be generated ? that can actually be a handy thing , because think about it if jehovah 's witnesses suddenly arrive at your door , you can just say i 'd love to talk to you right now , but klout 's almost done generating my influencers they 'll understand i know they will
