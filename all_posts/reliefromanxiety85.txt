i feel anxiety will always creep in one way or another into a relationship whichever kind of relationship that may be there are always worries and doubts that you think of now and then , and this is normal because in some ways it 's kind of a risk you are taking but for some people it can become a bigger issue and i feel that i experience it i 've spoken about these issues with my counsellor and i feel that these issues have come from my childhood and the relationships i have seen around me my anxiety mainly revolves a feeing similar to the fight or flight system and the feeling of needing to run away i guess this is because i feel i may experience a similar thing to what i saw in other people 's relationships as a child and it is my body 's way of protecting itself although i 've slowly improved with tackling this issue over time through talking to my counsellor , my understanding partner and writing numerous pages about , it is still a big issue for me i do really struggle sometimes and i do get really wobbly for a few weeks at a time , with fluctuating emotions and confusion however , i do manage to get through these issues with time and talking the number of hours i have written about this trigger and thought about it are numerous , because a lot of the time i ca n't seem to grasp why am like this and why i get so doubtful i'm extremely lucky that i am with someone who is so understanding of the difficulty is patient with it although this has been difficult to write about , i thought i would share it in the hope that it would help others , but also to see if anyone else has a similar struggle let me know ! amy xx
