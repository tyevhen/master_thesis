the chicago marathon has come and gone it was a great event i enjoyed it , and i 'd definitely do it again i had a decent performance it was n't my best it was n't my worst but i admit , i am a little disappointed i made a couple of mistakes which cost me time in the end that 's one of the reasons i 'd like to do it again , to correct those mistakes nevertheless , i had a good race on a perfectly gorgeous day my first mistake came early , but it was n't entirely avoidable i did n't want to start too fast , probably the most common mistake marathoners make unfortunately , within the first two miles , we ran underneath a couple of very wide freeway overpasses my garmin gps watch could n't get a signal , as we were essentially underground for an extended period of time , so i could n't see how fast i was going i did my best to run conservatively , but instead of the minute pace i was shooting for , i learned afterward that i actually ran an minute pace those first two miles ! way too fast ! despite the fast start , i felt good and ran really well through mile i was on a fairly steady pace unfortunately , my second mistake , which came between miles and , caught up to me by mile for a variety of reasons , one of which was to just enjoy the experience , i stopped looking at my watch after mile for miles , i just ran it was nice , but eventually i had the inkling that i was going too fast , and i began looking at my pace again i should have kept track all along , as i ran mile at a blistering for me pace ! way , way too fast i was enjoying myself , but my day got a little longer after miles by mile , i had to slow to a walk for the first time my legs left me my mile pace gradually slowed i ran and walked the rest of the way to the finish between miles and , four out of the five miles took over minutes on pace to run around most of the race , i ended up finishing in i know i was in shape to run faster , and i have no doubt those fast miles came back to bite me i was very happy to see and cross the finish line d was there waiting for me at the end of the finishing chute that was nice he gave me a big hug overall , the chicago marathon was a good experience the race , which catered to , runners this year , was very well organized everything went smoothly i was satisfied with my result , but like i said , i know i could have done better that 's the beauty of the marathon this was my th finish , and i still have n't got it figured out ! i guess i 'll just have to keep trying
