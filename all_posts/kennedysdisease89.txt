there is an old joke where a patient is sitting in his doctor 's office he explains , every time i raise my left arm above my head , i get this shooting pain that flashes through my body when he asked what he should do about it , the doctor said , do n't raise your arm for several years now , i have this situation where my jawbone will fall out of its socket on the left side this usually happens when i am eating a bagel or something hard to chew see the joke above it does not happen all the time , but often enough to be a concern i can resolve the problem with a slight push on the jaw popping it back into the socket it is not that painful , just uncomfortable well , that is not entirely true if i have a big yawn , the jaw can pop out of place and that is painful until i push it back into place i spoke with my neurologist about the problem a few years ago and he said that this situation was not uncommon for someone with kennedy 's disease recently the same problem has begun to happen at night when i sleep on my left side again , see the joke above it does not happen every night , but often enough to be a problem about a year ago i started doing some jaw exercises in hopes that it will strengthen the jaw muscles so far , it appears these exercises are helping this jaw problem has also become an issue when i see the dentist because i have to hold my mouth open wider than normal during the cleaning and examination fortunately , i discussed this problem with my dentist and he now uses a plastic brace to hold the mouth open while allowing the jaw muscles to relax for years , i had a similar issue with my right hip it would occasionally pop out of joint for a moment when standing up from a chair over time , and with the help of some side strut exercises , the problem went away i am hoping that the same will happen to my jaw problem i realize that it would have been easier to give up bagels , only sleep on my right side , and avoid the dentist , but then i would not have anything to write about
