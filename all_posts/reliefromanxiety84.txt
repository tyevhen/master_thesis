i always have the need to be in control and this just one of the ways i help to combat my anxiety i find that if i am in control , the lesser of a chance that unexpected things will happen to me and the more likely i will be able to know what will happen in the future for example , i often have to plan out what i am doing in the day , or write endless amounts of lists about everything in order to know where i'm at in my head although i do n't mind being spontaneous , and i will go out with friends at the drop of a hat or go on a road trip , i find things that are n't planned , a struggle for example , i am a massive organiser and i like to know who 's , when 's and where 's of an event if i do n't get replies straight away i become sightly anxious as it means i do n't have a complete picture of what is happening in the future and i find that really difficult to cope with i 've always been like this and i'm not too sure why it 's such a big issue , but all i know is that i feel a lot more comfortable if i do have things planned similarly , i have endless lists i have to do lists , shopping lists , work lists , bucket lists , goals and so on the list could go on although this process does help , i find it very tiring having to write everything down and plan everything can be difficult i get frustrated that i feel so anxious and uncomfortable when i do n't plan or write lists and sometimes i just wish that i did n't have to write things down all the time , like other people i have spoken to but , it is part of me and it is something i need to improve , but for the time being , it works for me amy xx
