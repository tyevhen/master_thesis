wearing my favourite phenomenal women tshirt in honour of iwd i 've been struggling a bit around here lately i 've been involved in the endometriosis awareness support scene pretty much since i was diagnosed in march i appeared in my newspaper article about endo in may i met the other canberra endometriosis network co founders around the same time and we tried to start to get things rolling in the act in i managed to get endo into cleo and cosmo , if only small articles syl freedman kicked things up a notch a year later later on that year we had our first yoga classes that got things rolling a bit faster for the network , and in the facebook group started going nuts and we had our first proper meet ups , with more than just a handful of people , at the women 's centre for health matters at last count the network has members but dealing with other life stuff has just gotten too much recently , and i have n't been able to handle my commitment to the network even seeing endometriosis awareness posts everywhere is overwhelming to me at the moment , even though i am so glad that they are out there and i am so thankful for the honesty and bravery shown in the women that choose to share their experience so last week i resigned from the board of the network it was a really hard decision but it 's what i need to do right now to give myself some space to deal resigning inspired me to say yes to another commitment , a panel that i had been asked to participate in at work on international women 's day so when today came around , i did one of these things that i do where i speak first and then overthink later i shared my experience of being dealing with my symptoms with an unsupportive manager , in front of a crowd of at least people the details of which i 'll leave in that room lest i end up on the receiving end of a defamation lawsuit i cried in the process , remembering how hard my life was at the time , how confused i was by the pain i was in and the fatigue i was experiencing , how i struggled to come to work every day , how i cried in the car park for two hours one day because i just could n't cope , how i felt utterly defeated by how hr treated me when i escalated the issue and took it to them it is far and beyond the hardest , most isolating , period of my life so far i just wanted to cease to exist sharing this experience made me cry i 've tried almost to forget that period existed , particularly as none of the issues were really resolved at the time i was frustrated in myself for letting emotion get in the way of me expressing how i felt about some weakness in how my workplace is run i felt like i lost my train of thought a bit , and just felt like a bit of an idiot however , some amazing colleagues of mine in the audience spoke up and shared their own experiences , and i felt like i 'd hit a nerve i thought it would be a prime time to ask the ceo to support people with chronic illness in the agency by arranging training for managers in dealing with employees with chronic illnesses , so i did we ca n't expect managers to know how to deal with people living with chronic illnesses without training , when those people themselves spend their lives learning how to best deal with their illness afterwards i received overwhelming support and i'm thankful to everyone who reached out to me a lot of people called me brave , which i thought was odd since i did n't really think much of what i 'd said at the time later in the day i started spiralling in anxiety a bit , worrying about the fact that i had cried in front of everyone , and that i had addressed the ceo so directly , and been so open about an experience that could reflect so poorly on my employers i started to think that maybe it had been a really stupid career move particularly as i had made some rather black and white comments on feminism as i tend to do when i'm hyped up about these issues i realise that the day to day reality is a lot more grey that all changed when i read a post made by a colleague and fellow member of the network calling me courageous and a superstar i burst into tears i knew that i was being silly for beating myself up , but i could n't stop it it took her posting to snap me out of it i am proud of the person i have become over the past four years since being diagnosed , and i am proud of how open i am about my experiences sometimes i feel a bit dumb for making myself so vulnerable , but i have seen such great things happen out of that vulnerability
