do n't you find it weird that you can phone into work and say that you ca n't come in for a broken leg and it will be accepted and yet you can phone up about your medically diagnosed depression and it could be brushed under the carpet even though the outcome is the same that you ca n't get out of bed ? in my previous job i did phone in sick because of my mental illness that was n't before i had a massive panic attack about opening up about my illness ! but i thought that if i did n't explain it then i would n't be able let them know if i was ill at any point in the future and so i did after this explanation of mine , my past employers were very good and i felt less pressure which provided less triggers and meant i did n't take another sick day but , it was my employer that told my colleagues that it was a cold when in fact it was crippling anxiety and depression and from that point , i put my colleagues straight and explained to them exactly what was going on and in turn , they reached out to me i thought to myself that if i was to live a healthy life i am to tell those whom i work for the truth , and if they do n't want to know , either i do n't need that in my life or in some circumstances , it could be breaking the law and with a law degree , it is certainty a passion of mine to uphold the rights of people in my latest job , my employers have also been very good and understanding the problem still remains is that even though i have told people of my illness and have no issue of it being known , i still have concerns about phoning in sick due to my mental health i still feel this shame that people do n't see it in the same light and i wo n't be believed or that it 's not a real reason , when we all know that it really is i am totally all for having sick days for mental health and in fact , it is a legitimate reason but there is a stigma which makes it appear that it 's not right what must be understood is that there are laws , there is happiness and there is health there are laws to protect us , our understanding that our happiness must come first and our health , that we must not compromise just because another person does n't understand you have every right to take a sick day for your mental health and there is nothing to be ashamed of i have done it before and i am willing to do it again nothing should stop you from living a healthy and happy life , regardless of the stigma that surrounds it and this is something i am campaigning for and allowing myself to be more comfortable with without mental health , there is no physical health amy x
