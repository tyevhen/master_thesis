neuroanatomy was my favorite class in medical school i loved tracing out the brain pathways , figuring out which part did what , connecting up clinical syndromes to what i knew about brain structure and the nervous system i learned all this back in the dark ages , back in the paleontologic age when whales had legs , before comets struck the earth and caused the last ice age the world wide web did n't exist then either i had to learn this stuff by examining the actual brains of dead people , by looking at stained microscope slides of brains and by pouring over books the things with pages , covers and ink rather than web sites so now the modern age is here and students get all kinds of cool high tech stuff to learn with just out of curiosity i scoured the web and put together a quick and dirty list of some web sites that provide interactive imaging of the human brain dang , i wish i had that when i was a med student michigan state brain bank harvard 's whole brain atlas university of florida takes a while to load , flash based , no labels university of washington wayne state university university of utah this one was my favorite atlas it shows actual photographs of gross brain anatomy you can click on the name of the structure and an arrow points to it no neuroimaging to interpret , just identification of gross structures university of michigan columbia brain atlas
