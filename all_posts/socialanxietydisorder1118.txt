marijuana illegal ? washington , dc police arrested , persons for marijuana violations in marijuana arrests now comprised one half percent of all drug arrests reported in the united states of those charged with marijuana violations , approximately percent , , americans were charged with possession only the remaining , individuals were charged with sale manufacture , a category that includes all cultivation offenses , even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use commenting on the figures , norml director allen st pierre said federal statistics released just last week indicate that larger percentages of americans are using cannabis at the same time that police are arresting a near record number of americans for pot related offenses present enforcement policies are costing american taxpayers tens of billions of dollars , ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of americans , and having no impact on marijuana availability or marijuana use in this country it is time to end this failed policy and replace prohibition with a policy of marijuana regulation , taxation , and education norml deputy director paul armentano added , according to a just released rasmussen poll , a majority of american adults believe , correctly , that marijuana is less harmful than booze the public has it right the law has it wrong myth marijuana can cause permanent mental illness fact there is no convincing scientific evidence that marijuana causes psychological damage or mental illness in either teenagers or adults some marijuana users experience psychological distress following marijuana ingestion , which may include feelings of panic , anxiety , and paranoia such experiences can be frightening , but the effects are temporary with very large doses , marijuana can cause temporary toxic psychosis this occurs rarely , and almost always when marijuana is eaten rather than smoked marijuana does not cause profound changes in people s behavior myth marijuana is highly addictive fact most people who smoke marijuana smoke it only occasionally a small minority of americans less than percent smoke marijuana on a daily basis an even smaller minority develop a dependence on marijuana some people who smoke marijuana heavily and frequently stop without difficulty myth marijuana is more damaging to the lungs than tobacco fact moderate smoking of marijuana appears to pose minimal danger to the lungs like tobacco smoke , marijuana smoke contains a number of irritants and carcinogens but marijuana users typically smoke much less often than tobacco smokers , and over time , inhale much less smoke as a result , the risk of serious lung damage should be lower in marijuana smokers there have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana myth marijuana has no medicinal value fact marijuana has been shown to be effective in reducing the nausea induced by cancer chemotherapy , stimulating appetite in aids patients , and reducing intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma there is also appreciable evidence that marijuana reduces muscle spasticity in patients with neurological disorders myth marijuana is a gateway drug fact marijuana does not cause people to use hard drugs what the gateway theory presents as a causal explanation is a statistic association between common and uncommon drugs , an association that changes over time as different drugs increase and decrease in prevalence marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in the united states today therefore , people who have used less popular drugs such as heroin , cocaine , and lsd , are likely to have also used marijuana most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug indeed , for the large majority of people , marijuana is a terminus rather than a gateway drug myth marijuana kills brain cells fact none of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana , even from long term high dose use an early study reported brain damage in rhesus monkeys after six months exposure to high concentrations of marijuana smoke in a recent , more carefully conducted study , researchers found no evidence of brain abnormality in monkeys that were forced to inhale the equivalent of four to five marijuana cigarettes every day for a year the claim that marijuana kills brain cells is based on a speculative report dating back a quarter of a century that has never been supported by any scientific study myth marijuana use during pregnancy damages the fetus fact studies of newborns , infants , and children show no consistent physical , developmental , or cognitive deficits related to prenatal marijuana exposure marijuana had no reliable impact on birth size , length of gestation , neurological development , or the occurrence of physical abnormalities now tell me what justice is in making marijuana illegal answer i don t understand why it s illegal either it s no more harmful than any legal drugs out there but the fact of the matter is , marijuana is going to stay illegal unless enough people are willing to make a stand to change it in general , people are unwilling to do this , because if they stand up for legalization , they are viewed by the rest of society as being a pot head or druggie , regardless of whether or not this is actually the case
