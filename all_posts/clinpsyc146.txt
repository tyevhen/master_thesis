alex chernavsky has written many thoughtful comments on this blog , which i greatly appreciate his latest comment is about the potential zetia coverup , but it could have been written in response to many other topics and been just as apropos i wish i could disagree with him , but i think he has a point what strikes me in these cases is just how little progress we are making i 've been following this stuff for the last years or so , and i see a lot of expos s but not a lot of substantial changes that result from those expos s for example , if you look back to , you 'll see that david willman a reporter for the los angeles times won the pulitzer prize for a series of articles about corruption in the pharmaceutical industry his articles are first rate and are still worth reading today http www pulitzer org year investigative reporting works but that was seven years ago are we in a better position today ? maybe i'm being overly harsh , but i just do n't see a lot of progress made big pharma has corrupted medicine and especially psychiatry and now has its sights set on psychologists
