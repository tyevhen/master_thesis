hey there ! moving on in our tour , next to the reading area we 've placed an old bookcase i painted blue for the purpose of housing paige 's musical instruments since they are out for her to see , she finds it much more convenient to grab them and play with them through the day we plan on adding some more instruments to the shelves soon my old keyboard from my childhood rests on top we pull it down for paige to play sometimes she always delights in hitting all the keys and tapping out random tunes i never realized i would actually like all the noise and welcome it for now anyway , haha ! save you might also like reading corner toy area art corner linkwithin
