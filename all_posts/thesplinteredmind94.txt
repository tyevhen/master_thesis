hanging my head in shame and staying home because i'm not a famous , rich , successful whatever is boring it is so much more fun to get out and mingle with people i'm not sure when i discovered this , though , but it did n't come without a lot of resistance on my part i used to hide at home , certain the world would think less of me because everybody knew that i dropped out of college when i became disabled they also had access to my current bank balance and knew , i mean really knew , how close to zero i rode things as far as i was concerned , everyone was intimately aware that i was a loser , right ? well , that 's what i used to think , because that 's what i believed about myself how stupid for the past few years i 've been attending writers conferences , pushing myself to abandon these foolish fancies and face an inconvenient truth people actually like me i know weird , huh ? so when i learned that my friends , brodi ashton and bree despain , were hitting every author event in the valley and getting invited to dinner , i thought , hey ! i like dinner and decided to do the same i have n't been invited to dinner yet , but i'm sure the invite will come any day now i have to first convince all those authors that i do n't eat with my feet it might also help if i finish a manuscript or two speaking of which , despite raging adhd , i have started and finished a children 's picture book manuscript this month i call it take a hike ! and i am very pleased with it it 's the first new picture book i 've done in a long while the others have been reworked to death today i will send it off to an agent i have a two year old , dusty rapport with and hope for the best it starts off like this
