this is n't a real post i'm going to post the real post tomorrow but it feels like there should be some sort of intermediate thing to prepare everyone for the abrupt change of speed ahead here 's a picture of an airplane i realize that airplanes do n't look like that , but this has been a hard year for me and learning how to draw planes accurately was n't exactly a priority i maybe could have chosen to draw something else , but i started drawing the plane , and there was already too much momentum anyway , i feel like this is becoming way more about planes than i had anticipated let 's move on if , at any point over the last eighteen months , you 've wondered what was happening to me and why it might be happening , my post tomorrow should explain everything i 've been working on it for the better part of a year partly because i wanted to get it exactly right , and partly because i was still experiencing it while attempting to explain it , which made things weird , and i'm relieved and excited and scared to finally be able to post it at this point , you 're all probably wondering what is it ? what 's in the post ? ? is it airplanes ? and no , it unfortunately has very little to do with airplanes it 's a sort of sequel to my post about depression it is also about depression in parts , it might get a little flinch y and uncomfortable , and if i succeed in making you laugh during those parts , you 're going to feel real weird about yourselves but it 's okay just let it happen i want it to happen because it makes me feel powerful , and also because there are flinch y , uncomfortable things everywhere seeing them is inevitable if we can laugh about some of them , maybe they 'll be less scary to look at okay , so that 's what 's going to happen tomorrow hopefully this transition post makes the experience less jarring for everyone as it turns out , there is a plane i had forgotten about it it 's small and not the main focus of the post and the coincidence was entirely unintentional i 'd never tell you there are n't going to be planes while being fully aware that there 's a plane
