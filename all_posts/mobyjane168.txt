thanks so much , ab ! i think i get it ! yes , i do have to face my own demon , which definitely is wanting respect i regarded my financial conduct choices as something deserving of respect by my family , when i got something else , i was thrown into a tailspin now i am aware that a i do n't need sis 's respect b my focus when with family should be on less personal matters keep the money discussions between husband i thankfully , he i are very much on the same page , share many core values ! c taking in these realizations will lessen my fear make me less needy i will then be less defensive uptight i will try to become more aware of game playing i can be so naive my husband says sister is very street smart , he says i am not at all anyway , if i see a game starting , i will remember , play it to lose thanks again for all the wonderful feedback suggestions g dear g i used to do this with one of my relatives she would get so ridiculous sometimes but i never tried to best her after a while i really enjoyed what , at one time , was very painful for me because i ceased to take her comments as an attack i began to think they were funny , then sad , and then my relative came down with dementia and isn t that how these things tend to end why not love each other all along , nasty or demented dear a b i was touched by your experience by your ultimate conclusion you obviously learned to handle the challenges gracefully why not love each other all along , nasty or demented ? but that is n't the way it goes much of the time , is it ? guess its ego you let go of your ego found love earlier you remarked that family is a sacred bond that 's different from the popular notion that family is basically an accident that occurs ! if we do n't like what we got , we need n't worry we choose our friends ! then , we just create a new family ! sincerely g
