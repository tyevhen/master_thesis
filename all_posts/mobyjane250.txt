another great day my cup runneth over however , i know that good thoughts must be maintained not just wished for brainswitching is getting easier i 've been using yes , we have no bananas to withdraw my attention from anxiety when it comes often during the day i relax and imagine the following scene i imagine i'm sitting in emile coue 's garden in nancy , france with all the other patients that come to see him daily i am in a very relaxed state and i hear his voice saying if in the past you have been subject to depression , gloom and melancholy forebodings you will henceforward be free from such troubles if you have sometimes been haunted by evil and unwholeseome ideas , by fears or phobias these ideas will gradually cease to occupy your mind they will melt away like a cloud as a dream vanishes when we wake so will this vain images disappear
