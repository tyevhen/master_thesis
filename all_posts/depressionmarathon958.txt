thanks to your comments and my friend renee 's insistence that i would love it , i did the run , bike , run duathlon this morning and i did like it i'm not ready to say love just yet it was another gorgeous day for a race we 've sure been lucky with beautiful racing weather this summer a crowd of just over showed up , and what an intimidating crowd they were ! holy cow ! those triathlete types are scary with their rippling muscles , tight spandex , and bikes ! i immediately felt way out of my league in my loose fitting running shorts i just could n't run in the big butt bike shorts ! and a loose bike jersey , i'm sure i posed no threat whatsoever in the eyes of the tri crowd the initial run went well i felt good and relatively quick i ran the mile jaunt , which included a fairly decent hill , in , per mile transition one took me seconds the newness of racing a bike was fun i could tell my new bike was up to snuff when i easily passed several people who appeared much more muscled than i i just tried to maintain my cadence throughout unfortunately , the never ending hills , including one long , gigantic hill at the halfway point , were not so fun i could tell my pace was slowing over the last several miles still , i averaged mph for the mile ride not bad , and like i said , i felt like i stayed in front of a lot of decent looking bikers men and women getting off my bike to begin the second run was quite comical i almost fell down as i jumped off my bike i never realized my legs could feel so inept ! it took a good mile , after my second transition , to lengthen my stride to just beyond baby steps ! i ran the second miles in , per mile that was slower than i would have liked , and it sure felt faster than that , but i again passed several people unfortunately only men along the way i was quite thrilled to cross the finish line ! overall , i was happy i finished in , th out of women and nd in my age group but more importantly , i was pleasantly surprised by my ability to handle the course as efficiently as i did i think i'm in better shape than i thought that 's always nice to discover it was a good day , and yes , i 'll probably do it again thank you all for your support !
