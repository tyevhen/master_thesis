when i was , i shaved my head bald it was a quadruple dog dare i did n't want to look like a coward it all seemed like a fantastic idea while it was happening i was the center of attention especially in the eyes of the boy who had dared me to do it i really liked this boy i had liked him since the th grade he had always been cooler than me , which really was n't very hard to accomplish i mean , i wore wolf t shirts , had giant braces and thought that it was socially acceptable to own elastic waisted jeans i do n't know how i came to the conclusion that shaving my head would make things any better i really did n't think it through properly like i said , i really liked this boy i thought maybe i 'd look like demi moore in g i jane i called my mom at work me hey mom , is it okay if i use the dog shaver ? mom for what ? me to shave my head mom um prolonged silence in which i am sure she felt torn between her duty to protect my self esteem and her duty to allow me to express myself it 's your hair sweetie do what you want me thanks my mother passively taught me a very important lesson about thinking things through my friend did n't just use the dog clippers he braided my hair , cut off the braid , used the dog clippers on me and then went and found my mom 's razor in the shower and shaved my head until it sparkled everybody laughed allie is so crazy ! i laughed too look at how silly i am ! i am out of control ! i am so extreme right now my time in the spotlight lasted about minutes that evening , i eventually got around to looking in the mirror i had never been very self conscious i did n't have the fashion sense to know what to be self conscious about but i knew ugly when i saw it i spent about an hour transfixed in front of my hairless reflection i was confused i wondered why i did n't look like demi moore in g i jane was it my jawline ? i calculated how long it would take my hair to grow back i started to weep you can laugh it 's okay the ensuing months were filled with the kind of life experiences that force a person to develop their inside beauty lest they become devoid of any value whatsoever for example , i was waiting in line for the next stall in a public restroom and a little girl started screaming this is the girl 's bathroom ! i soon realized she was screaming at me i looked her dead in the face and said i'm a girl neither of us walked away without significant psychological damage and gender confusion issues despite having my gender identity ruffled , my interest in boys began to intensify looking back , i am so sad for myself the futility of it all was mind boggling my best efforts at attractiveness only succeeded at making me look vaguely like something you 'd see in cirque de soleil apparently , this was n't what the boys were looking for in a girl my friends were getting into makeup not wanting to miss out on the fun and hoping to disguise myself under a thick layer of feminine awesomeness , i joined in we were terribly misdirected in our attempts at looking beautiful , so i ended up strutting around town with whore red lipstick it was like a neon frame for my giant , gnashing braces ! , bright blue eye shadow and a nice , shiny , bald head i think i may have been wearing my wolf shirt sadly , my best attempts at looking feminine and smokin' were not convincing enough i had been selected to play the lead in the school musical that year however , the lead role was a woman and my appearance altering decision made it difficult for me to effectively portray that my teacher gently requested that i give my part to a more convincing classmate instead , i was to play a male role to make it worse , i had to sing like a man all i remember is being up on a stage , fake beard clinging fake beardedly to my face , belting out some annoying song in my best baritone and wondering how my life had gone so wrong so early my hair eventually began to grow back , as hair is wont to do first i looked like a skinhead or cancer patient , then like a chia pet , then like a marine , then like gary busey and finally , kind of girl like i got rid of my wolf shirt i started plucking my unibrow gradually , i began to fit into society again i almost learned how to put on makeup i bought a dress i even got my first boyfriend i think he turned out to be gay , but whatever if i was going to look like a dude , at least he reassured me that i looked like an attractive dude the important point is , i made it i survived the catastrophic ugliness that once shrouded my future in uncertainty and i learned an important lesson about being mindful of the consequences of my actions kind of okay , so here it is in all of its blurry , hairless , dog presenting glory p s i think my dog who was usually a morbidly obese chunk of pure disobedience won that ribbon only because the judges thought i was a cancer patient after the competition , my mom overheard them talking about the poor girl with no hair what do you think she has ? do you think it 's terminal ? my mom interrupted them and said you must be talking about my daughter she did it on purpose there 's nothing wrong with her physically i like how she included the word physically to insinuate that yes , there may be something wrong with me mentally but i definitely did n't have cancer
