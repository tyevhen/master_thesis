happy thanksgiving ! i realized that it 's been a long time since i had a free promotion for my novels , and with black friday looming , i thought it would be nice to have shrink rap jump on the bandwagon with black friday shopping you can do from your living room , and with a great price , too free novels the promotion goes for days now through monday if it goes well , i will set up another promotion for one day in december double billing is the story of a woman whose life changes when she discovers she has an identical twin she never knew existed it 's a quick read with a little psychiatry sprinkled in the book was a page turner because of elegant structure and pacing i really cared about the author s take on things because she is a psychiatrist ? because i ve followed her blog for a while ? which meant that i was interested in the protagonist s thoughts , feelings and actions at times i ached for the mess her life was in , at others i wanted to shake her into action , and then she d find her backbone again , just in the nick home inspection is a story told through psychotherapy sessions in a format that is similar to the hbo series in treatment dr julius strand is a psychiatrist who plods along in his already lived life until two of his patients inspire him through their own struggles to find love i like to read all sorts of books , but books where there 's something in it that reflects a part of me , a part of my life , a part of my experiences , are something i go out of my way to find i have not found any fiction book that does nearly as much to show what psychotherapy is like if you do n't own a kindle reader , you can install a free kindle app on your computer , tablet , or cell phone by going here and then you can read any kindle book you do n't need to buy a kindle to read on your computer , tablet , or smartphone there is is a single link to my amazon page with all my books here the price for double billing , home inspection , and a children 's novel mitch and wendy , are all and can be downloaded instantly both are also available as as paperbacks from amazon , but not for free i'm more than happy to have people download my novels at no cost i 'll be keeping the doctor day gig so please tell tweet blog share the free promotions to anyone you think might be interested finally , if you do read any of the books , please consider putting a review on amazon the promotion starts friday , so it 's off to turkey and family for today wishing you all a gentle holiday
