i am officially a law undergraduate it 's strange to hear myself say these words i have really been enjoying university so far it 's a world away from home and i'm glad i made the move i 'd be lying if i said anxiety is n't something i have to cope with on a daily basis , but i'm hoping to continue to tackle it before it becomes too much of a problem in my every day life at university on the other hand , i have met many different people from all walks of life i have found that some of these have been through similar issues that i have , which still surprises me , even though one in four experience problems with their mental health in any one year i'm lucky to have met people who are as understanding meeting new people has meant i was out almost every night for freshers although it was somewhat out of my comfort zone , i found a good group of people i could and can have a good time with it just shows that stepping outside of your comfort zone is something we should all try once in a while cooking is still something i am getting used to and i'm sure that i 'll get there eventually but , for the moment i reckon i'm a long way from being the next winner of masterchef ! it 's been over a month since moving out and yet it feels longer i already feel i have embraced my independence taxis and buses , food shopping , budgeting , cleaning , joining societies and going to see a new doctor are all a main part of my life now i did n't think i 'd ever be able to get my independence back , but i have i hope that from reading the beginning of my story of anxiety , to reading where i am now will give you hope once , the sheer thought of getting in a taxi would send panic through my body and stop me from moving and yet , i can now get in a taxi by myself i know that it can seem that you 'll never recover and you 'll never be able to do the things you love i have been there but , you will get there over time , you just have to ride the wave with the knowledge that there is light at the end never be ashamed of your journey you 're not alone i will keep you updated with my university journey and i hope to be back into a blogging routine very soon feel free to ask me any questions about my recent move ! you can do more than your mind thinks you can best wishes , amy xx
