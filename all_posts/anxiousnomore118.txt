a few posts back i mentioned how well i have been doing its true , for the last year and a half my anxiety has been all but non existent , or really low and life was good however , its as if by posting on my success the angry anxiety demons became enraged and decided to remind me that they are still around always lingering deep inside for me , sometimes the anxiety war really does feel like you are battling demons inside of you i posted on the panic i had all last wednesday morning , but my anxiety did n't stop there i was hopeful and positive when all was said and done that it was a one time weird phenomenon and that all would go back to normal but it lingered a little on thursday , friday i got a break , but saturday and today it has arrived and decided to stay i have had horrible anticipatory anxiety the whole weekend i am pretty sure that some recent past and upcoming stressors have caused my anxiety to return i am stressing right now over a day long upcoming family reunion in a couple weeks that is about hours away from home its always been a cycle for me where i have really bad anxiety and then it goes away for awhile but it always comes back eventually this time , it had been so long since i have had the really bad anxiety that i had let myself think that maybe i really had overcome the worst and that their were only brighter days ahead the anxiety i was feeling in my life was tolerable and i could live a happy medication free life i think that 's why this setback is hitting me emotionally so hard i am feeling so nauseous and unable to eat anything but worse than the physical unpleasantness is how upset i am over its return i feel so defeated , alone , and like a total failure i feel like i have lost all control over my thoughts and my body i feel like its my fault that the daily anxiety has returned that i did or am doing something wrong and i am a horrible person for having this and putting my family through it i feel like no one around me will understand what i am going through and will just think i am weird i know i am going to have to fight this through all over again and the battle is so hard , so completely life consuming and i do n't know if i have the strength to do it again let 's just say i 've been crying alot a few years ago when my anxiety was at its worst , i only had to worry about me i could waste away to lbs in my work cubicle everyday and deal with my anxiety in the smallest of babysteps i felt i needed to , but this time i have a baby to look after and if i do n't eat , i do n't have the energy i need to keep up with her so there 's some pressure this time so the question is , do i go back on medication or not ? i feel that i should if the daily anticipatory anxiety does n't stop because it is effecting my ability to do the simplest daily tasks however the consequence is that i wo n't be able to nurse my little one anymore and she will have to go on formula for a few months until she can drink whole milk the abrupt weaning will be hard on both of us as opposed to the gradual weaning i was planning on i am planning to go to my doctor tomorrow to talk to him about it and see what he thinks its back , unfortunately but at least this time i have the knowledge and tools i need to work through it and i can remind myself that i have beaten it before and i can do it again i got my anxiety and phobia workbook out and have been rereading it for a refresher it has brought me some comfort today also my husband has been so loving and supportive and that means alot i know there are a lot of you out there with similar experiences and i am so sorry for you let 's help each other battle the demons you might also like dealing with unexpected anxiety setbacks how stress affects the body my story celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip linkwithin
