i am happy to announce that my long string of rejections has been broken by a paying magazine , byline it should be out in july i first sent five poems which the editor found too edgy , but she took the time to say some nice things , even suggesting another venue that 's the kind of editor i sought to be at melic so i immediately re read the guidelines and examples from the magazine , tuned my voice down to some milder pieces , and she took one in other words , if you get your foot in the door , try to keep it propped open does this give me hope ? enough to go on for now the other day i bought an old issue of qlr devoted to david schubert , a man who did little but write poetry , succumbing to insanity and institutionalization by age , and subsequently dying of tb at what 's interesting about the issue is how many prominent literary lights praise him , and how many personal reminiscences paint him as an extreme narcissist diagnosed with schizophrenia , i suspect he was rather bipolar , but he also may have had a narcissistic personality order btw , his later poetry ai n't bad here 's a sample , the opening stanza from predicament their love is exhausted in family , you told me it is true to my experience what can one do ? to be left with the cinders of recrimination for what cannot be returned no , to live without expectation of love that is like a toothache , chronic and infectious to mock your feelings , as someone i know , laughing at us all as sexual maniacs , is but self mockery in googling david schubert poetry i found no less than references listed , which surprised me here 's a comment from john ashbery i do n't think it 's demeaning to call schubert a poet 's poet a poet whom poets in particular treasure for the knowledge of the craft of poetry he can give to a practitioner of it , but also one whose work is open and available to everyone david ignatow strongly identified with him james wright called him a master of silence and inadvertently neglected schubert 's one slim volume of poems was published in , years after his death as a transitional poet between the suprarationalism of eliot and the rationalism of auden to the stark confessionalism of the s , he is an interesting writer , but one i consider more a historical footnote than a major voice what 's interesting about him is his inability to express what he wants to express , how he elliptically misses it and acknowledges the frustration in the same way his later poems are more direct his most ambitious , and one of his most successful poems , is the voyage many influential literary friends strove to have his only volume , initial a , published during his lifetime , but failed some of them sought this purely out of friendship and pity , truly which gives us an insight into what may go on at the top tier of editorial discussion remember eliot went to great lengths to have his mother 's undeserving poems published and succeeded do n't forget jimmy carter , jimmy stewart , hugh prather , jewel , and leonard nimoy as for his private life , schubert had a bizarre marriage in which he was supported by his wife and which included physical and verbal abuse on his part , though his wife remained inexplicably devoted to him most telling of schubert 's inner life is a quote by his good friend , theodore weiss , in a letter to renee karol dated april , it 's amazing , the proportions of david 's ego sitting alone with him , he busy carrying the burden of his 'greatness , ' i realise how terribly much the image of his 'genius' has taken hold of him thus he 's walking me to the subway and suddenly asks me , 'how is it ted , i feel , i am ! such a genius ? ' in reading the verse and life of this relatively and deservedly so obscure poet , there is perhaps hope for all poets striving for some sort of recognition in their lifetimes more important is that we not be deceived or swallowed up by our own narcissism at the cost of reality it is a good thing this man never became a father , for instance then serious poets rarely make good fathers their egos leave little development for the individuation of their children , unless an understanding spouse ameliorates their toxic self absorption i realize this claim is an exaggeration , but i could cite many examples , such as stevens and frost enough for today to the tomb of the the unknown poet ! ce
