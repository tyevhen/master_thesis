resisting autumn november s dying gold has turned to rust and rust to brown the great rains have begun nature hoards its strength because it must but why is nature always boom or bust ? the douglas irises have come undone november s dying gold has turned to rust a little sun would elevate my trust at least the green of firs can t be outrun nature hoards its strength because it must brown skeletons of thistles join the dust the cowslip parsley s white has turned to dun november s dying gold has turned to rust i d love to see a single bulb upthrust to light the forest floor , a change begun nature hoards its strength because it must perhaps i ought to call prometheus to bring us fire and burn this season down november s dying gold has turned to rust nature hoards its strength because it must i think my medication change has had some salutary effect on me although my balance is not so good , my head is not filled with the constant , narcissistic self despite which characterizes depression and my anxiety about everyday tasks seems slightly reduced for instance , yesterday i got up on a tall ladder and cleaned the rain gutters at our rental our landlord is sly when i told him this needed to be done , he simply slid a big ladder in the garage i wonder if i m being used or whether the partnership between the landlord and me is natural in either case , the back rain gutter is pretty helpless as it s protective mesh of wire has fallen down near the bottom of the gutter , inviting redwood fronds to bury it into oblivion the mesh in the front gutter is in good repair , so i didn t have to hand clean the vegetable matter out of its depths i am not well but i don t feel as sick my great frustration has been an html class i m taking at the local community college i just can t seem to get it i sit at the computer and compose code and nothing ever happens on the page as i intended the concept of the cascading style sheet and the document still puzzles me , and i don t know how much of the former i should employ for the latter i have continued in this class during my depression because i know it is good for me , even if my failure to grasp certain basic principles makes me fear i have lost my mind the four great themes of poetry are nature , love , death and god yesterday s villanelle was about death , today s about nature the rhyming was difficult in today s offering but i hope it does not appear unnatural thine in truth and art , craig erick
