in the dopamine primer , i covered the four major dopamine tracts in the brain today i 'll break down the two most important ones to psychiatrists and anyone interested in the fabulous story of human evolution and greatness , the mesolimbic and the mesocortical pathways for simplicity sake as mesolimbic and mesocortical do n't have a whole lot of meaning unless you are versed in neuroanatomy , also because the mesolimbic system ends in the cortex so it is also mesocortical , and that 's hella confusing , i'm going to call them the medial and lateral dopamine tracts respectively the medial tracts go from the center , primitive , animal parts of the brain up to the emotional centers of the brain , and then to the front part of your brain literally the center of your forehead , more or less the lateral tracts go from the center , primitive , animal parts of the brain up around the outside and end up more by your eyeballs more or less both tracts carry dopamine , but the tracts are responsible for somewhat different human behaviors the lateral tracts are responsible for future orientation in predicting events strategic thinking rational , abstract thought focus and control unemotional someone who has an optimal amount of dopamine in the lateral system is going to be self contained , practical , self confident , and able to forgo immediate gratification in order to ensure greater reward later on he or she might be the perfect person to bring with you on an expedition somewhere however , an extreme lateral dopamine type person would n't be the one you might confide in with emotional problems also , on that expedition , if you break your leg and no longer become practical , it might be just a little too easy for he or she to leave your burdensome self there in the wilderness so the dark side of dominant lateral tracts would be grandiosity , ruthlessness and sociopathy the medial tracts more emotional in nature rather than rational thought are responsible for action aggression future orientation in exploration motivation and drive creativity along with paranormal experiences and psychosis hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors euphoria and pleasure seeking a more medial dopamine personality might be a bit wacky , impulsive , and free thinking a hippie or an artist not particularly good at planning , but often compelling , creative and interesting maybe not the first person you would want to take into the wilderness , but perhaps capable of intuitive leaps of logic that could get you out of a real jam and as it is the serotonin norepinephrine right brain tracts that are more responsible for emotional sensitivity and understanding social cues , the medial dopamine dominant personality may not be particularly empathetic , and might wander off and leave you alone in the the wilderness as he or she might think of something better to do the dark side of the medial dopamine dominance would be psychosis , paranoia and irresponsibility keep in mind that these are all generalizations all the tracts interact in complex ways so there is rarely any such thing as a pure medial dopamine personality too much excess in the medial dopamine tracts leads to madness irrational thought , paranoia , loose thought associations , psychosis in just enough excess it is creative genius families with schizophrenics are also more likely to have more creative individuals and many people considered geniuses also suffered madness , such as nobel prize winner john nash , a schizophrenic who had this to say when asked how a mathematician devoted to logic and proof could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages because the ideas i had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did unfortunately , since schizophrenia is ultimately an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease , it is unlikely that a genius suffering from schizophrenia could maintain brilliance for more than a few adult decades it is an interesting observation of previc 's the dopaminergic mind in human evolution and history in that these two tracts seem to line up with freud 's separation of the human mind into the ego and the id the id here being primitive drives of sex and pleasure seeking , loose thought processes , and impulses of the medial dopamine tracts , whereas the ego weighs risks and benefits before jumping into any particular course of action a lateral dopamine action freud 's superego , or the conscience , is more likely more associated with those socially directed serotonin norepinephrine right brained tracts estrogen has a tendency to inhibit dopamine allowing for a greater dominance of social empathy , balance and those norepinephrine serotonin pathways , whereas testosterone will tend to enhance dopamine in the agricultural past , dopamine dominance has allowed for greatness and male dominance previc lists the following famous men in history and their dopaminergic traits alexander the great high intelligence , visionary , motivated , risk taking , self confident , but also grandiose , ruthless , restless , and paranoid columbus intelligent , visionary , motivated , self confident , risk taking , but also grandiose , ruthless , and restless newton extremely high intelligence , visionary , self confident , motivated , but obsessive , lacking empathy and social skills , ruthless , paranoia , and neglected personal hygiene from time to time napoleon intelligent , visionary , motivated , risk taking , self confident , but with delusions of grandeur , ruthlessness , and restlessness einstein extremely high intelligence , visionary ideas , high motivation , self confidence , but had obsessiveness , lack of empathy and social skills , grandiosity , and personal hygiene neglect which brings me to the present day , where is some respects things have flip flopped between men and women , at least in america according to a recent article in time magazine about the sheconomy , young single urban women outearn young single urban men , and while of women aged have a college degree , only of men do there is something going on socially , in culture , environmentally ? i could barely hazard a guess that is making it easier for women to remain focused on long term productive educational goals a dopamine trait in their youth women now own of the businesses in america as women still pay a major career penalty for having kids , and previous generations still control the fortune , women have not cracked the higher echelons quite yet but the generation y numbers could indicate that it is only a matter of time and women still have the estrogen serotonin norepinephrine advantage of better being able to read social cues , which is an a helpful trait in sales , business , and even politics if coupled with enough grandiosity in an agricultural world , vision , ruthlessness and sociopathy allowed for one man to grab all power at the expense of his neighbors , creating kings in a post industrial world , the hyperdopamine advantage may not be quite so simple
