a reader asks if we give advice i hope it 's okay if i copy and paste the question from the comment section of another post , i 'll leave the commenter 's handle out i went to a psychologist or years ago and all she did was tell me what i should do go there , do this , etc she didn t listen to me at all if she had , she would have known that the things she was telling me to do were things that i would never ever do i quit after or sessions i decided to try therapy again about a year and a half ago and my psychiatrist is the complete opposite she has never given me a single word of advice and even when i directly ask her opinion , she will only occasionally give me a straight answer i appreciate the fact that she isn t trying to force off the wall ideas on me , but sometimes i wish she d put in her cents where do you guys stand on this ? i m just curious as to what s the norm since my experiences have been so drastically different thanks traditionally psychotherapists do n't give advice perhaps this differentiates therapy from counseling which does imply that one person knows what 's best psychodynamic psychotherapy is about delving and understanding unconscious conflicts , and it 's done by looking at the process of the material a patient brings to the session rather than go for the superficial and concrete , perhaps there is something to be gained in understanding why a patient wants the therapist to give them advice it 's about understanding the mechanisms that guide the patient , not the specifics so i'm not an analyst , i'm particularly quiet , i tend to say what i think , and i'm a physician who treats conditions that i believe have some biological input to some extent , i have to give advice take this medicine at this time do n't take that medicine with this one , it 'll kill you do n't drink alcohol when you 're taking xanax , that 'll kill you , too i believe that when someone is suffering from a problem in a way that up ends them , they should make it their job to do what they have to get well what helps depression medicine , exercise , sleeping enough , not sleeping too much , structure , being empowered there was a study recently that suggested a link between mediterranean diets and lower rates of depression so i tell people to eat hummus if they like it ! i even suggest a brand because i 've personally taste tested them all and have a strong preference is it awful to admit this ? do i give advice otherwise ? yeah , sure sometimes i tell people who need more structure that they should get a dog dogs are good ya gotta get up and walk them , they 're interactive , they 're entertaining , you have to feed them , they pull people outside of themselves just a little , and they are object of passion passion , i think , is good what have i discovered ? people come to their appointments , mostly they take their medicines , mostly no one really does much more of what i suggest no one has bought a dog because i 've told them to and people who do n't want to exercise rarely do so because a psychiatrist tells them the research says this will help i 'll let you know how it goes with the hummus i do n't think freud would have liked me so i tell my patients what to do sometimes the more salient question would be do you tell roy what to do ?
