project you ! week stop trying to please everyone my children break up for the school easter holidays today , and they bounced out of the door this morning with a definite spring in their step no pun intended ! if you re anything like me , you ll have stocked the cupboards with easter chocolate and hot cross buns , and there will be a vase of beautiful daffodils taking pride of place on the kitchen table two weeks of family time is something to look forward to , and i intend to use this holiday to mix my own goals with special treats for the kids does that sound horrifying ? should i spend the next two weeks entertaining my three teenagers , doing double shifts on the cleaning because they are at home and , therefore , making more of a mess ? maybe i should be slaving over a hot stove to prepare the easter lunch , or perhaps rushing across the midlands delivering eggs to my friends and family we spend fifty two weeks a year trying to please everyone all the time what if you took a time out and used the easter break to do something for yourself ? would the world end ? would the family dynamics fall apart ? i doubt it the kids might relish the opportunity to lounge in their pyjamas for an entire day , and your partner might love the idea of ordering a takeaway on a tuesday night what would you like to do for yourself if there was no one else to please ? write it down you know how much i love a good list , and this is a perfect opportunity to make a note of all the treats , events , visits and stuff you ve wanted to do but put off one of my favourite exercises is to use a full page in my journal and write out my ideal day i don t think of myself as a single mum of three , a daughter , friend or colleague i m just me , shelley wilson , a forty something woman who would love to fill in the blank julia cameron , the author of the artist s way , explains how important it is to our health and wellbeing to fill our well of creativity imagine yourself as a wishing well where every time you do something for yourself you are throwing another coin into the water when you choose to please other people , those magic coins are taken away , and you begin to feel lethargic , stressed and sad it s important to your children , partner , parents , friends and colleagues that you look after your needs before everyone else as i used to say to my holistic clients you can t fix others if you are broken fill your well this easter and do something for you i would love to hear about your ideal day share it with us in the comments and you might just motivate someone else to take that all important time out
