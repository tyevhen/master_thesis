true to brendan eich 's earlier timeline predictions , firefox b now implements javascript , with such new features as array comprehensions fine tuned scoping via let expressions multivalued function returns these are currently available only in the browser , alas , and not in mozilla 's rhino engine rhino has a history of following the ecma standards quite closely , and the js features are not part of any standard yet of course , none of this will be in internet explorer any time soon once again , the firefox folks have made a bold move into unexplored territory , leaving the safe , comfortable , web weenie world of ballmer co ever further behind
