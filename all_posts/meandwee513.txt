hi friends ! thanks so much for your kind comments on my last post ! ! it is so nice to know i have people out there who care and are rooting for us since we 've made our announcement i 've been frequently asked how are you feeling ? i always seem to say oh , pretty good , thanks ! i guess the question is a heavy one for me because i 've felt about a million different things up to now to get the physical feelings out of the way i 've been hellishly tired where i had been going to bed at at night and waking up at in the morning i would then manage to be up for a few hours and then fall back asleep for an hour or two in the afternoon i was feeling like a bear in hibernation ! i 'd wake to nibble on a snack and down bottles and bottles of water and then stumble off into my next snore session i figured this would happen to me , but it just sort of takes you by surprise in terms of the severity for a while , i was also sickly i did n't much throw up just more feeling severely hung over all day and night lots of dizziness and feeling very blah lots of gagging and such i would think to myself geez , this is reminding me of my drunken college weekends except i'm not having any fun the night before thankfully , i have been feeling less and less of this each day i'm also able to stay up a little later at night truthfully , i 've been getting so sick and tired of being sick and tired it 's like enough already ! ! ! but , the larger emotion is one of being grateful when i was feeling the worst of it i would whisper thank you to god so that it was clearly understood how grateful i am that this is happening for us i would say lists of thank yous at night when i got into bed i still do i will never be able to be thankful enough , and feeling tired or sick just reminds me of how lucky we got so , if i need to be sick and tired , then i will be so whatever has to happen i will welcome with open arms if it means a healthy baby in the end emotionally i 've felt lots of things in the first month after finding out our news , i was sick with fear i spent the better part of every day near tears with a paralyzing fear that something was going to go wrong it was truly horrible i tried so hard to focus on the positive and tell myself that this was going to be fine but i 've only ever gotten evidence to the contrary in my past and that 's all i had to go on the nurses at my ob office are so great they gave me lots of reassuring blood tests and i 've had tons of ultrasounds to be on the safe side measuring the bleed i mentioned in an earler post as the weeks have gone by , i 've gotten a little more confident and a little stronger now , i am allowing myself to believe that this is real that i'm not an imposter pretending and playing at pregnancy for the longest time i had a hard time admitting i was even pregnant because i felt like it would just be over soon anyway , so why even say that i am ? at my first prenatal appointment , the nurse was giving me all these papers on pregnancy and forms about childbirth classes and such i said why are you giving me these ? in a joking manner she said well , believe it or not you are pregnant and things are still looking good ! i felt like a poser as she handed me sheet after sheet of information it 's like i was n't really in my body and i was watching it all happen after months of wringing of hands , grinding my teeth , and sweating it out , i'm finally able to say i am pregnant and i'm feeling optimistic i will never assume i will bring a baby home at the end of this anything can happen , and i understand that i take each day , one at a time and i silently say thank you every night each day i have this baby with me is a huge blessing and another day where i got to be so lucky i am starting to believe and that is scary but i must believe , i need to believe ps the nurse called with our first trimester screen ratio results we screened negative for trisomy and negative for down syndrome but , the odds ratio i was given was for down syndrome so , they want to do a follow up ultrasound level ultrasound to check things out in detail sigh i will also have more blood work done i'm telling myself that this is common and will be just fine but why could n't i have just gotten a call that said everything is great ! things do n't seem to pan out that way for me there is a worry in the back of my mind now , but i know that all will be right in the end the scan will happen on dec st when i go for my anatomy scan and find out the sex hopefully one more month ! one day at a time , one day at a time save you might also like noah 's birth reflecting the soothsayer linkwithin
