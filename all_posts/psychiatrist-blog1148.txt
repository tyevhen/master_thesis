to roy with love from the new york times well blog when your doctor twitters ! or better yet , that blog post references an article by pauline chen called medicine in the age of twitter it talks about social media and doctoring i think we 're all a little hesitant here i started a listserv among psychiatrists i know recently , and it 's slow going people have asked if they can be sued and blogging , well , you know only a handful of us are doing that so i liked the new york times reference pieces and thank you all for the kind feedback on shrink rap and you ! and my three shrinks will be back , though probably not for a while
