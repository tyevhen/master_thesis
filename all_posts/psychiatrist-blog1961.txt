posted by dinah when i met clinkshrink , in the last millennium , she was the proud owner of two lovely cats , eli and zac , may they rest in peace and , yes , eli short for elavil , and zac short for prozac , were named because of their antidepressant properties i think there was someone named spike in there too , maybe after a peanuts character ? memories so clinkshrink , a devoted catatarian , never got new cats , kind of amazing it turns out that she has bad allergies to cats , and was living a congested , droopy life , now all better without the cute little critters and now the good news , from today 's hot off the press new york times they 've made hypoallergenic cats ! ! for a mere , clinkshrink can order a sneeze free kitty ! let 's hope she passes the interview one brief suggestion , friend when they come for the home visit , you might want to turn off dexter catatarian , by the way , is my own neologism related to cats and humanitarians
