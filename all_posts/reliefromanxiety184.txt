first of all , i cannot believe it 's been a whole month since i 've posted anything i 've been so busy revising for exams amongst various other things , that i had ran out of time but , i am back and i will try to stick to the usual blogging timetable for july , even though it 's going to be quite busy thanks for sticking around ! some of you had tweeted me , writing how you 'd like to see some of my travels of the summer and thus this is what i 'll be doing ! it wo n't necessarily be focused on mental health , but rather the trips i have taken first stop is lanzarote apart from the few cloudy days , it was really hot and i must say it 's nice to have a break from everything the majority of the time we stayed in the resort , but did make a few trips to go to the market and another to puerto del carmen , which seemed somewhat influenced by the british with cooked breakfasts and roasts on various cafe menus ! the food at the hotel was excellent and so were the staff , i just wished i had brought my cycling gear so i could explore more of island the mountains appeared to be changing every day it was very picturesque meeting the regular cats and birds was a nice extra along with getting to know some lovely people ! anxiety seemed to play a minimal part in the holiday , which was a nice change there was one night in which i felt very on edge , but i managed to follow some breathing techniques to avoid a panic attack generally however , i really enjoyed myself lanzarote is a small island , but it 's still unique in it 's own way and in many ways is very beautiful i 've included some pictures of my trip below let me know what you think ! best wishes , amy xx
