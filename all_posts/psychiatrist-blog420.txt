clara lieu is an artist at rhode island school of design she has this amazing gift of observation for example , she has this series on her website claralieu com called waiting here is how she describes it i am interested in the contradictions found in waiting figures even though these figures stand in very close physical proximity to each other , it seems apparent that there is a significant emotional distance between them each figure seems locked within their own existence , unaware and unresponsive to the other figures surrounding them yet simultaneously , waiting in a line creates a situation where the gesture of one figure leads directly to the next , creating a fluidity between all of the figures i am engaged by the individual and group anxiety that seems to permeate such silent and still scenes so true my first iphone line was like that she also completed a very impressive series of drawings and sculptures called falling this series , unlike her others , are very personal , based on her own experience with depression she emailed my three shrinks to let us know about her work i was so impressed that i asked her more about herself and the motivation to show such an intimate view of her anguish i developed depression and anxiety at a young age , and lived with the condition for most of my life before being diagnosed and treated just a few years ago it was startling to see myself clearly for the first time , free from the disease only at that point did i have the emotional distance that allowed me to to be in position to address this subject artistically i knew at that point that i felt an uncontrollable drive and compulsion to make the work falling was an unusual project me for in that it was told from a very personal , intimate perspective unlike my previous projects , which approached the subject matter with an emotional distance depression is something that happens privately , behind closed doors it 's a secret that most people keep hidden and never talk about in public unfortunately here 's still a social stigma associated with depression that causes people with depression to conceal their true emotions from others on a broader level , i'm looking to open a dialogue about a topic that is rarely discussed openly by exposing my own personal experience she goes on to describe this body of work falling is a visualization of personal experience with depression and anxiety the condition brought on frequent episodes where i felt emotionally and physically out of control unable to release myself from these episodes , i waited for the physical limitations of my body to end them recounting the affected years , i realize how accustomed i became to depression s influence many emotions and feelings belonged to it and not my own personality after an extended , untreated struggle , a diagnosis brought relief , and the process of unearthing myself from the disease began her work can be found at claralieu com note october is national depression screening day get screened
