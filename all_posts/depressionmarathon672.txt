i ran another marathon today the lake wobegon trail marathon runs through west central minnesota along what used to be a railroad corridor i used it as a long training run and finished in unfortunately , that is not the news most pressing this evening i attended this marathon with several other area runners our driver was a year old husband and father in perhaps the best shape of his life he was shooting for a personal best on this flat , fast course after crossing the finish line around , he collapsed he died a short time later there are no words for occasions like this why god feels the need for senseless occasions like this is a grand mystery to me the needless agony of his family haunts me tonight i do n't know what else to say i cannot shed any light on the darkness of the moment rest in peace , paul rest in peace
