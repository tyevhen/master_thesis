mycoplasma genitalium is a super tiny bacterial parasite of the human urinary system , causing about of urinary infections in men its genome , encoding just protein coding genes , is often cited as the smallest genome of any organism that can be grown in pure culture the genome is so small that scientists have for years used m genitalium as a kind of litmus test for the essentiality of genes if a particular kind of gene exists in m genitalium the reasoning goes , it must be truly essential for life mycoplasma genitalium recently , i looked at the genome of m genitalium from the point of view of latent nucleic acid secondary structure secondary structure refers to the ability of a single strand of dna or rna to base pair with itself i probed each gene with a script designed to detect intragenic self complementing regions of length eleven so called mers , the idea being that complementary runs of bases shorter than that might occur at a high rate by chance given m genitalium 's base composition stats adenine being most prevalent , at of all bases in protein coding message regions , thymine being next most abundant , at of protein coding bases , the most likely mer , 'aaaaaaaaaaa' , could be expected to occur by chance once every , bases in actuality , that particular mer does n't occur in the m genitalium genome , but if it did we could expect around occurrences of it in a genome of , base pairs instead , what we actually find are occurrences of complementary mers in genes the procedure used to check for mers is as follows in pseudocode for i i genes length i for each gene for k k genes i length k for all bases sequence genes i substring k , k get bases complement getreversecomplement sequence if genes i match complement a match exists if matchnotwithinmask mask not inside a previous match if matchnotinsidesequence sequence not inside sequence matches count it as a hit updatemask update mask note that with even length sequences it would be important to guard against self matching sequences , since a sequence like agct is its own reverse complement with length sequences this is not an issue nevertheless , it 's possible for successive matches to overlap , and i wrote a check to guard against that that 's what matchnotwithinmask mask and updatemask are all about it should go without saying , but i 'll say it anyway complementing mers in genes is a very substantial and quite unexpected amount of internal complementarity the question is what 's the purpose of all that putative secondary structure ? one possibility which i 've talked about in a previous post is that the secondary structure allows for thermostatic control of gene expression rna thermometers are a well established phenomenon and it could be that m genitalium needs sensitive control over thermal expression of certain genes another possibility is that many genes incorporate magnesium , manganese , or calcium sensitive riboswitches rna is a potent chelator of metal ions , particularly doubly charged ions like mg , which is smaller than sodium or potassium with twice the charge and thus has unusually high charge density it 's possible that under conditions of osmotic stress with high influx of water and low ion concentrations certain mrnas relax or uncoil and thereby become translatable if this is true if certain genes are under osmotic control , we might expect to find that many m genitalium genes with high secondary structure potential are membrane targeted genes tasked with managing the import and export of various things and that 's indeed what we find further below , i present a table with the top m genitalium genes containing the most putative secondary structure based on the mer probe outlined above the table shows the gene name , gene product or function where known , gene size in base pairs , and the number of complementing mers in the gene the genes tend to fall into only a few categories about a third of the genes out of are dna or rna binding genes a dozen genes are transporters or permeases another fall in the category of other membrane associated genes these are marked with asterisks and ten encode lipoproteins sixteen are hypothetical proteins which should probably be reannotated as proteins of unknown function , since we can be fairly sure the genes are expressed it 's interesting that so many genes with putative secondary structure potential are nucleic acid processing genes among genes in this category are ten genes that either acylate or modify transfer rnas what 's interesting about the latter group is that most involve trnas for non polar amino acids alanine , leucine , isoleucine , valine , phenylalanine , and methionine the reason this is interesting is that non polar amino acids are extensively used in membrane associated proteins thus we have a situation , possibly , in which osmo switches osmotically sensitive mrnas control the expression of trna synthetases for amino acids used in membrane proteins it is quite possible that some of the few metabolic genes listed in the table are membrane associated this is likely true for phosphomannomutase , udp galactopyranose mutase , and glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase , for example also interesting is that , bisphosphoglycerate independent phosphoglycerate mutase from thermoplasma has been shown to be manganese stimulated riboswitch modulation of such an enzyme would not be unexpected altogether , to out of genes listed in the table are membrane associated , and another are trna synthetases involving non polar amino acids heavily used in membrane proteins , tending to support the hypothesis that m genitalium uses secondary structure of mrna and or ssdna to modulate gene expression in osmotically sensitive manner table genes with high secondary structure potential in m genitalium genes marked with asterisks are membrane associated genes other than transporters or permeases the final column
