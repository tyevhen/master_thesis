it might seem counter productive to read about other people 's experiences of depression , particularly if they are in depth and auto biographical there can be triggers within the contexts which poses a threat to the recovering and well being of readers that are depressed however , i find them to be highly informative i recently started browsing for books on mental health , in particular those surrounding the conditions of social anxiety and depression i had previously been given a book of this nature before initially i was reluctant as i 've been bombarded with studies , theories and books with contradictory claims and it just puts my head into a faster spin cycle sometimes it can be hard to accept help from others of course support is welcomed , but in most cases it is likely that the person experiencing depression has done a fair amount of research into the illness themselves the books i 've come across vary in their approaches to the condition some have been written from the perspective of the psychiatrists sharing how they feel seeing patients with similar issues day after day and how that affects them something which could be an interesting read as a high proportion of psychiatrists have gone into their profession due to a personal experience of mental illness i prefer to avoid being bogged down by the science of depression instead i have a few books that are memoirs , in depth books providing an insight into the author 's experience of depression , what worked for them and what did n't , how bad things got for them and in some cases how they escaped the dark depths of depression i love seeing people 's reactions to the cover of the book i have my nose in , the titles are n't exactly cheery so it 's funny to see them recoil with wide eyes i think it 's worthwhile for anyone to read these sorts of books , you may well find yourself in a similar position one day or come across someone in your life experiencing depression if anything , the discussion of symptoms will help you to recognise them in yourself or others of course certain parts of the book can be quite distressing to read , yet i find comfort in knowing that someone else knows how badly depression can pollute the mind and i'm glad that these authors have managed to express themselves for their own benefit as well as getting their stories seen by thousands of other people in the coming weeks i am going to be posting short book reviews on the titles i 've been reading recently hopefully this will act as a guide to anyone interested in reading about depression in this way the reviews will also highlight whether sensitive issues and potential triggers such as self harm are mentioned
