stephen colebourne penned an interesting blog not long ago about the possible fate of java he speculates that there will be a jdk but not necessarily a java he points to the fact that there is no jsr for java nothing comparable to jsr for java se perhaps not coincidentally , every blog from a key sun employee in recent times has referred to jdk , not java there 's also the fact that sun has impeded progress of the apache harmony project by not responding to apache 's open letter to sun microsystems until that dispute is resolved , and until there 's a jsr , apache ca n't move forward with an open source java sun , however , can move forward with a jdk and that jdk can contain sun controlled pieces there has been a lot of grumbling about this in blog posts around project jigsaw , the effort to modularize java for an excellent post on this , with lively comments , see neil 's point free blog but also explore the googlesphere on your own this is a fast moving story people are coming to realize that sun still has an iron grip on java , and that the jcp process has not helped ensure the openness of java , going forward had sun gone with another standards body for java , things probably would be turning out differently right now what amazes me , frankly , is that so many people thought sun would ever relinquish control of java in any meaningful sense how could anyone be that naive ? the community 's best hope of seeing java unshackled from sun is to see sun be acquired by ibm which , imho , is not a sure thing either if ibm acquires sun , i believe there is a chance that ibm will make java truly open and unencumbered ibm will make it community property right now , as things stand , there 's too much entropy around java for it to ever see the light of day i agree with colebourne that we will almost certainly see a jdk beyond that , all bets are off do n't count on seeing a java se or java ee any time soon
