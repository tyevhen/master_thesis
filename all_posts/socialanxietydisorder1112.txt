i would study for hoursno exaggeration at least hrs a day for days for one test that i made a on that happened on three occasions so it was like a horrible nightmare i couldn t comprehend the material no matter how hard i tried , was depressed , had anxiety attacks , lost pounds , and went to the mental health center on campus but felt like i got the whole generic how do you feel about that psychological treatment nehoo , dropped out about a month before finals right after finding out i had failed of my classes not to mention was fighting with my family because to them i was going to graduate with honors ! anyways , after all that i really want to get back into school i took the next semester off , went back in the fall of last year barely scraped a c out of one class and a d out of the othereasy classes i guess i lost my motivation i lazily didn t get signed up for classes this spring and am now working a part time job i had a really hard time with those classes last fall i would get super anxious about easy tests and assignments and my ut college experience would come back and haunt me , get dreams about it and all i mean is there still hope ? after f s in classes at my previous universityall a s from the community college i attended back home , and the c and d at this community college is there a way i can still attend finish it out and go to nursing school like i had intended all along ? i feel like there s no hope and this time i want to go on my wants and dreams not my parents and families sorry it s so long guess my original question sums it up should i still go back and even if i do will i make it far ? answer yes you should go back to college the odds were stacked against you since you were a kid and you not only beat those odds but surpassed what many people do you finished a year college , not a lot of people even start on that path go back to college , just watch out how many classes you take on at once so you don t get buried in the workload if you re having trouble getting a concept of a class or subject see if there is someone in your class that can help you or see if there is a tutoring center at the college that might be able to you get the concept oh and use mnemonics ! there is a huge swell in it professionals in medicine it might be something to look into too question feel depressed and overwhelmed about my life ? i am very lonely i have no friends and no boyfriend anymore i am years old and i havent accomplished much except for getting myself into debt and i m screwing up in school suffer from chronic depression and social anxiety although this isnt diagnost it s an ongoing problem for many years after dropping out years ago from college i m back i did okay last semester but i screwed up the semester got behind in my studies and now i cant catch up so i m going to have to withdrawal from of my classes the only career path i can see myself doing will end up leaving me , dollars in debt and this scares me and overwhelms me i want to major in biology and get a masters in biology think a phd in zoology so i can work as usual just a conservationist i work full time right now but i m going to have to cut back my hours next year to take credits a semester because apparently i m not strong enough to work full time and go to school full time like some people to make up for lost wages i will have to take extra federal loans which i don t want to do but how i am i going to finish school ? on top of my chronic depression i feel like a loser and just overwhelmed by everything i can t afford health insurance and i m not sure i can even go to a mental health or health services on campus when to cut back my hours can anyone give me some at advice or if you have a good books to recommend something not religious thatd be great i am reading this is all and it doesn t sound so bad but i m seriously feeling really overwhelmed and depressed and i don t know what to do everyday feels like a struggle answer i know it s not much coming from a complete stranger , but even reading it can sometimes help a little knowing someone cares enough to take the time to type it out at all everything will be okay sources a friend question should i live in the dorms or at home ? i am going to a very highly renowned college for pre medicine i am here on a scholarship that pays for the vast majority of the costs my parents are paying for the remainder i feel that after living in the dorms for only a few days , it is not the right place for me not only did my roommate drop out , but they are going to put me with someone else that i know nothing about and i have no idea when i will be placed with this person it seems weird , but i want a roommate because they are kinda the go to person when you have no one else to go eat with or go to a seminar i have no problems living in the dorm when it comes to privacy i can shower , go to the bathroom , and function just fine i may not like my neighbors so well , but i can deal with it just fine classes haven t started , but the freshman s required class has already started and it is very stressful i feel like i am overextending myself in academics with a double major in chem and bio , but i think i can handle it as soon as i get into a routine the main problem is , i desperately miss my family whenever i think of them , i get very upset and sad even though it has only been two days since i last saw them since i started school i haven t eaten well it seems like i am eating very small portions only twice a day if that i am not drinking anything , but maybe a glass of water a day i went home the other day just overnight after being here for days and could only stomach a little food i miss my family extremely ! i live about minutes from campus but , at this school there are very few commuter students i think of the freshmen commute to school i live mile in the alloted zone for commuting i just think that it would be healthier for me to live at home for the first or second semester and adjust to this transition that way then next year live in the dorms every time i do stuff on campus i realize i like living here but as soon as even a thought about my family enters into my mind , i am overwhelmed with sorrow i want to make more friends and get involved , but i am having a hard time because when i think of my family , i go straight to my temporary single room and cry like a little baby which also makes me feel like a loser i know i should try counseling , but all i would do is break down which i definitely don t want to do in front of anyone i am worried that my mental health of missing my family may actually get in the way of making friends and getting involved because i would try and leave campus as much as possible to go home just to see them i wish this was easier i keep telling myself if i give it some more time , but i have to make up my mind quick answer you re experiencing homesickness , which is normal , but it s not the time to be making a decision on whether or not to go home if you re having that much trouble working through it , go see a counselor they have seen plenty of people break down in front of them and aren t going to judge you for it
