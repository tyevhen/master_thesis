hi there ! i 'd mentioned in an earlier post about finding balance in life well , in a step to find time to enjoy something that is just for me and just for fun , i enrolled in a watercolor class at my local community center it meets every monday night for the next several weeks last night was the first gathering i loved it ! the teacher is going over techniques and how tos with lots of individual instruction thrown in i took a course in college and the professor literally gave us assignments and then sat there as we worked i had no clue what i was doing the entire time and just sort of figured things out as i went along but , i struggled in just last night 's course i learned several things i 'd been doing wrong that had been making watercoloring really hard and giving me crappy results so , it 's been worth it so far ! as you can see in the photo , we 've begun a one color painting of a lighthouse here it 's about half finished to learn about shading , tone and controlling the water all that aside , it was nice to get away and do something for myself for pure enjoyment it 's nice to have no purpose there 's no grade , no critique , no trying to sell the paintings , etc i get to just sit , get lost in the project at hand , and play around with it there was a mix of people in the room old and young experienced and un experienced there were no judgements a long way from the scary and sometimes mean critiques i suffered through college i have a great story of a professor who ripped up one of my projects into little shreds sigh it was so relaxing and the hours went by like nothing i can get used to this ! i came home feeling so excited and energized simply from this one thing ! what do you do that is for yourself and just for fun ? it 's something to think about if you have n't been doing it already have a great day ! save you might also like art and mothering workin' for a livin' before and now linkwithin
