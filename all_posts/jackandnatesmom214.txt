i took the day off today to spend with the boys we had a bit of a daycare snafoo because of spring break , and frankly i have n't had a non sick day with the boys in a long time so we were due i really wanted to do something social for jack he 's been having a bit of a rough year in that regard very few party invites , which is a very common thing for kids on the spectrum in fact , our local taca chapter is making their may meeting a literal birthday party for the kids to attend since they get to go to so few of them jack has had a few boys in class who are not very nice to him , and bless his sweet heart , he does n't understand just how mean the things they say are he comes home and tells me how they say things like he is the most annoying kid ever , or for him to get away and never come back , and jack just kind of laughs about it and then says the child is his friend in some ways , it 's a good protective mechanism , but i hate the thought of my kid being unable to defend himself so you can imagine that i have become very protective of him when it comes to friends we usually stick with kids that we have known for a long time , or the children of close friends of mine i called most of them up to see if they wanted to play today but everyone was pretty busy at the last minute like this so i took a deep breath and grabbed jack 's class list i was honestly terrified for those of you who do not have school aged children yet , it feels much like asking someone on a date , or making a new friend as an adult and taking that step to socialize outside of the usual group and the last thing on earth i want is for jack to feel rejected there is a boy in his class who has always been very nice to him when i have been volunteering in the classroom , and his mom seemed nice when i met her as well so i did it , i called and asked if they wanted to go to the local bounce place with us this morning i figured it was a low pressure setting , with lots of white noise and they came ! jack had a great morning and he and the little boy played very nicely together when jack wanders off , this little boy looks for him he is very protective of jack , and of other kids in general at one point , an older boy hit jack when they were standing behind a structure and i did n't have a direct view jack 's buddy came running over to tell me , which just really touched me i could n't really get nate into actually playing on stuff , but he had fun running around anyway it 's always difficult to decide how to broach the subject of nate with new friends i have a new technique that 's really effective it 's what i like to call out with it i just told the mom , and told her what to expect she was very supportive , and then she did n't have to wonder why he was n't touching any of the bounce houses , or talking , or why he prefers to lie on the floor much of the time i guess i could keep it to myself , but i have a feeling that not knowing would likely make the other person more uncomfortable than knowing because it 's pretty obvious that nate is not doing typical three year old stuff , especially when this family 's two year old was there climbing all over everything anyway , the boys hugged goodbye , talked about the orioles , and want to play again ! so so glad i took the leap after months of worrying score one for jack ! and mommy !
