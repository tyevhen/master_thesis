yesterday i woke up and was so exhausted i talked myself into working from home a few hours later i realized that my connection was too slow and i wouldn t be able to get anything productive done from home so i started blogging and researching on the internet before i knew it , it was pm and tyler was on his way home i had successfully done nothing the entire day no shower , no laundry or dishes , not even yoga , just nothin so i started feeling guilty that i didn t go into work when there is so much that i need to get done , that i had this day off and sat in bed all day long watching bad daytime tv and surfin the web if you didn t already know who i am let me introduce myself i am the queen of justification and i can rationalize almost any behavior i do to make myself feel better whether it s right or wrong sometimes it s a bonus and other times it s a flaw i m not sure where this one should be categorized , but watch me go for me , every once in awhile i just need a day where i can just be , just exist i don t have to do anything if i don t want to and if the day is a blur with no accomplishments than that s ok no pressures , no appointments , no expectations or things to analyze it s a mental holiday and i think that s ok the timing might not have been right with the rest of the world , but i have to allow myself those days and not feel bad about them today i am back at the daily grind and i feel the pressure mounting for the next few work weeks i love the company that i work at and i love what i do , but i know that i am going to have to put in some overtime and i am not looking forward to it this will happen once every couple months or so whenever we let out a release if anyone is curious about where i work they can check out this video that is a short advertisement for the software i help create test actually so i know that for the next month or so i won t be able to justify any vacation time , so yesterday was my one day off for awhile and i thoroughly enjoyed it see ? i feel better already you might also like relaxation technique calming music my top anxiety tools and resources relaxation technique yoga relaxation technique envisioning a peaceful scene linkwithin
