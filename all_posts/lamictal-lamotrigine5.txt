last fall , i thought i was getting away with something when i watched videos on my ipad at night in spite of the blue light emitted by ipads that can be so dangerous to the sleep phases of modd disordered persons , there i was , sleeping normally i theorized that maybe the screen was too small to emit enough light to screw me up i now theorize that i was wrong my current theory is that i 'd been watching videos , which are obviously not all emitting pure white or blue light all the time much of the time , indeed , the colors on the screen can be quite dark the same is not true if you 're using the ipad as a reading device then , it 's straight up black text on a white background then , you stay up until am reading then , you ca n't fall asleep before am for the next two weeks and then , the trend shows no sign of stopping
