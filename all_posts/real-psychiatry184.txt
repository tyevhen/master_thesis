testosterone testosterone replacement has been a controversial issue , despite a large number of physicians who prescribe it , fda approval of products for mass marketing , and a number of advocates that see it as an anti aging and performance enhancing drug for aging men the science behind is has been surprisingly slow in an era where inequities in health care are often argued by race or sex , this seems to be one where the science at least lags far behind what is known for women expert opinion about testosterone replacement has changed very little over the years , despite much popular literature about how this has occurred for years in europe and there is widespread benefit for physical and emotional well being of men as they age from a clinical perspective , psychiatrists are seeing more and more middle aged men on testosterone replacement this treatment modality has significant implications for any medical treatment provided by psychiatrists as well as associated comorbidity from a psychiatric perspective it is also important to determine if the testosterone use is more than indicated , is associated with increasing muscle mass and body image changes , and if it occurring in the context of unreasonable expectations like preserving youth , reversing the effects of aging , or athletic performance enhancement in the most recent study of men years of age and older the authors examined the effects of treatment with testosterone gel for a period of one year the total number of subjects was out of a total of , men who were screened in order to qualify for the trial testosterone level had to be sufficiently low less than ng dl on one of two samples and that eliminated of all of the screened men the trial was designed to look at physical function , sexual function , and vitality the treatment resulted in testosterone levels that were in the mid normal range for to year old men despite considerable medical comorbidity in the recruited patients there were clear cutoffs for medical comorbidity those cutoffs included a history of prostate cancer or risk of prostate cancer on the prostate cancer risk calculator , other conditions known to cause hypogonadism , medications known to effect the concentration of testosterone , high cardiovascular and severe depression phq score the overall results showed that there was moderate benefit on sexual functioning and some benefit with mood and depressive symptoms but no effect on physical functioning or vitality a look at these measurements is instructive physical function was assessed using the minute walk recent normative data has been established for various age cohorts using subjects from several countries that data establishes normative curves for age cohort stratified by sex the six minute walk distance mwd ranged from meters in year old men to meters in year old men on two trials subjects usually walked on average meter farther on the second trial in the present study , the criterion for a positive effects from testosterone was a walking distance increase of meters when compared with controls , the testosterone treated men had significantly more men increasing the distance walked by meters , the percentage of men exceeding this measure , the change from baseline , and the percentage of men with higher scores on the physical function domain test pf from the medical outcomes study item short form instrument sf one of the concerns i had reading this methodology is the use of testosterone for physical performance enhancement is it effective without using a training program ? were the subjects in this study advised to extend their walking distances or speed ? without it i am skeptical that it would have much of an effect vitality was determined by measures on the facit fatigue score as the primary outcome measure interestingly facit stands for functional assessment of cancer treatment and their web page links to an extensive list of modified rating scales i could not tell if the rating scale had been validated in normal year old men without a cancer diagnosis no significant differences were noted between testosterone treated men and controls on secondary measures testosterone treated men were more likely to report higher energy at the end of the trial , but that measure was unspecified and may have been a line item in the sf sexual function was measured primarily by question of the psychosexual daily questionnaire this item is a item yes no checklist of male sexual behaviors , thoughts , and fantasies greater testosterone levels achieved in treatment correlated with higher testosterone levels a secondary measure the derogatis interview for sexual functioning in men ii disf m ii also documented increased sexual desire and it was also used as a screen for participants in the sexual function arm of the trial the sexual function measures do appear to be more straightforward , but they are all self report measures over considerable time frames one of the most interesting aspects of this trial was an analysis of the side effects one of the main concerns in treating men with testosterone is the risk of prostate cancer that is sensitive to testosterone levels i have had personal communication with physicians who were treating patients with testosterone who developed widely metastatic prostate cancer the significant adverse effects in this trial were all summarized in a table there were placebo treated men compared with testosterone treated men the events were summarized according to prostate specific antigen psa level increases , diagnoses of prostate cancer , elevations of hemoglobin , myocardial infarction , stroke , all cause cardiovascular death , death and hospitalization although there were a greater number of psa elevations in the testosterone treated men , there was only case of prostate cancer compared to in the controls during the year of study and cases of prostate cancer in the testosterone group and one in the placebo group in the subsequent year of the study the rationale for this study was try to to add to the results of previous trials that showed inconsistent results of testosterone replacement on muscle mass , body fat , sexual function , energy level , and physical function it is disappointing to read through all of these details and find out that there was not much of an effect and that the methodology in the st century is so weak the only good news that i can find in the article is that it is relatively safe to replace testosterone in year old men who are rigorously screened for hypogonadism and prostate cancer risk although selection bias for a project like this is certainly a consideration , i asked myself whether men self selected for replacement by low testosterone ads would be rejected at the level by their physicians of course the researchers here point out that the risk over the long run can only be determined by larger trials or my opinion post marketing surveillance but post marketing surveillance as suggested by the fda is really a blunt instrument compared with any type of organized pharmacosurveillance or screening all new cases of prostate cancer on a particular electronic health record for testosterone prescriptions at some level , i wonder if the research questions would have been answered more completely by trials focused solely on each groups , but there were a very large number of investigators many of the investigators have the appearance of conflict of interest through affiliations with pharmaceutical companies and many do not the results of this study are consistent with what clinical psychiatrists see in their practice it is not uncommon to see men taking supraphysiological doses of testosterone and not wanting to reduce those doses it is common to see men on testosterone who stop taking it because there is no clear efficacy and or because they are concerned that the women and girls in their life will accidentally come into contact with testosterone but let 's face it this is really not about hypoandrogenism that is not what is fueling the debate i am not an advocate of aging gracefully and accepting what happens i think if you have been dieting and exercising through the first years of life it would be useful if medical science could provide something to help you maintain an active lifestyle and prevent the kind of morbidity that slows you down , leads to deconditioning and the host of metabolic factors that hasten aging and death preventing that pathway of physical deterioration depends on maintaining attitude , muscle , joints , and bone this is another paper documenting that there is no clear solution to that array of problems it is unfortunate that medicine does not have a scientific solution at this point even after hearing all of the unscientific hype about testosterone and growth hormone for the past years george dawson , md , dlfapa references snyder
