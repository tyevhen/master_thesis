you may have heard the news that evel knievel passed away today i wanted to take a moment to share a story from my youth as a way of commemorating him during a hot summer month before fonzie jumped a shark , all the neighborhood boys gathered in tommy swenson 's backyard to subject their evel knievel stunt cycles to the most wicked pissa jumps they could think of there were no toys like those cycles we could rev them up and launch them into the air in the most punishing , yet entertaining circumstances our evel knievels withstood them all years later we would graduate to riding our banana seat bikes over our own jumps , but nothing compared with the sweet thrill of that summer one particular day stands out in my mind above the endless others because it embodied in our young minds what evel knievel was all about we had set up a particularly abusive jump for our evel to survive at the base of tommy 's driveway the driveway led up to the street right at the foot of maint street in reading , which was actually route it is a very busy street that leads from north reading to the heart of reading with two lanes of traffic going each way getting out of our driveway to go anywhere in particular was always an exercise in patience in this setting we placed our rugged surrogate whoever 's turn it was to send evel knievel to his fate cranked the gyro to a whining pitch until his arm began to ache then evel launched out of the pad , up the ramp , into the air , and over whatever deadly obstacles we had placed in his path before re entering earth 's orbit usually , the stunt cycle would biff in the driveway after a particularly high jump , but not this time evel knievel scooted right up the driveway , across the sidewalk , and to our horror , out into main street as we ran up the driveway after our intrepid toy , screaming for it to stop , we came to a stop instead all of us stood on the sidewalk and gaped in wonder as our tiny white stunt cycle , with evel knievel figurine astride , deftly rode under cars and trucks across all four lanes to come to a gentle stop at the curb on the other side , completely unscathed to this day i can still remember the soaring exaltation and bliss of that moment it was better than tv our toy had defied death and won ! no moment more aptly defines my young boyhood in reading than that summer day with evel knievel the real evel knievel never knew of the his doppelganger 's adventures , or how we tried to recreate that moment over and over again once my mother found out what we were up to , however , she put an end to our evel knievel adventures after all , somebody had to cross that four lane street to get his evel knievel back my mum did n't take kindly to her own son 's taste for derring do upon reflection , i am thankful for evel knievel 's contribution to our culture and his cherished place in my memory as a young hyperkinetic boy i was thrilled to relive his daredevil exploits he gave me many intense , hyperfocused summer days that i will fondly remember for the rest of my life coping strategy go out and play life 's too short here are two excellent sites about this fabulous toy firebox com and william thompson 's fantastic evel knievel toy page tags technorati evel knievel add ad hd adhd like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe !
