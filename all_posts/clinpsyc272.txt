the new york times has just run a great story about just how much doctors in minnesota have been stumping for various atypical antipsychotic meds and how this is related to the large upswing in their usage though the focus of the article is on kids , the same quite likely holds true for adults as well the patient who gets the most coverage in the story is anya bailey , who , at age , apparently developed an eating disorder and was prescribed risperdal i ve never seen a shred of evidence to support such a prescription , but the doctor was apparently thinking the side effect of weight gain would be a bonus in her case anya developed a crippling knot in her back as a result of treatment her mother alleges that she was never told that the evidence base behind such a prescription was nonexistent the authors say it nicely highlighting added just as surprising , ms bailey said , was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised anya s care received more than , from to from johnson johnson , risperdal s maker , in return for lectures about one of the company s drugs doctors , including anya bailey s , maintain that payments from drug companies do not influence what they prescribe for patients but the intersection of money and medicine , and its effect on the well being of patients , has become one of the most contentious issues in health care nowhere is that more true than in psychiatry , where increasing payments to doctors have coincided with the growing use in children of a relatively new class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics these best selling drugs , including risperdal , seroquel , zyprexa , abilify and geodon , are now being prescribed to more than half a million children in the united states to help parents deal with behavior problems despite profound risks and almost no approved uses for minors snip from to , drug maker payments to minnesota psychiatrists rose more than sixfold , to million during those same years , prescriptions of antipsychotics for children in minnesota s medicaid program rose more than ninefold those who took the most money from makers of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most often , the data suggest on average , minnesota psychiatrists who received at least , from atypical makers from to appear to have written three times as many atypical prescriptions for children as psychiatrists who received less or no money key opinion leaders let 's talk about folks who are quick to try out new drugs , often for uses that have little supporting evidence they are called high flyers or early prescribers , as well as some other terms these are the docs most highly targeted by drug companies because they tend to yield the highest return on investment how do you target docs ? with key opinion leaders find a respected physician to talk with the high flyers though other docs are also targeted use a kol who will be seen as objective this will help convince the doctor to start using the new drugs read the following snippet from a company that contracts with big pharma to develop kols to influence prescribing habits all emphases are mine the professional networks of physicians play an important role in product adoption a decision to adopt a product can be profoundly influenced by key opinion leader kol peers who have already formed a positive opinion about a product through our uniquely created patent pending process we target those kol s focused on top prescribers of treatments for a given specialty these leaders significantly influence the opinions , and behaviors of others through their knowledge , advice and enhanced perspective , creating advocates which , then help gain the adoption of the product in this case our highly trained engineers delivered a solution using the latest technology and our proven process in a matter of weeks our successful kol program strategies are based on systematic and rigorous methods for identification , new research techniques , and the use of the latest technologies we leveraged these strategies so that bms could establish long term relationships of mutual trust with these leaders built on integrity and continuity through our user friendly methodology we have proven that successful marketing and adoption of a product requires a minimum of four steps we incorporate these four steps as the basis for this successful solution awareness the physician recognizes the product by name agreement the physician evaluates and agrees to the theoretical premise of the product adoption the physician decides to use the product on a trial basis integration the physician incorporates the product into his daily practice of medicine ain t that neat ? i think you ll see how this relates to the remainder of the nyt article , to which we now return stumping for drug companies from the nyt piece in minnesota , psychiatrists collected more money from drug makers from to than doctors in any other specialty total payments to individual psychiatrists ranged from to more than , , with a median of , since the records are incomplete , these figures probably underestimate doctors actual incomes anya s doctor , george realmuto gave several educational marketing speeches for concerta , manufactured by johnson johnson , which also makes risperdal he had the following to say and i hope he was misquoted when asked about why he gives marketing speeches for drugs to the extent that a drug is useful , i want to be seen as a leader in my specialty and that i was involved in a scientific study , he said i e i wanna be a key opinion leader ? ? ? the money is nice , too , he said dr realmuto s university salary is , academics don t get paid very much , he said if i was an entertainer , i think i would certainly do a lot better hey , can someone fetch me the kleenex ? making , per year is a sign that he does not get paid very much cry me a river in blanking credible as the interview continued , dr realmuto said that upon reflection his payments from drug companies had probably opened his door to useless visits from a drug salesman , and he said he would stop giving sponsored lectures in the future good for him now i m not saying that his concerta gig made him prescribe risperdal in anya s case might having a cozy relationship with j j lead to prescribing more j j products ? perhaps , but i don t know what concerns me most is that , if he was quoted correctly and in context , he really thinks that a k salary is not enough income if that s the case , and he s willing to put his stamp of approval on a drug via marketing speeches because a k salary is insufficient , then that level of greed is astounding by most standards moving along the drug industry and many doctors say that these promotional lectures provide the field with invaluable education critics say the payments and lectures , often at expensive restaurants , are disguised kickbacks that encourage potentially dangerous drug uses the issue is particularly important in psychiatry , because mental problems are not well understood , treatment often involves trial and error , and off label prescribing is common the analysis of minnesota records shows that from through , more than a third of minnesota s licensed psychiatrists took money from drug makers , including the last eight presidents of the minnesota psychiatric society the psychiatrist receiving the most from drug companies was dr annette m smick , who lives outside rochester , minn , and was paid more than , by drug makers from to at one point dr smick was doing so many sponsored talks that it was hard for me to find time to see patients in my clinical practice , she said i was providing an educational benefit , and i like teaching , dr smick said giving so many speeches pimping new drugs that you can t find time to see patients ? dr smick is hereby officially nominated for a golden goblet award , that s pimpin it hard even the immediate past president of the american psychiatric association , dr steven sharfstein , chimed in , pointing out that it s sure odd that lexapro is the most prescribed antidepressant in the absence of evidence that it s better than generic antidepressants could it be that lexapro still has key opinion leaders talking up the drug , forest labs has reps pushing lexapro in office visits , and that lexapro is featured in quite a bit of medical journal advertising ? hey , do you think that the meteoric rise of cymbalta might also be due to marketing rather than scientific evidence ? child and adolescent bipolar the controversy continues from the nyt article the sudden popularity of pediatric bipolar diagnosis has coincided with a shift from antidepressants like prozac to far more expensive atypicals in , minnesota spent more than , buying antipsychotic drugs , most of it on atypicals , for children on medicaid in , the cost was more than million , a fold increase snip many minnesota doctors , including the president of the minnesota psychiatric society , said drug makers and their intermediaries are now paying them almost exclusively to talk about bipolar disorder on to the research regarding treating bipolar in children and adolescents as discussed in the nyt article , there was a study done , in which adolescents took either depakote placebo or depakote seroquel the combined treatment group did better at the end , but about half of the adolescents in the depakote seroquel group dropped out of the study so basically the study was a wash yet , in the published paper , it was stated that depakote seroquel is more effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar mania than just depakote placebo nice melissa delbello author of aforementioned study and robert kowatch both of the university of cincinatti , conducted another study on treatment of adolescent bipolar , in which seroquel showed about equal results perhaps a slight advantage to depakote both delbello and kowatch also give marketing talks for seroquel no doubt they are both considered key opinion leaders there have been a few other studies done , but it is safe to say the evidence base is pretty weak for treatment of child and adolescent bipolar disorder data on longer term like longer than a month or two treatment is sorely lacking here s what one minnesota psychiatrist had to say regarding the meager evidence base on child adolescent bipolar we don t have time to wait for them to prove us right , said dr kent g brockmann , a psychiatrist from the twin cities who made more than , from to doing drug talks and one on one sales meetings , and last year was a leading prescriber of atypicals to medicaid children wait a minute , kent brockmann take away one n on his name and you ve got this guy ha ! anyway , dr brockman needs to give kids atypicals because it is urgent maybe he buys into the of bipolar children become suicidal line this line of prescribe new meds because it 's an urgent , urgent emergency makes me wonder if the docs who are all over the atypicals now are the same ones who were prescribing neurontin for everything as well because they could n't wait for the data to vindicate their prescribing practices as it turns out , neurontin for psych disorders turned out to be a flop , but that did n't stop it being prescribed like candy by many docs maybe i'm wrong the neurontin crowd could be entirely different than the atypicals for everything and bipolar is everywhere crowd i'm just taking a guess oh , and as for safety in , the food and drug administration received reports of at least children dying and at least more suffering serious side effects in which an antipsychotic was listed as the primary suspect that was a substantial jump from , when there were at least deaths and serious side effects among children linked to the drugs since reporting of bad drug effects is mostly voluntary , these numbers likely represent a fraction of the toll summary the bipolar diagnosis in kids is highly controversial , , , , , and there is pert near no evidence favoring treatment using atypical antipsychotics to manage their bipolar symptoms key opinion leaders have done a nice job of pimping atypicals the k many of these folks earn in academia just ain t enough they have to provide education to their colleagues regarding these life saving medications drug companies decide to push a diagnosis and recruit kols as well as utilizing other tricks to persuade doctors to prescribe the new meds , regardless of supporting evidence thank whomever designed the law in minnesota requiring disclosure of industry funding this set of data regarding industry funding could just keep giving and thank the good folks at the new york times , specifically gardiner harris , benedict carey and janet roberts , for their insightful piece of work note that i'm not saying everyone who does drug sponsored speaking gigs is a gold chain wearing , cane toting pimp what i am suggesting is that conflicts of interest often influence people , even when they think they are not being influenced i'm all about the openness patients should probably be aware if their doctors are receiving income on the side through promotion of a certain medication or medications is that too much to ask ? also , what world do people live in when they think that a k salary is insufficient ? is this a sign of entitlement , poor money management , really rich tastes , or what ? how many mckinnells do people think they 're worth , anyway ?
