due to posts either non germaine or merely self promoting , i have resorted to the moderation option on this blog that 's a kind noun for deleting interlopers i started this blog in the late summer of and continued it through our trials in mexico and my subsequent two year depression that some would come here not in good faith but only to scribble graffiti saddens me at the melic review roundtable poetry board we had about seven good years before the barbarians stormed the gates i had a policy that adults should be able to ignore the posts of brigands bent on stealing the spirit of communal discourse without policing alas , at last , i was proved wrong and as we switched to censorship the board simply collapsed , after which i put the whole enterprise on hold right now i'm open to editing and publishing again , i'm even toying with the idea of starting a new magazine or resurrecting the old one cyanide capsules may be mailed to my snail address seriously , i know some untapped talent i suspect would make for a riveting magazine , my only impediment being the lack of a literary light also schooled in webmastering who might be willing to devote her gifts to the technical side any volunteers should e mail me and i will try to provide some monetary reward as well , though likely not commensurate with the current commercial market meanwhile my mood is holding , with a few dips , at least stable enough to write about melancholy not in the first person , a poem presently being workshopped at gazebo and wild poetry forum at their biofeedback thread , should you wish to visit the workshop process i post the poem here for your convenience queen melancholy dressed in perpetual blue , her smile a wound too wise for ordinary martyrdom , with the stealth of a blue bottle fly she moves , black veined wings pressed on an azure gown though her kiss is bitter as the almond pit , her name flows over the tongue like maple syrup all happens for a reason she reassures us in a smoky cocktail voice , rendering unreasonable pain immune to reason 's solace she will choke you with a noose of accusations woven from strictest honesty beware her lying bed great minds have languished there and dined upon themselves my thanks to all who have followed my journey and apologies for delaying the publication of your comments there is no other apt word for what i am being forced to do than censorship , which i detest i hope the result will not be as discouraging as the downfall of the melic poetry board thine , ce
