as my blog description line so loudly if blog description lines can be loud , that is proclaims , i am an unschooling vegetarian animistic green anarchist a lot of people were interpreting green anarchist as two separate things that i was both green , and an anarchist , instead of how it was supposed to be read that i'm a green anarchist , so i decided the dash was needed feminist i 've been feeling far more strongly attached to that term lately , so figured i should add it hippie child some people eschew anything they see as labels , and that 's fine but as a word lover , i kind of like walking around with a string of words attached to me i picture them trailing out behind my head , fluttering a bit in an imaginary breeze as i move around a banner of pride yeah , pretty fanciful mental image , i know but anyway , i choose to attach these words to my person because i identify strongly with them they make me happy to use , i feel like each one describes me well , and i just like them those words are my friends it 's important , of course , that everyone gets to fill in their own labels source so that 's why i do n't find labels such as those confining at all when a word stops feeling good , i simply drop it as it is , i like being able to define my worldview , my philosophical views , basically the things that influence and impact the way i see things and choose to live my life , in ways that other people can hopefully understand people with similar views can find me that way , and i feel like it 's a bit of a warning to everyone in general look out , radical here ! i'm always slightly nervous that i 'll encounter aggressive disagreement or stressful bullshit from random people when they discover what my views are , so i like to get it all out of the way as soon as possible , before i can start liking someone only to find they react in shock and disapproval when they discover what i really think about things ! well , okay , that has n't happened yet the me liking someone then having them hate me because of my views bit , i mean the aggressive bullshit thing has definitely happened ! but maybe that 's just because of my clever strategy of being super open about my views right from the get go , right ? either way , i like my labels though i prefer to refer to them simply as words , thus avoiding all the baggage that comes along with the l word i like describing things anything and everything , really in words , and thus i like describing me in words all the feelings i associate with the words i choose to use in regards to myself are positive , feel good ones , and as long as that continues to be the case , i'm going to hang onto them which is why you wo n't find me bashing labels anytime soon ! you might also like the term homeschooling sucks unschooling unlimiting against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference new bio , updated about me page linkwithin
