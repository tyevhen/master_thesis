the primary care companion to the journal of clinical psychiatry has a piece on abilify for depression that illustrates many of psychiatry 's woes full text of the article is here the journal published an article titled examining the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder a pooled analysis of two studies the paper combines data from two previously published studies which examined the addition of abilify to existing antidepressant treatment , one of psychiatry 's big name academics , michael thase , signed on as lead author i'm hoping that he did n't actually write the paper actually , there are eleven authors of the paper , which seems a little ridiculous given that the paper is an analysis of data which had already been collected for two previously published clinical trials seven of the authors are employees of bristol myers squibb bms or otsuka , which both market abilify wait if you look closely , you can see my favorite disclosure in the fine print on the first page in case you ca n't read the fine print in defense of thase and the other academic authors , they may have not actually written any of the paper much or all of the writing appears to be creditable to ogilvy healthworld medical education on their site , they note that they perform clinical development and publications management experienced medical writers work closely with authors , editors and publishers to provide our clients with a full range of publishing options whatever bms otsuka paid you for this one simply was not enough why ? because whomever wrote this thing did an admirable job of focusing on the positive and completely ignoring the negative erasing the patient 's opinions remember , the article 's title states that it examines the efficacy of adjunctive abilify adding abilify to existing antidepressant treatment so you 'd think the article would mention all of the relevant depression data from the two relevant studies well , no in the two stuides which are discussed in the article , patients were assessed on depression using the following measures montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs inventory of depressive symptoms self report scale ids quick inventory of depressive symptoms self report scale qids using the madrs , the authors conclude that adding abilify to antidepressant treatment is more effective than adding placebo to antidepressant treatment ok , fine , though it 's not by a particularly huge margin mysteriously , the authors do not even mention that the self report scales ids and its subscale , the qids were used in the two trials and why would they ? in both trials , abilify was not significantly better than placebo on these measures a letter to the editor pointed out this glaring weakness in abilify 's claims of efficacy , the response to which was weak noting that abilify did not outperform placebo on the self report measure in the trial , he wrote that this may be due to the lower sensitivity of the measure so the drug was n't the failure blame the rating scale instead the people at bms picked the scale and when it does n't give results they like , then suddenly it 's a poor measurement of depression i bet dr berman would not have complained about the instrument had it yielded results in favor of abilify in the publications of each of the two clinical trials , the authors tried to downplay the fact that abilify was no better than placebo according to patient self reports then , when publishing an analysis that combined the results of the two trials , the authors go a step further by not even mentioning that patients completed a self report right down the memory hole in my opinion , any reasonable academic author writing about such research would want to note the strengths and limitations of abilify in treating depression the lack of benefit on patient rated measures is a major weakness yet several big time academics signed off on this paper despite its complete scrubbing of negative data for that , i hereby nominate each author for a coveted golden goblet award and i credit the ghostwriter at ogilvy with a fantastic job of serving his her corporate clients you , sir or ma'am , deserve kudos for a marketing job well done the instructions for authors who submit to the primary care companion to the journal of clinical psychiatry state conclusions should flow logically from the data presented , and methodological flaws and limitations should be acknowledged um , does completely scrubbing negative data count as failing to acknowledge limitations ? i can see that the peer reviewers and or editor really paid close attention to this paper safety the authors note that adjunctive aripiprazole is relatively well tolerated in patients with mdd relatively ? relative to what being hit with a baseball bat repeatedly ? they note that akathisia occurred in of patients on abilify compared to of patients on placebo restlessness vs insomnia vs fatigue vs blurred vision vs the authors report that akathisia resolved in of patients by the end of the study , which would also mean that for of patients with akathisia , they were stuck with it at the end of the study but do n't worry , it 's relatively well tolerated overall , another example of a research publication being little more than a puff piece in favor of a drug with big name academics signed on as authors to add credibilty and just a fine print mention of a ghostwriter i thank an anonymous reader for alerting me to this study citation thase me , trivedi mh , nelson jc , fava m , swanink r , tran q , pikalov a , yang h , carlson bx , marcus rn , berman rm examining the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder a pooled analysis of studies primary care companion to the journal of clinical psychiatry , ,
