self portrait take off all your disguises there you are , like john the baptist naked save for fur i would not spoon your soul out from a jar or squeeze you like a tube of brown manure i only want to know your naked heart , its tangled bridges to your fortress mind beset with harpies , gorgons , pried apart because your integration was a blind for separation of the self from soul , division of the heart from the intent , dissembling for the public in your role of thaumaturgic poet discontent i ve lost you once more , craig , you re hard to pin sit for the portrait we ll begin again prose stream sit for the portrait the brush strokes the canvas in favonian languidness who knows of the flamulated owl ? who mutilated the television with crayons ? the blade iron that heats and cuts ? cuisinart for reptiles only as if man would eat crabs , or oysters then man 's like a rat he 'll eat anything , even shoe leather when he 's starving no one has to starve today but out of greed humans prevent other humans from eating it is a cruel cruel cruel world out there , dorothy do n't trust your ruby slippers get a kick ass pair of boots saw my shrink today my case looks pretty hopeless may have to find a way to get ect anyone know how to start a foundation ? shock a poet today ! kilorats , craig erick
