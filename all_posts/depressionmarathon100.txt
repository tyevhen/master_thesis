i was going to call this post rejuvenated , but that was n't entirely true i'm not quite there yet but i do feel a bit restored as planned , i only worked my regularly scheduled days this week that made a big difference i was able to get back to my preferred training intensity , and i caught up on some much needed napping i love naps ! i'm feeling better , physically and mentally i'm training for my next marathon , which comes up in just a couple of weeks i 'll be running the bridges marathon in arkansas for my th ugh ! birthday i had a great , quick paced mile run today it felt good to go fast tomorrow i 'll run a mile long run and then start tapering again i'm looking forward to experiencing another new marathon it will be my next adventure hmm i do n't know what else to tell you today i'm relieved to be feeling less tired and worn out my mood eventually suffers , and sometimes suffers mightily , if i stay tired too long i have a little busier week ahead , but i think i now have the energy to tackle it and i only have to tackle it one day at a time keep moving forward , and carry on , my friends
