antidepressants have not fared particularly well in clinical trials to determine efficacy placebo effect has gotten stronger over the years , resulting in many expensive failures of late stage phase iii drug trials , with the result that most major drug makers have halted r d programs aimed at developing new psychiatric drugs many of today 's most popular drugs for depression barely achieved efficacy years ago if they had to jump through the same fda hurdles today , most would n't make it the following table , from a neuropsychopharmacology paper by khan et al , shows the results of fixed dose clinical trials done for fda approval for a variety of antidepressants fluoxetine prozac , nefazadone serzone , venlafaxine effexor , sertraline zoloft , bupropion wellbutrin , and citalopram celexa note that serzone has since been pulled from the market over liver toxicity concerns trials in which the drug at the dose shown was superior to placebo are shown in bold remarkably , only a third of trials showed the drugs to be better than placebo placebo antidepressant antidepressant protocol duration of trial weeks symptom reduction symptom reduction dose mg day fluoxetine nefazadone aoa venlafaxine a sertraline bupropion bupropion nefazadone a mirtazapine venlafaxine a citalopram nefazadone aoa a nefazadone aoa b bupropion citalopram venlafaxine er how , then , did fda decide to approve the drugs ? fixed dose trials are not the only kind of trials used in drug approval the drug makers also submit flexible dose trials those are successful around of the time see the khan paper for data fixed dose trials are typically done to establish dose response relationships since weaker doses might not be as efficacious , it stands to reason that fixed dose trials which can be weighed down by weak dose results should fare worse than flexible dose trials in terms of establishing efficacy in theory , at least in reality , that 's not what khan et al found when they looked at symptom reduction as a function of dose , they were unable to demonstrate a clear relationship paradoxically , in the investigators' words dose does n't seem to matter much looking at overall results , the average improvement in patient hamd score was for those who received placebo and for those who got an antidepressant one interpretation of this is that divided by of the benefit of the drugs is due to placebo effect but it 's also possible that the only thing we 're seeing here , in any of the results , is placebo effect the greater response on drugs may be due to breaking of blind , as drug takers realize when side effects start to kick in that they 're not in the placebo group and begin thinking they 're taking something powerful when really it 's just a different kind of placebo this would also explain why dosage does n't matter as you know if you 're a regular reader of this blog , i'm writing a mental illness memoir which is undergoing final proofing and formatting right now sample chapters will be available very soon add your name to the mailing list to be notified when samples are ready thanks !
