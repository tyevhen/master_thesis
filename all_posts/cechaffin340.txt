i'm sitting here after a day of my brother in law 's birdwatching while i plantwatched he saw a hutton 's vireo today i saw thrift and blue eyed grass in our parallel pursuits i praised him for his level of difficulty birds move but plant 's do n't richard has to wait on birds but plants wait on me i have often thought i may like plants better than animals or humans i suppose man 's inplantimity to man has spurred me to it and animals you can groom , but you just ca n't prune you can have a bigger impact on a plant 's life than anything else i know feed it , prune it , shape it , make a topiary of it , hybridize , create a new cultivar with your name on a subspecies 's tag i mean , it would take much longer for me to breed a craig 's hound than graft a fruting branch on a rootstock and thinking of my doctoring years , i ca n't tell you how much easier plants are than patients plants ca n't disobey your orders i 've been reading through jane hirschfield 's after , a lovely book in which her diction becomes simpler with no loss of substance i highly recommend it her assays poems are particularly good , like envy an assay , termites an assay , and especially ah an assay ah an assay when the greek gods would dip into the clothing and bodies of humans , it was not always as it appeared not always , that is , for seduction , nor to test the warmth of welcome given to strangers the sex like the sudden unveiling and recognition was not without pleasure but later , they would remember the barley soup offered one night in the village of , its wild marjoram , scent of scorched iron , and carrots ah ! , and the ones who turned away from us , how their eyes would narrow and wrinkle the tops of their noses the barnyard odors and afterward , sleep in that salt scent , close by their manure hoards and feathers sleep itself ! ah ! for this soft ah ! , immortals entered the world of bodies such a great idea , walking in the shoes of gods i'm not a fan of prose poems but i'm slowly being won over about two decades after they became permanently accepted as a genre for those of you who think i'm just spinning my wheels , i presently have twenty poetry submissions pending to magazines that pay something some are big names beyond my wildest dreams but hey , just mail the stuff persistence is more important than talent no one will discover you if you do n't promote yourself the world is not a merit system it 's connections , promotion , persistence , and a little talent that counts not a lot just think robert creeley and britney spears i ca n't decide who of the two is less talented i'm happy the nba playoffs have begun , especially watching our local warriors beat the number one team , dallas , in their first game for christmas i got a subscription to nba tv , so i do n't have to miss anything tonight its the lakers vs the suns and the warriors vs the mavs and do n't miss charles barkley on tnt , truly the funniest hall of famer in the history of basketball , a gifted clown who can laugh at himself as much as he criticizes others a national treasure despite his ascending the stands in his playing days to spit on a fan , or his numerous bar brawls which he invariably won he has displaced ted turner as the mouth of the south i will leave you here do stay in touch thine in truth and art , ce unrated
