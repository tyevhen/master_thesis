in a speech , nikita khrushchev made the following remark can there be diseases , nervous diseases among certain people in the communist society ? evidently there can be if that is so , then there also will be offenses which are characteristic of people with abnormal minds to those who might start calling for opposition to communism on this basis , we say that now , too , there are people who fight against communism , but clearly the mental state of such people is not normal after khrushchev s speech , soviet psychiatrists immediately set about trying to identify , and treat with drugs and institutionalization , all the mentally ill communism deniers haldol was the chief antipsychotic used in soviet political hospitals early ads for haldol emphasized cooperation and control its use in the u s has declined in favor of risperidone and other atypicals click to enlarge the groundwork had already been laid in , in a joint session of the ussr academy of medical sciences and the board of the all union neurological and psychiatric association a session instigated by stalin so as to free soviet psychiatry of western influences , a number of prominent neurologists and psychiatrists were accused of pursuing an anti marxist and reactionary deviation from the teachings of pavlov the psychiatrist who wrote the subsequent policy report was andrei snezhnevsky , who identified a new mental illness sluggish schizophrenia after khrushchev s speech , the term quickly gained currency and the new illness was frequently diagnosed symptoms of the alleged illness were such that even the slightest nonconformity of speech or behavior could be taken as a sign of mental derangement outspoken dissent might be diagnosed for example as indicative of sluggish schizophrenia with delusions of reform andrei vladimirovich snezhnevsky snezhnevsky personally signed documents declaring several prominent dissidents legally insane among them neurophysiologist vladimir bukovsky , who would become the first to expose the abuse of psychiatry in the soviet union , and spent years in prisons , forced labor camps , and psychiatric hospitals astonishingly , in , one year before bukovsky managed to smuggle , to the outside world , pages documenting the role of soviet psychiatry in silencing political dissenters , the american psychiatric association named andrei snezhnevsky a distinguished fellow for his outstanding contribution to psychiatry and related sciences at its annual meeting in san francisco in the u s , we pride ourselves on our supposed freedom of ideological choice and laugh sadly at the seemingly absurd willingness of a soviet medical system to pathologize dissent and yet , in the u s , if you dare criticize capitalism or suggest that the u s might not be the greatest country in the history of the universe etc , you are essentially considered a lunatic , or at the very least imbalanced in some fundamental sense , much the same way khrushchev considered anyone who questioned marxist orthodoxy to be psychologically impaired we scoff at the idea that dissent is methodically suppressed even with medication ! in the u s , and yet the dsm v spells out , in detail , the very conditions we scoff at one is called oppositional defiant disorder yes , odd indeed the disorder , strangely affecting children and adolescents only , constitutes a recurrent pattern of negativistic , defiant , disobedient , and or hostile behavior toward authority figures that persists for at least months and is not due to a mood or psychotic disorder to fulfill the diagnosis , an individual must exhibit of the following often loses temper often argues with adults often actively defies or refuses to comply with adult requests often deliberately annoys others often blames others for his or her mistakes or poor behavior often touchy or easily annoyed often angry or resentful often spiteful or vindictive fortunately for politicians , odd is not considered to be a disorder of adulthood otherwise it would obviously apply to most of congress up to of odd patients may go on to be diagnosed with conduct disorder , which is like odd but involves destructive and or violent behavior which are not part of odd conduct disorder , in turn , is considered a precursor of antisocial personality disorder aspd , which , strangely , does n't afflict anyone until age aspd , meanwhile , is often associated with psychopathy or sociopathy all of which can be , and often are , in fact , treated with drugs what drugs do we use in the u s to treat these disorders ? pretty much the same category of drugs the soviets used antipsychotics the only difference is that in today 's u s we tend to favor atypical antipsychotics which were not available in soviet days between and , u s doctor s visits with a prescription of antipsychotic medications increased from per persons to for children a fold increase , to for adolescents , and to for adults see olfson et al , jama psychiatry , dec , or for a somewhat broader discussion see appendix c in of two minds antipsychotics are largely given to induce compliant , non disruptive behavior one study found that of child antipsychotic prescriptions were based on a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders bottom line , we regularly medicate not only children but adults in the u s with antipsychotics in fact we do it on an unprecedented scale to reduce disruption , alleviate agitation , and remediate disorganized thinking one of the signature positive symptoms of schizophrenia the beauty of the american system is that the afflicted , by and large , willingly endorse their own treatment except , of course , for certain children , who may not like the treatment but wo n't progress through school without it the result , in any case , is a compliant tranquilized populace , a citizenry that does n't complain about the true sources of its illness , which might include , say , a conformity obsessed school system , or a job world that treats humans as capital , or a dysfunctional political apparatus corrupted by corporate influence , or any number of other complaints that might turn out , on close scrutiny , to be quite legitimate the sovietization of the american psychiatric system that began with andrei snezhnevsky who was duly recognized by the american psychiatric association in is now complete , minus the mental hospitals that no longer exist we allow our mentally ill to roam free it is the land of the free , after all is it not , comrade ?
