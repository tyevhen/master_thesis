i read this post recently over at un schooled , and all i could think as i read it was how very much i related to it not the great musicians touring europe bit i wish , but the relationship , the closeness , described between siblings and i just had to share my own relationship with my sister , and how i feel that relationship has been affected by unschooling emilie most often referred to as em or emi , if i'm the one doing the referring is hands down my best friend in the entire world emi , in summer ' she 's years younger than me the half especially mattered when we were younger does n't a bigger sibling always want to claim as much of an older and thus obviously more mature advantage as they can ? , so when i first started going to kindergarten which i continued to do for half a year she was still too young for school this was long enough ago that three was still considered too young for school ! every day when the bus came to pick me up , my mother would walk me the short distance to the end of our street , while emi would stay by the window watching until i was picked up i think she was envious of me that i got to go somewhere that seemed , at the time , exciting though i was personally pretty ambivalent about my kindergarten experience , even at the time more than that , i think she just missed me we were used to spending all of our time together me and emi , circa ' or ' once i left school , we fell back into a more familiar rhythm we spent our days playing , creating art , and going to various group activities when emi reached school age , there was never any suggestions of her going to school so we grew up together we played , learned , squabbled , and everything else siblings are supposed to do we liked baking circa i mean , we certainly fought , and continue to fight , at times when she was just a toddler i bit her on the face , and just a couple of years ago i gashed her arm open with my nails then felt extremely bad about it for weeks , long after it had healed , among hundreds of other small fights that resulted in less spectacular displays of physical violence for a few years , when i was in my preteen to very early teenage years , we lost a lot of closeness , as i had definitely hit a new developmental stage , felt a lot older , and emi was still a little kid but once she reached the preteen stage , we regained that closeness once more me and emi , with our dog , flora , in ' of course , virtually all siblings be they unschoolers , homeschoolers , public and private schoolers , or freeschoolers love their siblings many , no matter what type of education they have , are even close to their siblings but sadly , there are also many who are not to me , one of the greatest benefits of unschooling is the relationships i 've developed with my family , which i definitely attribute at least in part to unschooling when in school , siblings spend every day appart from each other , in separate grades , classrooms , and even schools though seeing as you 're not supposed to be socializing in class , i suppose it would n't make much of a difference if siblings where in the same class , anyway evenings are usually spent doing homework , or spending time with other friends there 's a stigma attached to hanging out with people of different ages , and i 've definitely also encountered a stigma to liking family members to many young people , actually liking a sibling enough to spend time with them just is n't cool so as unschoolers , we missed out on internalizing any siblings are uncool and so is anyone younger than me messages but far more than that , we simply had the time to become such good friends ! because that 's what we are now best friends emi is now , and i 'll be turning in march though we no longer share the same activities , we still share a fair amount of friends we hang out together we giggle and squee over sexy guys , watch shows and movies together , and endlessly discuss the plot , characters , and where it all might be heading we also discuss a huge array of other things like sexism and anarchy , oppression and media and racism and gender and how we want to live our lives problems with friends and things people said and how we can make a difference sometimes we curl up together and talk until am or later laughing at who knows what taken in we 've been known to laugh in synchronization , and even to burst out singing the exact same song at the exact same time , completely out of the blue we make comments and references that cause us both to burst into laughter , when no one else has a clue what we 're talking about we exchange plenty of secrets that never go further than the two of us , and we almost always know what the other is getting at , even if we 're exhausted and making no sense which , being the very late night people we are , is a fairly frequent occurrence at a dance , in perhaps we would have been just as close had we gone to school but i'm oh so glad that our relationship was never put under the strain of the both of us growing up separately in school , so glad that our friendship could grow unhindered as we ourselves grew up ! both of us looking kinda silly , but happy ! june , ' yeah , okay , i'm feeling kind of sappy now but , well , she 's my sister i could go on so much longer i could talk about how we 've always looked out for and defended each other i could talk about how awesome and witty , intelligent , hilarious , social , thoughtful , compassionate my sister is , and about all the cool things she does like play snare drum in a highland band , and be a ninja really , she takes ninjitsu and write novels , and sew plushies , and all that jazz but i think i'm going to stop here , and finish instead with this quote from kate , of un schooled , who says it all so much better than i 've managed to in this post going to school doesn t mean not getting to know your own family it doesn t mean not becoming good friends with your siblings but being unschooled means getting the chance to hang out with them all the time to learn with them the way kids in school learn with their classmates to learn with them in ways that classrooms can t really ever encompass being unschooled means living together during the day as well as the evening and the winter as well as the summer not knowing that you re supposed to be divided up into grade levels and younger kids are supposed to be boring and older kids are supposed to be off limits being unschooled means being in it together every day and i am so thankful that i got the chance to be with my brothers like that
