i wanted to find a nice , sweet entry to help jog my memory on how it feels at the beginning of a lovely new relationship instead , i quite quickly remembered how it was n't so sweet in the beginning of my last relationship with mr rebellious i found this entry quite humorous it probably sums up how i felt for the whole two years sunday th december so my life is full of drama the whole 'mr rebellious' thing is very much in full swing been out a few times now and have ended up at his on more than a few occastions thing is i think he really likes me , well that 's what he has said ! all the signs are telling me this is bad , the amount of lies i am telling is awfull , one thing is for sure , if this continues i am going to have to be honest with the rents i absolutly hate having to lie but they leave me no choice ! it 's only a bit of fun and i'm still figuring it all out for myself anyway , so what is there to tell the thing is , he is probably the most inappropriate guy i could ever be with well ok , not that bad but pretty bad firstly i think it has been so long since i 've had any sort of thing like this that it feels nice to go out and have a flirt secondly it is quite fun , i know i'm not going to get too involved so really there 's no harm ? ! and it 's really hard to say no it 's so easy to text back and say 'yea , i 'll go out' i'm def going to speak to him on tuesday oh yea , i'm going over to his , god !
