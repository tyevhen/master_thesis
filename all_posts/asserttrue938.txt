lately i 've been perusing some of oracle 's javascript code from its adf faces i see that it 's extraordinarily well commented i'm looking at it in openoffice , so just for fun , i tell ooo to do a regex search on and globally replace that with zilch , thereby wiping out all comment lines the result ? with comments , oracle 's core js file is kb without comments kb imagine almost k of comments in a k file i do n't think i 've ever seen such well commented code in any language , ever kas
