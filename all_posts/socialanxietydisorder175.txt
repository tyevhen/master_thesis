subsidizing green technology is affordable only if it is done in tiny , tokenistic amounts using the governments generous subsidies , germans installed gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity last year , more than double what the government had deemed acceptable it is estimated that this increase alone will lead to a hike in the average consumers annual power bill according to der spiegel , even members of chancellor angela merkels staff are now describing the policy as a massive money pit philipp rsler , germanys minister of economics and technology , has called the spiraling solar subsidies a threat to the economy advertisement germanys enthusiasm for solar power is understandable we could satisfy all of the worlds energy needs for an entire year if we could capture just one hour of the suns energy even with the inefficiency of current pv technology , we could meet the entire globes energy demand with solar panels by covering , square kilometers , square miles , about percent of the sahara desert unfortunately , germanylike most of the worldis not as sunny as the sahara and , while sunlight is free , panels and installation are not solar power is at least four times more costly than energy produced by fossil fuels it also has the distinct disadvantage of not working at night , when much electricity is consumed in the words of the german association of physicists , solar energy cannot replace any additional power plants on short , overcast winter days , germanys million solar power systems can generate no electricity at all the country is then forced to import considerable amounts of electricity from nuclear power plants in france and the czech republic indeed , despite the massive investment , solar power accounts for only about percent of germanys total energy this is one of the key reasons why germans now pay the second highest price for electricity in the developed world exceeded only by denmark , which aims to be the world wind energy champion germans pay three times more than their american counterparts http www slate com articles news and p answer lol the same in spain where , after intensive work and expenditures , they have found that for each green job they lost normal jobs http www forbes com green j alan turing der spiegel is one of the biggest german news magazine http www spiegel de international , question how can anyone support obama at this point ? unemployment is rising economists expected the economy to create , jobs this month we created , fewer jobs than expected for a whopping u unemployment rate counting discouraged and part time workers looking for full time work , we re at about then , of course , there s the matter of the folks who have fallen off the unemployment rolls they number in the millions , but they don t count anymore apparently they re enjoying double dips at the local ice cream shop incidentally , in response to today s report of a unemployment rate , the white house s chief economist said that these are just bumps on the road to recovery so , now that we are back in the double dip , we can expect the marketing message to change it s just a bump housing is toast it s happening just as we forecast two years ago the second wave is in full effect and no , new buyer tax credit is going to stop it a drop year over year , and we can expect , at a minimum , another from here we ve said it before , and we ll say it again , from top to bottom this real estate market will see declines of between to it s a long way to go before real estate stabilizes in real value terms fed printing might keep prices seemingly within the range of where they were in the mid s , but that means the cost of everything else will be rising as well , significantly outpacing the housing market greece , beware of eu member who bear gifts europe is a disaster it may not seem important to us here in the us , and our leading economists certainly rarely , if ever , mention it but it is important to note that one of the key reasons for why the great depression of the s happened was because of european defaults guess what ? it will happen again less than a year ago they told us greece had to be saved and that they had a plan the eu and imf would lend them a bunch of money that they couldn t pay back , and that would resolve the problem woops it turns out that borrow and spend didn t work so good for greece they re in serious trouble again , their bonds are collapsing , and they are in more debt now than last year new plan lend them more money , and this time , double dips for everyone ! consumer s aren t so confident anymore what is america without a confident consumer base ? in a depression , that s what and right now , our consumer confidence numbers are collapsing it might have something to do with the weather , as is often claimed by mainstream media it s the heat it s the snow it s the tornadoes or maybe , just maybe , it s that everyone is broke , the banks aren t lending to consumers unless you re going to college and people are terrified that next week they re going to get a pink slip we ll let out astute readers make up their own minds on this one manufacturing is collapsing turns out that when consumers stop buying stuff , the people who produce that stuff don t get orders from the companies that sell it the end result is collapsing manufacturing sector , which is exactly what we saw happen earlier this week with the ism manufacturing index food stamps for everyone ! putting all other economic indicators aside , you can look to the food stamp participation rate to get a real idea of what this crisis feels like on main street million people require assistance from the government to eat to eat ! we ve projected this is going to million within another to months now we re learning that congress may actually be looking to cut food stamp programs bad news considering that commodity prices will continue to rise over coming years , effectively reducing those food stamp benefits through dollar depreciation riots in the streets won t be far behind answer we re smart enough to realize that obama didn t cause the recession , and there was nothing he could ve done better to help stop it seriously , he came into office with a skyrocketing unemployment , and stopped it at , i doubt mccain would ve been able to pull that off any con probably would have just cut taxes for the rich , to help out china s economy question it was k before and now it s k , why does it keep dropping ? washington house democrats at work on health legislation are narrowing in on an income tax surcharge on the highest paid wage earners to help pay the cost of subsidizing insurance for the million who lack it pushing to complete a comprehensive health care bill by friday and bring it up for committee votes next week , house democrats abandoned earlier money raising proposals , including a payroll tax they planned to meet behind closed doors thursday to fine tune the details the action in the house stood in contrast to the senate , where democrats edged away from their goal of passing health care legislation by early august amid heightening partisan controversy over tax increases and a proposed new government role in providing insurance to consumers as discussed in the tax writing house ways and means committee , the surtax would apply to individuals with adjusted gross income of more than , and couples over , , according to officials involved in the discussion most spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private in addition , key lawmakers are expected to call for a tax or fee equal to a percentage of a worker s salary on employers who do not offer health benefits ways and means chairman charles rangel , d n y , has said his committee needs to come up with billion in new taxes to deliver on president barack obama s goal of sweeping changes to the nation s health care system to bring down costs and cover the million uninsured hundreds of billions of dollars more would come from cuts to medicare and medicaid to pay for legislation expected to cost around trillion over years top administration officials , including white house chief of staff rahm emanuel , conferred with rangel s committee democrats on wednesday as they met throughout the day they know what i m thinking about and i have no reason to believe i ll have any problems with them on that part of the bill , rangel said of the tax proposals rep shelley berkley , d nev , a member of the panel , said the proposed surtax on high income taxpayers appealed to her and others as a way to avoid a nickel and dime approach involving numerous smaller tax increases answer i assume you re talking about this part the surtax would apply to individuals with adjusted gross income of more than , and couples over , as obama repeatedly made clear during the campaing , families making under , would not see their taxes go up under his plan nothing in the article you cite contradicts that see how it says the tax would apply to individuals making over , ?
