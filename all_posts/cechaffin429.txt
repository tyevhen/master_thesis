funeral notes i won t take death lying down let me sit up so i can curse the day i don t want a martyr s tinsel crown if my poetry should gain renown and some fool wishes to embalm this clay , i won t take death lying down a viking funeral let me burn and drown is better than the coffin s slow decay i don t want a martyr s tinsel crown death is the ancestral hand me down , your last best suit , it is the great clich i won t take death lying down we hope some deed or word , some towering noun might keep our memory forever in play i don t want a martyr s tinsel crown i ll curse you if you put me in the ground i d rather you put my books on display i won t take death lying down i don t want a martyr s tinsel crown i want to thank lkd for her compassionate comment yesterday , proving that she is truly one acquainted with the night it s easy to tell who knows and who does not know the experience of severe depression there is no way to fake the knowledge i wish i were never given the knowledge , but you can t pick your parents , and both of my grandmothers , not to mention a bunch of aunts and cousins , are manic depressive , as was my father there are certain disadvantages to the diagnosis in terms of practical matters i can t get term life insurance because my dad committed suicide at age and i have the same disease as for health insurance , we are catapulted into the states high risk pool , where we can get blue cross for mo or sign up with kaiser for around , the only disadvantage being that kaiser is over two hours away , and not an easy drive on the two lanes even when i was a practicing doctor i favored universal health insurance massachusetts is trying it , god bless them with a third of americans uninsured , it is one more class division between the haves and have nots i worry about kathleen s hip , which is painful and clicking , and whether she might need a hip replacement and if i had insurance , this depression might be over as i could afford ect but we muddle on , try to walk each day for an hour , stop when kathleen s hip or back become too painful and kenyon can t join us on these walks , they wear him out , although he still swims like a seal today kathleen has declared housecleaning and i look forward to it since it consists of concrete tasks with immediate rewards i once asked my pastor at a large lutheran church if there were any menial tasks i could do to help me with depression i ended up vacuuming the whole sanctuary but my back couldn t take it and they say irony is dead i think i ll cut this off here and check in with the domestic engineer and receive my sentence one crying spell yesterday i usually try to resist at kilorats , craig erick
