fears and fantasies , which has served to keep them going and as a result , they must each face that they 've become like zombies , and life has no meaning for them without their illusions then , hickey reveals his secret the benefits of reading the iceman cometh without giving away the dramatic ending , i believe that the iceman cometh is a fascinating play with universal psychological themes although it would be easy to dismiss these characters' stories because they 're severe alcoholics who have lost their way , the story highlights how easy it is for anyone to hold onto illusions and the personal repercussions involved if you have n't read the iceman cometh , i highly recommend that you read it and consider the psychological roles of illusion and denial see my article the benefits
