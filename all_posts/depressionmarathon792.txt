my brain has been feeling less broken lately in fact , this morning i was detailing feeling better to my doctor we were both pleased unfortunately , by early afternoon , i was tired , sad , and hopeless so very weird this morning , i ran my errands , did some laundry , and met the electrician working on my basement renovation by the afternoon , i was in bed despite sleeping for hours , i could barely drag myself out of bed i forced myself out the door for a bike ride , which went okay , although i could n't wait to be done i ate dinner and e mailed my doctor something to the effect of wtf ? i hate when my mood shifts so quickly as i said to my doctor , it makes my head spin it is so strange how does one go from feeling okay in the morning to feeling like crap in the afternoon ? shit , i do n't know it 's just another one of the joys of this illness , i guess on another note , i 've joined weight watchers online now people who know me are thinking , wtf ? you see , i do n't look overweight , and i'm not but i'm heavier than i 've ever been i do n't like the way i look or feel and being a runner , heavier equals slower , too i 'd like to lose pounds i know i 'll feel better physically and mentally if i do and i 'll still be well within normal weight limits for my height my doctor and therapist approve , and the program has already paid off it 's what motivated me to get back out the door to exercise with weight watchers , eating uses points and exercising accumulates them i like to eat , so exercise is necessary ! i 'll keep you abreast of my progress so far , i'm really liking the program that 's all for now i'm getting ready for my relay triathlon this weekend more on that later
