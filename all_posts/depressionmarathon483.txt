i just returned from my weekend with d we had a lovely time he indulged my training schedule and waited , after he ran miles , while i ran miles saturday morning i had a good run it was a beautiful day , and d took me to a beautiful trail through the woods i ran miles out and back there were a lot of other runners and bikers out , but there was no shortage of quiet solitude either it was nice during my run , i hit a rough patch between miles and but then finished strong i'm still thinking about signing up for the dallas marathon based on how well i ran and recovered from this miler , i think i'm still in fairly good marathon shape after our run , d and i indulged in a couple of big , delicious burgers before heading out to an art museum walking slowly for hours through an art museum is not typically how i recover after running miles , but i put on some compression stockings and did fine i got a short nap in later while d cooked me a very enjoyable thai dinner it was a long , productive , complete day together after such a wonderful time together , it was difficult to leave today puck and i packed up and headed out early this afternoon despite the challenge of the distance between us , i think things are moving along nicely in our relationship i'm glad he 's one of the good guys , and i really like him i'm now getting settled back into my nice , quiet house it 's going to be another busy week , as i'm working out of the next days i 'll even be working thanksgiving day , but hopefully only half the day i 've been invited to eat thanksgiving dinner with my very close friends , and i'm really looking forward to that i have a lot to be grateful for i think i 'll try to focus on that throughout this busy week
