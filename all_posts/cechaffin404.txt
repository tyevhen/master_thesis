i would like to do a chinese brush experiment , an exercise where the poet can go only forward , never back except to change line breaks , punctuation , grammar or spelling the words themselves may not be changed in any significant way here i go introducing demosthenes chewed stones but spit them out , his tongue ungrateful for the discipline she 'd learned from pebbles wrapped in saliva not an announcement , no parasol and green balloon over the astronomy lab , shame it is as i was saying , the shortest route between two points is woven like a snake , even two snakes mating which is a vision you ca n't be responsible for i mean in a general sense , no presupposition the black girl in the orange raincoat smiles for no reason , you grip your cane , shield your heart and take suspicion for your lover shame it 's not the same for everybody , you know but as i get older i want to be more open , coiled to try to understand , intent upon meaning , without dismissing the ravings of the inexperienced nor promoting the ignorance of academic singularization , to live with an open door because the house of your life is stout and your fear is a trace element folding on itself atomically the nuclear blast so green green fire , the parasol on the desert was dust dangerous dust ha ! the sore point how the ulcer of aggression feeds the maggot of desire we were talking about that , and the confessions of the samoan twins , accused of terminal obesity exceeding the cholesterol limit by two kiloblubbers thank you very much you have been very kind may you all be blessed in all things by the grace of god , amen
