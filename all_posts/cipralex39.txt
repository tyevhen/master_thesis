once again its been a while since i 've posted , but in a way thats a good thing , i spend most of my time with my girlfriend and friends , having fun living i'm very calm maybe a bit too calm , at least that what my gf thinks , i have n't told her anything about it yet , and with a little luck i would never need to everything is fine , no panic attacks lately maybe just a mild one couple of days ago but nothing serious i will post more soon take care and happy holidays email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
