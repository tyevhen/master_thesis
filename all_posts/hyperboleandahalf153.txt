i am finally coming to terms with the fact that i am not cut out to be a productive member of society i originally intended to become a doctor or medical researcher i thought that i wanted to save people , discover things and change the world but the more i think about it , the more i realize that i just want to sit on my couch in my underpants all day this is why i need you to make me famous by thursday thursday is the day that i officially graduate from college back in january , i thought i would be ecstatic when this day finally came i now realize that graduating is a huge mistake i wish i could take it back , but i ca n't at this point i ca n't even fail i am starting to panic it does n't have to be this way if my blog can become famous and profitable , i will be rescued from the brink of adulthood if my blog becomes famous , it is possible that i will never have to wear pants again ! you have no idea how much this would mean to me i hate pants here is what you can do to help wear a brown ribbon in honor of my cause nobody has dibs on brown yet , right ? this will not only help me , but it will raise awareness for terminally adult people all over the world run down the street screaming about how awesome my blog is make sure to clearly annunciate the url spell it out if you have to hang up a banner outside your door that says help rescue the author of hyperboleandahalf blogspot com from impending adulthood make flyers to support my cause neon green and yellow would probably be good background colors for the flyers you make just fyi take out a phonebook start dialing in the a 's somewhere educate the call recipient about my plight if they resist , ask them if they ever had a dream use their first name if it is listed try to use their nostalgia and insecurity over their broken dreams to get them on your side but do n't be inefficient ! if you sense that the person is a heartless bastard who will not change their position no matter how much you plead , move on to the next name this is a numbers game and you ca n't get them all call your local radio station dedicate a song to me preferably do n't stop believing by journey once again , make sure to clearly annunciate all syllables in my blog url i cannot stress how important this is that 's all you have to do to assure that my future can be spent pants less and happy ! is that too much to ask ? p s i am completely serious about this how funny would it be if someone actually did some of these things ? even if i do n't get famous , i would probably be able to live the rest of my life in complete happiness knowing that some person , somewhere did these things in my honor if you take a movie picture of yourself doing any of these things , i will post it on my soon to be super famous blog along with a description of how awesome you are p p s i wanted to tell you again that i am completely serious , just in case you did n't believe me
