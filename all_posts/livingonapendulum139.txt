so while i was writing the post of the best chick flicks , my daughter suggested i do one about which books , in my opinion were some of the best and why this post might be a work in progress because i have read a great deal many books in my lifetime i am a reader when i read , i am one of the lucky ones who sees the characters and the actions reading to me is like watching a movie , it just takes longer sometimes i read books just to pass the time , other times i want to be captivated by the story , become part of it , so i read a variety of books to start off , i have a few favorite authors john saul john saul is a writer of suspense and horror this man has a wonderfully twisted mind his monsters , if you want to call him that , tend to focus on children , or be children he covers mad scientists , many souls with unfinished business , hauntings , possessions , human experimentations i own almost all his books and i am slowly converting them from paperback to hard cover he is the only author that i wrote to the publishing company to order books i could not find in bookstores this was before my amazon and chapter days i highly recommend him iris johansen irish johansen writes in two very different styles crime fiction and romance novels i first discovered her under the romance novel umbrella and noticed that she had a wonderful style one day i noticed her name on the cover of a book in the suspense section when i picked up the book and flipped it over i saw by the photo that it was the same author the book seemed very different from the medieval novels i had been reading from her that when i discovered the world of eve duncan and joe quinn in her crime novels , she has central characters around which most of her stories revolve eventually , like a soap opera , you become addicted to the lives of these characters and wonder what kind of new adventures they can have of course , also being a romance novelist , her crime stories have a bit of romance and descriptive love scenes , the best of both worlds i am also building up a hard cover collection of her books catherine coulter catherine coulter also writes in two different styles she reminds me a little of ms johansen , but she does have her very own way of telling a story she writes romantic suspense thrillers and historical romances catherine has a fbi series which has a cast of central characters each book however stands on it 's own it 's interesting to see how each character interweaves through her stories nora roberts nora roberts is a truly prolific writer how can one person write as many books as she does is a mystery to me sometimes i wonder if j d robbs is not an actual twin or clone ! yeah that 's right , clone j d robbs is her pen name for her crime series in death she is at the bottom of my top four because she is the more commercial author i did have to include her however as i read a great many of her books , and i know that whatever she writes will be a pleasant read she is a safe author , which is probably why she is so popular now on to my favorite books let 's take for granted that any book written by the quartet above is going to be on that list what other book have i enjoyed reading ? well i enjoy almost all books ! which ones did i enjoy more you say ? oh you should have said so here they are elizabeth george this body of death on compassionate leave after the murder of his wife , thomas lynley is called back to scotland yard when the body of a woman is found stabbed and abandoned in an isolated london cemetery his former team doesn t trust the leadership of their new department chief , isabelle ardery , whose management style seems to rub everyone the wrong way in fact , lynley may be the sole person who can see beneath his superior officer s hard as nails exterior to a hidden and possibly attractive vulnerability elizabeth george is a master at describing the torments of her main characters and keeping the secret of who done it till the end unholy child catherine breslin unholy child is a year in the life of sister angela flynn and the people around her , a story of how this secret she 's kept affects not only her but everyone she 's come into contact with from the title , i was expecting something like the anti christ , but what i got instead was a dead baby and a nun who does n't remember being pregnant the twist to this story is that sister angela has a split personality , there 's also gayle flynn gayle was angela 's birth name before the order gave her angela gayle is a lot freer with herself , drinking , having fun , and picking up men angela has no idea gayle exists when angela comes back from a blackout to find herself somewhere she does n't recognize , hours missing from her life , she does n't know what to think , and she keeps this a secret as well to be continued
