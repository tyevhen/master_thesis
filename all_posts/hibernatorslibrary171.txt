reading the bible as literature event hosted by roof beam reader number on my classics club list is the holy bible , so imagine my delight when i heard that roof beam reader is hosting a reading the bible as literature event next year despite repeated promises to myself that i will not sign up for any more year long blogging events i already have and that 's probably more than i can handle , i need to participate in this event i have been watching for such an opportunity for a few years now , but whenever i find one , it is generally a very conservative or charismatic group which i would n't fit into or it 's half way done or , people are just crazy mean to each other i have high hopes for this one this will be a literary reading of the bible , which is exactly what i'm looking for i have three four bibles that i will be working from , since i think a serious study requires different translations and perspectives my three four bibles are nrsv esv and for help in concentration while reading the esv esv nabre unfortunately , delving into the bible as i would like to this year will mean that my other non fiction goals will be put on hold other than the little house readalong but i think it 's worth it here 's the reading plan that roof beam reader has outlined the reading plan january genesis through exodus february leviticus through deuteronomy march deuteronomy through samuel april samuel through chronicles may chronicles through esther june job through psalms july psalms through isaiah august isaiah through ezekiel september ezekiel through zechariah october malachi through luke november luke through corinthians december corinthians through revelations i'm really excited about this , and hopefully i have the time to delve into it as i would wish without totally throwing off all my other reading plans
