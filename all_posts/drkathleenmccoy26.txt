the memories came flooding back yesterday when , by chance , i pulled an old book from the shelf of our home library and a yellowed envelope fell out from between the pages i picked it up , examining the lovely , legible handwriting that so many learned in the early decades of the last century it was from a beloved aunt , my mother 's youngest sister , who had been my grandmother 's caregiver in the last years of her life it was postmarked june , six months after grandma 's death and eight months after my mother 's unexpected passing i found these pictures in your grandmother 's attic , she wrote i do n't know whether this was a dance recital or just temporary insanity but i thought you might like to have these back carefully , i pulled the photos out of the envelope and stared and suddenly , memories of easter , were there , sweet and so immediate it was the easter of my junior year at northwestern university and i have never celebrated that holiday in quite the same way before or since i wonder if i ever told my aunt that this was , indeed , an instance of temporary insanity ? i had returned to the dorm the night before easter , after a rare exceedingly rare date , to find my roommate ruth sitting on the floor of our room , busily constructing something out of crumpled newspapers , wire coat hangers and old white towels here , she said , tossing me a pair of scissors and the raw materials we need bunny ears we 're going to be easter bunnies in a student film that a friend of betty 's is doing tomorrow bright and early in the crocus patch i sat down slowly you volunteered us ? ruth did n't look up from her task sure , she said why not ? do you have better plans for easter ? i did n't this was the first easter i was n't planning to attend mass , having become disenchanted with the religion of my upbringing it was too early in the quarter to get super compulsive about midterms and class projects i sat down and got to work on my bunny ears the next morning , four of us assembled in betty 's room to review the plans for our film debut betty , in a bright yellow caftan , a craft paper beak nearly obscuring her face , would be the great chicken karen , in a black pajamas with a lambskin rug tied to her back and a paper lamb 's mask resting on top of her head would be the spring lamb and ruth and i , resplendent in our matching pink leotards and terrycloth ears , would be bunnies we were joined by our wonderfully loyal hawaiian friend jeanne , an enthusiastic photographer , who not only agreed to be seen with us but also to hold our coats when we were on camera it was a very chilly easter morning and to take photos of this event easter from left , karen , betty , me and ruth betty clucked karen cried baaaaa ! and ruth and i romped through the crocus patch as the student filmmaker , perhaps a bit taken aback by us and our makeshift costumes , perhaps underwhelmed by our collective film acting talent , completed a brief segment and fled people on the way to services at the university chapel across the street took scant notice out of the corner of my eye , i saw a guy on whom i had a major crush pass by en route to church suddenly mortified , i prayed my only prayers on this first secular easter sunday that he had n't seen me but a man walking to church with his family spotted us immediately and turned with delight to his five year old son see , i told you that we might run into the easter bunny ! he laughed as the son clutched his father 's leg and tried to hide behind him , ruth and i rushed forward to give him candy eggs from our baskets the little boy smiled shyly and thanked us the moment was an inspiration to betty let 's go surprise some professors ! she said wish them happy easter ! give their kids candy ! oh , come on ! it 'll be fun we surprised only one professor one of betty 's favorites who greeted us with incredible kindness and grace , inviting us into his home for an easter brunch with his family he pulled up extra chairs and we enjoyed delicious eggs benedict and great company that morning later , when we got back to the dorm , removed our rudimentary costumes and settled in for some serious studying , i thought back on the day i thought about how liberating it felt to make a total fool of myself and not have it be a personal disaster i thought about how fun it was to do something a little crazy and impulsive with a group of good friends i thought about how most people that day did n't see us or ignored us , but that some special adults greeted us with humor and amazing generosity of spirit that i hoped to emulate in my own later years i thought about how strange it felt to be celebrating easter as a secular rather than religious holiday and wondered if it would always feel that way i thought about how soon we would be adults , out in the world and too grown up for such revelry youthful revelry years ago ! and , indeed , we grew up so very fast betty became a psychiatric social worker , karen a college professor , ruth a highly successful attorney we 've lived lifetimes of challenges , disappointments , achievements and joys since that easter years ago and yet that day remains vivid , with or without the memory prompt of those long lost photographs that jeanne took of us that easter morning so long ago it marked the waning of a certain phase of youth , before adult responsibilities intervened to quiet and calm our spirits it was an important lesson for me in taking a chance , risking looking foolish , and realizing that my life would remain the same , that most people did n't notice or did n't care , and that some people , with an extra bit of kindness and imagination , were absolutely splendid it taught me anew that some friends are incredibly precious as jeanne stood by us , holding our coats as we cavorted , not embarrassed in the least to be seen with us i thought that at least some of my companions that day were likely to be friends for life and i was right jeanne and ruth have been close and treasured friends for more than years easter was a moment of frivolity at a time when we were all working incredibly hard at our studies and at campus jobs to build bright futures none of us came from affluent families we had to work as well as study hard to make our dreams come true during those years , i used to worry as i lay in bed in my dorm room each night will this all be worth it ? will i get a job doing work i love ? will i find someone special to love who actually loves me back ? and , well into what was once my unknown future , i smile as i study the old photographs looking back to that chilly morning years ago , i quietly give my younger self the answers to her questions yes ! yes ! and yes !
