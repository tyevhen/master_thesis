well , that last post was written quite a while back what ended up happening ? well , i had to go back a week later for another methotrexate shot since my numbers were barely going down i waited through all of may , june , and most of july before my numbers finally zeroed out it was such a slow and painful process ! i 'd just wanted it all to be over with and i had to go back twice per week for blood tests the entire duration when i eventually passed the pregnancy mid june it was the most awful painful experience of my life i wo n't lie physically , i went through the worst pain in my uterus i 'd ever felt i had contractions for hours on end that got more and more painful just like i 've always seen on childbirth shows on tv , i would feel the huge need to push i spent two days doing this and went lost huge quantities of tissue from in there in the worst moment of pain , i was home alone and passed the pregnancy in the toilet i would not wish this moment on anyone i just sort of sat there exhausted , sweaty and crying i know it sounds gross , but i fished it out so i could inspect it closely the mass was grayish and blue and the tissue it was on was the size of my hand i did n't know what to do with it i could n't much recognize much of what i was looking at so i put it back in the water and cried for a while then , as quickly as possible i hit the flush lever on the toilet so that i could n't change my mind i said a prayer and left the room to go lay down nobody talks about this part nobody wants to go there and i only share this because so many people go through this but feel they cannot share well , i mentioned in my first post that this was candid , so i wo n't apologize for being detailed it 's real life and it was horrible how would you feel if you were faced with flushing your once flourishing little baby bean down the toilet ? it was a terrible moment etched in my memory forever and i hope that those of you who have gone through it can understand why i share and i also hope that those of you who have n't will never know the feeling save you might also like flashback loss number three flashback loss number four flashback loss number two linkwithin
