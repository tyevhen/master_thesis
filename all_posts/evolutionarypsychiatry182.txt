last week i introduced us to a new diet and dementia paper for the most part i presented the results and fumbled around with the interpretation , but did n't quite know what to make of it , given a lack of details about the actual diets in the paper i contacted the researchers , who were kind enough in fact , they were very kind in their emails ! to send me a bit of information about the methods and a sample daily diet so now i can fumble around some more let 's start with big picture context i tend to forget sometimes that thoughtful and well meaning people still believe that animal fat is bad and simple carbs are bad and that we should all be eating cardboard er , i mean fiber rich foods , skim milk , olive oil in moderation , and skinless chicken breasts i'm also perhaps a little too comfortable with the fact that not only do thoughtful and well meaning people have that view , but that they think my view that animal fat is good and macronutrients are n't as important as you think absent insulin resistance or other issues such as dementia in which case you should be eating more fat is lunacy i mean , my kids get whole milk yogurt still , and they are both over two , the age when fat becomes bad according to the usda okay , i 'll stop with the capital letters now part of the reason that i'm comfortable being thought a lunatic is that i think most people secretly believe psychiatrists are lunatics anyway there is almost always a bit of a double take when i tell people my profession in medical circles , i will get a oh , she 's one of those sort of look among lay folk at a party , for example , people will suddenly clam up or begin telling me their life stories and all about the different psychiatric medicines they 've tried psychiatrists are a bit of a puzzle what is it we do , anyway ? i think of what psychiatrists do thusly we look at big , complex puzzles comprised of experience , world view , psychology , environment , and biology and try to figure out how to help someone typically presenting with emotional issues , though this day and age it could be anything manage all the factors that could be contributing to the problem that holistic view of problem solving health problems makes a psychiatrist somewhat uniquely suited to examining evolutionary medicine , but perhaps that is my bias speaking of bias , this week i read with great interest as always paul and shou ching jaminet 's perfect health diet blog , particularly blood lipids and infectious disease part in the comments i linked to an commentary on a study about cholesterol and all cause mortality in honolulu from the lancet , the money quote being here sir the central , surprising , finding from our study was that low serum cholesterol , persisting for years , increased subsequent all cause mortality we have no logical explanation for this finding , nor , apparently , do any of our correspondents here is a graph of their data and another money quote these are both from the author 's letter replying to other commentary about the findings we agree that the association between low cholesterol and mortality is only that we are sorry that cuchel and rader infer a causal relation , since that was not our intent yes , a correlation is merely a correlation but when correlations are always pretty darn consistent and the most recent phd post links to studies showing the same correlation , especially true in the elderly , it is important to put our thinking caps on and try to figure out why correlatively speaking higher cholesterol does n't seem to be killing people as fast as having low cholesterol does , despite the fact that health minded people have been busy eating good diets and taking meds to lower that cholesterol for a generation instead of putting on the thinking caps , the researchers in the lancet conclude we have no logical explanation and timidly suggest that the elderly not be treated quite so aggressively with cholesterol lowering medications which is nice and conservative of them , and fine , but how about a sentence with some thought about why cholesterol might be good for us , since our bodies go through all that trouble to make it , after all , and how we might go about proving causality from these correlations ? so , with the world view of the conventional nutritional researcher firmly in mind , let 's go back and look at the diet and dementia paper and the actual diets a reminder , in this study , healthy older adults mean age and adults with mild cognitive impairment mean age about were put on a low low fat , low glycemic carbohydrate diet or a high high fat , high saturated fat , high glycemic carbohydrate diet for weeks a number of biomarkers related to cholesterol and dementia were measured , and the researchers felt it came out as a clear win for the low diet i listed most of the results in my previous post , and what i think is the most interesting finding of the paper is how the mild cognitive impairment patients responded quite differently typically , in more extreme fluctuations of biomarkers , and sometimes opposite trends to the dietary changes than the healthy controls for simplicity 's sake , i will focus just on the mild cognitive impairment patients in this post first , more details about the diets , about which we were told the macronutrient ratios and the fact that food was delivered twice weekly to the participants here was my question to the researchers would you be able to be more specific about the diets themselves ? for example , was the high diet carbohydrate primarily sugar or starch ? were the foods more heavily processed for example , the equivalent of jenny craig meals delivered twice weekly or more whole foods ? were the saturated fats animal fats , trans fats , or coconut or palm oil ? and the initial reply the high diet carbohydrates were a combination of sugars and starches some of the foods were processed , but many were not the saturated fats were primarily animal derived the researcher cc 'd the nutritionist from the study , who very helpfully took time out of her day to send me a sample day 's menu and some more about the methods please see attached for a copy of a sample day from each diet to keep participants as blinded as possible , we deliberately included food items on both diets that seemed healthy unhealthy and the menus low diet breakfast egg white and lowfat cheese on a sprouted wheat english muffin fruit cocktail , canned in juice snack lowfat fruit yogurt whole grain granola lunch grilled low fat mozzarella , tomato , and basil sandwich on sourdough bread beef and barley soup peanut m ms snack whole grain chex with raisins , cashews , and chocolate chips dinner roasted pork tenderloin with roasted apples and onions bulgur wheat with apricots and almonds green beans snack blueberry crisp with lowfat whipped topping high diet breakfast buckwheat pancakes with butter and sugar free syrup milk , snack whole milk mozzarella cheese saltine crackers lunch grilled turkey and cheddar on white bread cream of tomato soup snack honey roasted chex mix dinner beef stroganoff with rice noodles broccoli with butter snack nilla wafers vanilla ice cream okay from a paleo perspective the difference i can see between the two diets neither of which i would eat personally is , indeed , more simple starches and sugars in the high diet and more animal fat in the high diet butter , milk fat , and cream both diets are chock full of grains and what i would consider industrially processed food rather than whole foods i would knock the high diet for the sugar and the refined flour and sugar free syrup i would knock the low diet for the use of fake fats lowfat whipped topping and grains i could see how both could be toxic to our delicate physiology with that in mind , let 's take another look at the biomarker changes and interpretations for the cognitively impaired patients before and after four weeks on the diet the high diet increased insulin resistance and that low diet decreased it the high diet was fat saturated fat and high glycemic carbohydrates , compared to the low diet fat saturated fat , carbohydrate i'm not sure what to make of that finding on the positive side for the low diet , eating more cardboard and less sugar increased insulin sensitivity another interpretation is that lowering the carbs in the high diet increased physiologic insulin resistance , but it certainly was n't a low carb diet by any means in the high diet ldl increased by points in the mci patients , and on the low diet it dropped by points most modern nutritional researchers would call this finding a clear win for the low diet keeping in mind the physiologic findings in dementia and the perspective and insight of stephanie seneff , however , i'm not so sure in dementia , lower lipid levels are found in the spinal fluid compared to non demented controls to me , the jump in ldl which was actually much higher than the jump in the healthy controls could be the mci patients way of trying to make the most of the animal fat and getting desperately needed saturated fat , fat soluble vitamins , coq , and cholesterol into the besieged brain but then , everyone knows i'm a psychiatrist so i must be a lunatic on the low diet , hdl went down by points in the mci patients , and on the high diet it went up by points everyone would have to agree this is a likely win for the high diet i consider hdl a marker for rapid cholesterol and fat turnover , which i would consider good the less old rotten oxidized fats floating around , the better then we get to some more specific biomarkers for dementia and here is where you get to a very confusing picture comparing mci patients to controls some of these markers went down in controls which the researchers considered bad and up in mci patients which the researchers also considered bad their reasoning followed an inflection point model , where people developing dementia have increasing levels of certain biomarkers , to a point where dementia is inevitable , at which point the levels of these biomarkers begin to drop as dementia progresses therefore , an increasing level in a healthy control would be bad bringing you closer to the point of no return and an increasing level in a dementia patient would be good bringing you back closer to the inflection point and closer to health ldl is a good example ldl levels tend to be higher in carriers of apoe the risky genotype for developing alzheimer 's dr bg has done some great posts about e recently , but ldl levels tend to drop before dementia develops i think a higher ldl might be representative of the brain and body doing it 's best to fill the brain with yummy delicious brain fat and nutrients in the conventional sphere , since high ldl is bad , high ldl must be part of the pathologic process destroying the brain probably through inflammation , though i have n't been sold on any reasonable physiologic method by which higher sat fat could cause inflammation lipotoxicity seems to depend on hyperglycemia conventional wisdom has no explanation for why lipids drop prior to the development of dementia , which is why it is considered reasonable to give someone with dementia statins which i think is a bit of lunacy but once again i'm the lunatic here never forget that back to the paper ! apoe levels go down on the high diet and increased on the low diet in mci folks again , this would fit the model that apoe takes cholesterol into the brain , so you have to be more aggressive about scavenging cholesterol on a low fat diet the researchers do n't believe cholesterol goes from the circulation into the brain and link some papers with that view senoff believes differently and links other papers and describes the mechanism by which apoe helps the astrocytes escort ldl from the circulation across the blood brain barrier given that autopsy studies show that cholesterol levels in the csf are similar to those in the circulation , it seems logical that these two systems have ways of communicating and equalizing well we 'll have to let the separate sets of researchers duke it out on that one on the low diet , amyloid levels went up on the high diet , they stayed the same i think this is a win for more fat , but the researchers interpreted that differently as one of those markers related to the inflection point , and they went so far as to explain that for this biomarker , the high diets probably could n't do more damage in an already extant process in the brain , whereas in the controls , where amyloid went up on the high diet , the high diet was clearly damaging f isoprostanes derived from omega fats and a marker of inflammation decreased in the low diet and stayed the same on the high diet in the mci folks the high diet increased f isoprostanes in the controls since a fat diet designed by a nutritionist probably has more omega than a fat diet but who knows , the fat was saturated fat , the diet only sat fat , so maybe it is a wash depends how much mono they ate and there is also all that sugar in the high diet , so i do n't even know how to look at inflammation in these diets so , what does it all mean ? what i see , with my biases and knowledge base , is some evidence showing that increasing fat in the diets of mci patients is probably a good idea , though i can see how both diets could be inflammatory and damaging so i would n't personally pick either the researchers , with their biases and knowledge base , feel that the high diet is a disaster and that this study presents strong preliminary evidence that the low diet is preferable for everyone , mci patients and controls the researchers have phds in nutrition i'm just a clinical psychiatrist with a hobby oh , wait , i'm a professional nutrition writer now too ! i keep forgetting that you decide whom you want to believe
