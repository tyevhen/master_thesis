photo by mangeshonline first off , i apologize for not posting yesterday about goals like i originally planned i was without a computer for most of the night and i ca n't find my book that discusses what i wanted to talk about so in the meantime i will list the book in case anyone is interested in it , and hopefully i will find it soon and post on the topic the book manual is called getting an edge student edition and has a lot of really good stuff on making short and long term goals so i will try to find it in the meantime , i have my friend rachel coming over tonight we are going to make some magnet boards to give to our other friend lindsey for her bridal shower i am nervous about tonight in the fact that i worry we will run out of things to talk about and there could be some awkward silence i forget what its like to not have to work at a friendship i remember having best friends in high school or growing up where i felt completely comfortable around them my walls were down and i was outgoing we had sleepovers where we would tell our secrets and ogle over boys we liked , talk about things we had in common like school , and jam to music in the car singing our hearts out now i feel like its all about keeping the other person entertained do they have enough to eat or drink ? are they having fun ? what should we talk about now ? do i look okay ? am i acting appropriately ? all these worries swirl through my head and sure i still have fun but its limited somehow i do n't feel like we are truly friends yet because its still a performance its like the dating scene all over again ! i ca n't let my guard down , the walls are up and firmly in place so i hope that things go well tonight maybe someday we will reach that kind of friendship that i remember , or maybe i am just being naive how are all of you doing ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like are we talking ourselves into panicking ? my story celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip i hate anxiety and worrying about work performance linkwithin
