when i worked in the software industry , after every release we would sit down and have what we called a post mortem this is where we would talk about everything that went well in the release , everything that needed improvement , and what we would no longer do anymore seems like a good idea i seem to have my own daily post mortem i ca n't avoid it after every phone call , text message , face to face encounter , or facebook post , i find myself reliving everything i said and did i ca n't stop thinking and worrying , i hope that comment did n't offend them or why did i say do that ? that was really stupid do you ever find yourself doing that ? is it more often than you feel is normal ? i seem to do it every day and i am noticing that i am really lacking self confidence to spend so much time worrying about offending others or not coming off as best as i could have its to the point where i feel like everyone must really hate me sigh there are so many layers to anxiety its like an onion you can pull away the daily panic attacks or generalized anxiety and you still have so many underlying issues to deal with will i ever be okay with who i am right now ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like how self esteem feels what have you done today , to make you feel proud ? a quick update and other ramblings focusing on the negative only makes things more ugly linkwithin
