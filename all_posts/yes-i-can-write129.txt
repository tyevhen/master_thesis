there 's something i 've noticed a lot that can make things really difficult for us unschoolers , and that is this unschoolers are always held to a higher standard than those with more traditional educational backgrounds anything bad note the quotation marks is the fault of unschooling if you have trouble getting a job regardless of the state of the economy , social privileges or a lack thereof , or any other important factors , it 's because you unschooled if you 're a naturally introverted person , it 's because you unschooled if you miss a deadline , make a typo , make a small mistake when counting out change , hell , if you happen to be clumsy , it 's probably because you 're an unschooler on the other hand , anything good about your personality , anything impressive that you accomplish , is entirely because of you , and has absolutely nothing to do with unschooling you 're obviously just a motivated intelligent whatever person who would do well no matter what the circumstances in contrast , schooled individuals , when they fail again , the quotation marks are important , it 's because they 're too unmotivated stupid whatever it 's never the fault of schooling and when a schooled individual accomplishes something impressive , it 's because of the wonderful education they received at school , never in spite of school , or because of their own inherent wonderfulness it 's most definitely sad and very frustrating it also puts a lot of pressure on you because whether you like it or not , the minute you admit to being an unschooler everything you do becomes a reflection on all unschoolers i 've felt the zeroing in of attention the second i mention , and then usually explain , unschooling though lately i 've come across some people who are already at least vaguely familiar with the concept yay publicity ! the questions start coming , of course , but along with that , it often feels like you 're being evaluated it 's like they 're examining a foreign specimen , wondering if you 'll prove to be a normal human or not i'm a reasonably social and confident person , at least when it comes to the subject of alternative education and unschooling , so it does n't usually bother me it 's actually kind of fun the challenge of being social and charming , and presenting my case in a calm and logical way by the reactions i tend to get , i think i might even be pretty good at it but when i think of how this would be for many other unschoolers out there , or even think of myself a couple of years ago , i most definitely understand why many people choose not to bring up unschooling at all , and i remember why i 'd never get into the details myself until a couple of years ago when you do something outside of the mainstream definition of normal , people think they have a right to demand an explanation or if they 're interested in possibly doing it themselves , they simply really really hope you 'll explain it to them yet even with the nicest , most well meaning and interested people , it can sometimes feel like a pop quiz or at least , i imagine it can having never faced a real pop quiz of which people speak , my metaphor could be off like i said , to me , it 's fun it 's energizing it 's a new challenge each time , to decide how to present things , which quotes or anecdotes to bring up at this point you may be starting to see why i enjoy public speaking so much toronto unschooling conference but whether you like it or not , there 's always that pressure by being open about being an unschooler , you become , to the individual or group of individuals you 're talking to , the unschooler the one who speaks for and represents all unschoolers that 's a lot of pressure , and , obviously , inaccurate i think that to the great majority of people out there , unschooling is thought of as a method of education and i think i 've referred to it as such myself , at times but that description does n't sound quite right to me it makes me think of all the different curriculums and school reforms , where new methods are implemented , then the results are studied that 's what people often see unschoolers as results of a specific method of education and to me , that 's not what unschooling is as tara wagner said in her recent interview on this blog i do n't think unschooling created me or gave me an ability i think it simply gave me the freedom to create myself and supported my innate abilities whereas schooling or limited mentalities got in my way , unschooling stays out of my way as unschoolers , we 're not results we 're individual people with individual experiences , personalities , passions , and goals i definitely feel unschooling has impacted who i am as a person , but i feel the same way tara does , in that i feel that by unschooling , i had the time and space to become my own person unschooling gave me freedom the rest i did myself or , myself , with the help of the world , my community , and life in general unschooling did n't create the aspects of myself that i'm proud of , and neither did it create my less than stellar qualities my achievements and mistakes are thanks to me and the circumstances i 've found myself in it 's harmful for people to look at someone who unschools , and see only the product of a specific type of education instead , people need to shift the focus away from whatever education someone did , or did not , have , and focus instead on the actual person of course , that 's easier said than done , but as more and more people are recognizing the failings of both so called higher education and the compulsory schooling system itself , i have high hopes that the focus will shift evermore towards a more organic and flexible view of what it means to be educated and successful
