today my therapist and i were marveling over the brevity of my recent dive into depression 's darkness that discussion got me thinking i have you readers to thank for that brevity you guys wrote some very supportive comments after i posted about my worsening mood last week thank you so much feeling alone is a big part of my depression , but your comments reminded me i'm among many thanks again for your support i hope i have half the effect on you as you have on me
