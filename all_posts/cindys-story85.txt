this song by sara groves , you cannot lose my love , gave me hope and comfort as i slowly came up out of the pit and darkness in my life the truth in this song is something that i hold on to and carry with me in the depths of my soul god loves us so much it says in romans new living translation and i am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his god 's love death ca n't , and life ca n't the angels ca n't , and the demons ca n't our fears for today , our worries about tomorrow , and even the powers of hell ca n't keep god 's love away whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean , nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of god that is revealed in christ jesus our lord
