it has been a nutty week and right now i'm cooking steak , and the month old wo n't let me put her down but a few things have caught my attention epilepsy 's big , fat miracle a new york times article about a parent with a kid on a ketogenic diet for epilepsy makes ketogenic diets sound completely bonkers , yet effective i suppose that is the story of my blog the year relationship between cholesterol and dementia from midlife to late life okay , get this in animal and cell culture studies , high cholesterol is associated with amyloid beta deposition yet when one reviews the human studies , the ratio between cholesterol levels and amyloid deposition becomes far more murky declining cholesterol levels as we age is a risk factor also , high dietary cholesterol in rabbits and genetically modified mice leads to greater amyloid pathology relative to controls ! ! ! should i eat the top round steak being simmered in grassfed ghee right now ? should i ? well , high cholesterol in women who had high cholesterol in was not associated with risk of dementia up to years later also , a decrease in cholesterol levels over the follow up period of years was associated with an increased risk of dementia here 's a money quote from the study thus , the unintended decreases in cholesterol levels e g not via medications or cholesterol lowering diet greater than expected due to aging may be more indicative of dementia risk than midlife cholesterol levels and may reflect underlying dementia processes this pattern is observed for other dementia risk factors , such as bmi and blood pressure consequences of the dementia prodrome such as apathy or reduced olfactory function may lead to decreased energy intake , which may also affect blood cholesterol levels or , just maybe , cholesterol levels are a biomarker of some other process , so following just cholesterol levels leads to confusing and contradictory information regarding dementia risk , and absolutely low cholesterol is usually bad news when it comes to the human brain it 's exhausting , really , slaying the remnants of the lipid hypothesis in dear conventional wisdom nutritional information purveyors i know that allowing fat into the diet makes a big juicy steak that much less naughty but you do n't have to be naughty to have fun ! ! you can just enjoy a big juicy steak seriously
