it 's a m i'm sipping vanilla vodka diet coke to both rev me up and calm me down i'm also listening to rjd a strong candidate for future study anthem status to get me in a pounding yet chill rhythm i do n't know if this means i am on or off track the fact that i'm writing this and not the other thing might or might not be a bad sign in my pre blog era , whenever i got stuck writing i would look at pictures of my exes on myspace it was quite depressing so sharing my feelings through blog , though not productive , ca n't be any worse than retroactive stalking
