i did n't wake up with depression this morning i had it last night and used the yes , we have no bananas song whenever i got up to go to the bathroom i woke up about a m but stayed in bed i noticed i was slightly depressed but the real futility and hopelessness never really emerged because i kept thinking , okay , i'm depressed so i can get up and write about it but i kept falling back to sleep and by the time i got up at a m i was so well into planning the morning , thinking about writing my blog , a breakfast appointment with a grandson , chatting with my husband as we made the bed , that any residual depression went away with no exercises i still had a bit of physical symptoms , tight chest , shallow breath but no real pain in the chest area then i opened my email and got the wonderful comment on the post i almost said a couple of things yesterday that i thought sounded kind of pretentious or something so i did n't but now , i do n't know , maybe i 'll mention what i thought first thought was , should i keep analyzing my own depression on my blog is this helpful to anybody ? now , clearly , i got that wonderful comment to let me know it is n't all in vain not wonderful in that somebody else is suffering for which i am truly sorry to hear but wonderful in that it makes such a connection to me , my work , my efforts thank you so much blueyedane i am very grateful i hope you , too , are feeling okay today another thing i thought was that maybe depression is my task on earth for a good reason maybe i'm supposed to get depression still so i can study it and pass on what i learn and maybe , in some way , it is a necessary balance to my ongoingness and without this heavy anchor now and then to stop me in my tracks , i might not head in a true course but this moment i am so completely okay , and so grateful for my life and my husband , and family and friends at home and all of you out there that i never see face to face and yet we have such a heart connection that means so much to me hopefully i 'll be hit by depression in the morning so i can continue my work well , that 's what i just thought and i decided not to edit it out no matter how phony it might sound a b curtiss
