most of my pictures from my blog comes from the flickr website www flickr com i came across an amazing picture of a torso of a woman with the words unapologetically thin on it click here to see the pic i am trying to get the woman who took the picture to let me display it on my blog and i will add it if she does what i loved in addition to the picture itself was her comments to go with it here they are , from hd connely there 's no doubt that weight is a constant topic of conversation in this world these days and in reaction to growing concerns about weight and health , i 've found myself the target of amazingly insensitive and absolutely unasked for commentary about my being thin well here 's my response i 'll say it and i 'll move on am i a product of genetics ? is my weight a symptom of another health issue ? should it matter to you ? does it affect you in any way ? i 've never told anyone they needed to look more like me or for that matter , less like themselves this goes out to those who make comments in my presence about how unattractive thin folks are this goes out to the woman at the grocery store who made a scene when i picked up fat free item to the nurse at my doctor 's office who told me to eat more fried 'taters to everyone who takes it upon themselves to offer helpful advice on an issue that is absolutely none of their business this also goes out to everyone who has tried to conceal their disgust for my weight in concern i can spot the difference between genuine concern and projection of your own issues from a mile away because i 've had more than my share of practice at it i should n't have to defend myself against your insults i admit i 've been deeply hurt by your words , but you will no longer get that kind of power in my life long story short love yourself love your body own your issues be a bit more compassionate and a bit more aware of your own actions wow ! that impressed me i am a very soft spoken , non assertive person that avoids confrontation at all costs i know that i could never be so bold myself , but she nailed it as to how i feel sometimes many times i admit i imagine the judgments but there have been many real ones that got me to where i am today that were not imagined i wish i could be more confident , so unapologetic as she is i love how she respects herself the way she is and says screw everyone who does n't like it ! lol i hope that i can become braver and take a small bit of her attitude with me so these two pictures here are my attempt my bold my unapologetic , i love my skinny body , so there attitude ! you might also like overly sensitive of society 's ignorance but feeling how to gain confidence express yourself creatively ! finding beauty in the storm personal bill of rights linkwithin
