my gratitude list i am grateful for my health , yes even my mental illness and alcoholism after all , both diseases played a role in creating the person i am today , and today i'm pretty okay with who i am i am grateful for my friends even though i tend to be an isolative person , i do have some incredible friends who make me smile , and laugh , and support me no matter what i am grateful for my mom and step dad they also support me no matter what , and i enjoy spending time with both of them i am grateful for the rest of my family despite our dysfunctional moments , they are still my family and i love them i am grateful for my job in these tough times , i have a job i love , and i work with people i really enjoy i am grateful to be a runner i am grateful for the motivation , strength , and ability i possess , as well as the opportunity to compete i am grateful for my dog , puck what else is there to say ? i do n't know what i 'd do without him he completes my family i am grateful for my home especially on days like this colder than cold outside i am lucky to have a warm , comfortable place of my own i am grateful for the ability to care for myself i think those of us who 've temporarily lost this ability are the only ones who 'd even think to add this to a gratitude list i am grateful to be sober without sobriety , i would n't be able to effectively take care of myself , or more likely , i 'd be dead i am grateful for my sponsor , my social worker , my doctor and my psychologist without their expertise , kindness , and care , my life likely would have ended long ago i am grateful for this blog and my readers this space has routinely kept my illness at bay , propped me up when i was down , and opened my life to a world beyond typical boundaries i'm sure i'm forgetting a multitude of things for which i'm grateful this list will likely grow it will change as i change gratitude is a very fluid thing , and i appreciate the ability to feel it today is a great day to reflect i 'll spend the day with close friends , in a warm home , eating delicious food and watching football what could be better than that ? i'm grateful happy thanksgiving , everyone
