at times it seems like i am drowning the fish going on and on about how you need to relive in order to cure and i have already drowned the poor fish in insisting that we need a therapy of feelings , of the right brain and the deeper areas of the limbic system and the brain stem if there is to be a cure so what is the proof ? here we go again on the difference between statistical truths versus clinical ones we tend to over emphasize the statistical because it has mathematics and seems more scientific and it looks objective , whereas the clinical approach just seems too subjective so over the years i have made my subjective findings and await support from the statisticians the reason i know that this is a futile effort is that some of the world s leading neurologists and neuropsychologists have made the case in neurology about the importance of feelings yet conduct at the same time therapies that are at base anti feeling they cannot seem to make the leap from the third line prefrontal neocortex down to the feeling centers in the limbic area and below they seem to have mastered the neurology but cannot become the avatars of the voyage from the right to left brain cannot make the connection from sensations and feelings to the frontal connection for integration cannot finish the trip from the right brain to the left , from the intellect to feelings why ? because the scientists seem locked away from their feelings , giving feelings a small nod before ignoring it they cannot make that leap from right to left because it is at once the longest trip and the most complex , and the shortest and easiest trip to make once there is access to feelings therein lies the rub because there is absolutely no way to gain access to our feelings through the intellectual route alone it is a contradiction in terms what we need to do is eschew the intellect , let it cede to the limbic right brain and access will appear automatically the more we try to use rationalization and intellectual comprehension the worse it becomes and the more in the head we are it is repression that drives some of us into our heads and which keeps us from knowing how important feelings are and it is the lack of repression that allows some of us to feel and to suffer to know that we are suffering and need to change when pain feelings rise to the top is when we comprehend our own reality and no longer have to build an intellectual super structure over it there are numerous findings that seem to support my point penfield , w proc natl academy of scie also the journal of clinical neuroscience , what they found was that when there was electro stimulation of the right hemisphere temporal cortex in human subjects there can be a reliving of the past that this stimulation offers the person access to her feelings the researchers point out that it reflects an involuntary persistent activation of interacting neural networks , and that this allows for experiential consolidation in brief , it gathers up aspects of feeling from various parts of the brain and then allows for consolidation this means integration and resolution , , which is the goal of our therapy this is no more than saying that we need to address the feeling brain as well as the intellect if we are to help patients if we stay in the intellect the patient will only get well in her head and her body will eventually disintegrate literally , from lack of integration so the head thinks all is well while the unconscious is rampaging around trying to make sense of all that inner turmoil because of little communicating between feelings and their comprehension the turmoil will remain there can be no connection and that is the be all and end all of proper therapy
