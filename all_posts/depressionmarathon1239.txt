it 's been one week since puck went under the knife he is doing well he did tear out four of his staples within the first couple days earning him a return trip to the vet and a super size lampshade collar poor guy can barely lift his head now ! but i warned him he is finished with his narcotic pain med , and i am grateful for that ! i think too little pain is a bad thing for my too active dog he is putting about percent of his weight on his leg now , but if he gets excited , he does forget that it hurts not a good thing ! one more week of strict rest we move to the next phase of rehab the following week we are lucky in that there is a new equine and canine rehabilitation facility nearby with underwater treadmills and doggy physical therapists we will check them out when he is cleared to begin rehab being a human 's pt , that should be very interesting for me ! i 've always wanted to train him to run on my treadmill ! it would come in really handy when my depression does n't allow me out of the house ! i 'll take pictures ! speaking of pictures , i am still waiting for the vet clinic to find their digital camera cable as soon as they do , i will post pictures of puck 's surgery for your perusal ! i am so glad i observed it was really interesting , and i know it helped me stay more calm than sitting in the waiting room would have lastly , i want to thank all of you for your ongoing support for those of you who donated , a special thanks to you someone asked that i update the financial progress , so here goes puck 's surgery was right around , i do not know yet what the rehabilitation will cost i received donations totaling dollars thank you all , again ! this has been an incredibly stressful time , and i appreciate everyone 's thoughts , prayers , and encouragement you 're kindness has meant more than i can appropriately express thank you
