the weather round here at the moment has been pretty rainy perfect for what i had planned tonight i managed to score a free double pass to see i give it a year great film ! i was n't sold on it at first but by the end i loved it i went straight from work to the movie , so what you see here is what i wore to work today i love wearing bright colours to cheer up a dreary workplace and i'm so glad i work in a place where i can get away with wearing the kinds of clothes i want to wear i also love the miniature floral pattern on this dress , and how flippy it is perfect for those days when you 're not feeling like having anything constricting your belly ! dress vintage , canberra vintage fair jumper witchery scarf op shop bag vintage shoes acoustic stomach i'm linking up with the pleated poppy for what i wore wednesday
