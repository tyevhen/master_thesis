i have an interview with a director today the director is in new york city , and he 's looking for people to cast in a video about depression success stories can you believe that ? me i have a chance to do exactly what i intend to do when writing this blog , speaking publicly , or running a marathon educate educate educate depression is an illness like no other , but it is an illness , and it is possible to live life fully despite it this is the chance of a lifetime i could n't be more excited ! this opportunity came about because of this blog i received a comment from one of the people working on the project right after i returned from running the boston marathon on monday she had recently discovered my blog and thought i might be the right person for their project i was honored by her comment and anxious to hear about the project , so i called her immediately the more she told me about the video , the more excited i became she was a little disappointed i did n't live in the nyc area , as was i , because i could n't go in for casting , which i think is taking place right now thankfully , she was willing to talk to her director about doing this first step over skype if i make it through the first cut , i 'll have to fly to new york to continue forward with the process like i said , this is a huge opportunity , and i could n't be more excited ! i hope i have what it takes to participate i do n't know what that is , exactly , but i hope i have it i 'd cherish the opportunity
