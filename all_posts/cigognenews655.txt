i have to read in my field every day for hours just to keep up i read a book this morning about false memory syndrome basically it analyzes the brain structures , specifically the hippocampus , which may be damaged causing false memory i simplify these are harvard trained scientists i am suggesting that unless one feels , that is , first feel one s needs and pain from their lack of fulfillment , it is difficult to know profoundly what the truth is and when one relates how scientific this proposition is , it can be unassailable in short , intellectuals must rely on abstractions , statistics and not a wild proposition that comes from observation i believe that intellectuals , and i include some of the great minds of the century that i have treated , generally live in their heads , cut off from feelings yet driven by them their sex life is a shambles because they are often sexless and fuckless they cannot use their head to help become sexual , nor to do their bidding in fact , they use their heads to flee from feeling if they did not they would be wallowing in pain all of the time so they are left brain dominated and cannot see the nuance or subtleties in social intercourse and they cannot see obvious emotional realities trust a man or woman who can make love we see how a president is more dangerous , the less he fucks in psychology it means turning to the intellect for answers to great emotional problems in short , being stuck in the left brain means to depend solely on that brain s indices , relying on what numbers tell them because they cannot trust their emotions so the intelligent person sees reality far better than the intellectual being intellectual is , by and large , a defense , no matter how smart the person is he knows facts and figures but knows very little about the human condition he often cannot make the leap into imagination or possibilities he is stuck listening to the orphaned voice of intellect because he is constantly channeled into the thinking brain , he cannot see beyond his needs and is a victim of philosophies , no matter how dressed up they are in complex notions he will never adopt a feeling therapy when he has no idea what that is
