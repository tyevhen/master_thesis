morning creativity originally uploaded by darkstream i should warn you after all this writing i 've done for my mlhh project , i 've been feeling an itch to blog again , especially after reading a brilliant column by dave barry on his experience getting a colonoscopy i can completely relate with barry 's experience when i was passing a kidney stone in and the doctor told me he wanted to ram robbie the robot 's arm up through my traumatized manhood , i politely said sure thing , doc ! then never called him again i instead passed the stone while my wife passed a child now i can tell you with certainty that passing a stone truly is the closest a man can get to child labor i held her hand the whole time but i digress if i'm going to blog more , however , i might consider a new approach , or an old one for that matter even with my secret to eternal youth posted publicly for the world to see , i have to say i 've been quite serious over here too serious when i consider how much fun i had writing the quiet riot , and how additude magazine is paying me to reprint it in their fall edition , i can see the writing on the wall i need to write jokes for popsicle companies for a living while i'm working on that new life dream , i might try to step up the game over here i 'll start with this photo morning creativity already , i'm laughing morning ? when am i up in the morning ? in this case , morning simply signifies the beginning of my day the sun had been up for a while in fact , it had crossed across the entire sky and into my backyard i'm fairly positive that 's why i woke up in the middle of the day best alarm clock ever by this point i 've spent more time writing an article about how i want to write more in my blog than i 've spent writing on mlhh , which supposedly is taking me away from my blog betcha ca n't guess i have adhd you might also like in which douglas experiences adhd 's up and down sides morning musings and mailbox moments a somewhat ungreat day that was n't really so bad where do you go to find peace from the stress of the world ? linkwithin
