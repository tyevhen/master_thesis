just a brief note to say hello on another beautiful minnesota day ! gorgeous sunny , degrees , cool breeze , blooming trees , singing birds you get the idea makes me happy to be a minnesotan this is why we suffer through the winter here i had a great workout today i drove south of the city to a small town and a bike trail along the river i took a mile bike ride along the trail , uphill most of the way back , and then ran for minutes it was tough , but i felt strong , and i felt really good about completing it i 'll take it a bit easier the next few days , as i think i'm going to run a k race this weekend after my workout , i did one of my favorite things to do i had a homemade burger and fries at the town 's little diner there is nothing better than a diner burger and fries after a tough workout and i love these local places where the regulars do n't even require a menu it was quaint , and the food hit the spot next time i 'll have to invite my foodie , triathlete , friend renee along for the ride , run and bite i'm on my way out the door to a presentation about wwii by a local man who experienced it tonight we 're covering the european theater and next wednesday the pacific i'm a bit of a wwii buff , so i'm really looking forward to this that being said , i must take off now afterward , my mom has promised me apple crisp ! i leave you with this thought fear is never a reason for quitting it is only an excuse norman vincent peale
