i had a lot to learn about publishing , when i was in my twenties as luck would have it , i had some pretty good teachers and i learned plenty my first hard cover book deal came about by accident in , through my friend george c larson who went on to become the editor of smithsonian 's air space magazine , i happened to meet robert b parke , the recently retired publisher of flying magazine parke was looking to sign up authors for a series of aviation books he was editing for doubleday larson put us in touch and we met face to face parke explained that an author of a book on dirigibles had bowed out of the doubleday series he was looking for someone to take over the project and bring it to fruition at first , i thought good god , who the hell wants to read a book about dirigibles ? then parke mentioned the , advance i began to levitate while thinking the matter over , i started to have other ideas my recent maintenance experiences with an airplane i 'd bought from a delta air lines pilot a nine year old cessna had left me with a considerable amount of frustration , but i had also acquired quite a bit of knowledge on things like brake pad replacement , magneto timing , carburetor adjustment , and whatnot i thought surely i ca n't be the only private pilot who needs to know some of this stuff if there 's a market for books about dirigibles , there has to be a market for books about aircraft maintenance i still self publish this book i decided that before i 'd sign up to do a dirigible book , i 'd query doubleday on an aircraft maintenance title to make a long story short , i decided not to go with parke 's offer to become an author in his series of books , because doubleday , as it happened , was only too happy to consider my other idea when a contract arrived by mail from doubleday , promising a , advance on a how to book for aircraft owners interested in doing their own maintenance , i was ecstatic , of course for most first time authors , this would have been the endgame most authors would have signed the doubleday contract right away and started writing not me i reasoned if doubleday 's willing to buy this idea , surely other major publishers who do aviation books will want to consider it too i staged my own book auction for an as yet unwritten book within a month , i had physical contracts in hand from van nostrand , mcgraw hill , and doubleday comparing the contracts was an interesting exercise some promised to leave the copyright in the author 's name one had it in the publisher 's name each contract varied as to the royalty percentage and payout schedule doubleday was offering a flat royalty against all sales the other two publishers paid a certain percentage that grew with each sales step for example , on the first , copies sold , then on the next , , and on subsequent sales payment milestones varied one contract was set up in such a way that the author would get a certain amount just for signing the contract , then another chunk of money when the manuscript was finished , then a third piece when the book went to press in another case , it was half the advance up front , half when the manuscript was finished in one case it was everything up front the number of authors' copies varied one publisher would give you free copies and the right to buy more at off another gave you copies and the right to buy at off and so on i argued for better terms on each contract , figuring if any one publisher got tired of haggling with me , i 'd at least have one or two other contracts to fall back on no one dropped out each publisher sent a followup contract with better terms ! in some cases , a particular term was scratched out in ink and initialed , awaiting my counter initial in other cases , the new terms magically appeared in the fine print of the typset , lithographed contract this was before laser printers i had several aha ! moments where i said to myself look at this , they 've got two printed contracts , with two different sets of terms obviously they send the lowball version out first there are lots of lessons here , one of them being , simply you do n't get what you do n't ask for another being publishers do n't shy away from auctions it 's what they do i eventually went with mcgraw hill , based on a step contract i was sure would have me making more money than with the other two publishers heck , i thought , this thing is going to sell thousands and thousands of copies i 'll hit those steps in no time as it turned out , i would have been better off going with the doubleday contract which had no steps , but it would take me years to figure that out mcgraw hill knew what i did n't , which is that the only step that counts is the first one , because most books do n't make it to the next level over the years , i 'd write more books and make more mistakes in one instance , a publisher allowed a second publisher tab books to bring out another edition of a work i 'd done i 'd signed a contract that allowed this the second publisher had well established mail order and other sales channels , with the result that the book sold much better through the sub publisher than through my original publisher the two publishers got into a dispute over something i ca n't even remember what and tab ended up not paying my original publisher , and i stopped getting royalties on the book the dispute was never resolved and i certainly was n't making the kind of money that would allow me to go to court over a dispute that was n't mine to begin with , so i ended up making nothing , essentially , on the one edition of that particular title that sold well ultimately , i started self publishing my aviation titles , and that 's when the real money showed up when i say self publishing , this was circa , before print on demand i had a newsletter audience to whom i could sell books , and i was doing a lot of speaking at aviation conferences for a while at speaking engagements , i often sold or books , on the spot , making net per book i still keep one title in print , with lulu com if you know anyone who flies small planes , check it out publishing has changed a lot over the years , but some lessons stay the same publishers promote winners they never promote slow selling titles see yesterday 's post most new authors vastly overestimate the number of copies that 'll be sold most titles do not sell well enough to offset the advance you can get badly burned on subsidiary rights but i can also say , based on personal experience if you truly do have a ready market for your book and sales channels you can exploit yourself , you can make money in self publishing and by the way ? if doubleday ever offers you , up front for a yet to be written book ? take it
