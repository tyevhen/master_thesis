my daughter in law posted this on august , my husband is doing a special mission for a few agencies near the border today i came down and got quite an education last night about our open border policy they are building schools faster here than anywhere in the country no one really knows the actual population of these border cities anyone caught is basically welcomed in issued a ticket to return days later in court , plenty of services available until court date which never show for mcallen is dangerous to drive in with , 's of unlicensed drivers who do n't ca n't read the street signs or understand our laws one of the us government border patrol workers became very ill and went into the er with health insurance and the hospital staff said we are so full with non citizens we are not going to be able to help you for a few days , we have no beds available the coyotes are paid to transport illegals through the border they screen out the young beautiful girls as young as and they are sold into escort service rings throughout the country others less beautiful are sold as work slaves we live in a great country , but there must be a better way to get a handle on this screen kick out the criminals , coyotes , drug dealers , and allow only the honest people looking for a better life an opportunity to earn citizenship through legal work service programs teach them our country 's history and culture and work ethics , gain self respect , and be a contributor to society every one of my hispanic friends are the most hard working , honest , family oriented people i know it 's those bad apples running the show with criminal activities that need to be swiftly addressed
