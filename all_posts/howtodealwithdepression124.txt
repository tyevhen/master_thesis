why exercise outperformed medication dr blumenthal and his colleagues described the differences between exercise and medication like this one of the positive psychological benefits of systematic exercise is the development of a sense of personal mastery and positive self regard , which we believe is likely to play some role in the depression reducing effects of exercise in other words , exercise confirms your new identity to yourself it changes the type of person that you believe that you are and proves that you can become better i ve previously said that the self confidence that comes with exercise is one of the biggest benefits of weight training this philosophy directly aligns with our community s focus on identity based habits it does n't matter if you re battling depression , working to lose weight , or trying to create work that matters your identity the type of person that you believe that you are is what dictates how far you ll go in any endeavor when it comes to beating depression over the long term , this is what makes exercise more powerful than medication it s not that medication does n't work it does but exercise does something that medication doesn t it proves a new identity to yourself each time you finish a workout , you reap the benefits of an increased sense of self confidence the cumulative impact of these small wins is enormous in the words of the researchers , patients who only used medication had the following internal thoughts instead of incorporating the belief i was dedicated and worked hard with the exercise program it was n't easy , but i beat this depression , patients might incorporate the belief that i took an antidepressant and got better it seems small , but this subtle shift in empowerment and self confidence is huge it s your identity that carries you to success if you believe that you re the type of person who doesn t miss workouts , then you re going to get in great shape if you believe that you re the type of person who overcomes uncertainty , then you ll succeed when you face a challenge if you believe that you re the type of person who puts others first , then you ll live a life of service but no matter what , it s your identity that carries you to long term success and this is where medication falls short it treats your symptoms , but doesn t rebuild your identity cut your risk of depression by half as the researchers sorted through the data , they discovered that for every minutes of exercise added each week , the rate of depression fell by half in other words , if you re not exercising right now , then adding just hour of walking per week will cut your risk of depression by the same holds true if you re already an exerciser let s say that right now you exercise for hours each week bumping it up to hours will cut your personal risk of depression by half i m sure there is an upper limit to this at some point , but the evidence is clear exercise often and it s more likely that you ll enjoy the rest of your life are there types of exercises that are better for depression ?
