continuing yesterday 's idea about rededicating to principles that we have decided to live by the reason i thought about rededicating myself is that i disappointed myself in my interaction with somebody when the conversation was over i wanted to take back one or two things i had said , and wished i had said something else they not only were n't terribly generous i realized i said things that made me look good i hate that i hate it when i say things that obviously make me look good why do i do that ? i 'll probably still be trying to prove myself when i'm so instead of continuing to beat myself up , i hung out with the idea that well , at least i caught myself after the fact maybe next time i 'll catch myself in the act of trying to look good and pull back would n't it be nice if i were more humble and compassionate but then , even if i achieve more humility , i 'll probably have to let somebody know about it sometimes i really could just kick myself it is really hard to be a good human being there just is n't any way to do it all right there 's always something more to learn oh , well speaking of the phrase oh , well reminds me of something that happened four of five years ago i had the most interesting encounter with a perfect stranger on a hiking trail once a man asked if he could take my picture i said sure and later on , down the path , while i was waiting for my husband he took the longer route and i turned back earlier the same man happened by and he was waiting for his wife we started talking and , you know me , sooner or later we got into a discussion about depression he said his wife had struggled with depression for years , medication did n't work and finally , she stopped all her therapy and medication and every time depression started up , she said to herself , so , what this happened several years ago and sometimes i forget if the phrase was so what or oh well , but it does n't matter the idea is the same the man could n't understand that such a simple thing cured his wife 's depression and he said he was always waiting for the other shoe to drop worrying it would come back when i explained brainswitching to him he was very grateful he said he had no idea why he took my picture i was in my grubby hiking clothes and old black hat an nobody would ever mistake me for a model but something told him to do it and now he knew it was so he could show the picture to his wife and tell her about our conversation is n't that strange ? life surely is a mystery a b curtiss
