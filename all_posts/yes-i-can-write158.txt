i think an easy to digest , and common , opinion about unschooling is that it 's not for everyone , and wo n't work for some kids this is an opinion held by many unschoolers , and that 's quite fine but it 's not my opinion what that opinion says to me , is that some children have the right to choose , the right to live in a way that nurtures freedom , and some ? some do n't i believe that freedom , on both an individual and community level , is a fundamental right for every person and community so deciding that some children deserve to be given as much freedom as possible , yet some do n't , just really does n't sit right with me which leads me to the fact that as far as i'm concerned , unschooling is the best choice for everyone , and should be the default by saying that , what i mean is that everyone should be given the freedom to choose from the start with that freedom of choice , it 's quite fine if some kids or teens decide to go to a school , or to structure their days in a rigid manner , or not the key is choice because i do n't just see unschooling as one option among many , but as something that should be the default , sometimes i worry that people see my opinions as being somehow exclusionary or judgmental to anyone who does n't unschool yet i realize that not everyone is going to agree with me , and that i'm not going to convince everyone i do n't expect all my friends , my facebook friends , all the people i follow on twitter , or all the readers of this blog to share this opinion all i ever attempt to do is share my opinions and experiences in an honest and authentic way to share my truth as best i can and that 's what i'm doing when i say that i believe that everyone deserves freedom , not just a select few individuals deemed worthy or capable of dealing with it ! i believe we all have the innate ability to make our own decisions , and to live consensually , these abilities just need to be nurtured and allowed to grow properly update i expanded on some opinions expressed in this post here , which may help clarify a few things that were brought up in the comments on this post you might also like blame unschooling ! the cons of unschooling the need for schooling misconceptions about unschooling linkwithin
