you know when in our young life terrible things happen , the pain is repressed and stored in the body eventually , the body gives way and shows its damage either in heart disease or inter alia alzheimer 's disease it is logical that the pain and its results end up somewhere and when it ends up in alzheimer 's it 's not a surprise and what is that disease ? it is something the victim carries around and is unaware of he is as unconscious of his disease as he is of his pain and there must a connection between the unconsciousness that binds the two kinds of lack of awareness together repression is the glue that makes the two adhere to each other of course you slip into unconsciousness because you are already unconscious the brain now just helps out a bit it accommodates the whole process so what is it ? alzheimer 's of the heart a disease of the soul , which is already in place since childhood the person becomes ill without understanding that he is ill , and never can or will comprehend his dilemma isn t that true of all neuroses ? it is sometimes just happenstance that it becomes a mental disease and not that of the heart those whose repression was mainly of feelings , who replaced those feelings with thoughts and ideas have the result of sweeping it all into the neocortex where alzheimer 's resides using too much brain power in repression so thoughts and concepts take the place of feelings , but the force of those feelings is still there to drive ideas and that force eventuates in disease what is terribly tragic in all this is the unconscious factor to drop into a disease without knowing it and losing all contact with humanity first , your own , and then , with others alzheimer 's is a simple continuum of losing awareness , losing contact and eventually losing your life you die without once knowing what is happening to you that is just terrible it also depends on many factors but it is often the place of vulnerability of organs and organ systems kidneys , liver , stomach , etc repression means holding down pain , a counter pressure against the rising force of feeling of course the body suffers repression is not a benign force it uses key chemicals in its service such as oxytocin and serotonin to say nothing of adrenaline and cortisol all those chemical changes wreak havoc with the physical system we already have evidence of this is a beginning study of alzheimer 's and very early pain it is a study we shall begin anew soon but , in general , those who lose touch with their feelings can treat others in horrendous ways because they cannot feel the effects of what they are doing so a well known republican can leave his wife who just came down with cancer , without a scintilla of remorse or regret his wants and needs take precedence over all else what matters is what he wants and only that or a husband leaves his wife and refuses to pay alimony she has three kids , no skills , no money and is totally lost he has no remorse that he leaves his children to starve why ? repressed and alienated from feelings he is basically a robot , like an alzheimer 's patient there is no more top level connection to feelings that makes him aware of the effects of what he is doing worse , he can never hold or touch his children because he cannot feel for or with them the beginning of many of the ills of society and why has conventional psychotherapy not changed in one hundred years , except cosmetically ? yep no touch with their feelings , themselves and in their therapy they do not see the effects or results of their therapy because these results are couched in terms of ideas , healthy notions which they think signals change it doesn t
