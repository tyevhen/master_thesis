hi friends ! the august newsletter is about to go out to anyone who has signed up for it and i have a set of free printable greeting cards for personal use in there for download woot woot ! i figured i 'd do a quick tutorial here for anyone who wants to print them subscribe to the newsletter here if you have n't ! firstly , the cards are a size i like to get my colored envelopes for personal use from paper source , but you can get a size envelopes most places online that sell envelopes when you click the image to download the cards , you will get a pdf file that you can open in acrobat reader i have my printer settings adjusted to print to a full x letter size actual size i set this up in page setup and again after i hit print to make sure it 's all the same once it prints out , you simply face the paper in a portrait orientation and cut across the center at the inch mark exactly half of the paper this gives you two distinct cards score the card across the middle i use a special bone folder for this see a video of what i mean if you do n't have one , you can take a ruler to the center of the card and press the edge of the blunt side of a butter knife into the paper along the ruler this scores the paper leaves an indented line along where it folds this indented line makes it easy to fold the card in half and makes the fold nice and crisp without bunching or denting i hope this helps make creating your cards easier ! i hope you enjoy your cards and remember it is illegal to resell these or claim them as your own they are for personal use only do n't make me give you a legal migraine ! thanks ! save
