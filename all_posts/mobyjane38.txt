i had a bout of plantar fasciitis on my left foot about years ago and it took about months to heal i got a pair of tennis shoes that did n't hurt of course i spent hours trying on every shoe in the store but i finally found a pair and i wore them almost exclusively for months then i did the exercise on the stair where you stand on the ball of your foot and slowly lift your heel up and then down as low as possible i did it about ten times a day , ten lifts and lowers each time when i got it again this year on my left foot , i tried the same cure and after months it still did n't abate finally i got an idea instead of doing the up and down foot lifts on the stair for ten times , i decided to do just the left foot for ten times surprise ! i could only do four lifts and lowers so my left arch was weak , i reasoned , that must be the source of the problem so for the next week or two i just did the stair exercise on the left foot about ten times a day until i worked up to ten times the pain disappeared in three weeks a b curtiss
