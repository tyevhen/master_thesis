several years ago i read this scott hamilton quote and thought it was perfect at the time , scott had a brain tumor and cancer he did not let that hold him back , however he eventually beat the cancer and today continues to write books and inspire others through his speaking engagements and philanthropy the dictionary defines disability as a condition that makes it difficult to engage in the activities of daily life if someone has a bad attitude , they are definitely 'no longer able' to engage in normal daily activities attitude plays such an important part in our lives john , a friend and member of the kda board of directors is another one of us living with kennedy 's disease he is also a man that always seems to have a positive perspective on life he just never seems to get down i am often amazed at how he has the ability to handle adversity and , more often than not , put a humorous spin on the situation john also has this attribute that he does not take himself too seriously he is fun to be around and someone who always seems to be there for you if you need him he is definitely not disabled in our family , when someone comes down with a case of attitude we say he she got ugly i never really thought too much about that saying , but it is rather descriptive if someone gets ugly , they shut down and refuse to communicate they often make everyone else around them gun shy not wanting to be on the receiving end of the negativity i have been known to get ugly once or twice in my life when that happens , i am not a happy camper it is a shame that when i do get ugly that i am blinded from seeing what my attitude does to others if i wallow in self defeat and continually feel sorry for myself , what have i accomplished ? have i proven anything other than finding out that i am a person no one wants to spend time with ? am i any better off by continually venting and showing others what a butthead i am ? and , most importantly , does my poor attitude change anything ? what is also interesting is that when i see someone else that i care for with a bad attitude , i want to find out what is wrong and help them through it i want them to open up and tell me what is bothering them hoping that we can talk it out at the time , unfortunately , the person is usually not very receptive because he she finds it easier to just shut down and wallow in the mire the other day i came across something that i wrote twenty five years ago those were the early days when i had something to say , but was not sure how to say it i have no idea what was going on in my life at the time , but this piece seems to fit perfectly with the topic peace it 's been a long time since we walked together is it because i lost my way i keep asking why you deserted me when i need you the most these days we were inseparable friends once and then you went away am i so different now than i was then or are you just waiting for me at the next river bend is this daily hell i go through the penitence i must pay i know this pain would all be forgotten if you would just visit me again today if you were at peace with yourself , it would be difficult to have a bad attitude
