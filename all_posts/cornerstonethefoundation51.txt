while suffering from depression back in the s i was painfully aware that i had become a broken , shattered person , a shadow of who i had been from my diary , th april i once saw a spider that only had four legs , the poor thing had lost the others somehow yet the spider , a creature of instinct , did not even know , it just kept struggling , vaguely aware something was wrong , but not knowing what it was exactly that s how i feel and th may self hate keeps descending upon me like a swarm of angry hornets i look at myself and find nothing but contempt for this pathetic person i have become but i know this is wrong , if i examine myself through the eyes of jesus , i see someone special , i see how much he loves me and cares for me , how much i mean to him and that he understands but knowing these things does not take away these feelings , feelings of self hate , feelings of depression , of despair , and doubts and th may i wish you were here on earth , lord , so i could go to you i would ask you to take compassion on me , and heal my wounded spirit the fact was that jesus was with me , holding my hand and comforting me and one of the greatest sources of comfort was his word in this post i would like to share a particular passage of scripture that brought me great comfort , a prophecy from isaiah about jesus god the father is speaking here is my servant whom i have chosen , the one i love , in whom i delight i will put my spirit on him , and he will proclaim justice to the nations he will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed he will not break , and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out , till he leads justice to victory in his name the nations will put their hope matthew the latter part of this passage spoke volumes to me i could think of no better description of someone suffering from depression than to portray them as a bruised reed or smoldering wick that was exactly how i felt bruised and battered , with my passion and zeal for life virtually extinguished , leaving nothing behind but a smoldering ember it reassured me greatly to know that jesus held me gently in his hands , a bruised reed he would not break but restore to wholeness how wonderful that although there was nothing left of me but a smoldering wick , he would take the time to gently fan that flame back into life and that is exactly what he did jesus healed my bruises and rekindled my life flame , making me whole once again jesus knows how frail we are as a father has compassion on his children , so the lord has compassion on those who fear him for he knows how we are formed , he remembers that we are dust psalm yet even so , he treasures us so much that he gave his own life for us the life i live in the body , i live by faith in the son of god , who loved me and gave himself for me galatians how comforting to know that those who follow him are held safely within his hands , even in the midst of life s trials and storms my sheep listen to my voice i know them , and they follow me i give them eternal life , and they shall never perish no one can snatch them out of my hand john all verses from the niv
