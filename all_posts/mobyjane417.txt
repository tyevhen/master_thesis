dear a b i have a question reading your book , you say that depression is a cycle and that all episodes do n't last anyway but brainswitching can shorten it does this mean that depression does heal itself naturally ? the chemical imbalance does correct itself ? thank you ever so much for your time you 've spent on writing to me i'm so grateful y dear y no the chemical balance does not correct itself permanently the reason depression is cyclical , and episodes end and start up again , is that the brain works by learned association even if the brain is on a dedicated neural track of depression , some maverick learned association could temporarily interrupt the track and the brain could get going in another direction away from depression remember , the brain always follows the direction of its most current dominant thought interruption of the depressive cycle can happen naturally and accidentally due to learned association , but it could take a long time brainswitch interrupts the depressive pattern on purpose rather than accidentally a b curtiss
