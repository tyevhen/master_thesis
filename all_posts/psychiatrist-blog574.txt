over on shrink rap news , a post will be going up about my random thoughts about adult children who essentially divorce their parents in the families i'm talking about and i know many , these are n't extreme situations the children did not suffer from abuse , neglect , or deprivation at the hands of their parents when they were children , the parents tried to be attentive , caring , and to provide for them as best as they could which was sometimes rather well the parents likely made mistakes , because parents are not perfect , but the issues are current ones and often ones the parents themselves ca n't articulate in these cases , the adult children have severed ties even though the relationship was close , and they themselves might say they had good childhoods why the estrangement ? i suppose it 's different in each case , and often there are issues with parental divorce , the relationship with the child 's spouse , a sense that the parent is too critical , too judgmental , or perhaps too intrusive and controlling the adult children may feel they are being used or manipulated i talk about some of my theories , and they may well all be wrong none of it science , just what i 've gathered from listening if you 'd like to read my thoughts , i invite you to surf over to cpn 's shrink rap news and , of course , i 'd like to hear your story you can check over there sometime around noon if you 're interested , i 'll also direct you to a website run by someone dear to me motherrr ! about rebuilding mother daughter relationships while my post talks about estrangement from the vantage point of the parents , this site looks as mother daughter difficulties from the perspective of the adult child
