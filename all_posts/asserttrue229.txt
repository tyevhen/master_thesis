a little perspective can be a good thing , so the next time you feel a need to have your mind blown , just watch this short video and you 're sure to come away with a perspective reset some additional perspective on a clear night , using only your naked eye , you can see about , stars , and the furthest of them is around , light years away , but most are much closer the most distant object visible barely ! with the naked eye is the andromeda galaxy , million light years distant everything else you see at night is only a few thousand light years away if you were to travel from the milky way to andromeda , it 's possible that most of your trip would occur in total blackness you would almost certainly traverse areas of space where no stars are visible to the naked eye because of sheer distance you 'd look out the space ship 's window and see nothing at all unless you used a telescope more perspective if you were to shrink the solar system down to where the earth is a foot away from the sun , the nearest star would be miles away but if you were to shrink the milky way galaxy down to a foot in diameter , the nearest galaxy is only feet away i know hard to imagine sci fi authors take note !
