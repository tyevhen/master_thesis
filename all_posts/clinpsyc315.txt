zyprexa weighs in pun intended i posted recently about the science of treating bipolar disorder in kids here 's an example of what passes for evidence in the child bipolar treatment world an open label i e , not placebo controlled study indicated that olanzapine zyprexa was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in youths with bipolar disorder by definition , it s pretty tough to show that your treatment works in the absence of a control group see research methods , so how can it be said that the treatment was efficacious ? and as for being well tolerated , keep in mind that the average participant gained five kilograms in eight weeks that s not so healthy if this is what passes for solid evidence , then i suppose bipolar in kids as young as two years old is widely underdiagnosed , and that zyprexa is a godsend for these poor undertreated children
