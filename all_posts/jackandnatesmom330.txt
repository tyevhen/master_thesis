i had a very insightful conversation last night i spoke with one of john and my family members , who also has experience with having children with autism i wo n't go into more detail than that as i do not know if this person is comfortable with it , but needless to say , she also has multiple sons on the spectrum they are older than our kids and she was fighting this battle with half the resources i have , and did amazing things for those kids i have had her phone number for months , but for some reason i felt very hesitant to call i am so glad that i did family commonalities in health conditions , in manifestations it is mind boggling to me and such a huge wealth of information i now have several new avenues to explore for the boys i am not saying that it is a guarantee that these will also be issues for my kids , but they are definitely areas that i should address , as this is the closest link we have had thus far so i will be looking for a gastroenterologist in this area , and i will be asking them to test for certain enzymes , and to look at the yeast bacteria balance in the gut more carefully asking them to take a closer look at nate 's immune system and hormone levels say a prayer for us that some of these things pan out thanks
