spring break is here hip hip hooray ! finally , i have a little free time to write my first post for the month of april yes , i have been slacking however , i now have an opportunity to sit leisurely on my bed and write this post while listening to i heart radio whitesnake channel , of course today it hit me that summer will be here and i have to think about my professional development plans often , i believe that professional development for school counselors is an afterthought for the majority of school districts if you ever have been forced to sit in a session on how to use the grading program for teachers , you know what i am talking about also , professional development costs money which many principals are not willing to fork out to their school counselors either bummer so , what is a school counselor to do ? well , it is imperative that we make professional development plans ahead of time as part of our yearly goals list the needs we are wanting to meet professionally for the year communicate our goals to our supervisors and make maybe even make some financial sacrifices ouch so , what are some options for professional development over the summer ? well , there are many different types from which a school counselor can choose however , i want to focus on the mother of all professional development opportunities , the summer conference i know , i know many of you lack the money to attend a conference and i totally get that more than you know so here is where my experience of working in six different districts under different principals may be helpful ways to attend a conference when you lack funds here is a list of ideas that i have generated from my own experience when i lacked supportive leaders it is imperative that you show a need to your school leader of why you must attend this conference play the radio station for your principal wfim what 's in it for me ! make sure you are targeting a need that is on your principal 's radar this could include student discipline , test scores , at risk students , etc make friends or at least , connections , in the district office there may be monies available from grants or specific conferences that other departments may sponsor for instance , our career technical agricultural education department is sponsoring school counselors to attend our state 's ctae conference this year sweet ! write a grant yes , i hear the moans from the readers out there however , this is a great way to find funds to support your professional growth when it is based on fulfilling a specific need or objective fund raising may be an option some districts may frown on this , but if your district is supportive you may have a source to sponsor you and your colleagues ability to attend a conference that you may have not considered get support from your pta sometimes your school 's pta may be on fire about a topic and you can volunteer to bring back information if you can get the funding to attend a conference look for local businesses to sponsor your professional development this can include insurance agencies , law offices , local business partners , etc sacrifice yikes cut out the daily coffee trips to starbucks or dunkin donuts , reduce the number of nights you are eating out , cut out some extra amenities i e snacks and save that money in a special account you will be surprised how much change you can actually save in a year i have saved over in change last year ! , look for evidence of why this conference is important to you professionally asca has created a justification letter that school counselors can download to share with their direct supervisors plan ahead for conferences you really want to attend and give your principal a road map of what you would like to accomplish by attending these conferences this can be done effectively when you meet with your principal to sign your yearly agreement for those of you not there quite yet like me most of my career , put this as part of your professional development goal that you would like to accomplish if you have a burning desire to attend the asca conference in los angeles like me , consider applying for the school counselor community scholarship hosted by jeff ream , the counseling geek now , it is time to consider what conferences you would like to attend now or in the future below i have posted a list of conferences that appeal to school counselors i hope you find one that you like or feel free to suggest one that i may have missed conferences for school counselors save the date !
