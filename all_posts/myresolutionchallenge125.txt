have you ever been on a diet ? you feel determined and inspired for that first week or two , and maybe even a little motivated by the initial lb weight loss , but just one small thing can undo all that hard work and you end up heavier than you were before you started confidence is a lot like dieting it is a delicate balance to maintain that confident persona and one small thing can tip the scales i was an incredibly confident young girl , always eager to volunteer , loudest in my class and life and soul of the party i seemed to have an endless supply of confidence and energy this was stripped away from me over time by a very clever individual my ex husband did n't go all rambo on me and break my spirit in one go , he took his time and gradually chipped away at my confidence and self esteem until there was nothing left of the old me he would use a snide comment , a derogatory remark , or pure manipulation , to ensure that i gave up my friends , distanced myself from my family and left my career i became a shell of who i had once been my children kept me going and i filled my days keeping them safe and dreaming of an escape i now understand that regaining confidence is possible with a little time and preparation i finally walked away from that abusive marriage , unfortunately it was only after it became violent , but the lessons i learned have shaped who i am today my confidence is back , i have a renewed spring in my step and through my holistic health business , i work hard to help other women find their confidence too when i began the long journey to become a more confident person once again , i followed these top tips i learned to approve of myself this was a tough thing to do after being told for seven years how stupid , useless and pathetic i was i had to stop listening to the external criticisms as well as my own inner voice that had begun to believe the lies i began to tell myself every day , how strong and brave i was i had to believe in myself i was suddenly on my own with three small children under the age of i had to trust that i could take control of my life i love the film , the holiday starring kate winslet , my favourite line is when the elderly neighbour tells kate 's character to 'stop being a supporting actress in her life and become the leading lady' this resonated with me so much and i try to act on those words every day jot it down my regular blog readers will know how much i love journals i have one for every possible reason dreams , gratitude , ideas and inspirations when i started writing down something positive about myself every evening , i began to believe that these values were true become your own bff over time i made new friends , some of who are still a huge part of my life today i would do anything for them and if they were lacking in confidence i would n't hesitate to support them it took me a while to realise that i deserved the same respect alone and lonely are n't the same when i was trapped in my abusive marriage i was lonely and frightened my lack of confidence fed on my fear of being alone and this was probably one of the reasons i stuck it out for as long as i did only years later did i realise that being alone was n't a negative thing some people jump from relationship to relationship because of that fear , but if they spent some quality time with themselves , they would reconnect with who they are and what they want in life my biggest life lessons came to me when i was on my own only then could i hear my true inner voice and recognise my path i still have occasional moments where my confidence wobbles , but i now have the tools to help myself recover and move on i hope you found some inspiration in today 's post confidence is n't always about the big stuff in life , it can be the smaller tasks that tip the balance meeting new people , speaking in public , starting a new job school , selling yourself in an interview if you take a deep breath and follow at least one of the tips above , it should help you to be more confident they worked for me ! i would love to hear your top tips for being more confident , what has worked for you ? photographs courtesy of www freedigitalphotos net and www louisehay com
