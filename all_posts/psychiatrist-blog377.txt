i do n't think of myself as a workaholic , but there are moments in time where i find that my brain gets really stuck on work maybe there 's a patient i'm worried about , or i'm working on an article that requires some searching , or is about something i'm passionate about ideas for blog posts run through my head , or every conversation somehow turns to cpt codes yes , yes , this is my fault , clink poor clink has heard so much about cpt codes or the latest issue of the moment or i get annoyed that the world makes no sense i find that i stress myself out with things i really do n't need to be stressed about , and then i really start to long for vacation when i get in these states , i feel like the unfortunate thing about going on vacation is that i really need a vacation from myself ! the good thing is that when i get away from work , the phone , the internet , the office , the house , the iphone , the computer , after a few days , i start to relax and eventually to recharge there 's something about our all too connected world that is n't always good for me , and i have this love hate relationship with technology okay , so today was my first day of vacation i baked cookies , watched tv , cooked a gourmet meal , saw my family i tried moving the laptop to another floor so i would n't be attached to it , but within an hour or two , it made it 's way back downstairs i did n't leave the house , did n't do any work , have my voicemail set to send callers to a covering doctor ah , but here it is , saturday night , and what am i doing ? yup blogging so what do you do to unwind ? do you have trouble disconnecting ?
