this is a little thing i live by whether its right or wrong do n't get me wrong , i can sympathize , empathize , show compassion , and feel bad for someone if they are in a crappy situation i am not a heart of stone however , if after a certain amount of time of hearing the same complaints over and over and knowing the person has done nothing to change their predicament i lose the sympathy and just get tired of listening i have been known to tell people after years of the same problem that unless they do something about it , i don t want to hear about it anymore sometimes i have to take a look at myself and see if i am doing the same thing to others i have been struggling with work lately and have even written a couple blog posts on it , because it really has been crappy and has been affecting my moods a couple of you told me that maybe i should be looking for a change that hit home to me , because really i wasn t doing anything to improve the situation yet sulking and complaining was the natural release so i am pleased to announce that i did take steps to improve my work situation at first i struggled because i didn t think i had very many options being pregnant and all but i posted my resume on monster and was surprised of the response i got i still didn t think i would be a great candidate when they learned of my pregnancy so i didn t pursue any of those too much plus the stress of starting a new job at a new company doesn t sound like fun but to know i had options really improved my self esteem and quieted some doubts luckily a position opened up at my work in a different department and although it will be a significant pay cut since it s not a managerial position , it will allow me to work part time and at home after the baby is born at an hourly wage that is very good ! i couldn t be more excited or feel more blessed not only will i not have the stressors of management meetings , confrontations , hiring , firings , dealing with senior management , etc but i will be able to have the ideal setup and i won t be working for my boss which has been the hardest thing it s not completely official but it looks like it will be happening very soon thanks to everyone for your advice i really do listen , promise and now hopefully my complaints will go down as well which is better for everyone moral of the story are you one of those people that when encountering a problem , take action to change your plight or do you thrive on the sympathy and attention you get from others , maybe from your anxiety or panic attacks ? that might sound like a silly question but it happens we may not even realize it , but deep down we may be benefiting from having anxiety and don t really want to give up that benefit the question is what are we gaining ? is it really worth it ? do you thrive on the attention for example ? maybe your spouse picks up the slack in other areas of life that you don t want to deal with such as housework , taking care of the kids , and the finances there are so many possibilities it s interesting to think about , and to weigh whether the subtle benefits are worth the crippling effect of anxiety if you decide to give them up , then change is the next step change can be a career change like me for example , a break in a relationship , a trip to the doctor , to the bookstore , out of your front door it could be going out with a friend , taking a chance on a new relationship , etc so what kind of person are you ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like celebrate what to do when feeling overwhelmed if it 's your birthday , you can be more prone to panic my story linkwithin
