dear a b , i ended up taking a sick leave from work days ago i had a bad breakdown and just could no longer push myself i stayed in bed for about a week slept almost continuously and felt just a relief that i did n't need to push myself in that way any longer i know i have to be proactive so i decided to go to a depression treatment center that doesn t rely on medication for a month from wed i wo n't have any outside contact for the whole month at this stage , i need some ouside help to give structure to figure out what to do when i come out , with the support of family and friends , i think and hope it 's the best option for me now surprisingly , i do n't feel as depressed and anxious now that the work pressure is gone but i know life must go on , and i need to construct my proper life on my own , and of course i 'll never give up no matter what y dear y i will be thinking about you you sound thoroughly committed to helping yourself and that is a great start if you read my blog you might remember that someone sent me an exercise that he uses to get out of depression he puts depression in a box , and he thinks outside the box it s excellent for getting in touch with your self and differentiating your self from your depression i ve been using it myself it s very interesting once you put depression in a box then you can think outside the box and decide what to do about the depression mainly it gives you a more graphic picture that you are not your depression i recommend you try it last time i used it i had all sorts of ideas what i was going to do with depression now that it was captured inside the box just imaging all the things i could do with it caused it to completely disappear into the objective thinking of the neocortex all the neural activity just powered down in the subcortex funny thing , but the box i put depression is in always the same it s an oblong , unpainted , rather shallow metal box kind of like a safety deposit box but a little bigger i wish you godspeed a b curtiss
