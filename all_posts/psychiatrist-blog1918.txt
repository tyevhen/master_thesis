posted by dinah i interrupt this cup of coffee to bring you yet another blog post inspired by an article in this sunday 's new york times magazine this weeks inspirational piece is from the funny pages and is called celebrity crazy by shalom auslander first , let me tell you that this piece won out for the moment , anyway over the magazine story about the severely anorexic teenager , and the times' ongoing series on diagnostic treatment issues in severely mentally ill children something lighter , i suppose , in honor of the holiday weekend so the author seeks psychiatric treatment to deal with his anger issues he is a reluctant patient and starts his narrative with i'm not doing the couch thing , i said you do n't have to do the couch thing , he said good because i'm not that 's fine should i do the couch thing ? the author 's therapy was going well , he reports , until the doctor referenced unnamed celebrity clients as examples of patients with similar issues mr aushlander liked this cool , i thought , i'm as crazy as a rock star unfortunately , he began to see his relationship with his doctor in the shadow of this information if there was n't an available appointment on the day he wanted , well clearly he was n't a colorful enough psychotherapy patient his therapist was holding those hours for celebrities whom he assume had more exciting issues , perhaps even heroin fueled sex orgies rather than deal with his transferential feelings of neglect you 'll forgive me here for making an interpretation on a patient i 've never examined , i admit this may be a leap , the patient on the page decides to embellish his own life , to make it as interesting as one lived by the stars when that does n't gain the desired response from the therapist , the patient quietly decides to leave therapy so he 's walking out the door when the shrink invites him to a family picnic in the hamptons dinah the reader cringes , but okay , go on big party , busloads of people photos of the shrink on the wall with the celebrities poor mr aushlander but the shrink hugs him and takes him aside , asking that he be the first to read the book manuscript dr shrink has written about one of the celebrities ah , mr aushlander is special after all ! ! oh , until he sees that the celebrity , not him , is thanked at the end oh well an amusing tongue in cheek tale , but who does n't want to feel at least a little bit special to their therapist ?
