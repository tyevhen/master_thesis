we 're going to the county fair today to see the lippizzaner stallions perform kathleen is a great horse fancier you saw my carnival poem below a poem by kathleen about a county fair back in new york county fair this is no country for old men nor for an old woman with dusty feet slumped in the illusory shade of the beer tent only the young move harmless through this blaring heat , a tawdry hell of lights and screams lowing of dumb animals stench of dung and frying dough survivor in my own bleak afterlife , i rub my head and think of brittle vertebrae and shearing steel , then see you looming through the haze , giant with a gentle face , come to lift my heart above the summer twilight that i might feast among the stars and have you lick them from my tongue kathleen m chaffin since kathleen became disenchanted with the litternet she does n't write anymore and who can blame her ? i can because it 's a terrible waste of talent , so any so inclined should write her at klmchaffin yahoo com to encourage her to compose before she decomposes she could write about her new slave job at safeway all the politics of white trash trying to emulate the cookie cutter corporate vision i think one of the first if not the first poem i published on the internet was about being a dishwasher , another slave job you want to see it ? hell , it 's poetry thursday , why not ? ! that dishwasher smell i opened my dishwasher and smelled the sterile sweet smell of superheated detergent and plastic made aromatic by high temperatures that makes me hand rinse my glasses before i drink and takes me back to washing dishes at a mexican restaurant for an hour , where i scraped burned beans three inches thick from the bottom of huge , two handled pots the beans , red skinned , white pulped , smelled like wet cardboard and burnt toast when i dipped my hands in their pebbly mush like the bowl of guts you feel on halloween when i moved up to sprayer i had to sort bus trays that reeked of blue cheese and cigarette butts and whiskey and wet napkins , grease and maraschino cherries almost as bad as the dishwasher smell i teased their garbage out before i doused the dishes with my high pressure nozzle , then stacked them in the rack that slid into the huge stainless box where they were purified by the smell of superheated detergent and hot rubber again after the last dish dried i 'd mop the dregs down the sloping concrete floor to the central drain where lettuce scraps , fish bones , white grease and hairs collected , then i 'd scoop it out by hand and replace the grate for all the garbage i handled , it was the dishwasher smell i could never get out of my hands , ground in like rodeo dirt published in real poetik kilorats and holding , thine in truth and art , ce
