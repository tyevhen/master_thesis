today 's post is reblogged with permission from author zone com do you have a web site ? do you care about google search ranking ? do you tag blog posts with keywords ? practice safe seo ? well , everything you know is about to change but first a bit of backstory not long ago , google announced the official end of its authorship markup program best known as the scheme that allowed people to appear with their g picture off to the left in a highly structured rich snippet search result google talked about the death of the program here the even bigger news , though already well known to hard core seo geeks but still making its way out to the hinterlands , is that google will increasingly rely on semantic hints in html markup hints that you need to be sure are there when indexing web pages the hints can be rdfa , or microformat based , or microdata based using the schema org schema the latter is recommended according to google , failure to use any of these hinting schemes will not adversely affect page rank , nor will using them affect rank but let 's be honest here it 's pretty clear that your pages are unlikely as hell to show up in cosmetically pleasing rich snippet format , on any google page , if you 've neglected to use microdata in your markup it does n't take a rocket surgeon to understand that eventually , if your site is n't using microdata and everyone else 's is , you 're going to be at a disadvantage in certain situations extrapolate that however you wish what do you have to do to get microdata into your content ? basically stand on your goddam head and count backward to infinity no rich text html editor i know of has built in support for microdata and yet , this support is clearly needed in all rich text editors , going forward who 'll get there first ? i have no idea it 's wide open i expect the tooling situation will change , quickly but in the meantime , you have only a couple of options for making your site 's pages microdata savvy read super google bing friendly the first option is really a workaround , not a solution and that 's to head over to google webmaster tools , where you can manually train google to know where the key itemtypes and itemprops are or should be located on your site 's pages once you 've registered your site with gwt , flip open the search appearance item in the command tree on the left edge of the page , then start clicking around that 's good enough as a right this minute workaround , but it obviously does n't leave your site with different markup than it had before and that 's where option no the stand on your head option comes into play insert microdata yourself by hand mind you , this is not something a human being should have to do without proper tooling , and frankly , until tooling arrives i think you 'd be crazy to invest a lot of time in marking up your stuff by hand but to give you a quick visual idea of what kind of markup i'm talking about , here 's what needs to happen to , say , a blog post first , the entire post needs to be wrapped in an article tag with microdata inside it , like so article itemscope itemtype http schema org article id post class post post type post status publish format standard hentry category uncategorized tag font tag legibility tag readability tag reading comprehension tag serif tag typeface ! content goes here article i 've highlighted microdata in peach so you can get a taste of the deliciousness blech ! the headline for your peach piece needs to be wrapped something like this h class entry title a href http author zone com serif readability myth title permalink to the serif readability myth rel bookmark span itemprop name the serif readability myth span a h if you 've got a byline , it needs to look something like span class date time a href http author zone com serif readability myth title am rel bookmark time itemprop datepublished content class entry date datetime t august , time a span span class author vcard a class url fn n href http author zone com author kasmanethomas title view all posts by kas thomas rel author span itemprop author itemscope itemtype http schema org person span itemprop name kas thomas span span and the content itself should begin with span itemprop articlebody p i ve been involved in publishing all my life , and like many others i ve always accepted as axiomatic the notion that typefaces with serifs such as times roman are , in general , are more readable than do n't use curly quotes those are a wordpress artifact so as you can see , this stuff is butt fugly , not at all intuitive unless you 're a taxonomy geek , and clearly not something an unaided human being should be doing by hand it 's a situation that very obviously calls for better tools , and right now we have crickets chirping wordpress developers ? html rich text tooling geeks ? open source community ? content management vendors ? we need your help this situation calls for immediate action lots of people could use lots of great tools please help us out i ca n't stand on my head and count backward much longer want great tips , news , and resource links in your inbox ?
