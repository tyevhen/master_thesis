my concern is about the number of people and seniors who are over medicated , which can lead to severe depression or even suicidal thoughts always check with your pharmacist to see if your medications are compatable i am aware of a senior who was put on three antidepressants and a sleep medication she attempted suicide because of the bad interactions of these four drugs prescribed by her family doctor a psychiatrist was able to help her get on the right medications i prefer clients see a psychiatrist for antidepressants because they know how medications interact with each other if you are depressed and not on medication , check out some of the natural remedies in dr balch 's book , nutritional healing fish oil is essential to help overcome postpartum and regular depression the more alkaline your diet , the less depressed you will be check out other blogs here on defeating depression , fish oil , twenty tips for beating the blues , and other blogs on depression also check out the book on amazon , defeating depression beating the blues when i have been depressed , l tyrosine , fish oil , b vitamins , and calcium and magnesium have been very helpful it has been twenty years since i have taken an anti depressant and even then i had a very bad reaction to the drug
