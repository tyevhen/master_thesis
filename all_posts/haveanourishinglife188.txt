broken , a poem i am not stick thin , life is not worth living i am broken within and finished with giving what i think in my head cannot be true things left unsaid are left to brew our mentors have failed we have nowhere to turn onward we ve sailed with beliefs to burn what hope have we for acceptance and love , when all we see is killing the dove ? i want to save you it starts with me i know what to do bring all to the tree nothing to comprehend apart from the cross suffering to lend is a terrible loss try again , he will say we have nothing to fear try again , he will say i am here , i am here
