it 's been a long time since i 've reflected and had a proper catch up with you all , so i thought i 'd include you all in this roller coaster of a few months i passed my theory test and only have a week to go until my practical driving test i 'll let you know how it goes ! i had to retake my theory because it ran out after two years fortunately with enough preparation , i passed it first time again i feel i have gotten to the stage with my anxiety where i can tackle my driving this is something which would have given me major panic attacks before , but this is no longer the case hallelujah ! i passed the first year of my law degree with a across all of my modules i am about to embark into my second year in a new house and living with some amazing people i met during my freshers here 's hoping i can keep my grades up ! this year i chose my optional modules to be medical and family law i currently work in my local charity shop whilst i am home from university as a volunteer this was a big step for me to take as having a job is at the top of my anxiety hierarchy as the thing that triggers my anxiety the most however , on the first day of the job i had next to no anxiety my step for next summer is to get a paid job ! i did a week 's work experience in a law firm called bond dickinson , which proved to be very beneficial and took me out of my comfort zone even further for those of you who followed my sponsored cycle to germany , know that i had to undertake one of the biggest challenges of my anxiety journey which was to find myself across germany and get on a plane back to england , completely alone i have no idea how i managed it , but i did very proud ! i am coming up to a one year anniversary , which again is something i 'd never think would be possible with all of my anxiety issues , but yet here i am ! i have been very lucky to meet a person who has helped me through every step of my recovery and has been understanding and caring too and mum , i have n't forgotten about you either of course ! apart from my depression being an issue for the first month of the holidays , i am slowly getting back on track and tackling my anxiety as each day goes by i have still had days where i have been very anxious and days when depression has been a cloud over my head , but i am getting there it 's hard to think that i was once a girl , aged seventeen who could n't leave her house and walk to the shops now , i am a girl at age nineteen who is living alone , travelling alone , learning to drive and working i never thought i 'd see the day and i am extremely proud i have come to far and i never thought it would be possible , so thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way you will never be forgotten and your help and support has been the best gift i could ever asked for if anything can give you hope , it 's your strength from within and the knowledge that others have made it through i hope i get there soon enough ! you can do it i have no doubt , amy xx
