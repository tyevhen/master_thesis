an open letter to mental health organizations i am writing regarding the use of the term consumer when referring to a person with mental illness as a person who has battled depression for years , i find this term baffling and offensive i ask you to discontinue using it when referring to people with mental illness i am not a consumer according to merriam webster a consumer is a a person who buys goods and services , or b an organism requiring complex organic compounds for food which it obtains by preying on other organisms or by eating particles of organic matter how does a person with mental illness fit into either of those definitions ? why are we hijacking a term typically used for wal mart shoppers to label people with mental illness ? when did patient become a four letter word ? why is referring to me as a person with mental illness pejorative ? i am not a consumer i am a person with mental illness my mental illness is a biological , treatable brain disease it is no different than a biological , treatable pancreatic disease like diabetes , or a biological , treatable heart disease like congestive heart failure yet while it is acceptable to refer to a diabetic as a person with diabetes , and it is normal to refer to a person with heart disease as a patient , it is somehow unacceptable to refer to me , a person with depression , as a person with mental illness or as a patient ? that doesn t make any sense consumer , used in an attempt to destigmatize mental illness , actually increases the stigma by separating persons with mental illness from those with any other type of biological , treatable illness it highlights difference i am not different when i am hospitalized , i am not there to choose between a green gown and a blue gown i am there because my symptoms have gotten worse , and i need specialized medical care to manage my illness this is true whether i have appendicitis , diabetes , or depression each is an illness that may lead to death if i do not allow myself to be treated , to be a patient i ask you again to discontinue using the term consumer it is inaccurate , stigmatizing and offensive concocting a term to classify people with depression , schizophrenia , or bipolar disorder rather than speaking directly about mental illness only furthers the stigma we already face
