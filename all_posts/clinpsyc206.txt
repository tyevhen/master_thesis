pfizer is proudly touting a new observational study which found that patients who switched from lipitor to a generic medication had an increased risk of heart problems fantastic avoid the generic and use lipitor oh , but wait , as peter rost points out there is only one teeny weeny problem the most common reason for switching drugs is because the therapy does n't work when the drugs do n't have the desired effect so it is completely expected that patients who were forced to switch had a worse outcome they may simply be treatment resistant and pfizer knows this that 's the reason they use a weasel sentence in their press release , hidden deep inside the text , saying as with all observational studies , the findings should be regarded as hypothesis generating but that has not stopped the so called health media from running with the story from the lipitor saves , generics kill angle see several sources on rost 's site here 's more fuel for the fire the bottom line on this particular study is that the data tell us such switching may not be without consequences , said michael berelowitz , senior vice president of pfizer 's global medical division , in a phone interview with all due respect , mr berelowitz , it would appear that you are either ignorant on this point or you are lying an analogy in the mental health field would be if patients who tried effexor and then switched to a generic tricyclic antidepressant say , imipramine were found to have worse depression outcomes than patients who stayed on effexor duh ! again , maybe people who dropped effexor are treatment resistant and or had more severe depression medications do n't work as well for them so it would be a pretty stupid comparison to say that those who switched antidepressants were acting dangerously by switching medications , would n't it ?
