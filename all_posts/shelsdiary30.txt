i'm sure i 've mentioned before that i have horrendously high expectations i expect far too much from friendships , relationships , my career and whilst attempting not to sound too dramatic life when i was younger i imagined myself as an adult with an incredible job , loads of friends and a fantastic dating boy life i guess i just imagined things would be all rosy where does all this come from ? who knows recently i 've seen lots of comedy facebook status' and pins on pinterest blaming disney for women 's high expectations when it comes to things like boys and of course , hair i guess they could be held a little responsible and if disney are a little at fault i guess so are chick lit writers , rom com directors and patrick swayze it 's not just me who expects a boy to fall madly in love with me , climb up a fire escape with a bunch of red roses and snog my face off whilst a classic 's tune plays in the background , loads of other girls want that too why do you think we keep reading those shitty novels where we all know the ending and keep watching those shitty films that make us cry we want our happy ending at , i now feel in a place where i need to manage my ridiculously high expectations of men , before they are all discarded to the he 's lush but he just ca n't dance the mirange scrap heap after spending years of my early twenties with a guy who i felt at the time made no effort , i thought i deserved much more i thought i deserved the perfect guy who met all my expectations i was not going to settle for less two and half years on , i am still single firstly i do n't actually think there is a guy out there who checks everything off my list teeth , triangle , brains , height , funny , kardashian lover , wine drinker the list goes on , obviously it 's near on impossible to find this guy secondly , say just for one second he is out there , do i even deserve this guy ? ! perhaps i am not good enough for this near on perfect guy , maybe i'm awful so perhaps i should start to think about which expectations i can let go off or at least be lenient with what can i let slide with the guy i actually quite like a sort of expectation priority list probably number one on my expectation list is reliability people or guys who let me down really get my goat if we make plans we do it , if i plan something i mean it i struggle to be lenient here this is a biggy for me i can however be lenient on texting i'm alright not hearing from you for a few days , it 's cool , what would we chit chat about anyway ? i can do funny , witty texts but i struggle with conversational messages there is only so many times you can ask what are you up to today ? drinking i'm ok with , who am i to lecture anyone about excessive nights on wine beer jaegerbombs anyway drugs ? a step too far , massive no no i could go on forever the point is sometimes you have to let some your expectations of relationships , jobs and life go by holding on to them you go a little crazy and most importantly risk missing out on something amazing that you had n't quite imagined or expected sure , keep your standards but just keep those great expectations in check
