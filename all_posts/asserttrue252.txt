in this fast paced talk by dr aubrey de grey , we hear about a breathtakingly radical approach to forestalling aging , which in a nutshell involves moving all remaining mitochondrial genes into the nuclear dna , so that mutations in mitochondrial dna , per se , are rendered irrelevant this technique of obviation of mitochondrial dna breakdown is n't a new idea it 's been around for at least years what 's new is that , technologically , we 're in a position to make it happen most mitochondrial genes are , of course , already in the nucleus the majority of scientists accept that mitochondria got their start as bacterial endosymbionts a long ago ancestor of today 's alphaproteobacteria took up residency in an anaerobe the anaerobe provided the invading bacterium with a nutrient rich environment in which to live , while the bacterium provided oxygen detoxification services and a lot of adenosine triphosphate to the host most likely , the invading bacterium had around , genes over time , redundant genes were lost and the remaining , or so migrated to the host cell 's nuclear dna a much safer environment for dna than the mitochondrion , leading to the present day situation where human mitochondria have an extremely small circular chromosome encoding just proteins but we know mitochondria actually contain around , different proteins , most of which are encoded in nuclear genes the majority of mitochondrial genes in the nucleus encode proteins that are made in cyotplasm and imported into the mitochondrion for import , proteins must be in an unfolded state some proteins the most hydrophobic ones are actually made on the surface of the mitochondrion and slurped into the interior of the mitochondrion as they 're being made folding of the proteins then takes place inside the organelle can the remaining mitochondrial protein genes be moved to the nucleus ? if we succeed in doing that , will cells live longer ? what technical obstacles remain ? what progress has been made ? these and other questions are addressed in aubrey de grey 's talk , which is well worth a listen
