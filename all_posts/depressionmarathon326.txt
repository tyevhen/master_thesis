with a miler and a miler scheduled , i was a little apprehensive going into this past weekend i was n't sure how my body would physically respond on the heels of the recent dip in my mood i am happy to report , however , that i had a very good weekend physically , i had two really good runs i felt good my pace was quicker than previous long runs and i recovered well my confidence is rising i am now looking forward to the boston marathon i'm feeling more and more ready everyday other than running , i also had a pretty good weekend from a mood standpoint i made the mistake of staying in , alone , all day , after my miler on saturday , so i was pretty bored and a little low by the evening a phone call to my boyfriend , d , helped and i made sure not to do the same thing on sunday in fact , i went to my friend wendy 's house sunday morning , and jet and i ran from there when we finished running , we spent some nice time relaxing with wendy and her family before returning home the rest of the day went well after that i definitely need to work on socializing more it is almost always beneficial to my mood i finished my day , yesterday , with a two hour massage from my friend , bill he 's a newly minted massage therapist , and he is wonderfully skilled he kneaded , prodded , and stretched me like i was a pile of play dough and play dough is exactly what i felt like by the time he was finished i came home and slid directly into bed i have n't had a massage since last summer , and this one , i thought , was timely and deserved i'm grateful to have a friend with such skilled hands i 'll definitely have to make more time in my future schedule for such pleasant treatment thank you all for your comments on my last post i hate to admit when my thinking gets screwed up i guess i feel like it 's okay if it happens to you , or you , or you , but not me i tend to be a little hard on myself , or so i 've been told your comments helped me feel less crazy and alone thanks again carry on , friends
