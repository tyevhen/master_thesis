when i was contacted by lydia about her latest info graphic which you can see in this blog post ! it sparked me to write about public speaking , as it 's one of my biggest fears the last time i ever spoke in front of a group must of been at some point during my a levels which must be a good few years ago now i do n't know why , but i get severe anxiety over it as much as i know my content and as much as i go over my breathing techniques , i just ca n't seem to stop the shaking and the wobbly voice i 've got to say that it 's a situation i dread i know that as i get older , i'm going to have to tackle it more often and i wo n't always be able to avoid it i'm hoping that as i tackle my anxiety and grow my confidence , the more i will be able stand in front of a group of people i 'll be honest , i am unsure as to what it is that makes me nervous , because it 's not the worry of judgement unless it 's something super important ! nevertheless , i think it 's just about time and practice that makes it easer i 'd love to know your stories and if you have any tips on the issue ! the info graphic that i have included in this blog post is very helpful and i hope it can support you too amy xx
