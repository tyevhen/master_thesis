as a nervous person i tend to see danger everywhere i got to scrub the cutting board really well or i could get food poisoning the next time i use it i better double check that the car doors are locked so my car is n't stollen in the past , i was obsessive about these tasks , and this caused me great anxiety today , i am a little extra thorough in washing the dishes or in ensuring doors are locked , but i no longer repeatedly perform these activities and suffer the resulting distress so being a bit more mindful about everyday tasks is my current average however , after reading dr low 's lecture on frustrations , emergencies and beliefs , i realized that i still have a long way to go in dialing down the amount of danger i see in my life true , i am no longer obsessive about washing dishes and parking the car , but a part of me the stranger in the brain still sees some danger in these tasks dr low told us of the importance of not seeing our life full of emergencies if you deal with everyday life , with routine work or routine existence , if you deal with the trivialities of the daily round , do n't believe that they are emergencies e mergencies happen very seldom in the existence of the average person and dr low wrote that tenseness affects all body systems from head to toe taking that idea a little further , i speculate that any tenseness in our lives can aggravate our nervous symptoms especially those that give us the most discomfort so while i think i 've conquered my issues with washing and driving , kernels of anxiety with these activities remain and those seeds can grow and exacerbate my other symptoms of course , i 've made tremendous progress , but to truly make my mental health a business i ca n't allow myself the luxury of even indulging in small symptoms thus , when i feel the urge to rinse something just one more time or just hit the keyfob 's lock button twice , i need to move actually , not move my muscles , bear the minor discomfort , and continue with my day these are not my most distressing symptoms at the moment in fact , they barely bother me but dr low said we need to attack symptoms at their weakest point so if i want my major symptoms to abate , i need reduce tenseness in all areas of my life i endorsed for writing this post reference low aa manage your fears , manage your anger a psychiatrist speaks glencoe , il willett publishing co
