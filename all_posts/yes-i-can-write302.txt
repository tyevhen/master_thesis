i leave for not back to school camp on saturday ! ! my feelings on going are really mixed , and honestly , right now , i'm not really looking forward to it last year was my first time at nbtsc , and i really did n't have as good a time as i could have i found being in such a large , high energy group with no one whom i knew well to be incredibly stressful , and then i got a nasty cold on top of that i wrote very honestly of my experiences last year here if you want to check it out come late winter , however , i really wanted to do it right to actually be more social , and really get all that i could get out of being with a large group of unschoolers ! however , about a month ago , basically when i realized nbtsc was so close , i started feeling that it really was n't right for me , for where i am in life right now now , i do n't really feel that i do know what 's right for me right now , and as a wise friend pointed out , perhaps i 'll discover that at nbtsc ! then of course there 's also the issue of sleeping outside in two walled cabins in the cold september nights of vermont , the open air showers , and the outhouses , none of which make me terribly happy i like camping usually , and do n't fuss about stuff like that , but i'm having a hard enough time adjusting to the fact that fall is here after a ridiculously short summer , and i'm really not enjoying the colder weather , so the thought of being dumped outside in the cold makes me grumpy ! p complaints about small things aside , i'm a very different person from the one i was last year i notice it , and the people who 've known me a while notice it even more ! so i'm sure that my experience this year will be very different from last year whether it 'll be positive , negative , or mixed , i do not know i just know that it 'll be different ! moving on to something different , and totally wrecking the flow of this post , i realized that i do n't think i ever actually announced that i have a twitter account i kind of snuck it into the links on the sidebar , but who reads those anyway ? so , my point being , i have a twitter account , so if you want to connect with me there , that 's great ! there are also a couple of cool things going down , but i 'll save writing about those for another post peace , idzie you might also like nbtsc not back to school camp a month of cool people places the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering linkwithin
