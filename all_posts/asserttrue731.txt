i spent the last two days in new york city attending a conference the enterprise search summit and did n't have time to check google analytics for my blog traffic until just now imagine my shock to discover that my may post , one of the toughest job interview questions ever , drew unique visitors from countries plus over comments so i guess if you want to draw traffic to your blog , the formula is very simple get a job interview with a large search company talk about one of the interview questions in excruciating depth optionally spend an inordinate amount of time discussing algorithms and such conversely , if you want to completely kill your blog 's traffic numbers , the formula for driving people away seems to be discuss cmis the new oasis content management interop standard fail to mention some kind of programming topic avoid controversy and do n't piss anyone off hmm , i wonder which recipe i should gravitate toward over the next few weeks ? aw heck , screw recipes this is not a cooking show
