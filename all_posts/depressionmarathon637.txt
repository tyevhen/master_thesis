i'm only nine days away from my next marathon , and my calf hurts ! i'm limping i thought it was better , so i went for my tempo run this morning unfortunately , miles from home my calf began to cramp i stopped i stretched i ran again it stayed tight , but it did n't get any worse as i made my way home well , it 's worse now it hurts i'm working on making it better i 've scheduled a massage for later today i 've iced it several times throughout the day , and i may try some ultrasound tomorrow it still hurts i'm getting worried i have nine days to get this thing right of course i want to run the marathon and unless it gets worse , i probably will but i 'd rather it did n't hurt if it hurts , running the race will be much less fun i hope it gets better , and i hope it gets better soon i'm worried it wo n't i hate being injured !
