it 's hard to find time to post recently , i think that 's a good thing life is going pretty well i love mr r more and more all the time i spend nearly all my free time with him and time just flys by he understands depression and supports me a lot when i have a bad day but not only does he support me he also gets cross with me if i sit around feeling sorry for myself he makes sure i get up and go out o he 's just what i need i do worry a lot though my new job is quite challenging and i really do n't know whether i am not good enough to do the job or i am just still finding the ropes i have sleepless nights about it sometimes i get very insecure about work and when i talk to my mr r i sense he gets frustrated with me and does not feel he can help i try to reassure him i am ok and my illness is my problem at the end of the day just being with him makes me feel better when i am with him it puts everything into perspective all that 's important is love and being with those you love , it does not matter if you are cleaning the streets or president of the us , when you 're in love , nothing else compares mr r told me jobs come and go , everything comes and goes but we are for the long term o ! we are going out for dinner tonight to one of my favourite restaurants i want to go and make myself look beautiful for him i keep expecting to wake up and find the last few months have all been a wonderful dream and i will go back to that person who just sits in front of the tv to take her mind off how crap life is mr r knows about my blog and my past now so we have no secrets i could n't imagine life without him anymore i hope i never have to
