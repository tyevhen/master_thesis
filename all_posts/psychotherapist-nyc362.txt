staying positive and focused on your goals , especially long term goals , can be challenging many people who made new year 's resolutions in january have already given up on keeping their resolutions see my article making and keeping new year 's resolutions there are many reasons why people , who start out motivated at the beginning of the year , lose their motivation after just a few months or even a few weeks here are some of the primary reasons why people give up on their goals having unrealistic goals many people have unrealistic ideas about what they can achieve new year 's resolutions tend to be about things like losing weight , exercising more or eating healthier these are all worthy goals , but the problem arises when people set unrealistic goals , like wanting to lose lbs in a month this is an unrealistic and unattainable goal for most people and it sets them up for failure in addition to being realistic and attainable , you 're more likely to succeed at accomplishing your goals if they 're specific , measurable , relevant and time bound engaging in all or nothing thinking when goals are unrealistic and unattainable , people usually become discouraged and give up rather than recognizing that the goal was unrealistic and modifying it it becomes an all or nothing proposition for them see my article overcoming all or nothing thinking having false expectations that accomplishing your goals will create a new you the idea of people reinventing themselves is a part of the american culture we read in self help books and hear ads all the time that say that you can create a new you if you only lose weight , have whiter teeth or fill in the blank this cultural stereotype appeals to people who want a quick fix as opposed to people who recognize that change is a process that usually occurs over time avoid false expectations that accomplishing your goals will create a new you when people focus exclusively on external change without focusing on internal change , even when they succeed at their external goal , it 's harder to persevere in that goal if they have n't done the psychological work that 's necessary to maintain the process for instance , i 've known people who had lap band surgery to lose weight after the surgery , they lost a lot of weight but if they did n't work on the psychological issues that triggered overeating , they often either reverted to overeating and got sick or they developed another addictive behavior , like gambling allowing people in your life to discourage you when you have an important goal , it 's important to share your intention with people who are going to be supportive of you see my article beware of emotional saboteurs emotional support to accomplish a goal can make the difference between accomplishing your goal or giving up do n't allow emotional saboteurs to discourage you from accomplishing your goals in an ideal world , everyone in your life would be supportive and encouraging but , as most of us know , this just is n't the case when you share your intention to accomplish a goal with people who tend to be discouraging , you 're exposing yourself to their negative thinking and , possibly , allowing their negativity to derail you people who tend to be negative and discouraging are n't always doing it to sabotage you sometimes , without even realizing it , they project their own discouragement about themselves onto you if you know you have a healthy , realistic and worthy goal , you have to become more self protective and talk about your goal with other motivated people who are doing positive things in their lives and want the same for you allowing self sabotage and negative thoughts to keep you from accomplishing your goals even more detrimental than other people 's negativity are your own negative thoughts that can creep in so easily , before you realize it , to discourage you from accomplishing your goals see my article are you sabotaging yourself with negative self talk ?
