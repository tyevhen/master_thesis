i saw a patient where the session seemed to drag he was ready to go , but the session was little more than half over i commented that we still had some time and i asked a few more questions it felt like time was going slowly , really slowly at some point , i finally realized that time had literally stopped the clock had not moved for some time i glanced at my cell phone , only to realize that it was now after the hour our minute session had gone on for minutes my clock battery had died , the clock had stopped , and i'm still wondering how it took me minutes to figure this out hoping my patient did n't think i was holding him hostage somehow seems appropriate for election day for the never ending campaign i am so glad it 's finally over
