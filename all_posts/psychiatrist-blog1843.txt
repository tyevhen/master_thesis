i have to admit i 've never seen the television show heroes i understand the idea behind the show is that ordinary people discover they have extraordinary powers that got me thinking about medical heroes usually when i hear that term i think about people like dr edward jenner who discovered the vaccination for small pox , or walter reed and his colleagues who voluntarily infected themselves with yellow fever to see if their vaccines worked medical heroes are people who do big , great things and cure diseases i dunno , i'm more fond of the television heroes' common man definition i like the ordinary anonymous docs who go out every day and do extraordinary things i like the public psychiatrists i wish there were more of them of the six remaining state hospitals in maryland , three have psychiatrist positions that have been standing vacant for months i wo n't even mention how tough it is to find public psychiatrists to work in corrections it 's not for lack of trying in the 's our state created the maryland plan , a program sponsored jointly by the university of maryland and the maryland department of mental hygiene to train and recruit psychiatry residents for employment in the public sector the maryland plan was supposed to be a model program that would fill the physician recruitment needs of our state facilities it has n't , not even after closing one hospital so where are the doctors ? there are psychiatry residency programs in the country charm city has two of them and they turn out a dozen or so psychiatrists a year one of the programs is within walking distance of my prison they 're not walking in my direction according to the u s department of health and human services health workforce analysis for maryland there were , psychiatrists , , psychologists and , social workers in maryland in this was equal to psychiatrists , psychologists , and social workers per , population maryland ranked th among states in psychiatrists per capita emphasis mine , st among states in psychologists per capita , and st among states in social workers per capita a search of the maryland psychiatric society 's directory will turn up doctors under the category public mental health system but you 'll get if you search for psychotherapy to add insult to injury , we ca n't even get public health service docs to work here because the federal government has decided our need is n't great enough to qualify for the loan repayment program psychiatrists have to work in a designated health professional shortage area hpsa with a need score of or higher on a scale of to the hpsa score is based on a convoluted algorithm involving poverty levels , demographic data and the number of mental health professionals in a given population with a psychiatrist to resident ratio of to , maryland does n't even come close to the required , to ratio needed to be a hpsa there are no sites in maryland with a need score this high correctional facilties get their own scoring system based on annual intakes and average length of stay , but again none of our facilities meet hpsa criteria even though we have longstanding open vacancies we 're missing a few heroes and they do n't know what they 're missing
