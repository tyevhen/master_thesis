i'm very sorry to say that there wo n't be a 'proper' post this evening i have been struggling for the past few weeks with withdrawal symptoms from a drug i 've been slowly getting off i seem to get knocked with the brunt of most possible side effects with anything i take ! i 've been struggling with little or no sleep for a few weeks now and side effects which combined resemble the flu and migraines but i managed to rally through to get a post up to avoid disappointment , to avoid disappointing myself if no one else i do write my posts in advance but i always like to come up with some form of face art to bring the concept of each post together and i ca n't bring myself to post something thats incomplete in a way this is a good reminder that there is a person behind this blog that is still incredibly unwell sometimes it can seem like i am merely recapping my experiences of depression rather than showing that i am still going through this in a big way i am nowhere near 'in the clear' yet , i doubt that i will live a life completely free of depression , it 's an illness which is likely to pop up again throughout life once someone has experienced it initially i'm ok with knowing that , when the bad periods come around it will be a reminder to cherish the good moments in life and i will truly know that life out of the shadows is and can be so much better than it is right now
