i'm on the road with little opportunity to connect , and i mean to offer examples of poetry other than my own to illustrate the principles of inductive and deductive poetry , but i have no poetic library with me on the road it so happened that today , staying at my daughter 's , i saw a scene which inspired an inductive poem inductive poems are often found poems in the larger sense , not confined to words found in a paper or book and rearranged , but built from a scene actually experienced that lends itself to poetic treatment though not to the extent that keats' ode to a grecian urn is developed , though strictly one must admit that ode to be an inductive poem , since it was inspired by the elgin marbles anyway , here 's my poem a touch a old man in a brown cardigan held a black chow by a chain leash beside the chain link fence where children thronged , reaching their small fingers like the white flames of stars through the open diamonds of the woven steel , crowding arms on shoulders , shoulders on backs , chests pressed against the fence , clamoring for a touch of fur , the feel of a living thing behind no barrier but not beyond its chain thanks for reading , and when i return from my trip around feb i 'll be able to write more about my new dichotomy for poetry , especially how inductive poetry seems to be in the ascent right now , whereas during the restoration it was deductive poetry that ruled pope , dryden i also mean to visit and comment on my favorite poet bloggers when i come back time is restricted at this library near sacramento oh , and my mood remains improved , glory be to god and new medications ! thine , ce
