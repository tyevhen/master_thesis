i 've been hearing these words quite a bit lately to a certain extent it 's a seasonal thing many of our facilities were built before air conditioning was invented when the indoor temperature starts pushing degrees , people rub on each others' nerves and tempers flair the work is difficult enough , but dealing with these challenging patients gets even harder when you need to look after your co workers' well being battle fatigue can strike anyone , from the top administrator down to the scheduling clerk i try to remind people that the problems are temporary i encourage them to take time off or think about ways of changing the job to make things more bearable in a worst case scenario , i even suggest looking at other job options just to reassure yourself there are always alternatives available sometimes that 's enough , but it does n't always work sometimes people need to leave for their own mental health i do n't want my colleagues to leave the average length of stay for a new correctional doc seems to be six months to a year at the longest lifers are rare , at least among us non inmates i'm blessed to be working with a dedicated young doc now who is called to public psychiatry and is very , very competent i 've watched her grow in her correctional experience and learn , both with and without my help she has reached the critical stay or go point that comes with the adaptation process i'm keeping my fingers crossed
