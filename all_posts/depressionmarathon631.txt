the long weekend with my friend d went well , although not as swimmingly as in the past there was a simple reason d 's year old son joined us at the lake he 's a nice guy , and he likes me , but it made things different first of all , he 's a very intense young man i'm not used to being around intense people it was a little tiring there were also some moments of tension i think d wanted to please both of us and or did n't want to offend either of us for example , i wanted to take d out for breakfast on sunday , just the two of us , but he thought it would be rude to leave his year old son home alone i disagreed i ended up going out with my parents instead some of the tension was of my own making d 's divided attention caused me to worry my fears of being hurt reared their ugly head i had to work hard to accept the situation as it was , accept d 's divided attention , and to not read anything into that divided attention for example , thinking it meant i was not liked by the end of the weekend , i accomplished that it was , overall , a good weekend once again the other update is not so promising i am injured again actually , i tweaked my knee during my last marathon , and it 's been bothering me ever since i have a longstanding , slight meniscus tear in my right knee , and i think i irritated it coming down one of the long , steep hills during the race i actually did n't run at all during the last week i biked , swam , or lifted weights everyday instead by saturday , the pain was significantly less as per my plan , i set out for my usual long run on saturday d 's son is also training for a marathon , and we were both scheduled to go miles unfortunately , despite feeling good prior to the run , my knee flared up around miles i made it miles , but that was it and i payed for it later i'm taking another break from running now i will treat myself with some ultrasound , get a massage , and cross train again it 's already better than it was over the weekend , but i'm worried i do n't know how soon i 'll be able to run again despite my injury , my mood is still holding steady i'm grateful for that i'm also grateful for all of you readers you really keep me going you have no idea ! i have a busy week ahead i'm hoping things go smoothly
