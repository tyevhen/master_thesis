the other day i thought i had somewhat of an epiphany that perhaps my mind was playing tricks on me and i could snap out of this mental illness that i deal with that it 's all in my head and i just have to think in a different way i thought to myself , perhaps i should think i'm not suicidal and i wo n't be anymore but , yet again this is just another way your mind tries to play with you although i think that thinking in different ways can help and allow to reach different perspectives , i am still aware that mental illness is real problem , usually promoted by a chemical imbalance and this is very real i wish it was as easy as just thinking you 're okay and that being the solution , but i think it 's a lot harder than it it takes a huge amount of effort to overcome the doubts in your mind , no matter what people tell you it 's just not that easy and sometimes i feel the brain likes you to believe that it is and you really can just come out of it but , if this was the case then i would n't be dealing with these problems right now it 's hard because i feel that everyday is a battle against your own mind even though it is the one thing you need to keep you in control for that hours you 're constantly doubting yourself , or feeling that there 's a black cloud hanging over you and that 's a challenge to keep going in itself , alongside the thought that what you 're going through might not be real do n't get me wrong sometimes thinking differently , for me personally , can help i do feel that i can get myself into a rut where i am thinking negatively alongside my depression rather than it necessarily being a side effect and in that case if i notice it , i release the pressure a bit but , a lot of the time mental illness is life changing and debilitating and it 's not just a matter of changing your mind set it 's sometimes just too beyond yourself to be able to even do that i know with anxiety , i could n't even walk sometimes and there 's nothing that i tried , that worked with that mental illness is very real and even when our mind plays tricks , it does affect u and you 've got to be strong to battle your own mind everyday , but i know it 's possible and i know the strength needed to get through we all have it best wishes , amy xx
