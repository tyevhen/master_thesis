i wonder if anyone else has fond memories of playing croquet at their grandparents' home ? while exploring a thrift store last week , i came upon this croquet set for i was immediately taken back to the days of my childhood summers croquet with my sisters and sometimes my cousins during picnics and visits to my grandparents' home when i think of croquet , i think of my grandparents it 's funny how certain material objects , smells , and songs trigger fond memories of course , i had to make this croquet set my own my kids had never played croquet before that evening last week it was wonderful and very nostalgic to see them enjoying a game that i played as a child making memories
