i'm really falling behind my stack of papers fortunately , life is good and busy , and there are always new , catchy songs to listen to the temper trap fader that song really puts a spring in my step rather like a strong cup of coffee full disclosure more of a tea person , but i 've been known to drink a cup of joe every now and again maybe i ought to drink a bit more the evidence is mixed , frankly and certainly i ca n't tell you how many times i 've had patients complain of insomnia , only to find out they are drinking large iced coffees a day , or mountain dews no matter how much i exercise , i do n't seem to be able to take this weight off , doctor but what does the research say about , say , depression and coffee ? a brand spanking new piece of epidemiology from the nurses' health study was published in the archives of internal medicine this month coffee , caffeine , and risk of depression among women some facts from the article of the caffeine in the world is consumed as coffee interesting prospective studies of men and caffeine use showed a strong inverse association between coffee drinking and depression , with no association for tea or cola three cohort studies showed an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and suicide though in a finish study , there was a j shaped curve with both very high cups of coffee daily and low consumption of coffee seemingly less protective than moderate amounts so , in the nurses' health study following , american female nurses starting in , women filled out questionnaires every two years , filled out questionnaires in , , or , and those with no history of depression at that time , women those with unknown history were excluded were followed over the next decade regular coffee drinkers in this cohort were more likely to be smokers , drinkers , and not go to church ! they also tended to have lower rates of diabetes and obesity average consumption for the whole group was about cups of coffee a day among the , women , about developed clinical depression in the year period there was a dose dependent , inverse relationship between the amount of coffee consumed and the risk of developing depression over the years when covariates such as age , health , smoking , divorces , etc etc were all adjusted for , the inverse relationship became even stronger ! no associations were found between tea consumption , chocolate consumption , decaf coffee , or soda consumption and depression so what 's up ? is coffee an antidepressant ? i know what i am band of skulls well , maybe this is no randomized controlled trial , so causation cannot be determined , but caffeine , , trimethylxanthine antagonizes the adenosine aa receptor this is thought to have pro dopamine effects by taking out adenosine , we might also be affecting the transmission of norepinephrine and serotonin , both known targets of antidepressant medicines since coffee is known to cause insomnia and anxiety , both features of depression , a weakness of the study is that women prone to insomnia and anxiety might limit their intake of coffee , thus biasing the results so that women who can tolerate a truckload of coffee also happen to be the ones less prone to depression but all told , it seems that this study is another notch in coffee 's bedpost though less than cups a day seems prudent and i really ca n't recommend mountain dew
