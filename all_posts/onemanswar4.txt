if a person is not talented enough to be a novelist , not smart enough to be a lawyer , and his hands are too shaky to perform operations , he becomes a journalist norman mailer by jack smith this norman mailer quote pretty much sums it up my heart longs to write for a living , but my head says i d starve i almost went to law school , but i hated my first job i worked at the biggest firm in the state in a job i started a couple days after graduation they stuck me in a room with no windows and not enough straight jackets to do tedious discovery work defending an insurance company a massive company that ripped off a bunch of poor people who didn t know better i was miserable my girlfriend was four hours away that summer the whole thing triggered one of my first bouts with major depression in my early s i d struggled before but never like that i could not get off the couch except to go to work i had no idea why and never told anyone when i told the firm i was leaving , one nice lawyer said it s a shame he said i wrote good memos and summarized things well i didn t take it as a compliment i remember wondering why he didn t say , you d make a good lawyer , jack that s all i wanted to hear i have enough lawyers in my family to field a basketball team with good subs to come off one heck of a bench for years , i ve wondered why i was too scared to become one i recently figured it out i was too scared to become one so i did something i swore i d never do i went home and settled on a career as a journalist at a community newspaper they were the best years of my life and career and the hardest it s not easy being superman s son , but flying is fun even if you re afraid of heights oh i almost forgot about the third part of the quote up top i have a tremor that on some days makes it hard for me to drink coffee in front of other people being a surgeon was not an option , even if i had n't stunk at science my whole life i ve sat through hundreds of lunches and dinners at restaurants and eaten entire meals without taking a single sip of water that s what i used to do when my tremor was bad and the waiter filled my glass too close to the top i was worried i d spill it everywhere i was mocked as a child just a few times and never really got over it until fairly recently if someone were to make fun of me tomorrow , they might get a shaky middle finger back in their face it feels good not to care what others think again i know that 's crass and i'm sorry to sound that way honesty is liberating , and that 's honestly how i feel and the rest of the truth is most days i do care what others think and that 's misery you may have heard what norman mailer said about going home or was it tom wolfe , who stole his line and put it on the cover of his best book ? either way , i made up a word just now for what at least one of them did plagiarism don t you know , a lady once allegedly told tom wolfe , you can t go home again ?
