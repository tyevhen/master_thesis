i want to explain a little more about the fear of judgement i mentioned in my first and second blog posts it is the source of much of my anxiety i fear all judgement i guess a better description would be to say i fear attention i m sure most people hate being judged negatively and that s easy to understand it s hating to be judged positively that seems more unusual for example , if people ask what i do i say i work in finance administration in fact , i manage a team of finance administrators but i feel uncomfortable admitting it i also feel uncomfortable if people find out i live in a four bedroom house i think because my own opinion of myself is low i want others vision of me to match mine i don t want them to think i m more successful than i consider myself and certainly wouldn t want anyone to think i was show off or something special my fear was first recognised by my therapist , about months ago , i never noticed it myself as it was such an integral part of who i was ever since he helped me see what an issue it was for me i have become aware of how many areas of my life it s affecting it sounds like a clich but having first recognised it as a problem i was then able to start taking steps to tackle it at the start of my therapy i began to think i had so many issues i was beyond help as well as the depression , there were all the ways in which anxiety crippled me i was an anxious driver , ridiculously so i avoided certain social situations i had many issues with my appearance i struggled to form friendships i couldn t so much as make eye contact with a man i didn t know , and i don t mean romantically i struggled to go into beauty salons i would often panic in shops , especially clothes shops , some of them i couldn t go into at all basically , i completely lacked confidence and constantly felt inadequate and often foolish whilst i m not keen on labels , giving most of my problems one name fear of judgement was a revelation and once i only had one problem to face it seemed so much more likely i could deal with it the therapist said to think of my fears each as a branch of a tree with the fear of judgement being the trunk although i still had many branches to tackle at least it was only one tree so why would someone who fears attention write a blog ? ! whilst i have made much progress and finished the therapy i still have a long way to go i ve tried for years to blend in and go unnoticed to always appear ok and on top of things , it s damn exhausting so , i m trying the exact opposite , i ll be open and share my life and in doing so i imagine the huge weight of pressure i ve put upon myself will be lifted and i can live a more free and easy life i m certainly enjoying blog writing in the days since starting this blog i have felt the most positive and excited i have in years it feels like i m taking control back and that feels so good as i wrote this i just got the strangest sense of deja vu i swear i ve dreamt this but only just remembered maybe writing this blog is part of my path , my destiny i can t in one post explain everything about my fear my plan is to write several posts each about one of the various areas of my life this has affected and i can explain my progress i also want to talk about my cfs , my quest to be healthier and my general life i won t be a blogger with a niche ! i have experienced countless things in my life and i want to share many of them with you i also want to share the current and more fun stuff if this helps or inspires anyone i would be so honoured another clich even if i only help one person this will all be worth it in this case the one person may be me thank you for reading kelly x suggested posts my exercise history my journey to healthy eating
