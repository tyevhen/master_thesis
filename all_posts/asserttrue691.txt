as a professional jargon whore i'm always fascinated to come across neologisms that have either just recently entered the geek lexicon or have been there for a while , but i just did n't notice such is the case with yak shaving , a term i frankly had n't come across until yesterday one of the better definitions i 've seen so far for yak shaving is the following march , zed shaw , you used ruby to write what ? ! , cio yak shaving is a programmer 's slang term for the distance between a task 's start and completion and the tangential tasks between you and the solution if you ever wanted to mail a letter , but could n't find a stamp , and had to drive your car to get the stamp , but also needed to refill the tank with gas , which then let you get to the post office where you could buy a stamp to mail your letter then you 've done some yak shaving shaw 's explanation of finding a stamp to mail a letter is a little quaint who mails letters any more ? and begs for more pertinent examples i think most of us could easily come up with quite a few right away i'm thinking ysee as a synonym for jee some others creating a mozilla extension hello world in osgi building a flex app doing a clean install of opencms on a virgin machine i e , a machine that does n't already have jdk , tomcat , mysql not difficult , just a lot of yak shaving getting almost any kind of enterprise software configured and running installing a nontrivial application on linux and having to resolve dependencies again , the essential idea here is n't that what you 're doing is difficult , just that it involves a lot of onerous tedium along the way to some worthwhile goal what would you add to the above list ?
