the neurology of hypnosis with the discovery of the brain 's hemispheric laterality see the work of gazzanaga and bogen as well as psychology today , may , p , the terms right brain left brain have become virtual household concepts the brain is divided into two halves , with each half mediating qualitatively different processes the right brain mediates non rational functions and holistic perceptions , while the left brain mediates the rational and specific the right is holistic while the left is analytic the right is internally oriented , while the left is externally focused another recent neurological discovery is that of the triune brain , where the division is concentric rather than lateral less well known than the concept of hemispheric laterality , the discovery of the triune brain may be more significant based on paul yakovlev 's research , the triune brain model describes the brain as organized concentrically into three zones or neuropils each zone consists of an interrelated network of nerve cells with its own biochemical composition each zone has its own storehouse for consciousness and memory the three zones or levels of the brain develop chronologically in the fetus and newborn just as they did in human evolution at birth and in primitive animals only the first level is operative , mediating visceral and body activity by the sixth month of life the second level of brain development emerges to mediate the limbic processes of feeling and emotion there is some evidence that in evolution this began with the turtle , which shows some limbic structure the third or cortical level , which mediates all cognitive functions , is the last to develop and in its full development is uniquely human how does this relate to hypnosis ? the dissociation so critical to all hypnotic phenomena hinges upon a disengagement of the third level of consciousness it is precisely this third level that predominates in relation to the outer world this part of the brain perceives , reflects , reasons , rationalizes , and comprehends its task is to process and evaluate information , to know what is what the temperature is , the conditions of the environment , if danger is near , whether the body needs food or sleep , and so on for hypnosis to be effective , it must disengage the third level , so that the individual is no longer able to independently process information a trance state occurs when the person operates from the emotional second or physical first level of consciousness without the benefit of the critical intellect third level in this state , no cognition is employed to determine whether internal and external conditions coincide , whether how one feels and acts is reality based this is why children are generally more responsive to hypnosis they do not have the well developed evaluative functions of the adult childish complaisance is the neurotic feature in the adult which enables the trance to occur and sustain itself notice two key phrases in erickson 's report of the woman in the somnambulistic trance with juvenile directness , earnestness , and simplicity , and in the manner of a small child i believe his demonstration uncovered the woman 's latent childish tendencies rather than inducing them the subject 's pre existing complaisance allowed for even further dissociation from what she ordinarily experienced so that even external clues would not disrupt her trance erickson 's demonstration points up another crucial aspect of the hypnotic state unencumbered by personal embarrassment and social restraints , the subject was free to act as childishly as she was under normal circumstances repression defends against the admission of neurosis under hypnosis , with the last remnant of rational perception suppressed , neurotic people can allow themselves to be as dependent , childish , and hurting as they really are the hypnotic procedure reveals what the self censorship of repression conceals the essence of the neurotic self it does so , however , by avoiding full conscious experience , for it is this experience that provokes feelings of pain clearly , we cannot get well through unconsciousness because that is the definition of neurosis it takes full conscious awareness to become whole thus , the attraction of hypnosis is the apparent opportunity to have it both ways you can show who you are without feeling the concomitant pain and this , as i shall explain later , is exactly why hypnotherapy cannot in the end be therapeutic
