as a disastrous lurches to a close , rumblings about player disharmony , unhappiness and homesickness are once again threatening to tear the brisbane lions list apart james aish is definitely on the way out it s been a tough year for the youngster with injury and form hampering his ability to consistently reach the sky high potential he possessed when drafted years ago jack redden has announced this week that he wants to be traded , with reports surfacing that he is unhappy with head coach justin leppitsch stefan martin wants to go home to victoria dayne zorko could seemingly be pried away for the right offer and jed adcock and matthew leauenberger have been told they can seek other opportunities so as this once proud club seemingly heads for a mass player exodus similar to , what is going wrong north of the border ? yes , the team is poor their record in speaks for itself wins , losses and a pathetic percentage of but with question marks hanging over half a dozen of their best and brightest players for the season , how can they stop the rot ? for me , there are two major issues an under resourced player wellbeing program and a distinct lack of leadership the board has already taken steps to improve one of these aspects in great news for the club , welfare guru craig lambert and his wife melissa seem likely to re join the lions and head up the player welfare program for the season this is a significant move to try and quell the dissatisfaction existing amongst current players and potentially future draftees in an age when it has become increasingly easy to change clubs , people with the ability to make the footy environment more welcoming are worth their weight in gold these people help you build a culture capable of empowering these youngsters and making them feel at home in a completely foreign environment but although this is a step in the right direction , there is plenty more to do my biggest issue lies with the coach and captain of the club , justin leppitsch and tom rockliff in my opinion , they aren t good leaders there are growing concerns about leppitschs ability to connect with the playing group on a deeper , more personal level he is said to be tough , hard and confronting this was seen earlier in the year where he was involved in a physical altercation with rookie zac o brien , where he allegedly pinned him against the wall of the changeroom during a reserves game that s old school coaching prehistoric coaching stupid and insensitive coaching now both parties apologised for their role in the fracas and it was a one off but no doubt some damage was done to leppas standing around the club leppitsch is hard nosed , with a waft of arrogance , which can ruffle some feathers so i guess if there was a suitable foil around the club for his up front style of coaching and leadership , it might be more tolerable but there isn t lions captain tom rockliff is the same kind of man his leadership style is brazen and in your face he is confrontational , straight shooting and offers tough love he is blue collar , and this helped him earn the respect of some of his peers , but not all of them does rockliff have the ability to be a calming , supportive influence on a distressed and unhappy youngster ? or does he dress him down on social media when he expresses some dissatisfaction with the clubs direction ? rockliffs actions have caused some disillusionment amongst his peers but leppitsch has openly backed him in saying i don t want a wallflower captain what sort of message does that send the playing group ? and then he compared his leadership style to luke hodge give me a break below is a list of brisbane lions draftees who have left , or are likely to leave the club this year pick james aish picks , and billy longer , sam docherty and elliot yeo picks and jared polec and patrick karnezis pick jack redden pick lachie henderson pick matthew leauenberger pick mitch clark likely to leave the club this tells the story an abundance of high end draft talent lost to other clubs the brisbane lions footy club lacks soul the culture is rotting they need to develop a program where players not only want to come to the club , they want to stay talented duo daniel rich and sam mayes are off contract at the end of next year as well , watch this space
