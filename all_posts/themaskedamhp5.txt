it was late afternoon one st october i had received a referral for bert , an elderly man living alone in a cottage a few miles out of charwood his gp was concerned that he had dementia and was expressing severe paranoid symptoms , including being tormented by someone he called mr dark , who , he said , was entering his cottage , interfering with his possessions and stealing the electricity from his lights i popped into the gp s surgery and got him to complete a medical recommendation for sec i then arranged to go with a psychiatrist the light was failing by the time we arrived at his cottage , in a remote location a little way outside the village , at the end of a narrow lane the cottage was in a state of dilapidation once thatched , many years ago this had been replaced by corrugated iron sheets , which were now rusting and ragged at the edges the garden was overgrown and choked with brambles and nettles the psychiatrist and i made our way to the front door and knocked a frail looking old man opened the door , and appeared pleased to see us come in , come in , he said , without bothering to ask who we were , and led us into a heavily beamed room with a cooking range in the fireplace we sat down on wooden chairs that were arranged around a large table i introduced myself and explained why we were there your doctor s worried about you he says that you re worried about people coming into the house not people , he said , leaning into us not people what do you mean ? mr dark he s not people he s not a person he steals my light he ll steal my soul he ll extinguish me he won t let me alone until he s taken everything and i m just a husk he started to cry he continued rambling on in this vein he looked terrified and exhausted he couldn t continue like this how do you feel about coming into hospital ? i asked him hospital ? some semblance of animation lit up his eyes i ll go to hospital as long as mr dark s not there will mr dark be at the hospital ? no , i said , no he won t although bert appeared happy enough about informal admission , i did not feel he could make informed consent , and he might possibly change his mind before he got there so the psychiatrist and i decided that it was best to complete an application for admission under sec mha , to assess him further we completed the forms , and i told him he would indeed be going to hospital this seemed to calm him i called for an ambulance , and the psychiatrist , as they always do , left bert sat by the table , and rested his head on his folded arms he appeared to fall asleep by now night had fallen that was when i heard a sound coming from upstairs it sound like footsteps as far as i knew , bert lived alone i had established that he had no relatives in the area , only a sister who lived many miles away and was in a care home bert , i said he opened his eyes bert , is there anyone else in the house ? only i thought i heard someone upstairs bert s face filled with dread he s here ! he s coming for me i was sure it must be rats most likely in a rundown old cottage rats i decided not to investigate instead , i rang ambulance control to see how much longer they would be then the door from the hall opened and someone walked in a tall , gangly man with a pale face , coal black eyes , and a wide lipless mouth he pulled up a chair and sat down at the table excuse me , i said , as always polite what are you doing here ? you re not a relative are you ? the man smiled broadly , revealing two rows of rotting teeth a relative ? no , i m not a relative i m mr dark he waved a hand and the lights in the room flickered and then went out
