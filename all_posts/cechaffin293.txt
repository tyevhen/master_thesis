i wish i had better news i wish i could say , i m well ! i m well ! thank god almighty i m well ! but i m not i m sick i m very sick since friday , soon after i wake up i burst into tears and sobs and they last all day until my tear ducts are just burned out by nighttime even yesterday , when i hiked with kathleen along the beautiful cliffs of the coastline , i couldn t stop the tears running down my cheeks beneath my ray bans i called my doctor but we did not connect i don t know how to stop crying i don t know what i m crying about it s as if someone left the alarm clock on and it won t shut off i am overcome with grief yes , i miss rachel yes , i can t believe she s dead yes , that thought makes me weep but my grief , my physical expression of grief , triggers self denigrating thoughts as well how incompetent and incapable i am what a failure i am i could n't get a job at mcdonald 's i would never learn to flip the hamburgers properly my back hurts always , yes , and my mind seems like a tattered kite hanging from the telephone wire , but i feel as if i deserve to be thrown out on the streets and given a shopping cart or perhaps i could join a freak circus the saddest man alive , the marquee would read the curtain would open and there i would sit , watering the tulips i want to look well for kathleen but i can t dissimulate in front of her i tell her of my little triumphs , how i put shelves in the coat closet , how i cleaned out the entire refrigerator during these tasks i continued to weep obviously i can function in this state , though it feels as if i ca n't what am i crying about ? i don t know it s like a record skipping i should have had ect a year ago , but who knows whether my daughter s death might have sent me off the deep end again anyway ? i took an antipsychotic this morning hoping it will calm me some i called my doctor again i try to be responsible about my illness netflix sent me the elephant man , which i apparently ordered long ago terrific movie i understand john merrick , as i think most of us do not that i have actually suffered as a sideshow freak and been beaten by a drunken handler it s just the feeling of being so very different when i know i am not , just as he yells at his pursuers , i am a human being ! and because he is befriended and loved , he receives more happiness than any of us can imagine who can imagine being lifted from such a wretched state to become a favorite of london society , and that not because he was a freak , but because he was human despite his unfortunate appearance i have a friend who suffers from the same disease , neurofibromatosis or von recklinghausen s disease like most cases , his is much less severe , though the fibrous tumors have necessitated multiple surgeries on his foot i ve never heard him complain about it i recently read an article in the new yorker about those rare individuals afflicted with lesch nyan syndrome because of one random mutation in their x chromosome , they chew their lips and fingers off and react oppositely in their emotions that is , if they like someone they may cuss at him or punch him if they dislike someone they may say something polite their hands must be covered with mitts because their fingers frighten them , as they feel suddenly compelled to bite them most have no lips , having long since chewed them off often they ask their caretakers to restrain them when they feel the self destructive compulsions coming on to think that one base pair askew in the dna chain could result in such specific behaviors is frightening and raises serious questions about free will kathleen tells me , it s not your fault it s your genes but i don t know any other me just because some genetic abnormality makes me cry for days on end doesn t mean that that crying feels any less like me and i do n't dwell on suicide , a thought that more hounds me when depressed nevertheless , if genetics is destiny , can i make myself stop crying ? can i will myself into sanity ? of course not i can t control it any more than an epileptic can control a seizure this is not a failure of courage or anything else it is not a failure at all it is a biological sentence that differs from grief i do n't feel sorry for myself if i grieve , i grieve for the whole world , because i feel as if the object of my grief has become diffused and fills the universe if you asked me why i weep , i could only say , for nothing for everything my sadness has no limit except this body still , my state is not like a pure biological depression it is something new i have never cried this much when depressed in that state there is too much of the bitter , metallic despair in me to do so i don t feel inhuman i feel too human , even if the capacity for sadness is only one aspect of being human in writing this i have temporarily stopped crying i feel like an emotional astronaut i try to report the journey and it doesn t have to make sense unrateable , ce
