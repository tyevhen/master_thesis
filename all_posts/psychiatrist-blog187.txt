i met dr sana johnson quijada at the apa annual meeting this year in new york sana has her own blog friend to yourself , and i invited her to do a guest blog on shrink rap in honor of independence day , she sent the following post self care is freedom , is democracy , is because we are accountable authenticsociety com self care tip be accountable for and to yourself it was about degrees fahrenheit , which in my part of the world is considered hot but in washington d c , i considered that temperature general anesthesia i was breathing it in and trying hard to remain alert just when i thought i could hold out no longer , i saw him big and expressive , the long form of abraham lincoln was there , surrounded by loud irreverent people my brother and i were wiping sweat out of our eyes trying to keep track of our kids we wanted to read the gettysburg address for our kids , and found ourselves screaming the kids could barely hear the words above the disinterested rabble around us despite all this , i was choking a weepy , sweaty , nearly anesthetized but free american four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation , so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure we are met on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this just down the corner from lincoln is a president s list of sites to see , informers and reminders of who we are and where we came from however , none of them were my lincoln experience but , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate , we can not consecrate , we can not hallow this ground the brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it , far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion a couple of days ago , writing the post about how stress intersects with medicine , i remembered my lincoln it may seem like a stretch at first but take a minute self care is a way of saying , i am free in places where life is cheap , almost without value , self care is not much of an option it is because of freedom that we can extricate the meddling fingers , the invasions , and be the keeper of our own private spaces however we choose to it is because of freedom that we can tell people that although my brain is ill and although i take medication , i am equal saying that is self care saying that is possible if we take that freedom to keep our own accountability for our own selves accountability is not the same as blame having accountability for our freedom is not the same as being at fault for what came before freedom , nor our current conditions that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation , under god , shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth if you re not accountable to your inner self , if you re only accountable to your actions , or you re only accountable to what others determine and define about you , than you are not free you are blamed accountability is such a tender privilege we might lose it if we forget who we are , where we came from and our rights to freedom democracy is self care question how do you see the relationship between self care and your freedoms ? i practice psychiatry and parent , with my husband , our small children woven into this , writing and connection to community continues to bless me i am grateful
