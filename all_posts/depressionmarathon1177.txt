i 've had local people , people who know me , tell me , i never realized depression could be like that , after they read this blog the reality is , i have no idea who is and who is n't reading my blog that 's okay that is both the blessing and the curse of writing a blog the beauty of this comment is these people know me they are friends , acquaintances or colleagues with whom i frequently share meals , runs , meetings , or work they see me they interact with me they know me but until they read my blog , they do n't know my illness not my illness , but the illness of depression it 's usually invisible depression is invisible , as the above comment highlights surviving with depression requires us to adapt to act our part expertly the stigma , shame and myths surrounding mental illness create an environment of illusion if we ca n't assimilate , we die we are all great actors on the stage of life we have to be , or we will be ostracized the solitude , separation and loneliness are too high a price to pay to keep it real this is not to say i am someone other than the person i project i am the person you run with , have meals with , and see at meetings social , cheerful , humorous , confident that is me but it is not all of me the depression i keep unseen you do not see the ugly vacancy within my soul the colluded , preoccupied , corrupt brain is invisible to you the financial anxieties , self care difficulties , and overwhelming fatigue i keep hidden i have to , or life would be unlivable , lonely and bankrupt it 's not sad i do not need sympathy it just is it 's reality that 's why i'm here writing reality to make visible the invisible , that 's my motivation to give form to the amorphous , describe the indescribable , and give voice to the voiceless , that 's why i write about depression after reading my blog , perhaps one person will decide to get help maybe another will cook a meal for a friend maybe someone will donate money for research perhaps one will drive a friend to an appointment perhaps i do n't know who reads this blog , what impact is has , or if it motivates anyone to take action certainly , i hope my experience will enlighten , support and help others that 's always been a goal i'm grateful when people tell me my writing has enlightened them , changed their point of view , or made a difference in their life i humbly appreciate that however , i never anticipated the difference this blog would make in my own life unexpectedly , writing reality has helped me writing this blog helps me feel whole whole for a person with depression , there is no better feeling than that
