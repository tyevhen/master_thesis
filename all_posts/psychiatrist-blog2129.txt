now i do n't just write a blog , i read other people 's blogs it 's like throwing time in the fire and watching it burn last night , i said to my husband , hon we 've lived in baltimore for years , i 've sunk to calling him hon , i think the blog is getting to be a problem he simply answered , yup roy , who somehow supports a family , directed me to fat doctor 's blog he assigned me a mission to get her to post our blog so far , we 're nowhere and it 's mostly been clinkshrink , roy , and i talking to each other i found fat doctor a famine resistant doctor , wife , mom , cynic and active daydreamer blogging for minutes each morning to better avoid starting my day a beleaguered soul who suffers from depression and is now off her prozac , fat doctor won my heart i laughed out loud when i should have cried she has a wonderfully self effacing , charismatic sense of humor strangely , i wanted her blog to be my blog hours after discovering fat doctor , i returned to learn she is in the hospital having suffered a stroke , still blogging her followers have wished her well , as i do now , though i feel like a bit of an intruder we 'll leave my blog swapping mission for another day
