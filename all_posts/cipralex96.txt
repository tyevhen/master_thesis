today after i woke up with a huge boner that hurt so bad that i almost i moved to the mg pill , i hope there wont be hard side effects and that it will go slowly and nicely however i'm prepared for it if it will come , also need to get to the course and interact a bit , see how it goes , meanwhile its the morning , the only thing that i notice is that my jaws are kinda stiff and i need to take a shit , still feeling chills here and there , also feeling electricity or energy flowing around my back and neck and head and hands , breathing became slower no problem shitting at the afternoon still had the jaw thing some pain on the right side lung between the bones , like a cold or something now its better , i 've also noticed that where the panic once were , there 's a mild tickeling sensation around the upper stumach , its in the afternoon right now , teeth clenching still here , also electricity feel and feeling very taierd , dealt with the nlp course people went pretty good , i didnt gave a fuck when he tried on me stuffs email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
