throughout my mental health journey i have always credited cbt to be a huge help cbt is cognitive behavioural therapy where you are exposed to situations which trigger your anxiety it sounds scary i know , but it 's not as bad as you think usually with cbt you start small , with the things that trigger your anxiety the least and as you move on you get to the things that trigger your anxiety the most by facing your anxiety head on your mind learns that there is n't a threat there at all and soon learns a new positive behaviour it does take willpower , but it is definitely something you are capable of ! you may not be able to complete the task first of all but you will get there recently i have come across an app called nocd whom contacted me to highlight their new app and asked to collaborate with me i downloaded the app and have given it a go myself in comparison to therapy in which i had cbt , it is pretty much the same thing but without a counsellor being there i think if you are finding it hard to talk to someone and or need something to help your anxiety then this app is definitely something you can try i know i wish it was around when i was having therapy and struggling with my anxiety it 's free to download , so you 're not losing anything by just giving it a go you can download the app free to your phone , here http m treatmyocd com relieffromanxiety i hope it helps you if there 's just a small chance it may help , then why not give it a try ? i know cbt really helped me , so i hope this app can help your anxiety and or ocd too below is an example of how i have used the app ! amy xx spon ad
