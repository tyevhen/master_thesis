i do n't feel like reading my book i do n't feel like watching tv i do n't feel like listening to my usual weekend programs on npr i did n't feel like exercising , but i did lift some weights i do n't feel like writing this blog post besides sleeping , i do n't feel like doing much of anything i'm concerned disinterest in my normal activities is a concerning sign for me my mood today feels sickeningly familiar , and disinterest is often the precursor to a slide of course , right now i am hyper vigilant when it comes to signs of a potential slide i dread the thought of going backwards i do n't think i could handle it again i 've written about this before it is so difficult , i think , to avoid panicking when we have these lower than normal days perhaps this is just a normal day with a normal dip in my mood and a normal dip in my interest in activities perhaps i'm just bored i hope so but how do we know ? i certainly do n't want to wait to find out i'm trying to battle rather than wait i am using some of the tools i just learned in my mood disorder program i used a tool called opposite action when i went to the gym to lift some weights despite wanting to stay inside and slumber i did go to my meeting this morning , and i will go to my track club banquet tonight i 've let my friend , wendy , and my doctor know what 's happening i am scared , but i pray taking the next right action and continuing to move forward will keep this damn , dreaded illness at bay please
