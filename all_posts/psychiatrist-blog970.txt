from the huffington post , here is an article on people with pda addictions i can relate only i can relate pro actively i knew the first time i saw email that it would ruin my life i kept it in my office , but i found myself wanting to go to work to check my email eventually , i surrendered and brought it home it ruined my life i do n't have internet access on my cell phone or pda why ? because i check it all the time i check it in traffic i check it when i'm on line at the grocery store i check it after i check it repeatedly what am i looking for ? does it matter ? it 's bad enough that i'm glued to my laptop at home i do n't have internet access in my office no , i'm not kidding i'm there to be at work , and i'm supposed to be with my patients if i had a computer , i 'd be peeking at email , waiting for time between patients to check , to blog , to plug in huffington writes we realize that this is a widespread malady consider these stats in , the average american watched more than hours of tv a month an all time high of people check their pdas just before bed and as soon as they wake up and an astounding peek at their pdas in the middle of the night ! one survey found that over a third of smartphone users would pick their blackberry over their significant other if they had to choose one to live without ! if all this sounds like addiction , well , it probably is in a new study , college students who went hours without using any media no cell phone , ipod , tv , etc then blogged about their experience , using terms of addiction to describe their feelings in withdrawal , frantically craving , miserable , jittery , crazy i can relate
