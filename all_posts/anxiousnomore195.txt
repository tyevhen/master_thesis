if you are like me than you spend the majority of your day sitting in front of a computer with all of the work that i do it makes it difficult to set a time to do yoga even though i know it is so very beneficial to me i always feel so much better after doing it luckily i came across some really cool , short videos that show you different yoga techniques that you can do at your desk at work to help you take a break its nothing huge or life changing , rather something small and easy to implement that could help you have a better day the majority of these i could do at my desk without drawing very much attention to myself a few i probably would get some weird looks if anyone saw me i think they are worth checking out , especially the neck stretch , shoulder , wrist , spine , chest , seated twist , and seated twist with legs crossed videos enjoy click here for more on office yoga easy exercises for desk jockeys if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like the benefits of yoga taking deep breaths great reasons to track your meditation efforts in a another testimonial of the awesomeness of yoga linkwithin
