it 's the weekend in the hospital unfortunately , that means long days of nothing we still have a few groups today , but the schedule is cut down significantly and unlike yesterday , when i spent most of the day sleeping , today the sleep will not come maybe that 's a good thing ? i do feel less fatigued , i think this morning , i rubbed the sleep from my eyes and got on the treadmill after breakfast my marathon training schedule called for a ten miler today it 's the last long run before boston i really wanted to do it , but i really doubted i 'd be able to get it done the treadmill is a bit old and hard it sits at the end of a hallway facing a window which looks out directly into some trees and worst of all , my i pod did n't work ! oh well , i got on the treadmill anyway i figured if i could run miles , i 'd be thrilled so that 's where i originally set my sights the first four miles were tough i occupied my mind by counting my steps up to , and then starting over , about a million times ! by the time i hit miles , i found a little groove , so i kept going that groove ended just before miles , but i figured i had run that far , so i did n't want to quit the last two miles seemed to take forever , but i made it i ran miles on an old treadmill with no view and no music i was amazed and pretty damn happy with myself i think completing that run helped lighten my mood today i'm bored now , but i do feel a little better it 's a relief being in a safe place , too do n't get me wrong , i want to go home i want to run outside , go back to work , and watch tv with my dog but maybe that feeling of relief means i'm exactly where i need to be thank you , thank you , thank you for all of your comments i appreciate your thoughts and prayers your comments buoy me i'm amazed to feel so much love from people i 've never met you guys , my readers , are the best thank you
