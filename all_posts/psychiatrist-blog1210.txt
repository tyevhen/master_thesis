doug duncan has a strong family history of bipolar disorder , and during his campaign to become governor of maryland , he became ill with major depression mr duncan dropped out of the race , and let the reason be known in today 's baltimore sun , there is an article about his symptoms and recovery apparently he made a good recovery with the trial of medication and therapy , and is now doing well could he toughed out the campaign ? this is a personal decision so what do you think in our efforts to destigmatize mental illness , would mr duncan 's history of depression be a reason people would vote for him in the future ? my guess i think people would not vote for a president with a history of depression will he push the button in a moment of helplessness ? what if she becomes depressed after a terrorist attack ? otherwise , i think he still has an open door just my opinion , do chime in and i just bought a brand new mac book i ca n't seem to work the copy paste cntrl c cntrl v thing for links oy try this if my link did n't work http www baltimoresun com news local bal md vozzellaapr , , column ? page oh , and i ca n't get a graphic in or put labels on the post clinkshrink ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
