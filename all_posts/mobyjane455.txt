i thought i would put the few verses of one of my favorite poems on my blog this morning i thought of it last night and wondered how many know of it in this day and age it used to be that all newspapers in this country would publish at least one poem every day for inspiration and an uplift to the spirit but somewhere poetry changed with the new yorker i think i hate their idea of poetry with them , it became dark and brooding and self focused , and arrogant , more like a laundry list of disconnected elite phrases , until it no longer had much relevance to the human journey the house by the side of the road by sam walter foss there are hermit souls that live withdrawn in the peace of their self content there are souls , like stars , that dwell apart , in a fellowless firmament there are pioneer souls that blaze their paths where highways never ran but let me live by the side of the road and be a friend to man let me live in a house by the side of the road , where the race of men go by the men who are good and the men who are bad , as good and as bad as i i would not sit in the scorner s seat , or hurl the cynic s ban let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man i see from my house by the side of the road , by the side of the highway of life , the men who press with the ardor of hope , the men who are faint with the strife but i turn not away from their smiles nor their tears both parts of an infinite plan let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man i know there are brook gladdened meadows ahead and mountains of wearisome height that the road passes on through the long afternoon and stretches away to the night but still i rejoice when the travelers rejoice , and weep with the strangers that moan , nor live in my house by the side of the road like a man who dwells alone let me live in my house by the side of the road where the race of men go by they are good , they are bad , they are weak , they are strong , wise , foolish so am i then why should i sit in the scorner s seat or hurl the cynic s ban ? let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man
