it 's been a long , tough , week i apologize for stepping away from this blog and my tsr blog i simply have had no desire to write that happens sometimes when i'm feeling particularly hopeless , distracted , or overwhelmed feeling little to no control over the intrusive thoughts i 've been having has left me little to no motivation to share anything with anyone readers , callers , visitors anyone i prefer to write when i feel i have something to offer i do n't like focusing on the negative if i 've written about it hopelessness , intrusive thoughts , discouragement and it continues , i feel no need to rehash or restate the dilemma i 'd rather focus on facts what 's wrong and what can be done , or what i 've tried to do to make it better while i 've taken steps this week to improve my situation , feeling i have little worthwhile to offer right now continues sometimes , i just need to battle things through by myself i have n't felt like writing , but i have done some artwork i finished the following painting last night it 's called chaos burning they say a picture is worth a thousand words that sounds about right
