several readers were concerned after reading my september post , an interesting week , and asked for an update as i mentioned last month , i was wondering what was going on my experiences prior to september were very positive and exciting then , for one week something happened well , since that one week , everything has been going fine fortunately , in october , i only had a couple of days were my strength was slightly off but fortunately , it was only a minor issue and not enough to prohibit me from finishing my long exercise routines of minutes and , except for those two days , i have been as strong as before that fateful week in september in two months it will be four years without missing one day of exercises obsessive compulsive perhaps , but there is something to be said about the benefits of exercise and dutasteride working together the two have definitely helped me live a better life even though i have kennedy s disease on a separate note , i mentioned about a month ago that i was focusing a lot of my time on the editing of my book that continues to be a priority along with my kda responsibilities within the next few months , however , i expect to publish several research updates from the kda conference in education symposium that was held last week there is some exciting news that needs to be shared with all of you
