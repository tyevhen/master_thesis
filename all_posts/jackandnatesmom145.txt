nate 's language had stalled over the past few months , but right now it seems to be picking up again i am not naive enough to think that this is it , but i am enjoying it , that 's for sure food has always been the ultimate motivator for nate , as it is for many kiddos his first words revolved around food and any progress that occurs seems to be at mealtime he has been saying more forever , and eventually he did add cup what happened though is that he started identifying every object as cup and the other things he likes seem to start with c as well corn popcorn , chip , chicken , etc below you will hear him say more cup to start and then correct to more chip you can distinctly hear the ch sound in there not that big of a deal for most , but for us well , for us it 's almost tear worthy
