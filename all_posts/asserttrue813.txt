last night , i made an exciting discovery i discovered that you can convert data urls rfc to tinyurls , which means you can poke a small gif or png image or anything else that can be made into a data url into the tinyurl database for later recovery that means you can poke text , xml , html , or anything else that has a discrete mime type , into tinyurl and do it without violating their terms of service read on if you 're not familiar with how tinyurls work the folks at tinyurl com have a database when you send them a long url via the html form on their web site , they store that long url in their database and hand you back a short url later , you can point your browser at the tiny url the tinyurl folks take your incoming request , look at it , fetch the corresponding long url from the database , and redirect your browser to the long url address think about what this means , though in essence , you 're getting database storage for free , courtesy of tinyurl com of course , you ca n't just poke anything you want into their database according to the terms of service , the tinyurl service can only be used for urls but according to ietf rfc , data is a legitimate scheme and data urls are bonafide urls and the html spec section specifically mentions data urls i take this to mean data urls are in fact urls , and can therefore be stored at tinyurl com without violating the tinyurl terms of service this leads to an interesting use case or two traditionally , people have talked about data urls in the context of encoding small gif images and such data urls never caught on , because ie and earlier provided poor support for them , and even today , ie which does support some data urls imposes security constraints that make it hard to ie users to deal with all possible varieties of data url but ie is the exception all other modern browsers have built in support for data urls it 's important to understand , you are n't limited to using data urls to express just tiny images anything that can be urlencoded and that has a well known mime type can be expressed as a data url here is a javascript function for converting html markup to a data url function todataurl html convert markup to a data url var preamble data text html charset utf , var escapedstring escape html return preamble escapedstring try this simple experiment run the above code in the firebug console if you use the firebug extension for firefox , passing it an argument of html document documentelement innerhtml html which will give you the data url for the currently visible page of course , if you try to navigate to the resulting data url , it may not render correctly if the page contains references to external resources scripts , css , etc using relative urls , because now the host has changed and the relative urls wo n't work even so , you should at least be able to see all the page 's text content , with any inlined styles rendered correctly still not getting it ? try going to the following url open it in a new window http tinyurl com cuga note to internet explorer users do n't expect this to work in your browser you should see the web page for ietf 's rfc however , note carefully , you 're not visiting the ietf site look in your browser 's address bar it 's a data url the entire page is stored at tinyurl com and is being delivered out of their database obviously i do n't advocate storing other people 's web content at tinyurl com this was just a quick example to illustrate the technique one thing that 's quite interesting to me is that unlike other url rewriting services , the tinyurl folks do n't seem to mind if your url is quite long i have n't discovered the upper limit yet what you 'll find , i think , is that the practical upper limit is set by your browser i seem to recall that mozilla has a hard limit of k on data url length someone please correct me it 's browser implementation dependent here are some possible use cases for tinyurl data url usage encode a longer than characters comment that you want to point twitter followers to storing it at tinyurl means you do n't have to host the comment on your own site you could create simple blog pages that only come from tinyurl 's database domainless hosting you could encode arbitrary xml fragments as data urls and store them in tinyurl , then retrieve them as needed via greasemonkey ajax calls this would be a cool way to store svg images you could passivate javascript objects as json , convert json objects to data urls , and store them in the tinyurl database for later use i'm sure there are many other possibilities maybe you can post some in a comment on this blog ? someone will say but is n't tinypaste or shorttext com designed for exactly this sort of thing ? why use tinyurl ? the answer is , with tinyurl , you get back the actual resource , not a web page containing a bunch of ads and css and other cruft wrappering your content with data urls , the url is the content please retweet this if you find the idea interesting , and let me know what you decide to build with it of course , after this blog , tinyurl folks may decide to modify their terms of service but let 's hope not
