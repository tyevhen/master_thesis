it became clear last week that the mental health system in america remains desperately broken three families are mourning and trying to heal this week in the aftermath of violence , injuries , and death apparently the results of untreated mental illness the family of patrick bedell , the man who opened fire on two guards at the pentagon last week released this statement we are devastated as a family by the news from yesterday to the outside world , this tragedy is the first and only thing they will know of patrick to us , he was a beloved son , brother , grandson , nephew and cousin we may never know why he made this terrible decision one thing is clear though his actions were caused by an illness and not a defective character from the gilroy dispatch the guards were injured in the shooting while bedell was shot and killed halfway across the country , another mentally ill man was found guilty in the murder of an iowa football coach mark becker believed his former coach , ed thomas , was satan and thought he was protecting the community by killing him he had been released from a three day stay at a local psychiatric facility the day before the murder from the desmoines register the defendant 's mother , joan becker , who had testified about her son 's disturbing struggles with mental illness , thanked the jurors for serving on a difficult trial even though she disagreed with their verdict our son mark would never have taken the life of another person in his sane mind , she said ed thomas was a victim of a victim although mark and we as his parents attempted to go through all the proper channels to get mark the mental health treatment he desperately needed , the system failed miserably one has to wonder , if mental illnesses were treated with as much respect , knowledge , and priority as other life threatening illnesses , would these families be mourning today ?
