so , i 've been busy with some smaller crocheting projects actually they were both projects that started out of necessity i started crocheting playfood to give as birthday gifts a few months back i love handmade gifts i know that not everyone appreciates them , but i find a gift made by someone 's hands and with their precious time is often a gift filled with love and thought my dishcloths were in such a sorry , threadbare , stained state that i really felt the necessity to replace some of them hence , i started crocheting the playfood and found it so much fun that i made some more for lily as well as for some of my friends' children and then i started having fun making all kinds of different colored dishcloths did you know that it 's so much more fun to wash dishes when you 're using a pretty dishcloth ? really , it is ! anyway , i 've been trying to tuck some time for crocheting into my days here and there admittedly , it 's going to become more difficult to find the time as it gets nicer outside and the outdoor work consumes most of my extra minutes but until then i 'll happily stitch along it 's therapy for my soul ! and i 've also been fighting the crazy idea of opening an etsy shop you know , with all the extra time i have ! have a great weekend !
