i have found that being continously anxious can be an emotional magnifier since i'm keyed up all the time , i overreact to situations other people would handle more calmly for example , when a friend arrives a half hour late , most people would find that irritating but not a huge deal for me , ever worrying and always on , the emotion is amplified , and i make a late arrival much more of an issue than it should be ! so calming my anxiety is key to not overreacting in all other aspects of life
