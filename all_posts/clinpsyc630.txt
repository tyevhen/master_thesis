i ve now read through the latest iraq mortality study the methods were quite similar to the study published in and seem solid i ll admit i m not an expert in epidemiological methods , but my limited knowledge of cluster sampling jives well with what they did a more informed discussion of the article s methods , with rebuttals to many criticisms , can be found here i would imagine that the same potential criticisms and comments would apply in the present study some of you may wonder why is this even being discussed on a clinical psychology and psychiatry site ? maybe because people dying in droves is much more important than anything currently happening in psychology or psychiatry i suggest all of you pay attention to this study and watch what the media does with it
