i am on a flight on the way home from a business trip i get very lonely on business trips as my colleagues all have family they miss , they ring their husbands , wives and children they all look forward to going home where i relish their company and wish i could spend more time working with other people i contacted my ex at the airport , for the first time in years i have missed him a lot recently despite it being more than five years since we went our separate ways i still have not felt close to anyone else i have dated a few people in fact i have a date on friday but i have never felt so close and so relaxed with anyone else the closeness i felt through my sexual relationship with him has never been rivalled he was my first love and i doubt i will ever feel the same way again i have given up hoping i have often heard people say that when a man wants sex , his desire is driven by the need to spread his genes far and wide when a woman wants sex , she looks for a man who will protect her and her children for life it seems so obvious when you write it down but i had never thought about it so clearly before my ex was socially competent , he protected me in social situations , i could go along with him and i knew that because he was so popular and perfect in my eyes i would always be accepted i am going to see harry potter on friday for a sort of date i am going with a nice man but i am not attracted to him i wish i was as i do not want to be on my own anymore yesterday i was walking along the beach as it was getting dark for a while i thought i was just going to keep walking and never return i wanted to just walk across europe , living a simple life on the streets alternatively , i thought of just walking out into the sea and drowning these thoughts were so much less disturbing than the thought of continuing life within my torturous mind i am thinking of stopping the aripiprazole again this time i will discuss it with my psychiatrist and maybe think about going back on a low dose of quetiapine instead i still do not feel myself , my brain is not functioning how it use to i phase out as people talk to me i cannot remember the beginning of the sentence as they reach the end they are just all words which mean nothing , i feel vacant and detached from others this does not help my loneliness i just want to be one of the crowd nothing special , nothing extraordinary , just a part of a group of friends who i can feel comfortable with and who i can relate to is this too much to ask ? i visited a cathedral today i was looking to feel wanted and loved it worked for a while and i am feeling better than i did yesterday i started praying that i would die soon i want god to take me rather than someone else who had something to live for in the end i felt better , a little more wanted and again came back to the realisation that only i can help myself i cannot imagine a future alone and i cannot imagine a future with another i wonder as i sit on this flight across europe , would those people sitting in front of me , the man next to me or those behind care or try to help if they knew how i felt and what i was typing ! how can i reach out to the kind people around me ? i long to be free free from the inner voice which criticises every move ! you smell , you have hairy armpits and hairy legs , your hair is a mess , you are incompetent at your job , you put other out , you are fat , unfit , incompetent , everyone thinks you are stupid , people laugh at you and hate you , you are ugly , you are a waste of space , you are a couch potato , you live in a mess , you should cancel going out on saturday night to make space for someone who others want to see , you are selfish , mean inconsiderate and get on everyone s nerves , you are a waste of space and the world would be a better place without you go on kill yourself , you are a burden of your parents and your sisters think you are a recluse , what is the point how can i get out of this mess ? i want life to return to the days before things went wrong with my ex he could not cope with my clinginess and depression when ithought he loved me i never felt things were so bad i believed no matter what the rest of the world thought of me i would always have him then he left me with no discussion , no hints and no time to get use to the idea
