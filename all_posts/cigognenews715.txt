there is a new book out by a specialist in add which claims that there are at least five different kinds of add , each diagnosis peculiar to certain kinds of individuals i often wonder what do these specialists believe is actually in the brain are there five different disease forms of add ? perhaps some genetic and some not ? are there five different areas involved in different kinds of add ? i do n't think so the brain is complicated but it is not mystical , holding five different aspects of the same disease in its reservoir add is first and foremost a failure of repression there are not many different kinds of repression there is one mediated by various kinds of neuroinhibitors it is pain that overwhelms frontal cortical function and fragments its abilities to contain impulses from below certainly , there are differences in personality so that some manifest add in one fashion while others manifest it in another but it is still add at its base and it all can be treated in the same way diminish the power of deep lying imprinted pain by reliving early traumas , allowing the frontal cortex to develop and control because it is no longer bombarded by lower level shattering input it all depends on how severe the early trauma was that compromised the development of the frontal cortex , and how much cortical tissue was implicated as i discussed elsewhere , very early severe trauma can leave a cortex so impaired that the person is awash in impulses which cannot be controlled so that he is violent and can kill in any case , the deficit is not just psychological it is a deficiency in frontal tissue when someone like this is described as not having all his marbles , now we know what that means it should read , not having all his frontal marble
