she tells me i may just have to accept it at least it 's just fatigue at least my mood is still okay it could be worse i could have fatigue and a low mood i could have fatigue , a low mood , and pain it could be worse it could be worse , but who likes to hear that ? my therapist is right , of course we 've looked , and looked , and looked for a cause behind this year battle with fatigue i have a bit of sleep apnea , but the cure for that did n't cure the fatigue it was n't low vitamin d , which was also a hope ? i do n't have any screwed up labs everything is normal or better than normal i'm just tired , and the only cause left is depression of course , i do n't want to accept that i do n't want to accept depression as the cause after all , if depression is the cause , it means there 's nothing left to do i'm taking meds , which are certainly working for everything but the fatigue so i'm not going to change those i'm doing the best i can to work and play around the morass what else can i do but accept ? but this is hard to accept it would be so much easier if something was physically wrong ! but as she pointed out , there is something wrong i have depression i'm fatigued it 's a symptom of depression i need more sleep than most everyone i know i'm in good shape , yet i need to sleep during the day sometimes my body aches with fatigue if i ca n't lie down it 's frustrating it sucks and yet , i know , it could be worse but acceptance ? i do n't know if i'm there yet
