this month 's psychiatric times continues the discussion registration required about the ny times article on psychotherapy that dinah and readers discussed on april this time , our colleague , ron pies md , authored this article which deconstructs the myths perpetrated in the nyt article , which interviewed a med check doctor who found it sad that his patients found him to be important to them in their lives read the article for the full flavor i'm glad that ron pointed out as we have that the mojtabai and olfson article which implied that only of us outpatient psychiatrists provide psychotherapy was a misleading statistic why ? because they did not consider brief psychotherapy sessions minutes or less to be classified as psychotherapy for their session thus , a min is considered psychotherapy , but a min would not be considered so , even though the ama 's cpt manual defines it as psychotherapy also , brief and supportive forms of psychotherapy are often given even when only a med check is billed nonetheless , the sound bite from that article has been only of psychiatrists do psychotherapy it just ai n't true as mark twain said , there are three kinds of lies lies , damned lies and statistics
