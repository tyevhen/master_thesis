so i'm sitting in dunkin donuts having an apple fritter when this nice cleancut young guy walks up to me and says , you should be eating a muffin i looked at him he was nicely but casually dressed , in an old navy gap kind of way i was sure i did n't know him pardon ? i said dr ellen says you should be eating a muffin she compared a bagel with cream cheese to an egg mcmuffin , and said the muffin was better at this point i was rather intrigued he engaged me in a long discussion of nutrition , exercise , the importance of balance in life he was animated , gestured a bit , talked a lot but not too loud or fast you 're doctor , are n't you ? you seem nice he said ok , that spooked me a bit because i had n't told him anything at all about myself i admitted i was a doctor then he went on to tell me about his family aging mother caring for father with alzheimer 's , multiple brothers and sisters overly involved in his life and i began to catch the drift that he was having a bit of trouble breaking away from the conversation i was n't surprised when he mentioned he had bipolar disorder by this time i was expecting it you 're a psychiatrist , are n't you ? he said ok , spooked again i definitely did n't mention i was a psychiatrist i know i 've never seen this guy before uh , yeah , i said i thought so you seem nice he told me about his psychiatrist someone i know , a non shrink rap colleague of mine , his clinic not too far away from my prison he handed me a religious brochure , told me to keep doing what you 're doing , god bless you , and then left he promised to say hi to his psychiatrist for me i still do n't know how he pegged me as a psychiatrist i guess i eat donuts like a psychiatrist
