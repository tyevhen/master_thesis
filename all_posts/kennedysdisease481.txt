it seems hard to believe that it has been eighteen months since i began taking dutasteride avodart since my last report i have averaged minutes for the every other day long exercise program and minutes for the short ones i have exercised every day for the last years it sure sounds like an addiction to me since i began taking dutasteride i have also been keeping a daily journal of my experiences i enjoy reading about my initial days of taking it i continue to feel very positive about dutasteride for me , it works , and people that know me also continue to comment on how it appears to be helping one of the most significant benefits has been the consistency of life i have been experiencing where i use to have up and down days strength weakness , the last eighteen months have been level steady as she goes except for a couple of times where i had a cold or some other health issue for example , in june i had an allergic reaction to something and the doctor gave me a steroid shot for about thirty hours after the shot , i noticed a slight weakness it taught me to always explain to any doctor how kennedy s disease works and what to watch out for in regards to potential adverse reactions when treating unrelated conditions more important , i feel as strong or as close to as strong as i did eighteen months ago i have seen no degradation in my capabilities for that , i am most thankful
