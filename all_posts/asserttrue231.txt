young people today do n't realize what has happened to the u s economy over the past years their sense of what 's normal is shaped by current reality , not the reality their parents grew up in they do n't know how things were how prosperous america used to be when i think back on what my life was like in , it horrifies me to see how badly the economic environment has deteriorated since then let me put try to put it in concrete terms the value of the dollar over time in this graph , equals in , a dollar was times as powerful as in four years out of college , i was making , a year in which does n't sound like a lot of money , right ? well , consider how i was living at the time i had bought a nearly new three years old two bedroom house on two acres of wooded land in north carolina , for , i bought a new chevy truck for i owned a year old cessna , which i 'd bought from a delta pilot for , i was easily able to make the monthly payments on all these items the combined payments came to a little over a month today , the new chevy truck would cost , the average home price in the north carolina town i lived in is now , a nine year old cessna can be had for , basically , everything costs to times more now to live the same lifestyle today that i lived in , four years out of college , would require an income of at least , in dollars few recent grads make anywhere near that amount life was good in america in it was really easy to live really well on not much money what can i say ? things have changed
