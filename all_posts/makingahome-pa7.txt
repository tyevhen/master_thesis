i am having so much fun updating our house lately , i 've been a little mentally stressed not because of all of the work work does n't scare me it 's the lack of a proper kitchen since our current remodel is the kitchen everything is kind of scattered about , so when i need a mixing spoon or a knife or a bowl or this or that , i have to search for it thankfully our home is small and i 've just kind of shifted everything into the living room and onto the kitchen table but still i guess i did n't realize how much my life revolves around my kitchen until it was in a state of disarray i 've heard others speak of this when they 've done a kitchen remodel however , it will be fabulous when it 's finished it will be a kitchen that is still tiny , but so very much me butcher block white cabinets open shelving i'm going for cozy and quaint , which is what i pretty much go for in all of my decorating but mixed in with all of that remodeling goodness , we 've had quite a busy summer we visited our best friends in charleston , sc we had one of my oldest friends from childhood and her daughter who also happens to be lily 's age come stay with us for a while we have had cake decorating class and electronics class and then there is the gardening and animal care that is part of our everyday life oh , and we became the owner of kittens two of them what a full summer we 've had so far
