hi friends ! a week and a half ago paige left her babyhood behind and began sleeping in a big girl bed in her new big girl room i was given the advice to start her in a big bed sooner than later so she does n't feel competition with the baby this made sense to me , so we went ahead and did it we excitedly ordered the furniture when she was with us at the store she seemed to like climbing up onto the bed and looking around from up high we got to work back home and replaced the ugly carpet in the room with oak wood flooring to match her old room after much deliberation , we decided to paint the room the same color as her old one i was gonna do a melon orangey pink color but it just did n't feel right anyhoo , the day the bed was delivered was quite exciting and she took ownership right away she kept saying big girl room ! and my bed ! we 'd talked about getting her new room for quite a while so i know she was ready for it a few days later , when it was time for her to sleep in her bed for the first time , chris took her crib apart before he did , we had paige go in the room and say thank you for being such a good crib and to say bye bye she patted the crib and said bye bye and thank you she also gave it a kiss , which made my throat tighten we explained that it 's a baby 's bed and she 's not a baby anymore so it had to go to a baby who needed it of course , we are keeping it and storing it for the next baby after her goodbyes , i took her downstairs and chris hid the crib in our closet when she came back up to get ready for bed , she went in the old room and noticed the crib was gone and looked puzzled i said remember ? crib had to go to baby 's house ! and she said oh and sort of shrugged and went about her evening like nothing happened this was a nice trick for her to visually see that the crib was no longer an option for sleeping we went about our normal routine just in her new room instead she was thrilled to sleep in her new room and she slept great ! i was terrified she 'd keep getting up or would cry , etc but she just fell asleep like normal phew ! another milestone under her belt and mine i 'll admit , i cried a little bit but i'm so proud of our girl she 's taking all these changes in stride and that 's a huge deal hooray ! owl is in the tree ! ! ! ! tree ! ! ! ! save
