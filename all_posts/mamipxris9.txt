mona is weeks tomorrow and i have always co slept so many people have different views on co sleeping , but personally i love it i think i began to love it because i was breastfeeding and it was easier to just pop her back into my bed once she had finished i also found that she sleeps so much better when i'm next to her , i can put her crib next to my bed and lay her in it and she just wo n't settle i definitely think that if you breastfeed your baby becomes very attached to you and always want to be around you and as close to you as possible it 's with co sleeping some say you will seriously regret it as it will be hard to get them out of your bed when they 're older but i do n't see the stress i mean they 're only this small for a short time so you may as well cherish these moments and memories because before you know it your baby girl boy will be at the age they do n't want mummy cuddles anymore !
