a couple of years ago , i wrote a post about how patients often ask me if they or something they are feeling or something they are doing is normal i went on to ramble about how normal is boring , and why would anyone want to be normal iq , tuna fish for lunch , you name it people still ask me if they are normal i 've taken to responding i have no idea what 'normal' means i still have no idea why anyone would want to be normal in psychiatry , we often ask why now ? why are you seeking help for your problem today ? you may want to know why i'm blogging about normal today ah , the answer to that is easy my friend patty put the above cartoon on her facebook page and what better graphic for a shrink rap post ? is it normal to blog about facebook cartoons ?
