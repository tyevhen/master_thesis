several readers have written to ask how i am doing i reported a few weeks ago that my arm strength and my neck weakness and pain were concerns arms hands shoulders fortunately , about a week ago my arm strength returned i believe i am close to back whew ! i was really beginning to wonder what happened i woke up on february and noticed the difference immediately what happened this time was different than what i call the slide neck and , since i changed my hours sitting in front of my pc , my neck has recovered it is about of what it was last fall , but that is a lot better than just a month ago i now only spend an hour at a time in the office and then i take a break it has made all the difference in the world i also have added a couple more neck exercises to my daily routine as long as i continue to be smart i should be all right other thoughts my leg strength continues to be good and that is a blessing and fortunately , i have not had any joint pain in many months my exercise program is going well now that my arm strength has returned i average minutes every other day and minutes on the in between days thanks for your concerns , advice and support
