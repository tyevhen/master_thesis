for those of you who came here to read a post about my little recent adventure , i thought better of it and withdrew the piece i want to consult my wife and editor , kathleen , as to whether my sociopolitical musings deserve a wider audience than chaffin cargo cult members who are also entitled to a discount on this blog , which means that if you only read of a day 's post you are nevertheless credited with on the chaffin worship i mean workshop meter now for sunday 's sonnet stuntman exchange your parachute for a medicine ball and bare your vital organs to the sky waves whiten on rocks below , so cartoon small you think of the roadrunner speeding by a bungie strap secures your lower legs , its far end fades into the coastal mist you trust the gaffers to guard against snags then cross the edge like a somnambulist and fall and fall further than satan fell from heaven , though he lacked a union card , but you 're insured and do n't believe in hell unless it 's in the script it is n't hard to die so long as you are paid to die and rise again in the director 's eye unpublished i'm too sleep deprived to feel anything , a consequence of my brush with the motorcycle club but underlying that patina of exhaustion lives an ache worth kilorat sleepily thine , ce
