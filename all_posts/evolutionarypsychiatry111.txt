foster the people , do n't stop right click to open in new tab time is flying by and my clinic is very busy , and the phone is ringing off the hook , but i did want to take a moment to list the planned upcoming talks and panels for the year so far march at paleofx i will be on a panel about addressing the psychology of change very excited to have a reason to go down to austin for a long weekend , as it is my home town and where many of my lifelong friends live may rd at the massachusetts psychiatric society geriatric interest group meeting in wellesley , massachusetts i 'll be doing a talk for psychiatrists who specialize in treating the elderly on evolutionary medicine and alzheimer 's disease i'm thrilled for this opportunity to speak to my peers , as i 've trained in conservative institutions , and i have the tendency to believe that any psychiatrist who reads my blog will think i'm a crackpot for this reason i'm sure the talk will be squeaky clean with regards to literature references and the best accuracy i can muster , and hopefully exciting and thought provoking for the attendees august at the ancestral health symposium in cambridge i 'll be doing a short presentation and will really enjoy seeing all my paleosphere friends again i have also been asked about possibly speaking for the boston area paleo interest group perhaps in the spring but i believe we were going to regroup after holidays winter , as it is nearly useless making plans when there might be a big snowstorm ironically the only one we 've had was last october , the day before i spoke at harvard law school ! my plan for upcoming blog topics finally , at long last , for real , the thyroid , with a focus on psychiatric implications the first in this series may even come tonight but more likely tomorrow and then i plan to take on that interesting alt med diagnosis known as adrenal fatigue i still have stacks of other interesting papers , plus the new ones that come up always more interesting things than i could possibly have time to look into and a number of books that need book reviews any tremendously wealthy reader willing to sponsor a year 's salary so i can catch up is more than welcome to do so of course then i would be spoiled for any future clinical endeavors and lose my usefulness as an active , front lines interpreter of the literature , so perhaps i'm much better off with the status quo
