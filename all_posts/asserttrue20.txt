addendum my father died a horrible death of lung cancer there 's plenty of cancer in my family and i expect to die of it myself someday but i'm still against a cancer moonshot recently , joe biden called for a moonshot to cure cancer without dwelling on the fact that we 've already had one failed moonshot to cure cancer nixon 's , which is still underway , i 'd like to explain why i think the new call for a hail mary pass on cancer is just plain poor public policy it 's bad policy , first of all , because it reflects muddled thinking cancer is not one disease it 's a multiplicity of complex , disparate conditions with distinct etiologies insert much longer discussion here you might as well declare war on disease itself but beyond that , we should be clear on why we 're choosing to attack cancer is it because we want to increase human life expectancy ? is it because we want to reduce suffering ? yes and yes , i presume what if we could achieve both of those goals more easily , which is to say in quicker fashion , less expensively , and with greater likelihood of success , by pursuing other agendas ? if resources are scarce so that we have to choose moonshots carefully , should n't we go for the low hanging fruit first ? life expectancy will not increase dramatically if we find a cure for cancer the cdc has known for a long time that total elimination of cancer , if it happened tomorrow , would increase american life expectancy by only years see my earlier post , taeuber 's paradox and the life expectancy brick wall , for details while this is not a trivial increase , it merely brings u s life expectancy up to where the rest of the oecd countries already are the u s does have a life expectancy problem , but it is not shared equally across all segments of society life expectancy usa at age versus income as a percentage of the federal poverty level from overcoming obstacles to health , robert wood johnson foundation click to enlarge the highest earning americans defined here as those making in excess of times the federal poverty level are already living years women to years men longer than the lowest earning americans those earning less than the federal poverty level eliminating this gap or the majority of it would at least be equivalent to curing cancer , in terms of boosting life expectancy it would arguably be better than curing cancer , in terms of reducing human suffering , because cancer suffering lasts a comparatively short time , whereas the depression , chronic illness , and other down sides to economic privation last decades percent of adults in poor fair health usa versus income as a percentage of the federal poverty level from overcoming obstacles to health , robert wood johnson foundation click to enlarge speaking of chronic illness many studies have shown that as income levels go down , chronic illness rates for diabetes , heart disease , etc go up , and as the above graph indicates , this is not an effect limited to a particular race it cuts across ethnicities the above graph suggests that a moonshot aimed at increasing economic wellbeing would also , in effect , be a health moonshot , potentially people who are economically better off tend to be physically better off if you want to make a dent in heart disease or diabetes , start by getting people 's incomes up a cancer moonshot transfers money to a relatively elite cadre of scientists and doctors and their institutions a prosperity moonshot puts money in the hands of ordinary people how do we do it ? how would we do a prosperity moonshot ? let 's look at how not to do it the federal reserve has done a moonshot , since , called quantitative easing , a program in which federal dollars are devoted to buying back mortgages and treasury debt and by the way , if trillion allocated to a single project does n't qualify as a moonshot , i do n't know what does it 's now fairly well accepted by economists that the main effect of the qe moonshot project has been to move risk money out of the bond market , into the broader equities market this has resulted in innumerable pointless stock buyback programs and a general increase in wealth inequality the intended goal of getting banks to lend more money and corporations to grow their businesses has not happened lawrence h summers governments , meanwhile , have been tightening their belts , cutting off fiscal flows via austerity programs when they should actually be stimulating the economy through deficit spending as former u s treasury secretary lawrence h summers puts it the reality is that it s government s responsibility to be countercyclical that when private saving is substantially exceeding private investment , that is precisely when government should be borrowing and investing now is just such a time in fact , the timing could n't be better as summers said in a recent interview this is a moment when the united states can borrow money at less than percent for years , in a currency we print ourselves it is a moment when materials costs are extraordinarily low it is a moment when construction unemployment rates remain high has there ever been a better moment to fix laguardia or kennedy airport ? it is crazy that at a moment like this , the united states has the lowest rate of federal infrastructure investment , relative to the economy , that we ve had since and on a net basis that is , taking into account depreciation we re essentially not investing at all this is the perfect time to be investing in rebuilding our infrastructure , forgiving student debt or extending payback terms indefinitely , and yes , getting people out of poverty by direct grants , if necessary we desperately need to see a drop in obesity which is correlated to low income , a drop in pain killer suicide rates , less diabetes , less alcoholism , less heart disease , less mental illness we need to see health care costs start trending the other way we can achieve that as a side benefit of doing a prosperity moonshot and get a boost in life expectancy along the way the hard way to achieve longer life expectancy and lift the economy is to do a cancer moonshot we tried that once , already it did n't work it 's not likely to work this time either let 's get out of moonshot thinking mode we have serious work to do we have a country full of people who want and deserve to earn more money , we have out of control health care costs , and we have a ton of decaying infrastructure to fix let 's go for the trifecta longer life expectancy , less suffering , and a healthier economy put money in the hands of ordinary people presidential candidates , please discuss buy my books they 're good i promise
