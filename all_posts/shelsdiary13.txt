the boy wants to read my blog he 's pestered me about getting the url ever since we first started dating i have always been reluctant to share it with him because i've written so much scary stuff he says he feels i'm keeping something from him and he 's kinda right i'm keeping my history of disastrous dates , douche bag dudes and days of depression from him and rightly flippin' so ! it 's funny in relationships at the beginning you do your very best for this lovely new person to see you in the best light possible you attempt to keep the crazy away , you dress up for film nights and wash your sheets before every potential sleep over oh how things change nearly one year and two holidays on , smelling each others morning breath , talking about toilet things and even spot picking is acceptable ! if i can be so free and easy with all those gross relationship things then why oh why am i so reluctant to share my blog posts that i thought at one time perfectly acceptable to share with the rest of the internet accessible world ? i think it 's good to be a bit aloof i think it 's important to keep an air of loveliness in your relationship i may have let my guard down on some weird couple behaviours but i do have my limits , limits that i know many of my friends do not maybe me not wanting to share my posts is one of those limits ? maybe i want him to continue to think of me as this cool , older woman haha and not a sad , pathetic nearly thirty most likely , straight after reading my latest entry , he 'll realise i actually do n't harbour any juicy secrets at all , that all i really write about is chick lit so boring i hope
