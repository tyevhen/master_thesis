sometimes i feel like i write with such vagueness i try to give as solid advice as i can , and to share as specifically as i'm able to what i 've learned about unschooling by doing it but when i look back at a lot of what i 've written , sometimes i find myself thinking well yeah , what i'm saying is the truth as i see it , but is it specific enough to actually be helpful ? i'm guessing it is or people would n't read and like it , but sometimes i look at some of the other blogs out there , and admire how much they talk about goals ! and steps to doing better at things ! and so much detailed advice ! that envy never lasts though because when you 're writing about unschooling , how can you say this is how you do it , no matter what specific it you 're talking about ? i can share what 's worked in my own life , how i 've approached learning myself , and that can be interesting and helpful for others , just as my reading about the experiences of others uncolleging can be helpful for me right now but beyond that , unschooling is kind of all about figuring things out for yourself as many ideas and resources and advice as i , or anyone else , shares , as much expertise on unschooling life learning uncollegeing and beyond any person claims to have or not have , ultimately it 's just a vision of the possibilities available to you and your family if we 're to recognize how different each person and each family and each community is , we have to quickly realize that the more specific we get in talking about the how 's , the less people are likely to find that actually works for them so i guess i 'll just continue writing vaguely , or just talking about the very specific ways that have worked for me , personally because anything else , though it might make a more impressive post on occasion , just does n't do justice to the truly personalized personalized journey that is unschooling you might also like learning advice from a learning life favorite unschooling posts on this blog of learning by doing education made real unschooling for adults linkwithin
