why does blogger ask this ? do i look like a robot ? do i act like a robot ? do i sound like a robot ? no ! why ? because i am not a robot i'm sorry the prove you 're not a robot demand for blog commenters is sometimes hard to complete unfortunately , this is a blogger issue , and not something we control it makes shrink rappers prove we are not robots as well , and sometimes i find the mere implication a bit annoying oh , but it was fun writing this post
