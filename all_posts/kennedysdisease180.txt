yesterday 's kda chat room guest was andrew lieberman , md , phd , from the university of michigan he is a member of the kennedy 's disease association scientific review board he is also a strong supporter and an advocate of our association 's work dr lieberman is one of my favorite guests because he has a way of explaining current research that everyone can understand he also has a lot of energy and a great sense of humor that helps keep the chat room visitors involved an interesting bit of information we learned was that researchers test a mouse 's strength with a paw pressure gauge dr lieberman was then asked how they actually do the test he said that they have a grip strength meter that tests how long a mouse hangs on to a triangular metal bar before releasing it then , dr lieberman commented that it either shows how much weaker a mouse is with kennedy 's disease , or how much smarter they are than healthy mice i loved that response i would like to believe that the kennedy 's disease mice are just smarter they have probably read my smart exercise guide and are adhering to the rule dr lieberman also mentioned that his lab was working with a chemical biologist to test the interaction of certain molecules with mutated cells so far , they have tested over , molecules in an attempt to find one that interacts positively with cells i cannot remember exactly , but i believe he said that the lab could test different molecules at one time if that number was correct , that works out to be iterations pretty amazing we also chatted a little about the michigan state and university of michigan studies on which came first , the chicken or the egg no , not really , it is a study to determine if the muscle cells play as an important role as the motor neurons in mice with kennedy 's disease for many years , the focus has been on the motor neurons they degrade and die and that causes the muscles to waste away in this theory , it appears that the muscles might begin to waste first or at a similar rate to the motor neurons sorry , i do not believe i did this study justice with my explanation dr lieberman also corrected an assumption i had about the results of the dr subue et al clinical trials according to dr lieberman , the japanese clinical trials show some positive results if the treatment began early in the progression cycle within the first ten years of onset this also corresponds with some of the testing of igf on mice models if igf for muscles is administered pre symptoms , it appears to be very effective we old codgers just cannot catch a break ! the chat room transcript should be available on the kda website around mid week if you get a chance , read the transcript the section from until am there is some good stuff in there
