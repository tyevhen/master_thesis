this morning i had my third treatment , and man it was strong ! i felt pretty damn fuzzy afterwards you had a good seizure , said the nurse i did n't know i was being graded now , as a depressive , i wonder if my seizures will ever be good enough do n't they know how we twist such statements ? i'm already blaming the patient for having inadequate seizures i did notice that after the last treatmen my muscles ached , especially in my abdomen the doctors reassured me this was not from the seizure but from the muscle inhibitor , succinyl choline , which first causes muscles to contract before they relax i expect i 'll ache even more tomorrow one possible sign of improvement is that i wrote two poems yesterday , a love poem for valentine 's day and the one below i wo n't post the love poem until kathleen receives it in the mail the poem below came after reading a good bit of charles simic i wanted a regular rhythm iambic trimeter because i was in motion on a bus and simic 's rhythms are at best eccentric but i love his honesty lines composed on a san francisco bus your ear buds counteract the threat of close contact here in the cell phone desert the world between your ears that we 're not privy to expands and wo n't contract the genie fled the lamp your lips are not sewn shut , they 're working very hard you rattle in portuguese about the price of beets but cannot hear the beggar and need not meet his eyes nor try to avert your gaze your world is tailor made charles simic talks to mirrors and trees and clocks and gets away with it like strand shaving his beard grown by somebody else but i 've heard better verse while captive on a bus a man was lecturing us that america was born with castor and pollux rising which meant we 'd always be competing for attention a nation of teenage clowns in charge of nuclear silos made perfect sense to me that man got a free ride no justice on a bus where public peace must trump puritan righteousness no driver wants to risk his life and liberty to shut a madman up no need to envy , either , he paid in other ways no one gets a free ride i think we have to trust karmic economy or sanity 's a bust all the years i spent concentrating language , were they , you think , well spent ? most poetry is forgettable as a four legged dog , pulitzer prize or not my personal albatross is that this art should be something that wo n't wash off with salt and terrycloth when all one really needs for entry is a pen since gemini is rising let p t barnum sing with charles h bukowski for literary bling there is no competition ? not in the yank tradition the only unfortunate occurrence today was that not long after i returned home from ect , my middle daughter called , quickly became incensed and hung up on me she likely will blame me for her behavior sometimes manners seem to degenerate in proportion to the degree of kinship one shares with the target with that edisonian glow , ce
