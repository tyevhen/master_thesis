a couple of months ago , i was walking through the neighborhood when suddenly i found myself flat , face down on the sidewalk with skinned knees and hands and the wind knocked out of me i honestly have no idea how this happened except that i remember twisting my ankle a bit and the ground was pretty steep but it was such a bizarre feeling to go from upright and confident to sprawled on the ground , humiliated with no warning whatsoever i feel like this is a good image of relapsing in mental illness my therapist says they are n't relapses so much as dips in moods , and i guess she 's right , but i guess i look at myself as being on an upward trajectory from where i was a year and a half ago in the complete worst shape of my life ever since then , i 've been desperate to get better and return to a proper functioning state it 's discouraging , frustrating , and confusing when i find myself flat on my face again , usually because of the same anxieties , hurts , or struggles that i 've grappled with for the last few years of my life i hate going back over and over to the same hurts , but i do n't know how to resolve them and move on either i guess that 's why therapy takes so long tonight , i fell flat on my face again emotionally , that is it was n't exactly an unexpected thing , i guess , seeing as i 've been stressed all day , but it sure felt like it came out of nowhere , grabbed me , and pulled me down to collide full force with the unaccomodating asphalt of depression i feel unbearably lonely and isolated from all of my friends i feel like nobody cares i do n't know for the life of me how to bridge that gap i feel stupid for falling for yet another guy who does n't like me back and i'm frustrated that we ca n't have a relationship because i just want to experience this stupid romance thing for once in my life and i feel like i deserve love so i do n't know why it keeps being denied to me in the christian tradition , many people say that broken relationships are one of the major effects of the fall of mankind into sin , and they serve as a reminder that this is n't heaven and only god can love us purely , the way we desire i guess that 's all true , but it makes me so mad to realize it i just want to be happy for a while in my life is that too much to ask after all the shit that 's happened to me ? i want to fall in love without asking a million questions or being afraid that he 's not right and we 'll break up and i 'll be hurt i want to love a person without the millions of worst case scenarios my frightened mind starts running through to protect itself i want to stop obsessing about people who do n't care about me and be the one someone wants for a change preferably someone not creepy who i actually like back , may i add i do n't know if i'm so sad because i have n't been getting enough sleep or because of the stress or because i did n't take my pills at the right time probably a combination of all three but that frustrates me too why can i only be happy if there 's a delicate balance of factors fulfilled ? life does n't typically allow for you to get your nine hours of sleep , your pills before breakfast on an empty stomach , your other pills afterwards on a full one , your workload at a steady stream of just challenging enough and counselors are only there once a week to put a little band aid on the gaping hole that exists where your chest ought to be i guess i should n't be so pessimistic on a blog , but i ca n't stop thinking about the times when people actually were honest with me about their feelings and i realized that i'm not alone in feeling these horrible sad things sometimes one incident in particular happened just a couple of weeks ago my successful , popular , attractive friend mentioned something about being lonely sometimes of course i was sad for him , but i was also a bit relieved to know that even popular people feel lonely so i write all this sad , angsty rambling for you , dear readers , in case you are comforted in the same way i was by finding that you 're not alone ironically , i think we can all relate as humans because we all feel lonely sometimes
