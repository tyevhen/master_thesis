in the state of maryland , regulations require that patients seen in community mental health centers must see a physician every days for a review , unless they are not taking medications , in which case they must see a physician once every months it seems reasonable to me to say that a patient with a chronic disorder on medications should be seen times a year to have their status , medications , lab work , health issues , mental status exam , all reviewed and to make sure the medications are still working and indicated and not causing undo side effects at the psychiatrist 's discretion , patients can be seen more often , and patients who are having a problem are seen sooner every patient has an assigned therapist and it 's not unusual for a therapist to schedule someone to come in sooner than the day review if they are n't doing well when i see someone , i often start my note with here for day review it 's code to myself that it 's a routine visit to assess the continued necessity of the medications , and it 's a bit different than if i write seen for an emergency sister notes was walking naked on the golf course and the patient is complaining of auditory hallucinations so today i received an email informing me that the clinic is auditing charts to be sure the documentation fits with the cpt codes that are billed it 's a problem , we 're told , if the note says that the patient is being seen for a day review it implies that the visit is for paperwork , and that there is no medically necessary reason for the visit and i should n't do this so wait , the law requires that i see the patient every days , but if i write that that 's why the patient is here today , that 's a problem , because it 's legally required but does n't make the bar for being medically necessary ?
