in my last post i promised to tell the tale of the wild cucumber when i belonged to a sober backpacking group in my late thirties , before my back could no longer be packed , i earned the sobriquet nature boy for my indefatigable interest in wild things along with my uncanny ability to lead the lost back , cross country , to wherever they wished to return i have a compass in my head and know the lay of the land it 's a background software program i take for granted apparently many folks do n't have it nature boy is willing to sample anything that looks faintly edible , usually accompanied by spitting and washing of his mouth , occasionally by gustatory approval i have yet to find a poisonous plant that tastes good that would be fundamentally unfair , unless the devil has twisted creation more than i thought god would allow the wild cucumber is a new plant i learned here in norcal the plant 's common name gave me hope of sustenance , and i did n't run across any statements about its edibility in my guides besides , i love cucumbers english cucumbers , that is , the kind with ridges i watched the vines flower and mature their little white flowers arose on vertical stalks like crabs' eyes i waited for the fruit two weeks ago on a saturday , despite my soul killing depression , i suggested we hike to cabrillo point for an outing on the way to the beach i noticed wild cucumbers fruiting i picked one of the spiny fruits , broke it open , held it to my nose and took a bite it was extremely bitter , bitter beyond vanilla extract poured directly on your tongue i washed my mouth out repeatedly kathleen sniffed it as well , but she swore it never touched her lip two days later , monday morning , kathleen awoke with a reddened philtrum which later peeled my nose was red as well , and in a few days my philtrum , cheek and nose all began to peel it 's only just healed our skin felt fiery when the eruption began we shook our heads trying to deduce a cause then it came to me delayed cellular immunity , as in poison oak on first exposure the body has to manufacture new antibodies to cope with a menace not previously encountered , first firing the cruder igm and afterwards the more specialized igg a hr delay between exposure and symptoms was about right for this scenario i must have kissed kathleen with the antigen still on my lip for her to have been affected beware of geeks bearing lips moral of the story ? craig , beware of putting things in your mouth most kids learn that before the age of three alas , all who know me know that i am socially retarded but adventurous as well , with little respect for my own safety for my daredevil behavior in high school i earned the nickname , crazy craig , despite my valedictorian academic status if i had been born into a primitive tribe most concerned with survival , it is possible my manic depressive disease would never have manifested itself nothing brings me out of depression if only temporarily so quickly as a life threatening situation , especially if someone i love is threatened freeway fist fights , unfortunately , have no survival value in our culture nevertheless do n't fuck with me or mine on the road i'm a bad enough driver without someone endangering me a month ago i chased a sports car down the street in san francisco , intent on pulling the asshole out the driver 's door to sweep the street with him unfortunately he escaped kathleen said fortunately there are so few opportunities to be a real man in our culture i tend to take the window for righteous action seriously if life is incarnation and not some video game , when an asshole smugly endangers others just because he has a plastic bubble to protect him , i think he should be faced with reality the reality of a fist or a baseball bat to disabuse him of the notion that his personal reality of technological isolation is in fact , not real people are brave with their internet aliases and behind the wheels of their hummers , but we all know the overwhelming majority of humans are craven cowards since telling my shrink what i needed wednesday i 've been better , but i'm not out of the woods by any means i cried too briefly for kathleen to notice this morning and got busy with other things later we took kenyon swimming , and in a battle between river and ocean currents he was able to retrieve his bottle from fifty yards , for minutes appearing stationary in his attempt to best the currents , but paddling courageously on i thought i was going to have to swim out and save him , but mr intrepid made it to shore he is our champion , god bless him we think swimming keeps him alive i 've gone easy on myself since my appointment with dr k i quit pushing myself to finish the novel revision my chief writing activity has been to go through unpublished poems and delete them forever , in the equivalent of a digital bonfire there are so many efforts of mine i do n't want to be caught dead with , literally one benefit of this depression has been to curb my narcissism towards all my work i am a journeyman poet , no genius , much of my work forgettable i 've put more energy into feeling neglected as an artist , i fear , than i have into my art how 's that for childish ? i'm as self centered and easily hurt as the next guy , maybe more especially in depression my self esteem , when it hangs , hangs by a fine thread i hope for the sake of entertainment the day comes when i feel hypomanic and blog accordingly then all will fear to pull on superman 's cape ! kilorats , ce
