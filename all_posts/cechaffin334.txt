at two or three kilobunnies hypomania begins to appear i chatter kathleen says , you re moving too quickly i multitask , i stay up until am reading , i charm strangers who naturally pour out their life stories to me , i think about punching out anyone who disrespects kathleen , particularly all the idiots who have no idea of how to treat lip readers money worries vanish i exercise with gusto my body is in less pain i pump out submissions like a saudi king the world is my oyster again where does that phrase come from , anyway ? oysters are rich , yes , but rather unsightly and very difficult to open , with dangerously sharp edges then if the world is truly your oyster you no doubt have underlings to open the oyster for you one great thing about feeling good a little above euthymia , almost hypomanic is that one s quandaries tend to become seinfeld like in their triviality take yesterday i was swimming at the gym a latino man entered the lane next to me and began to jog slowly up and down the pool each time i passed him i got a schnauze full of treacly sweet menthol lime deodorant ecch here s today s diversity comment i ve noticed an overuse of cologne in this order arabs , blacks , latinos my worst experience was being stuck with a rich young arab in an elevator afterwards i searched for turbans in the shape of an atomizer bulbs back to the gym i remembered a notice on the locker room door pleading with clients not to use cologne or essential oils or other strong scents , as there had been complaints so while swimming my requisite mile i was in a quandary as to whether , like a good communist citizen , i should turn in this reeking pendejo or whether , as a libertarian , i should confront him directly if i was sufficiently bothered or whether , as a christian , i should turn the other cheek and fuhgedaboutit when i finished my laps and entered the locker room i re read the notice it only applied to the saunas , which i don t use ! i was off the hook ! oh happy day ! i didn t have to make a decision it doesn t take a lot to make me happy on a euthymic day i am , truly , a different person kathleen says i m so glad to have my husband back my older brother repeats , good to have you back ! all i can say is , good to be back ! but it s not all good in my free flowing , equal opportunity , people bashing humor though to be fair i am fondest of bashing myself , i m more liable to hurt kathleen s feelings though i am also quicker to apologize and make up i m also tempted to drink or abuse drugs , because i m feeling so good already what possible difference could it make ? it s as if the increase in mood is so intoxicating i want to speed up the process to get maximum enjoyment out of it sly stone knows i can get even higher the world is my oyster indeed my point ? in manic depression intervention is needed at both arcs of the mood pendulum last night i finally dosed myself with antipsychotic medicine after a double dose of my sleep meds failed and i was still going strong on a michael crichton novel at am naturally i woke up this morning fuzzier than a sheep s navel just short of the thorazine shuffle clearly , i don t want to risk getting too high or i ll eventually flame out and get too low i m not saying that if you have this disorder you have to micromanage your mood , only that if it accelerates in one direction or the other , you need to pay attention , and fast at two kilobunnies , ce
