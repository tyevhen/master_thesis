here 's a little silliness , then a brief description of my mental illness and recovery i was first diagnosed with a mental illness in i had just returned from living overseas i became majorly depressed with anxiety , agoraphobia , and psychotic symptoms a friend of my family got me to go to a counselor , who got me to go to a doctor i began antidepressants that then triggered mania more medications were prescribed to help my bipolar symptoms over the next years i became suicidal i started cutting myself and hurting myself in other ways to cope finally , i made a suicide attempt , and i ended up in the psych ward i have been it the psych wards in three different hospitals for a total of six or seven times of attempting suicide or self harming behavior after the nd time in the hospital , i could not leave until i was set up with outpatient therapy doing dbt dialectical behavioral therapy for my borderline personality disorder i continued in that program for two or three years this taught me how to survive and helped me learn how to reenter life during those years , because of my depression , messed up sleep , and trying to get my medications right , i fell asleep while driving and totaled my car no one was hurt after i learned all i could from dbt , i still had many questions about god in the midst of all that i was dealing with in my life i switched to a christian counselor he had taught the bible for years , and could understand and help me through my questions i also found that i was not the only christian with a mental illness i joined a support type group at my church another thing that i have had to deal with was ptsd related to my car accident and driving which i quit for years i finally went to a psychologist who used emdr to help me to get over not being able to drive i can now drive my car without the intense panic attacks that stopped me also , i no longer have the need to cut as i have learned other ways of dealing with negative emotions i have realized that there is a reason for me to be alive , and i no longer have suicide as an option i have accepted myself and my mental illness as god accepts me i no longer hate myself i now have a great compassion for other people who struggle like i do i want to help bring awareness of mental illness and what it really is to people so that there will be understanding , so people can learn better ways to help us , and so that those who find they have a mental illness will not feel like they are the only ones who feel crazy and bad as i had thought hopefully , bringing awareness can also help reduce the stigma and fear we face as people with mental illnesses cindy
