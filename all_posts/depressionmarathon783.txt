a big thank you to those of you who left such thoughtful comments on my last post i'm still unpacking and sorting through things to sell the big sale starts tomorrow i ca n't wait i never expected i 'd feel so anxious to get rid of my stuff , but i ca n't wait to get it off my hands and out of my soul junk junk cluttering my house , but it feels like it 's cluttering my soul i'm ready to lighten up i sold another big item today my trumpet i played trumpet in high school and a little bit in college i owned that instrument since i first learned to play it was at least years old , but it was in pristine condition and now my co worker 's son will learn to play on it , too i feel good about that it 's kind of funny , now that i think about it the people who purchased my car bought it for their year old daughter it 's her first car , but in order to drive it she 'll have to learn to drive a stick shift my stuff is being used for learning left and right ! that 's kind of cool people keep asking me why i'm selling so much stuff i think my parents are even a little worried that 's kind of funny besides feeling overwhelmed with old things and old memories , i want to be able to pick up and leave at any time i ca n't do that if my house is loaded with stuff maybe i'm feeling a little restless maybe i'm having a mid life crisis i do n't really care lightening my load feels good , and i'm going to keep doing it until i'm done and i'm not done yet
