posted by dinah before i start clinkshrink , please forgive me for posting over you i need to vent , badly i 'll never do it again , really world please scroll down to clink 's wonderful post on keeping the faith , it 's really great we 've been talking about coverage , returning calls , standards of care see the posts below below clink 's wonderful keeping the faith post so , this stuff has been on my mind , and i 've been thinking about older wiser coveringdoc 's guest blogger comments about the expectation that emergency calls should be returned within minutes so , this morning , i'm steaming my wrinkled clothes and i hear my cell office phone normally , i 'd let it roll to voicemail , but i 've got this blog stuff on my mind , so i go glance at the number it 's a familiar number and i think it 's a patient who recently had a suicidal crisis over a holiday and yes , i called back on the weekend , several times i answer the call , only it 's not that patient , it 's someone new , looking for an appointment , she tells me her name which never registers and who referred her the steamer is on in the next room , my schedule is downstairs , i ask if i can call back in ten minutes i do n't have a pen paper , but that 's okay , the number is on my cell phone , i 'll call right back ten minutes i finish steaming , get dressed , grab my cell phone , coffee cup , and a basket of laundry and head downstairs i throw the laundry in the wash , find my schedule , and go to return the call where 's my cell phone ? and , i think , as i call it from the house phone and do n't hear it ring anywhere , what was that funny clunk i heard when i started the laundry ? well , i find my cell phone , very clean and very dead , in the bottom of the washing machine it 's now and i have my first patient at , i need to get going , but my office line is my cell phone , so i 'll have no phone for the day sort of panicked , i change my voicemail message , noting that my phone has been submerged and that i may have trouble both retrieving and returning calls for the day please do n't report me to the shrink police , coveringdoc i leave a message for the psychiatrist across the hall letting him know i will be showing up in his office to borrow his phone and check my messages and then i remember the new patient who wanted the appointment i do n't know her name , i do n't have her number , i feel awful as i 'll just be totally blowing her off , and my final call before i dash out the door to my phone free day is to the referring psychiatrist i leave a message on his machine but i do n't dial his emergency number asking if he could leave me a message if he knows who he referred to me and has a phone number it should have been a quiet day , but i was a little anxious without my phone think linus and that blanket my husband called , heard the message and suggested i get something waterproof this is my second drowned phone so , i'm spending friday night learning to work my new phone referring doc actually had phone numbers , and hours after my promise of i 'll call you back in ten minutes , i reached the prospective patient , apologized profusely and explained the drowned phone in the laundry story , and somehow she still wanted an appointment with ditzy doc that would be me and what did you do today ?
