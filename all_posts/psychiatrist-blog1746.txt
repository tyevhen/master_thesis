it 's sunday morning pm is still morning , right ? here in shrink rap land i 've had coffee with the judge , i 've done a load of laundry , i 've run a minute mile and then walked another one , and , of course , i 've read part of the sunday new york times it 's been an exciting morning with the paper i 've discovered that i'm either middle aged or on the cusp of it this is okay , not really news and now that i have teenage kids , i think i'm entitled to it so , first i read a review of a book by gina kolata called rethinking thin the book reportedly downplays the dangers of obesity let 's not go there and trails four patients as they go through a clinical trial at a university of pennsylvania obesity treatment group back in the day when middle age was n't even on my radar , i worked as a research assistant in that group some of those folks are even still there i think that makes them old i hear the book is n't all flattering to the group , but i may have to buy it anyway so now that it may be okay for me to be fat , i moved on to the issue of wisdom , a rather vaguely defined condition and it was sort of amazing that so long an article could say so little i thought of roy when i read , one of the most interesting areas of neuroscience research involves looking at the way people regulate their emotions and how that regulation can change over the course of a lifetime roy , why are n't you here ? yes , yes , yes there were fmri studies quoted , not to mention salivary cortisol levels no oxytocin , i'm so sorry okay , so i read and read , all the time wondering if i am wise i got to the end of the article and there it was , a link to an on line test i could take i was on it the test scored as and answering quickly , i scored a i have relatively moderate wisdom probably one different answer and i could have gotten a and had moderately high wisdom okay , i'm off to test my husband who is definately wise , maybe the kids , maybe max , and i still have to read the article on the guy who stopped his anti depressants i may be back
