i don t know where today s triolet comes from i converted it from a longer free verse draftwas working on that likely will go nowhere it is dark , but i had to delete it in order to submit it to a journal one good thing about form is that you know when you are finished with a poem , more or less , before the last minute tinkerings kathleen and i found a heap of mushrooms yesterday in the woods around the property most of them proved edible , mainly zeller s boletes there was another bolete called a slippery jack , but the cap was slimy and the book told us to strip the skin off before cooking not easy to strip the skin off of a mushroom we passed on the slimy shrooms i did not wake up feeling rested today and i remembered that if i were to stay up all night it would can provide a temporary reprieve from depression but i don t want to do that before my next shrink appointment wednesday or it may falsely minimize my symptoms i may do it afterwards what do i have to lose but a little sleep ? at kilorats , ce
