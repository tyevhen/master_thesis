profiles of young researchers in an earlier post called , the nine stages , i mentioned hope was the ninth stage i ended the post by saying , with acceptance , and armed with the additional knowledge that researchers were working diligently towards finding a treatment and potentially a cure , i discovered something that had been missing recently in my life hope in another post , another ray of hope on the research front , i commented , how fortunate we are that another generation has picked up the baton and continues to move towards the finish line finding a treatment or cure as long as someone is carrying the baton , we have hope in this post , i wish to recognize another researcher who is carrying the baton isabella palazzolo , ph d , is a researcher for the massachusetts general institute for neurodegenerative diseases mind , at the massachusetts general hospital , harvard medical school , in charlestown , ma bruce why did you decide to focus your research on kennedy 's disease ? isabella my first interest , when i was still in undergraduate school , has always been the neurons when i met my first mentor , angelo poletti , i discovered the motor neurons , and i found it extremely interesting how those tiny cells in our spinal cord can modulate the movements of all our body for our entire life i think the equilibrium inside those cells is amazing and i am really curious to understand it better , to find what goes wrong in disease and how to fix it bruce do you personally know anyone with kennedy 's disease ? isabella i feel lucky , because three years ago i had the occasion to join the kda meeting that event gave me a bunch of new reasons to study and work on kennedy 's disease everyone that i met , patients and patients' families , was and is a real example of dedicated , lovely , brave people i believe the meeting with you guys the kda conference in atlanta was really the changing point for my scientific life bruce briefly summarize what you are currently working on and why you feel it is important in kd research isabella i 've been working for the past three years in dr fischbeck 's lab , under the supervision of maria pennuto both these people should be acknowledged for what i have done so far as i said before , my starting point is the equilibrium in the motor neuron i believe it is extremely important to imagine being in the motor neurons there , the ar is in solution , and in contact with other proteins around it it is charged , positively and negatively , and the charge on the surface regulates the way it communicates and interacts with other proteins when polyq is expanded , interactions between proteins change and the ar becomes toxic so , i decided to study how i can change them again , in order to reverse counteract the toxicity of the polyq i think that attaching a phosphate group phosphorylation or a molecule of ubiquitin ubiquitination is a good tool to change protein protein interactions thus , i studied the consequences of ar phosphorylation by akt , a kinase that was protective in huntington 's disease also we found that this phosphorylation is indeed protective , in cells , in flies and in a mouse model with sbma kennedy 's disease my interest now is to understand why , what happens to the phosphorylated ar in the motor neurons i think this study is important because it highlighted a potential therapy for sbma kennedy 's disease akt activity can be stimulated by insulin like growth factor i igf , and we demonstrated that igf is protective in cells and mice i also think it is important to identify what happen to the phosphorylated ar as this might identify new targets for therapies , and will hopefully help to understand the mechanisms of the disease bruce what are your aspirations career goals ? isabella i really like translational research now , i have just started my phd and i did bring some sbma in my new lab i would love to keep working on neurodegenerative diseases and sbma in particular my long term question is once again how can i use post translational modifications phosphorylation ubiquitination ecc to target mutant proteins and reduce their toxicity , and what is the mechanisms behind bruce is there anything else interesting you would like to mention ? isabella i would like to thank once again all my previous and current mentors angelo poletti , for teaching me all that i know about the ar , maria pennuto and kurt fischbeck , for being such great examples of successful and determined scientists , and dimitri krainc , for is open minded approach to science and for giving me the possibility to keep working on sbma in his lab last , but not least , thanks again to the kda association meeting it is really motivating
