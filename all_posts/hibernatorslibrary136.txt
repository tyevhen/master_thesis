the psychopath whisperer the science of those without conscience by kent a kiehl , narrated by kevin pariseau in this fascinating scientific exploration into the biological differences between psychopaths and non psychopathic people , kiehl discusses his own dealings with psycopaths in prisons kiehl is known as the first person to use an mri in a prison to study the differences between psychopaths and non psychopathic prisoners kiehl would determine psycopathy by interviewing prisoners and then rating them on a list of attributes a score of indicates a psychopath approximately of inmates were psychopaths a balanced number of people who rate high and low on the psychopathy scale would be chosen for the experiments once the study subjects were put in the mri , they would be shown pictures of three types a morally neutral photo perhaps an ice cream cone , a morally ambiguous photo perhaps a wrestling match , and a immoral act perhaps someone placing a bomb in a car the prisoners would then rate one a scale how immoral the picture was when a person who scores low on the psychopathy scale sees an immoral picture , his limbic system lights up but a psychopath 's limbic system remains eerily dark in his book , kiehl also discusses findings other people have made about psychopaths like the fact that they have no startle reflex this mixture of scientific , psychological , and personal narrative make for a fantastic book i enjoyed this book quite a bit especially the ethical implications of whether a psychopath deserves an insanity plea because their brains function differently than normal people and they are unable to physiologically respond the right way to the thought of immoral activity kiehl himself longs for a day when psychopathy will be caught earlier in childhood , so that they can receive treatment rather than incarceration but the issue is quite an ethical dilemma where do you draw the line on the insanity plea ? i have previously discussed another ethical dilemma of the insanity plea whether , in a patient with dissociative identity disorder , it is ethical to punish one personality for what another personality has done again , where 's the line ? and then i wonder about what the neurodiversity movement would say about the whole thing ? things that make you go hmmmm
