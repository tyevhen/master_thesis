we join a small pool at a country club each year it is the same cost as the big public pool but only a couple of blocks away there are a lot of good things about this little pool the lady who runs it is a high school teacher who is strict it is close enough the kids can run up , come home for awhile and go back easily most kids in town want the big city pool with water slides and diving boards so there are not many there great for kids with rad when the kids were little i went with them now i will let taz or bear go one at a time anyway , yesterday afternoon the teacher who runs the pool calls and says that bear has hives and she wanted to make sure someone was home he comes home with appears to be heat rash it went something like this bear mom , k says i have hives me let me take a look it looks like heat rash to me bear no k says it is n't me take some allergy medicine and her is some hydro cortisone cream to help with the itching bear i think it might be because of all that fungus i touched the other day me what fungus ? bear when you made me wash that dish he had to wash out a dish from the frig that had some mold on it i told k about it and she said that could be it when taz is sick he likes all the attention he can get he likes for me to snuggle the blanket under his chin and feel his head bear says the blanket is scratchy and readusts it he says my hand feels cold or hot and he just wants me to leave him alone there is no trust i wonder how god feels when i do n't trust him
