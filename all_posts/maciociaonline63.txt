it always seems strange that joy should be listed among the emotional causes of disease in chinese medicine and yet , it has always been mentioned as an emotional cause of disease since ancient times strangely , the chinese character for joy xi is the only one of the emotions that is not based on the heart radical the character xi is based on the radical for drum plus mouth , i e beating a drum and singing in happiness incidentally , two xi characters next to each other are called double happiness and are a symbol of a wedding it is interesting that , in the list of emotions as causes of disease , joy is always top of the list , followed by anger for example , these are the emotions listed by confucius joy , anger , grief , fear , love , hatred , desire these are the emotions listed by lao zi joy , anger , worry , sadness , love , hatred , desire it is interesting that both lists include love as an emotional cause of disease ! chen wu ze lists joy , anger , pensiveness , worry , sadness , fear , shock these became the widely accepted emotions of chinese medicine zhang jie bin lists eight emotions joy , anger , pensiveness , worry , sadness , fright , fear , shock a normal state of joy is obviously not in itself a cause of disease on the contrary , it is a beneficial mental state which promotes a smooth functioning of the internal organs and their mental faculties the simple questions in chapter says joy makes the shen peaceful and relaxed , it benefits the ying and wei qi and it makes qi relax and slow down on the other hand , in chapter the simple questions says the heart controls joy , joy injures the heart , fear counteracts joy other passages in the nei jing clearly refer to joy as a cause of disease for example , chapter of the simple questions says joy injures the heart chapter of the spiritual axis says joy scatters the heart and deprives it of its residence fei bo xiong in medical collection of four doctors from the meng he tradition says joy injures the heart it causes yang qi to float and the blood vessels to become too open and dilated i think that the best and probably only way to understand joy as an emotional cause of disease is in the light of the three main philosophies of china , i e daoism , confucianism and buddhism i think that joy is akin to desire and craving from the point of view of these three philosophies of the three philosophies , daoism and confucianism are the main ones because buddhism was not widespread in china at the time when joy was already considered as a cause of disease , i e during the warring states period bc all these three religions or rather philosophies , for different reasons , advocated emotional restraint and avoidance of craving and desire for example , the daoists shunned social relations and advocated following the dao , absence of desire wu yu and non action wu wei they felt that joy would stop us from following the dao as much as other emotions such as anger the great daoist zhuang zi bc ? talks about wu qing , i e absence of feelings what i mean when i say that they sages are wu qing without feelings is that they do not injure their own persons with likes and dislikes and are always responsive to what is natural without trying to increase life the ancient daoist text nei ye inner training , older than the dao de jing , has this interesting passage on emotions the vitality of all people inevitably comes from their peace of mind when anxious , you lose this guiding thread when angry , you lose this basic point when you are anxious or sad , pleased or angry , the dao has no place within you to settle love and desire still them ! if you are tranquil , you will attain it the dao if you agitated , you will lose it indeed , to the daoists , stimulation has a negative connotation zhuang zi says concisely when desire is profound , the force of heaven is superficial this means that desire turns us away from the vitality of heaven stirring emotions within us that make us stray from the path of the dao confucianists believed that the true gentleman a mistranslation of the term jun zi that actually applies to both men and women is not stirred by emotions because these cloud his or her true nature they used the image of a pond with a muddy bottom if the water is very still , it becomes clear if we stir the bottom , the water becomes turbid the pond is our human nature which is naturally clear if we are stirred by emotions , these will cloud our human nature consider this passage from xun zi a confucianist philosopher , bc it is ever so that the heart mind xin is naturally full , naturally born and naturally perfected should its function be impaired , it is certain to be due to sorrow and happiness , joy and anger , desire and profit seeking if we can rid ourselves of sorrow and happiness , joy and anger , desire and profit seeking , the heart mind xin will revert to its flawless state the buddhists considered desire and craving as the very root of human suffering greed excessive desire , hatred and ignorance are at the centre of the wheel of life and greed is strangely symbolized by a rooster according to them , our very existence begins out of the desire and craving of a mind in the bardo state the period after death and before the next reincarnation the mind desires the warmth of a womb and it reincarnates later on in life , desire causes our mind to try to grasp objects like a monkey sways from tree to tree that is why the buddhist wheel of life has , among others , the image of a monkey on a tree so , what relevance has this view of joy , desire and craving to us in the st century ? i think that these emotions are indeed causes of disease and i would call the modern equivalent of these emotions overstimulation i think that this , rather than joy , would probably be the best translation of xi our society indeed bombards us with objects of craving and it artificially creates desire and craving through advertising on the other hand , it provides and fosters substances that overstimulate us we are all overstimulated by entertainment , frenetic lifestyle , consumerism , coffee , tea , tobacco , alcohol , tv , video games , recreational drugs , medicinal drugs , and sexual stimulation the main stimulant drugs are caffeine nicotine cocaine amphetamines prescription drugs e g ritalin methylphenidate , adderall amphetamine and dextroamphetamine , dexedrine dextroamphetamine , strattera atomoxetine , focalin dexmethylphenidate etc interestingly , antidepressants are not actually stimulants and do not usually lead to joy my experience with depressed patients on anti depressants is that these drugs blunt all emotions they do somehow lift depression but at the expense of alertness and enthusiasm indeed , some anti depressants are used for anxiety with some effect i think that the blunting effect of anti depressants is reflected in the resulting pulse , i e a pulse that feels stagnant and does not have the healthy wave of the normal pulse it is not wiry , not tight but i describe it as stagnant and reluctant while most authors see anti depressants as mood elevating and stimulants , i do not share that view and the pulse qualities described above seem to confirm this overstimulation , in the broad sense indicated above , makes the heart larger this leads to excessive stimulation of the heart , which in time , may lead to heart related symptoms and signs these may deviate somewhat from the classical heart patterns the main manifestations would be palpitations , over excitability , insomnia , restlessness , talking a lot and a red tip of the tongue the pulse would typically be slow , slightly overflowing but empty on the left front position it may seem strange that joy or overstimulation makes the pulse slow this is because overstimulation makes the heart larger and therefore slows down circulation shock , by contrast , makes the heart smaller the points i use for overstimulation are he shenmen , p daling , du houding , ren jiuwei zhang jie bin also called zhang jing yue classic of categories lei jing , people s health publishing house , beijing , p first published in the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine simple questions , p tian dai hua the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine simple questions p ibid , p spiritual axis , p medical collection of four doctors from the meng he tradition , p ames rt and hall dl a philosophical translation of the dao de jing , ballantine books , new york , , p roth h original tao , columbia university press , new york , , p lee j xunzi and early chinese naturalism , state university of new york press , albany , , p
