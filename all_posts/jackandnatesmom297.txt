when i take a chance in my life , when i allow myself to be vulnerable , i feel naked frankly some of my posts on this blog have been so personal that i would have felt less exposed if i were naked and that 's saying something there have been many times when i have been terrified to hit the publish button , afraid of mean comments , too much bad advice , you know , negativity it 's never happened never i have been in relationships in my life where i have felt constantly judged , never good enough , not pretty enough , not thin enough , not smart enough , not shallow enough to be accepted i never feel any of those things here i actually do n't feel any of those things in the autism community in general walking this road has taught me a lot about not judging others , their parenting , etc but it has also taught me quite a bit about feeling accepted myself it has brought me to a point where i will accept nothing less that 's what i deserve , and that 's what everyone deserves , including our children i feel surrounded by loving and supportive people enough so that if someone is n't able to see me as a person of value , someone worth knowing , then i do n't want to know them my previous tendency was to try even harder with people who did n't seem to get me insecurity central and it backfired every time i do n't have ongoing relationships with any of those people today if someone chooses to push my friendship away , hey , they must not want it ! how about that simple concept , difficult execution anyway , there is a point to this i am incredibly grateful for all of the support , good advice , and general discussions that this blog has generated i have enough readers at this point that someone responds to every post and quite often makes a really good point , or offers support that i did n't know was available my class with nathan is turning out to be a similar experience i am really coming to look forward to fridays for a whole new reason i love learning new methods for communicating with nathan , i always leave feeling incredibly uplifted and motivated and the other parents that 's the best part for me we are all very different different ages , backgrounds , etc but we have such a strong common bond as the weeks pass we are all opening up about our children , our families , our experiences with the autism community , different doctors , therapists , etc it 's a whole new type of education there is one mom , whose son is in nate 's aba class , who i chat with quite a bit the group was having a discussion about evaluations , genetic testing and other diagnostic tools and she revealed that her pediatrician told her that she needs to have her month old son evaluated that he is showing developmental delays already this doctor has not even met her older son who goes to a specialist , and was not aware that he is on the spectrum she welled up just talking about it i seriously wanted to wrap my arms around this woman who i barely know if finding out that one of your children has challenges is painful , finding out that another child is affected is excruciating all of the thoughts that run through a parent 's head how can i possibly get another child to all of these appointments , how can i possibly afford all of these appointments , what does this mean for my family ? and my heart just broke for her she then said that she wants to wait a few months and see if he catches up my first inclination then was to jump across the table , shake her and say do it now ! ! ! ! the earlier the better right ? but every parent has to go through this period before they even know for sure that something is amiss of mourning , of accepting what may be coming and i get that so all i said was , it wo n't hurt a thing , or cost a thing to have the school system evaluate him and early intervention wo n't cause him harm if they are willing to offer it , we should grab onto that right ? i hope she calls i do n't know what they would do for a baby that is months old all i could think of was that if she does n't call now , and he ends up having issues , she will beat herself up later , or at least i would what a huge thing to discuss with virtual strangers but in that setting , we 're not strangers at all we are very likely the only people who understand the magnitude of what she is saying the only ones who wo n't say things like i'm sure he 's fine because we all know that statements like that will not make her feel better nothing will make her feel better except hearing someone with credentials say that her baby is developing typically so i am saying some prayers for her and her family tonight , and i hope that you will too pray for her little bambino and the best possible outcome for him and thank god that his mom is already so well connected within this community , she knows what to do for him while i'm at it , thank god for other parents with similar experiences , and thank god for all of you , who make baring it all much less intimidating i ca n't tell you how much it is appreciated
