after brainstorming with a few different people , i 've come up with a pretty vague outline for what i want this conference to look like my vision for this conference , if you will as things move further ahead , it may very well change , but right now , this is what i 've got note that when i say we i'm referring to both myself and everyone who 's contributing to the planning of this event theme overarching message freedom based education can be for everyone looking to break the myths of who unschooling and freeschooling is for , and to give the tools and information for people to make these types of education available where they currently are n't a two day conference , held close to downtown montreal probably and easily accessible by public transport either in a hotel 's conference space , or , preferably , in a separate venue but with a nearby hotel that we 've worked out a special rate for conference attendees talks and workshops split roughly half half between unschooling and freeschooling , with hopefully some other talks and workshops that do n't fit into either of those categories directly what 's wrong with the school system , freedom based education at the university level , learning centers and co ops , etc also a film screening room and a vendor hall with vendors that we 've approved , so meet with the vision for this conference something i feel strongly about is that everyone who wants to should be able to attend , so there will be a sliding scale registration fee for attendees , as well as an added note that if the lowest end of the scale still does n't work for you , contact us and we 'll work something out we 'd also like to find multiple sponsors to lessen the cost , and have a food collective or similar there so that food can be bought , but is n't included in registration fee speakers from across north america if we can afford them we still need to put together a list of speakers we 'd love to have , and want to approach to find out more details and i think that 's basically what we 've got right now there are other details , but that 's the general overview ! so , what do you think ? does that sound like a conference you 'd like to attend ? any suggestions or ideas that you 'd like to share ? speakers you think we might want to look into ? comments are very welcome ! you might also like talks and magazines organizing a conference yikes ! points for toronto unschooling conference talk it 's official we 're going to the northeast unschooling conference ! linkwithin
