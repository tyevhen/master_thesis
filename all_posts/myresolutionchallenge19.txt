when i was younger , i would write my new year resolution or goals list based on what i wanted to do , be , or have that would make me happy it took me several decades to understand that happiness comes from within and isn t a physical object , place , or person it s human nature to want to make our lives better however , we have an inbuilt security system that resists change so how do you make improvements to your life without upsetting that inner control freak ? several years ago i saw a meme on facebook which suggested starting a gratitude jar the idea appealed to me , but in the example , you were told to write down something that you were grateful for each day , week , or month while i approved of the sentiment , i was already adding my thoughts of gratitude to my daily journal so , i improvised my happiness jar begins on the st january every year anything that i do over the course of twelve months which made me happy goes into my jar i m not only talking about the big achievements , even though they do make it into the pot , but the small moments , the kind people , and the instants of pride , joy , and hope that filled the year started off with a bang for me the first six months were exceptional , but then i hit a brick wall with my health and depression and struggled to keep my head up for the remaining half of the year when you are living in a slump , it can be tough to focus on the positives using the happiness jar allows me to remember all the precious moments i experienced , the wonderful people who came into my life or helped me along my path , and this turns negativity on its head on new year s eve , i open my jar , tip the contents onto the table and read all the tiny slips of paper i light a candle , make myself a cup of tea , indulge in a biscuit or two , and focus my time entirely on the positivity of by the end of this exercise i am no longer fixated on the darker side of my year , but instead , i m filled with hope , joy , and determination that the new year will bring more incredible experiences to overflow my jar once again some examples from my happiness jar include my acupuncture sessions with jo sept joined the gym and started running again may having hot chocolate with my daughter before sales shopping a lovely morning full of giggles jan i was a guest speaker at the it s your life west midlands event jan drive in movie with the girls sept there are coffee dates , cinema trips , author blogger events , and a host of other happy moments from last year in my jar by doing this exercise , i m allowing myself to start a new year with an optimistic vibe it doesn t take a lot of effort to start this great habit grab a mug , teapot , or old jam jar , or buy yourself a pretty mason jar and decorate it keep a small notepad close by so you can jot down anything that you did , or experienced , that made you smile , and add it to your pot i keep my happiness jar in a prominent place in my kitchen , that way i m always reminded to add to it over the twelve months it s also a visual reminder of all the good things in your life when you see it filling up let me know if you start your happiness project , and feel free to post any photographs of your jar on my motivate me facebook page happy new year ! thanks for visiting my blog , i hope you enjoyed this post want more ? connect with me here twitter shelleywilson , instagram or check out my facebook pages http www facebook com fantasyauthorslwilson and http www facebook com motivatemeblog you can also find me on pinterest
