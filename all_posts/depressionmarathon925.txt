i learned last night of two deaths which directly resulted from alcoholism one young man and one middle aged woman , both of whom previously worked a program of recovery , passed away this week relapse leading to death it makes me so frightened and so sad i 've been struggling with drinking thoughts since my sponsor 's relapse they scare me these two people who died were no different than i they were accomplished , intelligent human beings who chose to act on their drinking thoughts why them and not me ? i wonder sometimes why am i getting it recovery when so many others are not ? and what if i stop getting it ? i have to assume that i , too , would die if the drinking did n't kill me , the alcohol 's depressant effect would surely spin me into suicide why have n't i picked up a drink while others , with far more sobriety than i , have picked up ? i do n't know there but for the grace of god go i alcoholism is a crazy , scary , deadly disease i am so grateful to be sober today
