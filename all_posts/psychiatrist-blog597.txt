playing with pigs pig chase from utrecht school of the arts on vimeo i want this game a company in the netherlands is working on an ipad app that will let people interact remotely with pigs on a farm apparently pigs like to interact with bright balls of light this app creates bright spheres of colored light on a panel in a pig sty the pig touches the light with his snout , which scores a point the number of touches racks up a score , and at the end of the game the high scores get displayed on the ipad i'm not sure if the human is training the pig to touch the screen , or if the pig is training the human to play longer with an ipad either way , it looks like a lot more fun than angry birds here 's the web site for the video playing with pigs and the other amazing thing is that we already have a pig label on the blog have we really talked about pigs here before ? and for jesse , a hamster and here 's one from roy with ants
