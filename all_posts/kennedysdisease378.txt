since i will be traveling thursday , today s post will be my thanksgiving message i have so much to be thankful for and i hope most of you will be counting your blessings come thursday i have said it many times , but we live in a great country yes , it is not perfect , and , yes , things could always be better , but , in all of my travels , i have found the usa to be the most perfect imperfect country on a more personal level , i am very grateful for my family , neighbors , friends and critters yes , our three strays are an important part of our lives because they bring us much joy also , i am still finding it hard to believe that i am going to be a great grandfather in two months who ever thought that could happen at the ripe old age of i am thankful for my overall health because things could be far worse than just having to live with kennedy s disease it seems my evening prayers always have a long line of prayer requests for those less fortunate in regards to their health i have said it many times , things could always be worse and , most importantly , i cannot imagine life without my wonderful wife she needs to be nominated for sainthood my wife never envisioned having to share our life with kennedy s disease this disease has taken a toll on me , on our relationship , on my wife s freedom and on our retirement plans yet , like the eveready bunny , she just keeps going and going she is a true blessing i also need to say thanks to all of you who read my articles and put up with the ranting of a mad blogger the reason i continue to write is because of your support be safe this holiday season and have a happy thanksgiving
