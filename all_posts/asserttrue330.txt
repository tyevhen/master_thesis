not long ago on november i ran an excerpt , here , from gravity 's rainbow , thomas pynchon 's brilliantly eccentric postmodern classic about the v missile bombing of england in late i also tweeted about it and mentioned the book in an e mail to a friend and looked it up in a google search once on december , i got an e mail from amazon with a subject heading of gravity 's rainbow the first part of the e mail looks like this i was startled to see gravity 's rainbow just those two words as the subject of an e mail from amazon , although i guess by now i should n't have been the real question is does amazon know that the copy of pynchon i'm now reading is from the library ? google and amazon have been tracking our behavior , our reading preferences , our buying habits , for quite some time and they 'll only get better at refining their models , perhaps to the point where they can tell i'm about to commit a crime , before i commit it a la minority report how pynchon would that be ? gravity 's rainbow is all about the limits of causation and prediction it explores the inversion of cause and effect , a theme deriving from the fact that the sound of a v missile 's approach is preceded by the actual explosion , due to the missile arriving faster than mach in its almost psychotic paranoia and unrelenting preoccupation with government research into the limits of predictability , much of philip k dick 's work anticipates or does it merely echo , ahead of time ? pynchon 's landmark book the same way daily news headlines seem to offer a plangent , time inverted reverberation from some terrible dystopian future whose recent past we now reenact perhaps , as i tweeted not long ago , nsa google amazon are properly considered one entity , the data ingestion front end for the coming dronepocalypse i recently remarked on twitter i was being completely serious , because today 's bizarro reality is so monstrously outrageous our every reading habit cached in a silicon hash tree forest , our future purchasing decisions e mailed to us , but of course we can still opt out of a given purchasing decision should we wish to retain the illusion of free will even so , you might want to wait , first , for klout to finish generating your influencers no sense going off half cocked , old boy it would have beggared pynchon 's imagination , even if he was dreaming of philip k dick reading kafka before you write dystopian fiction , do a reality check that is to say make sure present day reality does n't already have you trumped broadband bizarro is streaming live , already have you checked your inbox ?
