when baking my christmas goodies , sometimes i find myself in a pickle either i ran out of some ingredient or i don t have the right tools but i never go down without a fight i hunt for a substitute and make do with what i have sometimes , to my surprise , it works out okay and , sometimes , well , i call it the error of the trial and error i then make note in my lovely recipe journal that the experiment did not work , and do not do that again ! i really do love baking because it is an artistic outlet for me baking or cooking is an art form if you let it i can be creative and unique once i get the basics down in some cases , my result would qualify for an ain t nobody got time for that meme no , i did n't make mini donuts yet believe it or not , cookies are a very delicate treat i had no background whatsoever in the baked good department because my mother , bless her heart , did not love to bake i remember the first time i discovered the glory of the oven timer what a useful invention ! i usually have no problem keeping flour , sugar , eggs , baking soda , and salt in the house however , i really believe tiny elves sneak into our fridge at night and eat all our butter or take it to the kleebler factory i don t know how many times i ve mixed cookie batter and then realized there was no butter anywhere in our solar system since i am too shy to knock on a neighbor s door , i rummage through the cupboards until i find an acceptable alternative obviously , using different substances will render different outcomes i don t know if it is legit or not , but i general follow this made up rule of thumb how the ingredient holds up at room temperature will give me a clue to how my cookies will turn out in a butter crisis , i am faced with using a few of the following options instead vegetable oil spread , margarine , shortening , olive oil , vegetable oil , canola oil , coconut oil hmmm that s all i can think of for now let me give you an example so at room temperature , vegetable oil is liquid y if i would use vegetable oil instead of butter , my cookies would be too runny when i baked them and would just flatten out on the cookie sheet option b , at room temperature , margarine is still pretty soft and melt y as well so i probably wouldn t use that either according to my made up rule , my next best option for cookie baking is shortening it holds up well at room temperature and in the oven i have never tried making cookies with coconut oil but maybe that is because i ve never bought it and i won t use canola oil either everybody knows that , if you use canola oil , you will make a cannoli sometimes , you can relate your life to making cookies what is that definition of insanity ? i believe albert einstein said it insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results i can t expect to just keep practicing the same way over and over again and then i would become the next america s got iron chef or whatever i have to experiment using different ingredients and different methods and not be afraid to fail the error in the trial and error doesn t always turn out that bad , just ask my husband if something in my life just isn t working out , maybe it is time to take a step back and look at the ingredients what is it that i am doing to get this outcome ? is there something different that i could try ? do i need to get advice from a master ? what can i learn not to do next time ? good luck with your christmas baking and cooking ! i hope you are lucky enough to get to try one of my creations or is that , lucky enough to not have to try it ? don t answer that question
