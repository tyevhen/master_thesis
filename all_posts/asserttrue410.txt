one thing every new bacteriology student learns on day one is that some microbes are strict anaerobes completely unable to use oxygen , and a universal characteristic of strict anaerobes is that they lack an important enzyme called catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water the idea is that anaerobes do n't need to have catalase , because they do n't live in the kind of highly oxidized environments where hydrogen peroxide forms lack of catalase is supposedly why many anaerobes are killed upon exposure to air according to legend , once oxygen gets into the cells , hydrogen peroxide starts to build up , and with no catalase to break it down , anaerobes choke on toxic peroxides i 'll let you in on a little secret , though this nice sounding story about peroxide buildup killing anaerobes upon exposure to air turns out to be mostly conjecture , not well supported by science even the bit about anaerobes lacking catalase is n't completely true many anaerobes do make catalase for today 's post , i did a protein sequence blast search against several families of obligate anaerobes using the kata gene of proteus mirabilis as a reference , and i was quickly able to identify two dozen strict anaerobes that do , in fact , have a catalase gene see table below table strict anaerobes that produce catalase tblastn query proteus mirabilis kata gene organism length aa e value percent identities alkaliphilus metalliredigens strain qymf e anaerococcus prevotii strain dsm e anaerococcus vaginalis strain atcc e bacteroides coprocola strain dsm bacteroides coprophilus strain dsm bacteroides eggerthii strain faa bacteroides intestinalis strain dsm bacteroides ovatus strain faa bacteroides plebeius strain dsm bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain vpi clostridium botulinum a strain loch maree e clostridium botulinum b strain okra e clostridium hathewayi strain wal e clostridium lentocellum strain dsm e clostridium phytofermentans strain isdg e desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain lmg p desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb e desulfosporosinus youngiae strain dsm e desulfotomaculum ruminis strain dsm e dethiobacter alkaliphilus strain aht e lachnospiraceae bacterium strain faa ct e propionibacterium acnes strain e syntrophobotulus glycolicus strain dsm e veillonella sp strain each entry in this table represents a protein sequence not dna sequence match between a gene in the organism listed and the catalase gene of proteus mirabilis proteus is a facultative anaerobe related to e coli and salmonella the length of each organism 's catalase enzyme , in amino acids , is shown under length by way of reference , the proteus catalase is amino acids long e value is the so called expectation value , a measure of how likely the sequence match would be by chance all of the values shown are extraordinarily low percent identities is the percentage of amino acid matches between the proteus enzyme and the target organism 's enzyme values in the to range are not unusual for functionally related enzymes in otherwise distantly related organisms values above tend to suggest a phylogenetic relationship , whereas in two organisms that are known to be unrelated , a value above would in many cases be considered evidence of possible horizontal gene transfer here 's the protein blast query sequence i used , in case you want to verify these results or go looking for more catalase producing anaerobes proteus mirabilis strain hiv , unmasked , name pmi , yp , kata , type cds , feature location chr , genomic location mekkklttaagapvvdnnnvitagprgpmllqdvwfleklahfdreviperrmhakgsgafgtftvthditkytrakifsevgkktemfarfstvager gaadaerdirgfalkfyteegnwdmvgnntpvfylrdplkfpdlnhivkrdprtnmrnmaykwdffshlpeslhqltidmsdrglplsyrfvhgfgsht ysfinkdnerfwvkfhfrcqqgiknlmddeaealvgkdressqrdlfeaiergdyprwklqiqimpekeastvpynpfdltkvwphadyplmdvgyfel nrnpdnyfsdveqaafspanivpgisfspdkmlqgrlfsygdahryrlgvnhhqipvnapkcpfhnyhrdgamrvdgnsgngityepnsggvfqeqpdf kepplsiegaadhwnhrededyfsqpralyellsddehqrmfariagelsqasketqqrqidlftkvhpeygagvekaikvlegkdak addendum after writing this post , i found that catalase also occurs in archeons see this post for details
