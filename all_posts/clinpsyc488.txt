the above title is from a journal article pandi perumal et al , i ve not been able to track down the actual article yet , but even asking if something could be the ideal antidepressant in a journal article title is patently ridiculous if a medication caused remission of symptoms in of patients with minimal side effects , it would be ideal but maybe we 've finally cured depression perhaps agomelatine really does magically cure depression let s take a look the data i found one study from which i could estimate the treatment estimate based on the abstract kennedy and emsley , here s what the abstract said , in part the efficacy and safety of flexible dosing with the antidepressant agomelatine mg day was evaluated in a week , double blind , randomized , placebo controlled study involving patients who met diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition dsm iv criteria for major depressive disorder current major depressive episode patients receiving agomelatine mg and mg day had a significantly lower mean hamilton rating scale for depression ham d score at endpoint compared with those who received placebo vs , p based on these means and standard deviations , i come up with an effect size of , which is considered small a small effect does not make for the ideal antidepressant duplicate publication watch read the abstracts from these two articles montgomery , and kennedy and emsley , i reproduced a segment from the kennedy emsley abstract above and here s a piece from montgomery s writing below in a recent placebo controlled study , mdd patients were randomly assigned double blind to receive placebo or agomelatine and mg day there was a significant advantage for agomelatine after weeks according to scores on the hamilton depression rating scale ham d p and the clinical global impression severity p , with an improved response rate p look familiar ? more hype montgomery s abstract closes with agomelatine may fill the gap in the current therapeutic armamentarium by combining efficacy with a favorable tolerability profile and additional clinical benefits i have not seen the tolerability related data , but i see not one shred of data to support additional clinical benefits , unless he 's referring to potential improvement in sleep but if we 're thinking of clinical benefits in the manner of better reduction of patient symptoms , there is simply no data to support that assertion the gap in the current therapeutic armamentarium is that current treatments are not much more effective than placebo as demonstrated by agomelatine , and they have notable side effects when ssris and atypical antipsychotics emerged , they were considered to be much safer and better tolerated treatments than their predecessors and we now know that is not the case does this new ideal drug have a better safety profile ? we had better wait and see before jumping on yet another bandwagon for a treatment that is overly hyped by the way , i tried to find more clinical trial data on this drug from the novartis website , but their clinical trial register was not functional at the time
