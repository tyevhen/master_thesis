hello and welcome to or welcome back to my blog this post also welcome s me back for those unaware , i have not posted a personal blog since july and haven t been blogging with any regularity since may i want today to give you an overview of how i am and an insight into why i needed to take a blogging break i am feeling quite a bit of anxiety over writing this post i was on a complete high at the beginning of the year with my blog and had found a great momentum for creating posts i was proud of sadly , circumstances crushed that momentum , my motivation and my confidence i miss blogging though and desperately want to get back into it for the past two years i have been fighting an injustice , it has been a constant fight and by the summer of this year i had mentally had enough , it had drained me and seemed to fill my every waking thought yet i couldn t blog about it and , so it was becoming almost impossible to blog about my life authentically without mentioning it i couldn t give up the fight though , i had gone so far and had to see it through i had hoped each month , and then each week that it would conclude , yet it dragged on until three weeks ago it is thankfully now over and ended in a way that i was satisfied with there were many times during the two years that it looked as though it wouldn t end satisfactorily for me at all and that has meant i have been on an emotional rollercoaster as a result , i have now made the decision to spend some time as a stay at home mum health wise i am much the same as i was when i was last blogging if you ve followed my blog you will know it was my intention to tackle my chronic fatigue syndrome cfs me , depression and anxiety this year with a holistic approach , focussing on nutrition , exercise and stress management unfortunately , the circumstances that stopped me blogging have also stopped my progress in these areas for the most part too i will write a few dedicated posts over the next couple of weeks updating you on where i am in more detail in terms of my cfs , mental health and diet i pretty much gave up everything possible for a few months i am feeling motivated to start afresh now and still want to bring you all along on my journey blogging my progress makes me feel more accountable , keeps me on track and hopefully may be of interest to you i have started going to blog events again and the week before last i accepted an invite to be a guest on bbc radio leicester again and had a great time i was writing weekly blog posts for a few months earlier in the year i saw them as a way to keep you updated on my progress and give you a glimpse into my life i often see youtubers vlog their week yet don t often see it in written format on blogs if you do know of any diary type blogs , please let me know i was never satisfied with the format of the diary posts i am instead going to start a series of these catch up posts and simply number them so i can write them as and when feels best i will still of course also be creating other types of blog posts too as i did before three weeks ago , when my fight came to an end i was going to buy a bottle of champagne yet when it came to it i couldn t , it felt by doing so i would somehow belittle the situation i had been through or that i was somehow saying i was lucky i just wasn t ready now i am , it wasn t lucky at all to have been through that , yet i do feel relief it is finally over , and i am hugely relieved that it ended satisfactorily so today i bought that champagne and tonight we will drink it i m back ! thank you for reading kelly x
