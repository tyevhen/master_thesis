between miles and , i could n't stop thinking about puck memories of the thousands of miles we ran together , his excited arrival in my bedroom every time i opened the running clothes drawer , his gentle demeanor and our trusted year bond these and other warm recollections accompanied my every step it took several minutes , but i finally realized the reason puck died months ago today as i write this now , tears fill my eyes i miss you , buddy you will always be mama 's best boy between miles and , i decided to challenge myself and ran up a mile long hill alongside a two lane highway as i wished , it was a challenge , but it was also loud and grimy vehicles of every size streamed by at miles per hour more than once i was showered with road grime as a semitrailer truck steamed past a little too close as i finally crested the hill , at the large intersection with another two lane highway , an erie stillness replaced the chaos a long procession of police vehicles , sans sirens but with lights flashing , slowly approached from the right , turned right , and disappeared out of sight in front of me cars and pedestrians stacked up on all sides of the intersection as the procession silently continued i realized i was likely witnessing the funeral procession of a year old sheriff 's captain who was the victim of a shocking fatal heart attack earlier this week it was an honorable , eerily quiet , somber scene as the last vehicle cleared the intersection , i thanked god for my blessings and reflected on the cruel fickleness of life between miles and , i ran around the local lake where they were just finishing the annual suicide awareness and prevention walk survivors of suicide populated the path surrounding the lake with large placards filled with names , pictures , and artifacts of loved ones lost to suicide i stopped at every placard i passed it did n't take long before my heart heaved with sorrow a year old daughter and friend , a year old military veteran who never made it home from iraq , a year old mother and grandmother , a year old handsome son there were too many sorrows to comprehend i ran past families with matching t shirts proclaiming their love and loss and felt guilty doing such a trivial thing in the midst of their pain nevertheless , i continued on suicide has been on my mind lately it was ironic to be surrounded by it of the way through my run twenty miles later , i am sitting in my living room alone i'm tired , as usual , from my effort , but i'm also sad and reflective i had a good run , a sobering run , on a beautiful day life is short , unpredictable , and sometimes unfair and or hard i'm reminded to speak up , to say thank you , i love you , or anything else i need to say , and to say it today none of us is promised tomorrow be well , friends
