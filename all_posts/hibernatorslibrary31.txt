chapter one of genesis sets the scene the creation story is filled with beautiful imagery my favorite line is before god actually creates anything and the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the waters genesis esv because i liked it so much , i found it interesting to see how this line was translated in the different versions nabre and a mighty wind sweeping over the waters nrsv while a wind from god swept over the face of the waters kjv and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters personally , i like the esv best the style is formulaic with a certain set of ingredients on each of creation days the announcement and god said , a divine command beginning with let the report and it was so an evaluation god saw that it was good and placement in time there was evening and there was morning , the day there is only one character in the chapter god and very little is said about who he is only what he does what we should think of god ? he created the earth , but was he omnipotent ? what were his reasons ? who was god ? these issues are left a mystery most people already have an idea of who they think god is before starting the bible is this why god was left a mystery ? or is it because god is a mystery ? ryken , leland ryken , philip the literary study bible , wheaton , il , good news publishers
