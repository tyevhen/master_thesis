it 's interesting to compare the social media sites on google trends to see how they 're doing twitter and facebook dwarf all the others , so i'm not going to dwell on them but see discussion further below what 's fascinating is the comparison of google plus against pinterest , linkedin , and challenger wattpad linkedin has been around longer than the others and has gained considerable traction in recent years , although it seems to be starting to plateau what 's interesting is that pinterest and google plus both spiked in poplarity in , but pinterest maintained its post spike popularity whereas google plus quickly fell right back down to near nothing this is all the more noteworthy in that if you google google plus , you get over billion hits you ca n't say google plus has no visibility on google in the meantime , the tortoise in this race , wattpad , has slowly overtaken google plus naturally , google trends data should be taken with a bit of caution wattpad has an alexa com global rank of , for example , while goodreads not shown above is ranked much higher in traffic , at no worldwide , yet wattpad outperforms goodreads in a trends graph not shown by a margin clearly , interest is building in wattpad , at least in google searches but it might not relate directly to site traffic i became curious about these relationships after a blog post of mine went to no on bigthink com the post in question garnered over , social shares i was interested in seeing how the various social shares broke out how do people share things ? which channels do they use ? the shares for the aforementioned blog as of this writing break down as follows facebook , twitter linkedin google the extremely poor showing by g augurs ill i think for google 's social platform how can you claim to have a major social platform when not even two percent of people use it to share anything ? or is this another mac vs pc situation where the product with market share comes from behind , over a period of decades , to overtake the category leaders ? i do n't think this is another mac vs pc situation i think google plus is finished i know many very smart people who think google plus is a great platform for various reasons and it does do certain things well the ui is less annoying arguably than facebook 's , at this point , and it integrates well with other google offerings no surprise there but still , hardly anyone uses it , compared to the other major social platforms look again at the above numbers , and it 's not gaining popularity fast enough to keep up , so the inescapable conclusion is that google if it intends to keep g going needs to remake g yet again , although who 's to say another incarnation of it will achieve greater traction ? many would argue and i would be among them google is merely flogging a dead horse at this point in the online world , as in the proton based world , there 's room at the top for , at most , two overdogs coke , pepsi gm , toyota android , ios chrome , firefox after the top two , all the other long tail stragglers put together do n't add up to much of a pie slice this feels like a battle google not only lost , but lost years ago in if google decides to walk away from g , at this point , it wo n't come as a surprise to me its relevance is low and dwindling the momentum simply is n't there even the mighty google colossus with its huge gmail user base ca n't move the needle on this one the social world has voted , and sad to say , google plus now very much appears to be as some of us suspected from the outset the answer to a question nobody asked
