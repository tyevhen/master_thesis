with permission , i am stealing this entire post from psych practice , a nyc psychiatrist who was kind enough to go through a step by step how to guide for determining and documenting the evaluation and management coding for the new cpt codes we 'll be using in january and thank you to becca who found this for me now if someone could translate it into exactly what one needs to do when using these e m codes in combination with the psychotherapy codes , that would be wonderful e m coding , in all its glory there are three key components to e m level of care history , exam , and medical decision making each of these components has requirements for meeting the various levels of care you need out of of these components to reach a specified level of care for example , if you have an extended problem focussed history , but only exam elements , you can still meet criteria for a provided your medical decision making is of low complexity it sounds confusing , but it ll become clearer as we move along the details for each of these components follow , after which i ll give some examples table level of care requirements out of needed level of care hx exam mdm problem focussed straightforward extended problem focussed low complexity detailed from or more organ systems moderate complexity comprehensive from each of organ systems high complexity let s look at each of the three components history history is broken into parts , namely , cc , hpi or interval history for an established patient , ros , and pfsh past medical , family , and social history cc is the presenting complaint for that session , and can be related to the diagnosis examples anxiety , or f u for anxiety in case you were wondering , a cc is required for all notes , not just the initial evaluation hpi or interval history is comprised of the following elements location quality severity duration timing context modifying factors associated signs and symptoms hpi is considered brief if it includes of these elements , and extended if it includes elements or stable conditions example the patient c o worsening anxiety x week with panic symptoms that occur intermittently , on average once per day , last for minutes , and are brought on unexpectedly by unclear precipitants this would qualify as an extended interval history because it includes elements severity , duration , timing , and context or if you include modifying factors ros includes pertinent positives and negatives there are fourteen individual systems recognized by the e m guidelines constitutional e g , fever , weight loss eyes ears , nose , mouth , throat cardiovascular respiratory gastrointestinal genitourinary musculoskeletal integumentary skin and or breast neurological psychiatric endocrine hematologic lymphatic allergic immunologic even in psychiatry , it is possible to review more than one organ system example ros positive for gi upset , sob , diaphoresis , and dissociative feelings this example could arguably include gi , respiratory , and psychiatric however , it s unclear what the liability is if you re calling sob respiratory , and then not listening to the patient s lungs pfsh pertinent past medical , family , social history past medical history a review of past illnesses , operations or injuries , which may include prior illnesses or injuries prior operations prior hospitalizations current medications allergies age appropriate immunization status age appropriate feeding dietary status family history fh a review of medical events in the patient s family which may include information about the health status or cause of death of parents , siblings and children specific diseases related to problems identified in the chief compliant , hpi , or ros diseases of family members which may be hereditary or place the patient at risk social history sh an age appropriate review of the patient s past and current activities which may include significant information about marital status and or living arrangements current employment occupational history use of drugs , alcohol or tobacco level of education sexual history other relevant social factors example patient is a graduate student in physics , about to defend his dissertation note you do not need to re record a pfsh if there is an earlier version available on the chart it is acceptable to review the old pfsh and note any changes in order to use this shortcut , you must note the date and location of the previous pfsh and comment on any changes in the information since the original pfsh was recorded for example , if you are seeing an established patient in the office you can write comprehensive pfsh which was performed during a previous encounter was re examined and reviewed with the patient there is nothing new to add today for details , please refer to my previous note in this chart , dated from emuniversity com table levels of history out of needed level of hx hpi ros pfsh problem focussed brief none none extended problem focussed brief system none detailed extended systems an example to clarify in order to be able to bill for an e m code , you need to refer to table , above , where you note that the required history is an extended problem focussed history in order to determine what constitutes an extended problem focussed history , you refer to table , where you note that a brief hpi and ros are enough to qualify psychiatric medical exam includes the following elements speech thought processes abnormal psychotic thoughts associations judgement orientation time place person memory attention span concentration language fund of knowledge mood affect general appearance muscle strength tone gait station vital signs other table levels of psychiatric exam level of care elements on exam from or more organ systems example speech normal rate , rhythm , volume , speaks english with an accent thought processes coherent judgement good fund of knowledge excellent affect anxious general appearance messy hair , not wearing socks , otherwise well groomed this example includes psychiatric exam elements , and would therefore qualify as a level of care exam medical decision making emuniversity mdm this part is a little tricky you can check out the link , but i ll try to summarize it seems as though you can raise the e m code depending on the complexity of your decision making but how the complexity is determined is , well , complex referring back to table , you ll note that there are levels of mdm straightforward low complexity moderate complexity high complexity each of these , in turn , is broken down into parts problem points data points risk so get ready for more tables table , levels of mdm out of needed overall mdm problem points data points risk straightforward minimal low complexity low moderate complexity moderate high complexity high let s look at how each of these parts is determined table problem points problem points self limited

total face to face time min cpt , e m ? ? ? ? ? cc f u for anxiety interval hx the patient c o worsening anxiety x week with panic symptoms that occur intermittently , on average once per day , last for minutes , and are brought on unexpectedly by unclear precipitants , in the context of his upcoming dissertation defense ros pt reports intermittent panic symptoms , including gi upset , sob , and dissociative feelings pfsh patient is a graduate student in physics pme speech normal rate , rhythm , volume , speaks english with an accent thought processes coherent judgement good fund of knowledge

reported allergies nkda labs ordered none , reviewed none psychotherapy note discussed with patient his automatic thoughts , and the specific concerns he has about his dissertation defense reviewed relaxation techniques with patient plan continue current medication f u week psychotherapy first , the history the interval history includes at least elements severity , duration , timing , and context this makes it extended the ros includes systems , gi , respiratory , and psychiatric the pfsh includes one element of social history , namely , that the patient is a graduate student in physics listing the allergies as nkda may also qualify as one element of pfsh referring back to table , history level of hx hpi ros pfsh problem focussed brief none none extended problem focussed brief system none detailed extended systems extended hpi , ros , and pfsh qualify as a detailed history now the psychiatric exam elements are noted , speech , thought , judgement , fund of knowledge , affect , and general appearance and the mdm anxiety is an existing problem for the patient since it is worsening , this earns problem points referring to table , it is clear that there are no data points and finally , risk a chronic illness with mild exacerbation is considered moderate risk referring to table , levels of mdm overall mdm problem points data points risk straightforward minimal low complexity low moderate complexity moderate high complexity high in this case , the overall mdm would be of low complexity , since out of elements are needed to sum it all up , we look at table , levels of care level of care hx exam mdm problem focussed straightforward extended problem focussed low complexity detailed from or more organ systems moderate complexity comprehensive from each of organ systems high complexity since there is a detailed history , but only exam elements and mdm of low complexity , this visit would qualify for a e m code now , if the patient also carried a diagnosis of depression , and this was stable , this would earn a total of problem points , for the worsening anxiety , and for the stable depression and problem points would move the mdm up to moderate complexity and since only out of the key components are required for level of care , a detailed history and mdm of moderate complexity would qualify as a , which is reimbursed at a higher rate overall , this is a pretty complicated business it adds extra work to note writing , and it s not really suited to psychiatry , and certainly not to high frequency psychotherapy or psychoanalysis and i suspect that since this is completely new , and doesn t fit neatly into nice little well established , categorized boxes , insurance companies will also be confused about it or the ll say they are so they can withhold payment posted by psychpractice at am email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook labels billing , coding , cpt , e m , practice , psychiatry , psychotherapy
