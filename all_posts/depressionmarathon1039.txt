it was n't my best time ever , but then again , i have n't run my best times since years and pounds ago nonetheless , it was the first test of the season having only run three times per week for the past three weeks , i was n't sure what to expect fortunately , it was a beautiful day for a k warm for spring in minnesota and sunny , with only a slight breeze i struggled with negative thinking , per my usual , throughout the first half i fought off worries that i was running too fast for the distance as well as self criticism that my pace was too slow comparing myself to my previous self is never productive , but i seem to do it anyway i guess my body and brain were sufficiently tired by miles , as i was finally able to simply focus on running this was a unique , equalizer race the women started minutes ahead of the guys that way the first person to finish is truly the overall winner it was nice to have the road to ourselves for a while i did n't get passed by the first men until after the four mile mark i'm not sure when they caught the lead woman , but i think she was into the latter stages of the course before that happened i enjoyed the format anyway , to make a long story short , i finished in the top twenty women and second in my age group that was a surprise ! i averaged per mile i was in pain over the last few miles , and i could feel my form go to hell more than once i just wanted to quit i kept myself going with a mantra about speedwork i e i reminded myself i was tough because of the speedwork i 'd done overall , it was a good day i'm proud of the fact that i was n't passed by any woman after about the mile mark passing and not being passed are always goals i'm also happy with my time it gives me a reference point upon which to plan the rest of my training i 'll definitely have to get faster if i want to qualify for boston , but this was a good start
