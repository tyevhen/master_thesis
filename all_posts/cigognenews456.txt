what i write now are simply musings but i wonder if there were anything that could have cured steve jobs i want to offer a possibility i use him as an example without fully knowing his early life but only as a means to explain why people get seriously ill so early let s start from my hypothesis that events during life in the womb imprint trauma in the cells and foretell of serious disease later on read life before birth for a fuller explanation these events , a smoking , anxious mother , a drug taking depressed mother , distort and detour natural cellular processes in the baby it doesn t show up for perhaps decades but it often will happen the carrying mother state is reflected in the neurophysiology of the baby and in steve s case it was not an auspicious beginning his mother was impregnated by a syrian , heavily objected to by the family so much so that she had to give her baby , steve , up for adoption can you imagine her state ? rejected by her family , carrying a baby that is a pariah to the parents she had to be full of anguish the bad part of that it is not a temporary affair that blows over when she gives the baby up for adoption that torment can leave a mark on the cells of the baby which may stay a lifetime that mark or tag has to do with changes in the chemical methyl in a process called methylation methylation changes how our genetic unfolding plays out to me it constitutes the primal imprint it endures and changes how our genetic legacy plays out it , in effect , changes heredity through what is known as epigenetics but methylation affects many biologic processes , dislocating and distorting function it changes heredity by turning off some genes that should be on and turning on those that should be off our development is affected there is new research that points out how the imprint can result in cancer and heart conditions later in life not to omit alzheimers and severe allergies the imprint takes place as the brain is rapidly changing and evolving very few of us can avoid these implications this may have been so in steve s case the earlier the trauma the more drastic the later effects in steve s case it may have begun when his mother discovered she was pregnant from then on she lived as an outcast and he suffered from it , a silent agony that was never recognized and never acknowledged it became overt as he matured and it was a mysterious disease no one knew how it happened or why oncologists tried to suss out more and more about the disease so as to guess how long he might live as the cancer went on there was no more talk of cure , just sustaining but they will never find out the hidden mysteries involved in this disease by only examining cells we need to look at the generating source at origins and how it became engraved for a good deal of current research and my own clinical experience point to womb life as a serious culprit how could it not be ? a rapidly developing brain disrupted and distorted ? it is difficult to suss out because there can be forty years between the primal imprint and the outbreak of disease for it is my opinion that under ordinary circumstances people should not fall seriously ill with mysterious ailments at a young age , and is a young age in fact , i believe that when it does happen that an illness overtakes a person it is almost inevitable that premature afflictions will take place later in life and here we have a situation where it seemed the father was also banned or at least left with no contact with his son ever what we do not know is whether he went to an orphanage or a short time before he was adopted or not whether in those crucial days and weeks after birth whether he had love , hugs and caring or was bereft of all that ? if so , the suffering was compounded and the imprint embedded thus his future could have been foredoomed , an ineluctable force that eventually killed him i must add that i am using this example only to indicate the factors that play into later disease so that we can all be more aware of the impact of early life i know that there are genetic cancers that may have a purely hereditary source but it is also likely that there are many epigenetic cancers that come from imprinted trauma during life in the womb methylation to refine the notion a bit more , there are hereditary sources in later cancer that may only become apparent when the genetic tendencies are compounded with traumas in the womb we know now that methylation has an effect on some tumor suppressing cells so that the possible outbreak of cancer is increased we also know that in our therapy there is a great enhancement of natural killer cells after one year of treatment these cells keep on the lookout for newly forming cancer cells and move in to destroy them they are not strong at the beginning of therapy when imprinted pain is at its height tumor suppressor genes can cause cancer cells to die by blocking cell growth imprinted trauma can interfere with their functioning so they are but a weak army fighting the overwhelming force i have seen this in epilepsy where the attacks may be genetic but the level of imprinted stress puts the patient over the top , and frank disease erupts and when we remove some of the pain stress in these epileptics the seizures cease we have normalized the stress level so that the system can tolerate the input without producing a symptom thus , symptoms are often a sign of overload the body can tolerate just so much stimulation and then slops over into perhaps a migraine or high blood pressure we have seen this in some patients who were treated by untrained therapists who allowed too much pain to erupt , the patient becomes overloaded and she leaves with a headache we know what the mistakes were and we move quickly to avoid that happening in our therapy the patient can turn a seizure into what it really is , major very early trauma or , the birth trauma , and we then find that the seizure was the primal turned inside out that is , when early imprints are threatening they can become a seizure if there is that genetic tendency that tendency may drive from many sources genetics , epigenetics , a crash on a bike , serious high fever while being carried or in the first months of life still we rarely see a cancer in our patients which may be due to the therapy and also because most of our patients suffer from leaky gates they cannot repress effectively hence , they suffer all of the time but there is no massive repression with no outlet , often the requisite for later serious disease i believe cancer as a deep cellular affliction requires massive repression as we mature what this means is that great early imprinted pain calls into being massive repression to deal with it it is an automatic process so here we may have an anguished mother , no father which means the mother is all alone to face the birth , a birth that will force her to leave her child forever , and no warm , kind parent to make it alright on top of that we have a child perhaps totally on his own for the first critical weeks of his life until he is adopted let me add that there are critical periods for the fulfillment of need as we develop once that timetable has passed nothing can make up for the lack of fulfillment it can be ameliorated so as to keep the stress level low enough to avoid the symptom but nothing can erase the memory imprint that is the basic fact of pain pain which remains and forever leaves a basic tendency toward developing a symptom , drug taking or drinking there may be a way to deal with womb life traumas as our patient digs deeper and deeper into his unconscious he eventually comes to infancy in therapy that reliving can trigger off still more profound and remote imprints , the first line physiologic cellular components of the imprint set down while we are being carried in the womb the reliving of infancy trauma then incorporates the deep physiologic aspect which becomes resolved and integrated , as well it may be how we can relive and eliminate those preverbal events that is , we may undo the traumas that have lain inside us for decades the traumas that may result in serious disease steve s having been given away may have been an harbinger of future disease an ineluctable destiny it is for this reason that if one has had a womb life filled with sturm and drang the only way to avoid the unavoidable is to have a therapy that can ultimately dig down deep a prevention , for once a symptom sets in with possible end organ damage it may be too late now let s remind ourselves that these traumas are registered deep in the brain and create havoc , and they resonate higher up as we evolve and disturb our emotional and intellectual learning capacities all levels resonate with one another and form a single coherent entity , possibly through similar or identical frequencies to trigger off the top level can mean setting off the bottom rung of the memory , as well and unless the person has deep access to himself , not a usual occurrence , the illness is being compounded the pressure on the cells greater the early force has been dredged up by some circumstance in the present but has no where to go so it remains to create serious damage and tendency to catastrophic illness the more catastrophic the imprint the more catastrophic the affliction the force is so great that until one relives the first line or observes it there is no way to explain how ineffably powerful it is once felt or seen no one wonders how it can create major illness i want to emphasize how we can relive something that happened while we were being carried in the womb it has to do with resonance there seems to be a specific frequency and or chemical affinity between layers of the brain when we relive traumas in our therapy we eventually trigger off the related first line deeply imprinted early imprints that dislocated cellular functioning so we relive something in our childhood , a rejection , which gathers up into the reliving process the prototypic early imprint and the whole thing is relived more than relived , there is integration and resolution that means that the damaging womb life imprint is also integrated so that it no longer creates the tendency to disease the question is whether that disease tendency is really gone and really integrated has the imprinted been reversed ? we need to study methylation in our patients to see what kind of changes occur as a result of the therapy we want to know if we truly can permanently remove aspects of our history , of our early traumas so that all critical imprints can be reversed can we remove all latent tendencies ? that is the generating source , the origin that detoured cellular life can be removed and i believe it is the only way to do it to conquer the disease assuming it has not gone so far as to be fatal otherwise the cancer comes back time and again experts look to the properties of the cancer to figure out why when they should also look into one s early life to figure out why maybe therein lies the answer steve had an idea about all this for in the rolling stone of october , , he discusses all this in jobs met a bohemian girl named christann brennan they soon embarked on a big , messy teenage romance , taking lsd and talking about the primal scream , a book by arthur janov for jobs it was away to live more fully and a way to overcome the pain of being abandoned by his birth parents steve explained to me how both lsd and primal screaming opened up stored trauma in the medulla he would repeatedly talk about janov s ideas in regard to how mothers and fathers would fail to love their children and walk out on them in so many ways , creating and perpetuating trauma he knew but he could not know what was raging inside of him so profoundly buried into the antipodies of his mind he was brilliant about so much in his outer world and so bereft of the knowledge of what was killing him
