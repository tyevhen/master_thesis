i returned to work yesterday finally the patient i was worried about was still there he was weak and in a bit more pain , but he smiled a wide smile when i walked in we held hands and chatted for a few minutes he 's a very peaceful , serene , and humble man i think that 's why i feel so connected to him he 's mastered what it is i'm striving to master serenity and humility he is what i strive to be i will not soon forget him once he 's gone it was nice to see all of my patients again i felt so out of touch with where they were at in their rehabilitation some had progressed amazingly others had slid backwards slightly i had a lot of paperwork to catch up on , which was probably a good thing as it decreased my caseload for the day i think i 'd have been really tired if i 'd had to see my usual number of patients all in all , it was good to be back speaking of work , i still have n't heard about the job for which i interviewed on christmas eve that 's probably not a good sign i think they are hoping to get a less experienced applicant whom they would n't have to pay as much that 's the feeling i'm getting anyway out of my control now , but i do wish they would at least call my lungs are definitely feeling better i'm still short of breath with activity , though , so exercise has not been at the top of my list at least i 've been eating better i set up some new goals for exercise and eating one of the goals is to stop snacking after pm i 've been doing a lot of late night munching lately i think being more aware of what i'm eating , and when , will help me a lot it 's helped already by giving me back a sense of control i 'll let you know how it goes that 's all i 've got for now have a great day ! here 's one of favorite quotes to send you on your way we make a life by what we get we make a living by what we give winston churchill
