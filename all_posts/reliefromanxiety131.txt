as many of you will know , the first step on the road to recovery is to talk this can include going to your doctor , as they should have the best insight to help you on your way however , this is n't always the case which is sad to hear the first step i took was to go to my local gp , which unfortunately was n't too helpful even after the milestone of million people improving their attitudes towards mental health , not all health care professionals are versed in something which affects one in four of the population if i am correct , there is no legal requirement for gps to educated on mental health specifically my gp gave information to counselling services outside of the nhs , which no longer existed we were n't even aware that there was a counselling service on the nhs , even though the leaflet holding all of the information was right outside the doctor 's door at that stage , we searched through the internet to find counselling services on the nhs , but sadly the waiting list was very long something which i could not wait for therefore , we searched for private counselling services in my area , to which we ended up paying a high price every week it was somewhat beneficial , but not enough to help me with my severity of my anxiety for many , the option of private counselling may not even be possible , which raises concerns for those who really need help this needs to change finally , after many months of just getting by , i managed to get counselling on the nhs to which i had two different types even though the waiting list is super long , the quality of counselling and cbt is outstanding and i cannot thank the people who have helped me , enough i had two different forms in which i moved through the system , until i was well enough to be discharged once i finally got access to the services , my life slowly began to turn around alongside this , finally meeting an understanding doctor after years of struggle , meant that i got prescriptive medication which has changed my life even though we are moving in the right direction towards better mental health , many healthcare professionals are still not trained in such a common illness this is needed to save lives and i hope as time goes on , this will be possible without the important help that people need , it can become fatal we need more money and more awareness to what affects so many people once you do get the help , it can change your life so keep going ! best wishes , amy xx
