he was tiny he was different he was intriguing i first caught a glimpse of him while taking a short break from signing copies of my book purr therapy at the santa clarita , ca catoberfest celebration of cats and the cat rescue organization forgotten angels he was a little black kitten , significantly separated from the other forgotten angels adoptable kittens and cats the organization , after all , considered him a long shot for adoption first glimpse playing in his litter box at catoberfest in santa clarita , ca he was black , not a popular color for rescue cats but his differences from the others were much more significant than color this little kitten had only three legs , a large hernia and a near tragic back story he was thrown into a trash can , simply discarded , soon after birth if not for a passerby who heard his cries coming from a curb side trash can , he certainly would not have survived unable to imagine a greater evil than discarding a defenseless newborn kitten into the trash , rescue volunteers assumed that he was born without his right rear leg but somewhat later , a veterinarian pointed out the bone protruding from the short stump and said that it looked like someone had cut off his leg in a senseless act of cruelty for someone with such a traumatic beginning , this little kitten named herbie the love bug by rescuers was amazingly cheerful , outgoing and loving he responded warmly to people , purring as soon as anyone looked at him , cuddling closely with anyone willing to hold him i could n't believe how this little animal loved people despite everything someone had done to him so early in life playing with a forgotten angels volunteer at catoberfest i watched as he rolled and played joyously in his litter box , while the forgotten angels volunteer sitting by his cage kept trying to re direct him to a toy filled little bed on the other side of the cage playing in the litterbox ! she scolded you have enough strikes against you already , sweetheart ! ca n't you just sit nicely in your little bed and look pretty ? but he dashed around , exuberant , full of life , showing off , spilling litter with every move as i headed back to my book signing area , i hoped and prayed that someone would adopt him before my next break but no one did plenty of people stopped to look at him and to read his heart rending story posted atop his cage but no one wanted a kitten who was crippled and who needed three surgeries in the near future i sent bob an email about this captivating little cat he wrote back that he felt haunted by the story of this poor little guy and wondered if we might think of offering him a forever home i set my phone down and started talking with people about purr therapy and listening to their stories of the cats they loved and the ones they had loved and lost dr tracy mcfarland , my all time favorite vet who rescued our beloved , late timmy and gus when they were tiny kittens sixteen years ago and entrusted them to us , joined me at the signing , autographing copies of the book which is dedicated to her for many at catoberfest who were patients and who considered dr tracy by far the greater celebrity present my husband and i are emailing each other about herbie , i whispered she smiled and put her arm around me he 's a wonderful kitten , very , very special , she said and he could n't go to a better home are you really going to take him home to arizona with you ? bob and i discussed the logistics via email i had to come back to santa clarita the next weekend for another barnes and noble signing i had planned to fly by myself but we took a deep collective breath and i changed my plans bob and i drove back four days later and , after the signing was finished , we traveled to the high desert town of palmdale to pick up this new addition to our family he was with a bunch of other cats at a local petsmart , snuggled with his little friend kirby , a beautiful gray and white kitten who had become his special buddy in his foster home bob and i paused , torn , at the enclosure should we take them both ? that would make five cats it seemed to be tipping the balance into crazy cat collecting oh , my god , kirby is so cute ! bob said , looking through the glass but he 's so beautiful and so perfect , someone will adopt him soon for sure poor little herbie does n't have the same chance vicki , a forgotten angels volunteer , looked a little tearful as she held our new kitten it 's so hard to say goodbye to this one , she said he is such a love but we 're so thrilled he has a home saying goodbye to vicki and then off to arizona ! we put herbie in a carrier and took him to our car where a fully equipped kennel with bed , food and water and a litter box , awaited him for the nine hour journey the long car trip has never been such a pleasure though he cried briefly , the kitten soon relaxed and rejoiced , purring loudly and cuddling in my arms and then bob 's as we took turns driving the miles flew by somewhere before the arizona border , bob decided that herbie was too close to hammie , the name of our youngest adult cat he likes to have a distinct name for each cat so that they will come usually when called we decided to name this one oliver or ollie everything was set or so we thought previous kitten introductions have been easy , thanks to the sweetness of our alpha cat gus , who has embraced every kitten coming into the house and mandated quick acceptance by the others but gus had died at age this summer and our three surviving cats have spent the months since both grieving his loss and jockeying for position in the household bringing a handicapped kitten into the mix did n't improve anyone 's mood ollie is undaunted by his limitations a missing leg and a large hernia to our surprise , our testy young female cat sweetpea was the first to befriend oliver after his obligatory several sequestered days , the mutual sniffing under the door and the growlings of various intensities ollie was delighted to have a friend , albeit one with definite mood swings when she tired of his playing , she would bop him on the head he would roll over , purring and simply wait for her irritation to pass sweetpea and oliver but maggie and hammie were less easily convinced that oliver was a welcome addition to the family maggie , weary of kittens and wanting to live in peace and quiet , took up residence in the linen closet , glaring out through a crack in the door hammie , our pampered and adored baby , had a more extreme reaction hiding in dark corners , running from the kitten , wailing loudly when visitors paid more attention to oliver than to him , refusing to let me touch him if i had just held the kitten , throwing up prodigiously all over my laptop computer , jumping up and ripping the sunday new york times from my hands , shredding the paper and nipping me he started to limp suspiciously similar to oliver 's gait , stopped eating and crawled under the bed for hours at a time we rushed him to his vet who could find absolutely nothing wrong with him and no reason he should be limping , though she ran a battery of tests we started calling the episode hammie 's hissy fit then gradually , the tensions eased maggie napped on the bed with ollie nearby maggie and ollie hammie stopped growling and started to play when i woke up in the middle of the night recently , i was stunned to see all four cats cuddled at the end of the bed and hammie and ollie were sleeping entwined with each other oliver and hamish hammie through it all , ollie has adjusted joyfully to his new home , his wonderfully optimistic , easy going temperament serving both him and us well when he was rejected by another cat , he would simply back down and play by himself or seek cuddling from us if you look at him , if you touch him , he purrs he happily welcomes visitors to our home and we wonder if we have another potential therapy cat in this sweet kitten who lives with such joy , exuberance and love helping bob with his stretches such a loving kitten ! secure in his forever home however he grows up , he is ours and we are his we 'll manage his expensive surgeries to repair his large umbilical hernia and to remove the stump of his right rear leg with the exposed bone we 're weathering the high drama of cat introductions that seems to be winding down and we have fallen hopelessly in love with a little kitten whose spirit could not be crushed by human cruelty someone 's trash has become our latest treasure
