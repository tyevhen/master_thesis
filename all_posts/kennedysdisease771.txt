a followup article in the new york times by pam belluck dismisses some of the fears people have regarding gene editing since huntington s disease is mentioned , that is a good sign for those of us with families living with kennedy s disease to read the entire article , follow the title link gene editing for designer babies ? highly unlikely , scientists say now that science is a big step closer to being able to fiddle with the genes of a human embryo , is it time to panic ? could embryo editing spiral out of control , allowing parents to custom order a baby with lin manuel miranda s imagination or usain bolt s speed ? news that an international team of scientists in oregon had successfully modified the dna of human embryos has renewed apprehensions that babies will one day be designed but there are good reasons to think that these fears are closer to science fiction than they are to science here is what the researchers did repair a single gene mutation on a single gene , a defect known to cause by its lonesome a serious , sometimes fatal , heart disease so are most physical diseases and psychiatric disorders the genetic message is not carried in a character tweet it resembles a shelf full of books with chapters , subsections and footnotes so embryonic editing is unlikely to prevent most medical problems but about , medical conditions are linked to specific mutations , including huntington s disease , cancers caused by brca genes , tay sachs disease , cystic fibrosis , sickle cell anemia , and some cases of early onset alzheimer s repairing the responsible mutations in theory could eradicate these diseases from the so called germline , the genetic material passed from one generation to the next no future family members would inherit them but testing editing approaches on each mutation will require scientists to find the right genetic signpost , often an rna molecule , to guide the gene snipping tool in the study reported this week , it took tries to find the right rna , said juan carlos izpisua belmonte , a co author and geneticist at the salk institute dr greely noted that while scientists work to get human embryonic editing ready for clinical trials currently illegal in the united states and many countries , alternate medical treatments for these diseases might be developed they may be simpler and cheaper photo https rhapsodyinwords com
