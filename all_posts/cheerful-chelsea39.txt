when i'm taking a tumble over the bell curve of my depression progress it can be hard to distinguish the progress i 've made if i'm asked about the things i 've accomplished recently i 'll shake my head because i ca n't think of anything besides forcing myself to breathe through my loud sobs the higher you climb , the harder the fall feels give me a few moments to recover and i might be able to tell you about that wedding i went to as a plus one , i might say that i'm feeling fairly good about decorating my office on my own but of course i'm not quite satisfied with it yet or i might talk about that huge party i attended the other week the party was something that i had n't given a second thought about ever since we received the invitation it seemed like an impossible task , so why would i allow myself to stress over it for a month or so ? it was going to be full of people that i had never met , scary there would be some people that knew far too much about me despite having never met me also scary and yet i found myself turning my ear towards the talk of how amazing it would be because they throw 'legendary parties' , and to be honest if a photo booth is involved it 's likely that i 'll be won over a week before the big event i 'd agreed to go of course i went back and forth in my mind about actually going there was a certain dress code implied so i went shopping with the 'future mother in law' callie unfortunately as we wandered around the shops i found myself slipping into an old routine my mum can probably remember some unbearable shopping trips with me i just did n't want to be there , the bright lights and loud music were getting to me and in my mind i was convinced that anything i tried on would look horrendous so why would i even bother taking something into the changing room when a public meltdown was likely unfortunately at the time mum was unaware of what was going on with me , i 'd hidden it like a pro i was n't 'in a mood' and i certainly was n't hating spending time with her i was just incredibly uncomfortable , i was paranoid that everyone was looking at me , i was anxious and had no self confidence that little scenario came into play once again last week i 'd reach out and touch a dress or a top here and there , callie would look hopeful as i had shown some interest , only for me to brush it off and say let 's just look for something for you once again i was having a crisis of confidence , hating the way i looked and felt in clothes i 'd decided to send a message to robbie to say that he should just go without me and enjoy himself with our friend that was staying with us typically i ended up face down in bed until an hour before everyone was leaving for the party i had been crying most of the day , sleeping for the rest and in my waking moments kicking myself for what i was about to miss out on apparently i just love forcing myself into these situations where i have to shovel some food down my throat whilst finding something to wear and slapping on some make up to hide the dark circles , all in a flash of the time i 'd usually take to prepare myself for just going outside ! fortunately i had talked myself into the mindset of it 's a celebration of three people 's birthdays the attention is on them , and everyone else is just looking to have a good time yes , i had to meet a lot of people yes , it was uncomfortable at times my clumsy self came out to play as i missed my mouth and poured half a cocktail over my lap but oh well ! i was wearing all black , we were outside in near darkness and most people were so drunk or pre occupied that they would n't have noticed i really wish that i did n't have to depend upon having a drink or two to make myself comfortable in those situations it definitely is n't something that should become a habit of anyone who struggles in social situations it should n't be used as an alternative to getting proper help for these kinds of issues i do n't tend to drink an excessive amount as it 's not fun for anyone involved , but on the rare occasions when i'm surrounded by people and feeling quite nervous , a drink can help calm my jitters and allows my shoulders to sink back down to where they are supposed to be surprisingly i actually enjoyed myself , the night went by fairly quickly the worst part of it was a conversation i had with two girls that are family friends of my fiance i was waiting with someone at the bar and they were introduced to me they knew that robbie and i met at university , they knew we went to durham obviously , as it turned out , they did n't know about me dropping out i was asked how my final year went and whether i 'd received my final mark before or after graduating a party did n't seem like an appropriate place to say i did n't finish uni , i fell into a deep depression and almost had myself committed , instead i replied with a cleverly phrased , yet honest answer which was that i left university with a i left my second year having achieved that grade from the work i did on my own , the work that i had to attend meetings about to ensure that i could produce some work in an alternative way to everyone else on the course i taught myself , albeit poorly , to produce social statistics and use some software which i would happily never look at or utter the name of ever again i did n't graduate with a , i did n't receive a diploma however , durham awarded me with a certificate for the everything i did manage to achieve , something which will eventually take pride of place in my office to remind me of how much i gained whilst i was there and how much it almost cost me it very nearly cost me my own life , it took away some of my sanity and it took a substantial amount of money despite all of that i gained a best friend who will remain my partner in crime even if we do n't get to see each other much i gained some incredible memories , some lovely and loyal friends and of course best of all , i found the person i'm going to spend the rest of my life with
