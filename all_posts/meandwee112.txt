disclaimer these posts are dedicated to following along with the book deliberate motherhood key powers of peace , purpose , order joy , a compilation of essays on motherhood written by authors who contribute to the power of moms website each month has a different power to focus on with the purpose of finding peace , purpose , order and joy in the role of motherhood i will be writing various posts each month based on that theme you do n't have to have the book to follow along though ! january 's theme is acceptance during the months that paige was first starting to see therapists for her delays back when she was around months old or so and then she was diagnosed with pdd nos an autism spectrum disorder , i was struggling to understand my daughter was she ok ? was her personality her own , or was it something reflected from her disorder ? i did n't know what to think i did n't know what was her or what was the delay it took a long time to figure out what little things were just normal everyday personality traits for a year old and what things were signs of her diagnosis i was overwhelmed and sad this was my first baby and i had no idea what was normal or what was a red flag why was this happening ? why my little girl ? i cried a lot well , after some time , peace all came down to acceptance my daughter was a miracle we 'd waited for her for so long she was sunny , bright , happy , silly , sweet , cute , and clever she certainly was very smart , and knew just how to make us smile nothing would change that no diagnosis would modify these things in her so why should i let her diagnosis define her ? she was still the same person once i chose to accept that my daughter was perfect just as she is , everything fell into place i stopped worrying so much about her future and realized she 's just fine as she is she is learning how to be more flexible , how to make friends and have social interactions with other kids , and a whole host of other skills that will enhance her life she 's doing great and she 's going to be just fine see , sometimes our children come into the world and we expect that we have influence in who they are it turns out , we actually have very little control in that area we can discipline we can guide we can suggest but in the end , our children reveal a little bit of themselves to us every single day it 's already been done we have to buckle up and enjoy the ride noah , i can already tell , is a more typical child he engages with me easily and is pointing , waving , clapping and doing these things paige never did he is also very willful and loves to get into things paige always listened when i said no he just ignores me and grins he opens every cabinet and drawer pushes every button he should n't ignores his toys in favor of the cable box or tv remote or telephone noah is his own curious person when i get frustrated with his antics , i remember to accept him as he is i feel gratitude for who he is knowing that his behavior is typical and healthy when i accept my children , i get a rush of patience i did n't have before my frustration can melt away to love i'm able to see things as they really are and enjoy the moment when they are crying , fussing , moaning and groaning all at once i accept it i smile and know that it will be over soon too soon so , in essence , acceptance is a powerful tool it can take a stressful frustrating moment and turn it into a moment of peace and forgiveness i accept my children every single day , as they accept me i'm not perfect they are not perfect but we accept each other 's love and that is what makes our world go 'round accepting those around you for who they really are is a gift it sets you free to live in the moment what do you accept about your loved ones ? is there something you need to accept in your life that would make things go more smoothly ? save
