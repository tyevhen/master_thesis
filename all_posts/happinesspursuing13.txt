for the first time since i started this blog , i have a whole stack of things that i want to say in the past , my intent when i came here has been very singular and it was usually just to scream into the darkness but , lately for some reason i 've felt a new level of engagement with the blog and you guys right now , though , i'm going to talk about podcasts bare with me , this really is going somewhere when i first learned what podcasts were a few years ago , i did n't think that they were for me that 's really kinda silly because i 've always enjoyed spoken word entertainment from listening to my dad 's bill cosby records when i was a kid to political talk radio to a whole host of npr shows it took me a while to warm up to podcasts but once i did i found a handful that , now , i listen to regularly wtf with marc maron , savage love with dan savage , the moth , the smartest man in the world with greg proops , and judge john hodgman of those , the two that i never miss are wtf and savage love all of them are entertaining and most make me laugh but i get something more out of wtf and savage both men are intelligent , articulate , funny and bring a view of the world that 's outside of the normal for me now , here 's why i'm telling you about this in an episode of wtf from early june , maron interviewed a man named todd hanson most of you probably do n't know who hanson is i did n't he 's a veteran writer as the onion that alone makes him incredibly interesting to listen to he 's also suffered from long bouts of major depression most of his life in his conversation with maron he breaks himself open and gives us all a good look at what he 's gone through i wo n't say it 's fun to listen to but it 's certainly cathartic if you get anything out of my little blog here , you definitely should listen to this episode go here to listen a few notes first , i suddenly find that i have a christian readership i'm sure that there have been a few of you lurking out there all along but lately , well , you know who you are and you know what 's been going on i bring this up because if you have delicate ears when it comes to language and adult topics , you might not want to put this show in them for the same reason , this probably is n't something you want to listen to on speakers at work second , maron 's shows' free availability expires so if you think you might want to listen this sometime but not just now , you should go ahead and download it it might not be available when to you come back to it later third , if you 're a weepy kind of person , do n't listen to this in a place where you should n't produce a tear or two because you probably will that 's it for now go , listen , you 'll definitely get something out of it
