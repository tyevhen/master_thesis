i was sent an email from a friend who related a sermon she had heard on the sunday before thanksgiving i really liked the idea and thought i would pass it along make a commitment to yourself that whenever you walk through a doorway you will think about your life at that moment and find things to be grateful for one of the things about this doorway practice is that it not only helps center us in gratitude when we are entering our homes to be with those we love , but also when we are leaving our homes facing a stressful or tough day it helps expand our horizons of gratitude by asking us to be grateful throughout our lives and not just in the good times
