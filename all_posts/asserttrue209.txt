in writing a book on mental illness which is topping out , now , at k words , i find that although i have n't exactly written an anti psychiatry screed , i 've come about as close to that designation as you can come without sounding like a full on psychiatry bashing lunatic where 's the dividing line ? for one thing , i stop short of saying there 's no such thing as mental illness i believe that the utility of the illness model is just barely useful enough not to discard it completely i also stop short of saying psychiatry has nothing to offer , or that drugs have nothing to offer , whereas many anti psychiatry zealots are willing to go there i ca n't go there unless that 's where the evidence points we know the evidence does n't point there , so let 's not pretend it does on the other hand , psychiatry not only psychopharmacology , but modern psychotherapy deserves criticism on many fronts , and it 's not hard to produce evidence on many of those points , so that 's all fair game my book is full of criticism and footnotes hundreds of footnotes in medicine , there are many solutions , which is to say therapeutic options that work for about of people who try them this includes placebos , antidepressants , antipsychotics , herbal cures , cures for alcoholism the year over year retention rate for alcoholics anonymous is about , various psychotherapies , low dose electroconvulsive therapy , sham ect , trans cranial magnetic stimulation , and probably diets , exercise , and much else frankly , a response rate , whether it 's for a cancer treatment or a mental disorder , whether it involves real medicine or placebos or sham treatments , is not something you just walk away from when people are desperate for relief , they 'll try something that works of the time and well they should ! but we should be honest about response rates , remission likelihoods , etc , in treatment of mental illness , as in treatment of cancer or any other malady and this is where the mental health industry if you can call it that has done a remarkably poor job patients are led to believe antidepressant drugs mostly work , when in fact they mostly do not they 've also been told ect electroconvulive therapy mostly works , when in fact the benefits beyond the one month point are essentially nil and there 's no difference in long term outcome between sham ect placebo and real ect , something i go into it the book citing fda 's own internal literature review also , cbt cognitive behavioral therapy has been so grossly oversold as a treatment modality , with claims of its superiority to other modalities , that i felt an obligation to counter some of the misleading claims made for cbt so in the book , i devote a few pages to that again , not because cbt does n't work for some people it clearly does or does n't have any utility at all , but because it 's been preposterously oversold i 'll devote a future blog post to that for more information about my upcoming book and how to get free sample chapters , please add your name to the mailing list no updates have been sent out yet i'm not interested in spamming anyone and please check back here often thank you !
