this may be a short post , as i am totally wiped out my first three days of the mood disorder program , wednesday , thursday , and friday , were great but long mentally , i was whipped going into the weekend well , all of that sitting must have ruined me physically , too , as my mile run yesterday was absolutely brutal it was going so poorly , and i was feeling so fatigued , i probably should have cut it short , but of course i did n't i spent the rest of the day barely moving i did get a couple of chores done then my friend , wendy , was kind enough to have me over for dinner it was nice to spend some time with her before collapsing in bed unfortunately , my fatigue has continued today i was scheduled to run or miles , but that was unrealistic with how tired i felt instead , i shoveled what little snow remained on the driveway and sidewalk , rested , watched some football , took jet around the block , and did little else i'm hoping to recoup before i start with the mood disorder program again tomorrow i think another good night of sleep will do wonders until then , i 've got more resting to accomplish
