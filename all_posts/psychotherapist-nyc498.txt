in recent years , there has been an increased emphasis on taking medication to overcome anxiety or depression while medication can be helpful , medication alone often is n't enough aside from the possible side effects , medication alone does n't help you to make the kind of changes you need to make to overcome anxiety or depression rather than relying on medication alone , attending psychotherapy with an experienced therapist is usually more effective medication alone is n't as effective as psychotherapy to overcome anxiety or depression medication alone is n't enough to overcome anxiety or depression believing that medication alone is enough for you to overcome anxiety or depression is a seductive idea it sounds simple and quick there are lots of commercials on tv that lead you to believe that all you have to do is pop a pill to fill better but this idea is deceptive psychotherapy is effective in helping you to make changes in your life to overcome anxiety or depression just taking medication alone wo n't help you to make much needed changes in your life to overcome anxiety or depression there might be things that you 're doing or not doing that might be contributing to your anxiety or depression by simply taking a pill , you wo n't learn to make the necessary changes that might be exacerbating your condition for instance , medication wo n't help you to develop emotional intelligence to handle your problems developing emotional intelligence is something you learn to do in therapy also , medication alone wo n't help to motivate you to engage in the type of self care that might actually make it unnecessary to take medication so , for instance , research has shown that , in many instances , doing exercise can be as effective to alleviate anxiety or depressive symptoms as medication and without the side effects in therapy , you can develop the motivation to exercise and engage in other types of self care that can help you to feel better in many cases , either psychotherapy alone or psychotherapy and medication can be effective , depending upon the client and the severity of the symptoms it 's very important that you consult with your doctor before you stop taking medication see the link below for my article about apa research , which reveals that psychotherapy is effective , but it 's underutilized i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or send me an email josephineolivia aol com apa research reveals that psychotherapy is effective but underutilized photo credit lism via photopin cc
