things are coming back to normal i'm feeling better the thoughts have lessened maybe it 's the new , temporary medication my psychiatrist prescribed maybe the darkness just ran its course whatever the reason , i'm feeling better thank god ! perhaps my outing yesterday helped things , too i crossed something off my bucket list yesterday i finally attended a live prairie home companion show i 've been a listener for years but had never seen the show before it was everything i had hoped it would be my face hurt from smiling so much ! afterward , my friends bill and cindy treated me to a very fancy dinner at a restaurant i had never visited before it was quite a treat very fine food and an amazing chocolate turtle cake dessert ! it was one of the nicest outings i 've had in quite awhile if you 've never heard prairie home companion , check it out it just may cheer you up if you 're feeling down so i 've narrowed down my bucket list fortunately , my friend bill said he 'd help me narrow it even further this summer skydiving ! anyone else care to join us ?
