i am venturing into dangerous territory these days but i am feeling overwhelmed about how i should be approaching jack 's issues at school i do not want to be a parent that the teacher dreads talking to , i do n't want to be a parent bully but i am worried that my son is not getting all of the services he needs at school it just does n't seem right to me that a child with what i would consider substantial fine motor deficits is only seen times a month at school and gets minutes of special education a day when he ca n't sit still in his chair for minutes i volunteered in jack 's class yesterday it was actually a very pleasant experience in terms of meeting the other kids and watching jack handle the transitions fairly well , even with mommy there as a distractor he went from center to center without complaint , even though he was n't coming to mine right away when he came to mine he talked to me a lot , but did n't completely monopolize my time that being said , yesterday morning was the time that the ot was working with him , so she was moving from center to center with him and redirecting his attention frequently and she is good the three times a month that she gets to see him which is not nearly enough but even after she left , jack sat on the rug with his lunchbag waiting to go to the cafeteria , he did not get up and come over to me , until his name was called for lunch , at which time he came up and threw his arms around me and said mommy , i sure am gonna miss you ! what a kid i met the three little boys he is constantly talking about they seem like nice kids , and they had quite a lot to say to me about jack , which was so cute , and comforting at the same time they like him too ! the rough part the center i was running involved cutting pictures out of magazines and writing the names of the objects all starting with s so i helped every child in the class spell and write these words and i saw where jack 's handwriting is in comparison to every other child in that class i ca n't even explain it all of these letters were formed completely independently , from dictation half the time we need to hold jack 's hand still and force him to form the letters his strength is not good either , it is a constant struggle to get him to push down with enough force to really make his writing readable in class he has the short pencil , a special grip , and a slanted work top to try and help him gain more control and the ot was drawing a box where each letter should be in order to try and help him keep his writing somewhat straight , as he is usually all over the place did it help ? i think so but what good does this really do for an hour once a week ? ? ? ? how is he supposed to retain these techniques when they are done so sporadically ? i am sure the special educator tries to reinforce as much as she can , but there is no room for much individualized attention in a class of years olds , so how can his teacher be expected to do these things regularly ? the school psychologist is coming to observe jack on thursday , and i am hopeful that there will be some recommendations for changes , or in other words , increased services if there are not , then mommy may have to request an iep meeting it 's october , there is plenty of time to get a good system in place for jack and telling me that they are short on aides is just not going to cut it with me if there is a need , they need to fill it end of discussion
