there 's an interesting discussion going on at theserverside com right now someone asked what s the strangest thing about the java platform ? i can think of a lot of strange things about java space precludes a full enumeration here offhand , i 'd say one of the more disturbing aspects of java is its ill behaved unpredictable system gc method according to sun , system gc is not reliable when control returns from the method call , the virtual machine has made its best effort to recycle all discarded objects notice the wording best effort there is absolutely no guarantee that gc will actually force a garbage collection this is well known to anybody who has actually tried to use it in anger the problem is , in the rare case when you actually do need to use gc , you really do need it to work or at least behave in a well understood , deterministic way otherwise you ca n't make any serious use of it in a mission critical application not to put too fine a point on it , but if a method is not guaranteed to do what you expect it to do , then it seems to me the method becomes quite dangerous i do n't know about you , but i rely on system calls to work if you ca n't rely on a system call , what can you rely on ? suppose you 've written a reentry program for a spacecraft , and you have an absolute need for a particular routine e g , to fire retro rockets to execute , without interruption , starting at a particular point in time the spacecraft will be lost and the mission will fail at a cost to taxpayers of million if the retro rockets do n't fire on time or do n't shut off on time now imagine that just as your program 's fireretrorockets method is entered , the jvm decides to stop the world and do a garbage collect houston , we have a well , you know the point is , if you could call system gc ahead of time , and count on it doing exactly what you want it to do collect garbage immediately , so that an uncommanded gc wo n't happen at the wrong moment , you could save the mission arguably obviously , this example is somewhat academic no one in his right mind would actually use java to program a spacecraft , in real life and that , i think , says a great deal about the java platform
