i was a yr old man re entering university when i met lydia she was a nurse and the most beautiful person i had ever met she blew me away i had severe self esteem issues and felt i wasn t worthy of her or her family but she still stayed with me i told a few lies to cover up fro what i believed were my inadequacies and she still stayed with me even when they were uncovered i couldn t believe i had been so lucky to meet her and that she loved me months later she got pregnant and we decided to keep the baby we moved in together and were so happy i borrowed lots of money to pay for things as i was a full time student but i worked jobs too our lives were perfect i graduated and we moved house as i got a new job our daughter was healthy and a real character because lydia worked nights at weekends i had looked after our daughter every weekend and stopped going out to see my friends i gradually became depressed but didnt realise this i also had mild bi polar moments which got me suspended from work this caused financial problems and we decided to move in with our respective families for a short while to get out of debt i still had my daughter every weekend and lydia would stay over from time to time we had family holidays etc and sometimes things were really good many other times it was mundane i did nothing to help our situation and eventually lost my job due to innapropriate comments at work not long after this lydia said she felt numbed by me and didnt feel she could love me anymore i said to give me a chance and she did , she would come over one night every other week but i still didnt do anything constructive to get us out of the situation i did however start to go to counselling and i saw a psychiatrist i went weekly for months and they made me realise that i had been ill and that i had a low self esteem due to my own problems when i was a young child i worked really hard to sort myself out and took medication that really helped me i have always had my daughter every weekend throughout this time our last few sessions together were like an epiphany for me i realised that i truly love lydia and that i was harbouring anger from not being able to socialise and that i was indeed worthy of her i realised i had not shown her the love that she deserved and came out hell bent to show her who i really am and to let her see that i was ill but now have been cured for the first time in my life i liked myself i was able to truly love her and to be myself without putting up barriers or falsehoods i had and still do complete clarity in thought and belief in myself i tried to speak to her and get her to see me as i wanted to apologise for what i had done to her i wanted to show her how wonderful she was and to let the light of my love shine down on her we met up and i asked her to open her eyes to me and let me have the opportunity to show her what i am now i asked her to let me love her because i only just realised that it is all i want to do she then told me that she couldnt , that she felt numb to any feelings with me and had started seeing someone else although she said it wasnt serious she is now with him all the time i am so angry with myself that i could hurt such a beautiful woman she has given me the most wonderful daughter and she is a good mother i have ruined her in many ways i feel that my life has been robbed from me by my mental health and self esteem issues i have a clear bill of health now and know i can never be where i was again i cannot consider stopping my love for her because i need to show how i have got better and am the right man now it wasnt that i didnt care or didnt love , i was ill we see eachother a few times a week and every time i see her or my daughter i breakdown i try not to do this in front of them if i felt i wasnt worthy then i would walk away but i am not going to fall into old traps of giving in when things are tough it rips me apart when i know she is with her new guy but i havent got mad about it i just want to find a way to let her see what i am , to see if i am somone she can trust and love if after seeing this she cant love me then i will walk away but until i get the chance to show who i am then i will still continue to tell her how much i love her i dont want to hurt her but i cant let the opportunity go for the greatest happiness in hers , mine and my daughters life can you help me ? anybody been in this situation ? i know i should let love go and it will come back to me but she doesnt know what she would come back to and i need to show her or all i have done to get myself well is wasted i know it is beneficial for me to be strong , but i tell you , i would rather have stayed in my own apathy than be reborn into this world of pain i feel now answer keep telling her you love her and want to be with her and keep showing her you love her now you have learned to hold on to the best things in life ! question my boyfriend takes me for a complete joke but he is my sons father what should i do ? at first my relationship was wonderful he was my knight in shining armour i had been through a horrendous years i had been in a very abusive relationship had been attacked by all my ex boyfriends friends and then randomly attacked and ended up going to the priory for help to get over what had happened to me i managed to get as in my a levels and was off to university when i met my new boyfriend he was lovely to me and it was such a relief to finally have some happiness i ended up in a really bad uni and in hospital due to a stomach infection when i decided to leave uni because it wasnt suitable i found out i was pregnant it was quite a shock and i moved out to live with my boyfriend and his family in order to hide it from my parents everything was fine at first until i ended up not going out at all and he became really controlling of me to the point where he had to go through all my emails i eventually told my parents and they welcomed me back home and let him move in that they had never met before everything was fine but he started to be nasty to me putting me down all the time then i had my baby i wanted the best for my child so i decided to stay at home my boyfriend didnt like this as soon as i had the baby he didnt even say well done he was just nasty to me instantly i cant legally live at his house and he is in allot of debt so he cant afford to move anywhere i however have been saving money by living at home i have tried to help him pay off his debts i have tried to get him into a good university but all my efforts are completely unappreciated and he is just rude to me then he had a fight with my mum where he nearly punched her because she asked him why he was pressuring me into something so as a result my dad asked him to leave i maintained our relationship even though he comes here forces me to have sex with him then leaves i am scared that because of my past needing mental health he will try and take the baby away from me he comes here is nice to me for five mins i think maybe things will be different he forces me to have sex with him and then is rude to me he thinks that my mum is the devil and that she is racist he is muslim when she is not as she has many muslim friends i want him to be part of my babys life as i want the best for him i am planning on going to a better university next year and taking the baby with me i want to work hard and provide him with good opportunities but apparently i am wrong for wanting the best for my baby then his mother wanted to see the baby which is fair enough but i was informed in the middle of the night that i would have to travel hours when im really ill the next morning to see her i could of been given a bit more notice and he cant just take the baby as i am breastfeeding but when i said that i cant make it with that short notice when i am this ill he said to me that why should he have to make an appointment for his mum to see the baby so i invited them here instead to which he said that i think his mum is going to travel to see me his mum is not old she is in her late s there is no reason why she shouldnt he sends me rude messages about my family the whole time like this one oh poor u and ur f g family ur all the innocent ones now and its all my problem u f g piece of shits i f g hate you all but unfortuantly i have a kid that connects me with u devils and im not ging away from his life so go and get f d and do watever u want that ur mum wud love to se u do like come back home drunk f g , my kid will want to know me and he will know me on top of ur mums fat ugly big head i am his dad weather she likes it or not ! number one i dont even drink and number two my mum wants him to have a more active role in my babies life she doesnt have a problem with him being involved i am so ill he forces me to sleep with him sometimes unprotected when i dont want to then says to me if i get pregnant to have an abortion or he will abort the baby for me i just want him to leave me alone but i do still love him i know that having this baby was a big shock for him but he has done absolutely nothing for him i have done everything single handedly his family will obviously back him up i just want things to go back to how they were i am just trying to do whats best for my son and will never inform him of how his father has treated me as i dont want it to affect their relationship but im worried that he will play the same mind games with him being there one moment the next disappearing which isnt good for a child he is going to try and take him away from me i know it and i dont know what to do answer idk i havnt read it but this is why you should get married before having kids ! ! sex before marriage is badd lol
