dear ab curtiss i always read the news for the middle east do you think this affect my ability in treating my depression ? ? ? i am sending gratitudes to you from me and my wife because of your help has strongly affect positively our life regards , r dear r i m not sure if i understand your question are you telling me that listening to news from the middle east is causing anxiety for you because the news is not good that you are hearing , and it causes you to worry ? and that this worry about the news in the middle east is causing you to have more depression ? a b curtiss dear a b yes , you are right does watching or reading the news about the recent conflicts in the middle east help increasing depression ? r dear r like everything else , it depends upon your attitude if your attitude is to keep up with current events in the middle east , and keep yourself informed so that you can fulfill your civic responsibilities to vote , support those politicians that will carry out your wishes , and protect your own family and your community , that is one thing but if you dwell on all the negative possibilities to the point of becoming anxious , and never take any positive action as a result of the information you have , that is something else again that would be concentrating on the negative to no purpose and like all negative , anxious thinking can , indeed , lead back into depression a b curtiss
