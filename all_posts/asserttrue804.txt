it seems adobe cfo mark garrett , in a tourette 's like outburst , said recently at an industry event that microsoft silverlight adoption has really fizzled out in the last to months microsoft 's tim sneath director of the windows and silverlight technical evangelism team answered garrett 's charge in a defensive blog , where he listed a number of prominent marquee customers using silverlight in production and made the obligatory claim of million downloads for starters , silverlight shipped four months ago , sneath said , and in just the first month of its availability , we saw over million successful installations just on consumer machines that makes it official all three major contenders in the ria development space microsoft 's silverlight , adobe air , and sun 's javafx have now claimed million downloads in x number of days adobe has claimed it microsoft has claimed it see above , and a couple weeks ago jonathan schwartz of sun made the claim for javafx i do n't know why the number million is so magical it is certainly an interesting number it 's more than the populations of spain , syria , and canada combined it 's one in every people on earth think of all those starving babies in africa who 've downloaded javafx remarkable , is n't it ? what does it say when the top three ria framework contenders begin flaming each other in public debates over patently ridiculous adoption rate numbers ? i say ridiculous because the so called downloads are actually based on stealth installs adobe , for example , trojans air into acrobat reader and other product installers sun and microsoft are guilty of the same tactics what it tells me is that there 's no winner in this so called race which , in turn , tells me there 's been no substantial market uptake any time a successful product becomes a success in the market , it by definition penetrates and dominates the market in question , marginalizing the competition in beverages , there 's coke big winner , then pepsi also ran , then the long tail in almost every market , it 's that way there 's a dominator , an also ran , and a long tail we have not reached that point yet in the three way ria race we may never reach it , because it 's not obvious to me , at least that the software industry has embraced ria , as currently conceived , in any major way , and it might not , ever try this simple test ask ten people what 's the killer ria app of all time ? see if you get any agreement or anything but blank stares it may actually be that the ria wars are over , and nobody won in fact , if credibility is any indication , everybody lost
