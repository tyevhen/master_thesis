well , here it goes i'm going to reinvent myself in case you wonder who i was before , here 's my old blog let me tell you a little about myself oh see ? writer 's block already that 's why i'm reinventing myself because i know who i was , and i know where i want to go but right now i'm in a transitory state i have a phd in biomedical engineering my thesis studied the bones of hibernating bears this degree was difficult to achieve because ever since i was in my early 's i 'd been alternating between states of depression and states of high energy and motivation when motivated , i 'd make all these huge plans for myself then i 'd get burnt out and not complete any of them looking back , it 's a wonder i graduated at all last year , i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder ii , which means , well , exactly what i just said i have alternating depressed and energetic states do n't think these energetic states are all good it means i over commit myself , spend too much money , act impulsively , and eventually crash having bipolar disorder was not good for my career , to say the least i started out strong enough went to a nice post doc in a leading spinal cord injury lab but various problems got in the way , and eventually i mutually agreed with my boss that it was time for me to move on to other things i came back home to minnesota , where i have so many supportive friends and family here , i worked for a while in a major bookstore chain , and then got a job as a manager of a clean up crew at a nursing home neither job is what i dreamed of when i went to graduate school , but both have brought an opportunity to learn i see life in a non academic world for the first time in my adult life over the past year , i have learned much about how to be mindful of my mental state , and how to keep it stabilized a lot of the credit of my new mindfulness goes to dialectic behavioral therapy dbt , which i think could help everyone , not just those of us with mental illness now that i have recognized what i was and learned to control the beast , it 's time to reinvent myself my major goal at the moment is a monumental task i want to be accepted into a physican 's assistant program my time working in a nursing home has made me realize that caring for patients is a joy i have decided that psychiatry is the right field for me due to my new found knowledge of mental illness and my volunteer work as a counselor at a crisis hotline this goal will take a lot of preparation since i have to re take a bunch of prerequisite classes because my bachelor 's degree is too old in the interim , i'm going to get an emt certification to get some hands on patient care experience and just because i'm in one of those overly motivated states of mind i think the new me should come with a new blog yes i might be over committing but i'm going to try my darnedest and if i can get an entry every one or two weeks , i 'll go ahead and pay a professional to give my blog a make over i 've always wanted a professional looking blog and i 've heard a good blog supports a good applicant wish me luck !
