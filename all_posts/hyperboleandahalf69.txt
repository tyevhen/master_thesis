so i just remembered that i have to go to the dentist again today and suffer through the judging all over again only it 's going to be worse this time because i did n't even brush my teeth yesterday last time i went to the dentist , i brushed my teeth like , five times the day before and the dentist was still all up in her tower about my intermittent flossing and my bleeding gums guess what , dentist ? if someone poked you in the mouth with a metal spike , you would bleed too ! but somehow she thinks it 's my fault that i'm bleeding i'm pretty sure she 's a robot that 's why she has such a hard time understanding the relationship between stabbing and bleeding this also means that i am probably not going to survive most robots are malicious and vengeful , and my filthy teeth will only serve to aggravate the dentist further , so i really do n't see how i have a chance the only thing i can really think of is to wait until exactly the right moment and then throw water on the dentist , possibly causing it to short circuit now i just have to find a way to conceal the water so that the dentist does not become suspicious
