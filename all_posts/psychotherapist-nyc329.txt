in the past and indulge themselves in fantasies about how wonderful life could have been in this article , i 'll show how therapy can help a client to overcome this problem and give some tips that i

ended their relationship several years before how to get unstuck so you can free yourself from living in the past ann followed bill 's life on his facebook page as she read about how happy he was , she regretted breaking up with him when she ended their relationship , she felt they each wanted different things in their lives but now that she was reading about how happy he was and how much fun he was having , she felt she made a mistake she compared her life to his and she felt her life was dull the worst part was seeing the pictures of bill with his new girlfriend , which made ann feel jealous and made her regret even more that she ended her relationship with him she knew that the more she looked at his facebook page , the more unhappy she felt , but she could n't stop herself it had become an obsession that she felt embarrassed about since she was so focused on bill , she was n't giving herself a chance to get to know other men when she went out on dates , she compared her experience to the life she felt she could have had with bill and each man came up short as further proof that she had made a mistake by breaking up with bill and missed a chance to be happy , she thought about the relationships that did n't work out since she broke up with bill on some level , ann knew that she was making herself miserable , but she felt powerless to do anything about it ,

experiences in her former relationship with bill at the point where she broke up with him , she knew the relationship was n't right for her ann was able to concede this in our sessions but she could n't get over the feeling that his new girlfriend was reaping the rewards of a more mature , responsible bill and that if ann had only stuck it out , she would be happier now ann was filled with regret about this we also talked about how someone 's facebook page is n't always a reliable source of information about how things are in his or her life ann knew this in theory , but she felt sure that bill and his new girlfriend really were having a wonderful life together a life that she could have had with him if she had n't broken up with him ann was aware , at least on an intellectual level , that if she was happier in her own life , she would n't be so focused on bill her obsession was a distraction and defense against taking responsibility for her own happiness as opposed to imagining what life could have would have been with bill her obsession also kept her from looking at her own patterns for choosing men that resulted in unhappy relationships see my article learning to make better choices in romantic relationships as ann began focusing more on herself and less on her fantasies about bill , she began to take steps to improve her own life this helped her to feel more empowered since she was bored at work , she began a job search to find a job that would be more enriching once she began the search , she discovered that her skills and experience were in demand , and

really enjoyed how to get unstuck so you can free yourself from living in the past in the meantime , she heard from a former college friend , who remained friends with bill , that his life was n't all that it seemed to be on social media despite the happy photos that continued to appear on his facebook page , he and his new girlfriend were n't getting along for many of the same reasons that caused ann to end her relationship with him he continued to have a hard time settling down and being responsible ann also found out that he had mismanaged his business , and he was about to declare

life , things began to improve for her some tips on getting unstuck to free yourself from living in the past it 's easy to get caught up in fantasies and remain tied to a past that no longer exists and , possibly , never existed outside of your fantasies living life in the present is harder staying focused on the past keeps you from making changes in the present remember that people 's facebook page often is n't a true reflection of what 's really going on in their lives remember that your thoughts and feelings are n't facts and what you imagine to be true might not be the case just because you believe something to be true does n't make it true if you find yourself obsessively dwelling on the past and telling yourself that you could have been happier in a relationship or situation from the past , rather than giving these thoughts more power , be as objective as you can and question your thoughts ask yourself if these obsessive thoughts are serving another purpose like keeping you from being proactive to make changes in your life or if you 're punishing yourself with these thoughts ask yourself if you 're remembering the past accurately or are you rewriting history to make it look better than it was in actuality talk to friends that know you well , listen to what they have to say and consider their perspective if talking to friends does n't help , consider getting help
