i'm in the generation that straddles techo life i want to say i remember when but that does sound so very old okay , i remember when you stayed home to wait for a phone call , stood up to change channels , went to the neighbors' because they had a color tv , smith corona typewriters with the carriage return , carbon paper for duplicates , teachers handed out mimeos they 'd cranked out that smelled of fresh ink , libraries had microfilm , people wrote and mailed letters to communicate for my th grade invention , i wrote about a device that you could talk in to and it would type out your words mr shannon liked it , but said such a thing would never exist in college , i thought word processing was awesome until the computer crashed with your paper on it , in med school i got an answering machine , and no , i do n't remember my first remote control i do remember my first experience with e mail , i asked clink to show me , and the only person on her address list i knew was a mutual friend across the country i sent him an email and he wrote back to say that he and his wife and two children would be visiting and could they stay at my place for a week ? that was enough email for me for a while , but i did enjoy his visit and his wife , and his kids and clink has spent years telling people that i thought the dial up site i used to look at houses after all , if people were going to come visit like this , we needed a bigger place was much too slow and the internet would never catch on i often wonder how , as a somewhat extroverted , easily distracted person , if life would have been much different for me if there had been cell phones and texting and facebook back when i was a teenager would i have had a broader social life , would i have ever been able to study ? would i have had more fun ? would i have ever been able to do the work i needed to do to get into medical school with so many other distractions available ? would i have had a blog back then ?
