i hate crying , especially in public ! i cried at work today it was one of those frustration angry cries i was so frustrated and angry , my voice cracked and tears came out instead of words we were in the middle of one of those staff meetings i mentioned in this space yesterday how negative my work environment has been lately that 's what the meeting was about well , actually , that 's what it ended up being about i have no idea exactly why it was started , but we ended up airing resentments and concerns i 've been feeling the resentments floating around , so i guess it was good to air them , but i hate crying ! fortunately , i did get to say what i needed to say that i was feeling nit picked to death , that i felt we were n't working together as a team , and that i was tired of hearing only criticism , never anything positive it was when i told them i was doing the best i could that my voice cracked god , i hate that the fact is , i am doing the best i can i'm no longer very good at multi tasking , thanks to depression and ect , so i often miss a line on a form , forget to deliver a copy of some paperwork somewhere , or miss my productivity expectations the amount of paperwork i need to do is overwhelming , and i frequently do n't do it perfectly furthermore , i no longer care about perfection unfortunately , my colleagues value perfection and seemingly nothing less they never miss an opportunity to point out the missed line , the forgotten copy , or the lesser productivity none of which effects the treatment i provide my patients so , i said , i'm doing the best i can , and my voice cracked i stopped talking , but i could n't stop the damn tears they rolled down my face i was embarrassed i wanted to be anywhere else but there , but i stayed the tears eventually stopped , and we actually got a couple of things resolved as for the overall tone of the place ? too soon to tell i hope it changes i ca n't stand the negativity much longer and i do n't want to be reduced to tears at work ever again
