i'm back from my weekend away with my boyfriend , d it was a very nice weekend it was too short , as usual being back in his arms made me realize exactly how long it had been since we last saw each other , and that i missed him more than i knew we ate in , ate out , watched a movie , went running , visited with family , and of course , played with jet i'm so glad i had the opportunity to go , and i'm already looking forward to seeing him again it 's difficult to live so far apart from each other i ran miles along the milwaukee lakefront on saturday morning unfortunately , i did n't properly hydrate on friday , stayed up too late friday night , and felt tired before i even began running within the first mile , i knew it was going to be a long day i tried to focus on the new scenery around me , but i had to do mental gymnastics to keep myself going for almost three hours i almost completely ran out of energy with three miles to go , which forced me to take walk breaks the rest of the way but , once again , i did it , and i'm happy about that i'm also happy with how i recovered d and i ran miles together on sunday , and i had no difficulty with that so it was a mixed bag this weekend , and that was okay i'm grateful i was able to run and able to run in new , beautiful surroundings i 've not got much on my agenda this week my mood remains fairly steady i'm hoping to chat with my psychiatrist about returning to work when i see her on thursday i'm feeling ready to give it a shot i think i 'll be okay as long as i start slow and ease back into things i do n't actually know if i will have the opportunity to return to my previous position , but i'm lucky to be a physical therapist , as i know there are positions open elsewhere i 'll let you know how the conversation with my doc goes
