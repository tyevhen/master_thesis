the other day as i was driving somewhere with my sister , i turned to her thoughtfully and asked do you feel like you 've learned to hide when you do n't know something so people do n't blame it on unschooling ? because i feel like i do that automatically she agreed that she did that as well it 's not a good thing , though she said it 's not , i agreed , but it is a thing growing up as an unschooler , it often feels like people are watching you like a hawk , just waiting for you to stumble , so they can shout aha , i knew unschooling was n't a good idea ! you never want to provide fuel for other people 's judgement , so it becomes easier to just pretend you know what 's going on around you , or that you understand that unfamiliar word someone just used most people , regardless of their education , tend to do this to some extent , but i think unschoolers and homeschoolers can fall into the trap of doing this to a much larger extent , just because we know that our ignorance will likely be taken as a reflection of an entire philosophy and community it strikes me as rather ironic that those most concerned with how much unschoolers do or do n't know , those who frequently decide it 's appropriate to quiz people as soon as they discover their educational background , are actually making it harder for unschoolers to learn if you learn that expressing curiosity around strangers comes with the risk they 'll react badly to it based on your education , you 're going to quickly stop asking as many questions , and thus miss out on learning a lot of interesting things ! my ignorance is great when it comes to drawing i am , however , quite good at cooking ! i'm trying to unlearn that habit now , as an adult , since as my sister noted , it really is n't a good thing but right now i still only really feel comfortable showing ignorance around trusted people either unschoolers and unschooling types , or trusted friends from different communities who i know wo n't judge me for it , or think that unschooling has led to my , you know , not knowing everything lest it sound like i think unschoolers are less curious because of this , i do n't think that 's the case at all i just think the widespread judgement we face can , sometimes , lead to people being more cautious of which environments they express that curiosity in which , no matter how you look at it , is just a real shame you might also like my least favourite thing about unschooling grown unschooler chloe anne spinnanger the best thing learning advice from a learning life grown unschooler c kennedy i was unschooled from the linkwithin
