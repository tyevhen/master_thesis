our group pre run post run with friend gwen left and olympian , carrie tollefson i had a wonderful opportunity yesterday morning i got to run miles with an olympian after speaking at our track club 's banquet on saturday night , carrie tollefson , minnesotan and olympian in the meters , joined a large group of us for our sunday morning run it was cold but sunny the pace was a bit fast , not surprisingly , but i can even say i ran in front of an olympian for a short very short period of time ! seriously , it was a great opportunity carrie inspired us saturday evening with her message to , get after it ! matching her actions to her words , we all enjoyed her company sunday morning she was a humble , humorous , personable woman she and her husband would fit perfectly into our local running community consider that your invitation , carrie ! not only was it nice to hear , and meet , and run with an olympian , it was nice for me to get out and socialize saturday night was the first time i had seen most of my running friends since august or september , prior to this last depression episode and sunday 's group run was my first group run post depression episode as well when i fell behind the group halfway through the run , i had to remind myself it was okay my thoughts tried to go negative on me the pace was one i could have easily maintained last fall but , as i reminded myself , i am still healing and recovering i know i will soon find that pace easy once again , as long as i keep working and i have no plans to stop working so , good for me ! i got out , socialized , ran , and battled the negative demon thoughts all of this despite not feeling my best it shows me i can take the next right actions even when i do n't feel like it ultimately , those actions led to my mood improving over the past couple of days who knows , maybe taking those actions even stopped a slide today is a better day , and i'm grateful for that
