hi , i just wanted you to know that even though i 've never read your book , it changed my life in i noticed a coworker reading your book depression is a choice and that was the day my life changed forever with your four words as my motto , i was able to transform a lifetime of self loathing and negativity and give myself permission to be happy it was all up to me thank you , l dear l thank you for your letter for many years i have regretted my publisher 's choice of title because so many people told me they felt insulted by it as far as sales ere concerned it was not the title , therefore , that people felt comfortable recommending to a friend for fear of offending them because of you letter , well , maybe the title was perfect after all if you ever have any specific questions , i will be glad to answer them a b curtiss
