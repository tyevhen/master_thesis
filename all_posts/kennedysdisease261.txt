it has been ten days since i started taking dutasteride i am keeping a daily journal to track any side effects , observations , etc i felt this would be a good time to provide an update those interested the only major side effect that i have seen so far is the horns growing out of my head my wife said this has nothing to do with the drug , it is just my personality expressing itself physically i am certain there is a compliment in her response somewhere i have noticed a few things , but i am not certain whether they are drug related , psychosomatic or caused by something unrelated in day i woke up very sore the muscle soreness was pronounced and in the shoulders , wrists , hands , and lower legs this soreness was different than my normal aches , however the soreness went away , but shows up again after every long workout this workout is the same routine i have been doing for over three years without any soreness again , i know it is too early to tell anything and it will probably take months or perhaps a year or more to tell if this is doing any good , but my long exercise program is easier i am even adding more reps i am doing far more arm raises and arm lifts from knees to above the head they are so easy right now i am even considering adding more weight i feel like i have more energy except for the muscle soreness , i have not experienced any other side effects we ll forget about the horns for now it would be wonderful to report some miracle has happened , but i knew going into this program that was not going to happen patience is what is needed and also the hope that i am one of those men that dutasteride works on a few men reported that they had no idea whether dutasteride was working until they stopped taking the drug
