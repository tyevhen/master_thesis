an interesting open problem in biology is how so many signature microbial species not just in the oceans and soil , but in anoxic lake sediments , hot springs , deep underground rock formations , etc got so widely and uniformly distributed how is it , for example , that if you dig down a foot into the topsoil of any back yard in north america , and do the same in any back yard in japan , say , you are practically guaranteed to find examples of pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus mycoides and hundreds of other characteristic soil species ? did these species get spread by the wind ? by birds ? by rain ? probably all three we know , for example , that african dust storms can carry particles as far as houston , texas but also , bacteria routinely occur in the atmosphere , in clouds , and even in hail stones hailstones a window into the microbial and chemical inventory of a storm cloud , by temkiv et al , describes finding examples of proteobacteria , sphingobacteriales and methylobacterium plus some organic compounds in hail stones a similar finding was reported in a blog post by university of wisconsin bacteriology professor john lindquist in looking at recently fallen hail stones , lindquist was able to culture purple photosynthetic bacteria rhodopseudomonas species from his samples to my knowledge , no one has yet tried to characterize the viral or bacteriophage content of atmospheric moisture if you 're looking for a thesis project in microbiology , this could be a good one
