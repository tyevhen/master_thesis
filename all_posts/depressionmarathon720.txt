i'm going to have to stop going to church this morning , as has happened several times , i got really sad upon leaving church really sad and for the life of me , i ca n't figure out exactly why it 's a heavy sadness it washes over me and settles like a leaden cloak upon my back it weighs me down it makes me tearful and tired it negatively effects the rest of my day if this continues , i'm going to have to stop going to church i do n't understand the sadness , nor why it happens upon leaving church it may be connected to loneliness , but i hate to admit that that sounds so pathetic but loneliness is the only thing that even remotely makes sense i go to church alone , and there are lots of families and couples there together maybe those reminders are just a little too much ? i do n't know i'm curious to know if anyone else ever experiences this and by this , i mean sadness upon leaving a group , or an event , or anything which should n't evoke sadness it bothers me i do n't like feeling sad , especially when the reason is not clear does this make sense to anyone else ? i'm curious , and confused , and , well , sad
