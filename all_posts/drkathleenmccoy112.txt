the email from my dear friend tim a few mornings ago ended on a poignant note dear dear dear dear friend take your vitamins ! what had prompted this admonition was shocking ed keifer , one of tim 's closest male friends for many years had died of cancer tim reflected back on all the holidays their families had shared , watching their children grow up together the last time tim saw ed , who now lived on the east coast while tim is in chicago , was last june at tim 's daughter eliza 's wedding as they toasted the occasion together , tim looked at his obviously ill old friend and knew that this might be one of the last times they would see each other still , ed 's death was a shock tim wrote to me , grief stricken , with new awareness of his own mortality and a heightened fear of losing other old and treasured friends our old friends who were children with us or college classmates or co workers when our careers were new and our lives still so open to possibilities are ever more precious as we age they understand us in ways that no one else can they know where we 've been who we are now they know firsthand our life challenges and triumphs , sorrows and joys and we know theirs perhaps my oldest friend is mary laing vaughn we were babies together as our families moved into a newly built l a neighborhood shortly after the end of world war ii our fathers were war veterans our mothers were newly stay at home moms after their wartime jobs ended and we kids grew up as near siblings mary and i celebrated my second birthday by eating the cake with our hands , grossing out the other party guest sandy gahan , who was a more sophisticated four year old mary and i played together , put on neighborhood shows and adored the mouseketeers together and even though we have n't seen each other in decades , we communicate by email , snail mail and occasionally by phone and it 's as if we saw each other just yesterday my nd birthday with mary laing r and a bemused sandy gahan c mary l , diane uglow c and i during childhood playtime mary , who lives in pennsylvania and florida , also sent me an email this week , telling me how sad she was to hear of former mouseketeer annette funicello 's death it was an interesting moment of the blending of our child selves and older selves our young selves mourned an idol we adored together when we were children , someone who was an icon of graceful adolescence our older selves ca n't help but reflect on our own mortality even as we feel sad for annette and her family this mixture of youth and aging is an inevitable part of our long time friendships bob 's best high school friend wellington stanislaus stan calls him rocky an affectionate nickname only bob 's high school friends ever called him stan , who was a popular athlete in high school , befriended bob when he was a shy newcomer to the school he helped bob get a succession of summer jobs at the camp for the junior blind in malibu during the last years of high school and the first years of college these summers still have a special place in bob 's memory a time when he was doing work he loved , feeling that he was making a difference , particularly when teaching the campers music he loved working side by side with stan and the companionship of the other camp counselors and he greatly admired the camp 's director who had used much of his wealth to build and run the camp stan , a star athlete and stellar friend , in stan 's life since those idyllic summers has not been easy he spent some years in a catholic religious order and emerged as another friend of mine has in his later years underemployed and with scant social security benefits stan is strong in spirit , but his body has been frail he works off and on as a cook , living alone in an apartment in fresno , ca but when they connect on the phone , stan and bob slip easily back into the friendship of their youth , seasoned by the wisdom and experience of age no one but stan knows first hand what those summers so long ago meant to young bob and an older bob rarely fails to close a conversation with his old friend without telling him that he loves him our old friends are irreplaceable there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't hear from a dear old friend i see certain emails and they always make me smile there are the almost daily uplifting messages from my hawaiian friend jeanne nishida yagi , one of my most treasured and enduring friends from college she has remained filled with faith and optimism even as she has endured recent back surgery and her husband jimmy had heart surgery

our th high school reunion together this coming weekend pat hill circa pat at ucla voice conference there are the wistful emails from my friend dr chuck wibbelsman , with whom i wrote several books ,

conclusion that he was gay his initial coming out nearly years ago was tempestuous and it was something that we shared , changing both our lives we 've since shared many major turning points in life from the joy of my wedding to bob to the grief over the loss of chuck 's entire immediate family of origin he currently lives in san francisco with david , his companion of years since i 've moved to

the joys of my life even though we do n't get a chance to see much of each other she 's now a counselor for students at stanford university we keep in touch and our occasional dinners together are great fun and filled with her unique insights and witty observations when bob and i were living together before we were married , i invited her over for dinner and bob was aghast does she know our situation ? ? he asked frantically what do i call her , for heaven 's sake ? i 've never met a nun before i mean , do i call her 'your majesty' ? ? or what ? ? oh , this is going to be terrible ! but it was n't two minutes after she walked in the door , sister ramona had bob laughing and she later came to our non catholic wedding in a spirit of joy and celebration not long ago , bob and i were discussing the meaning of success as well as who might be the most successful person we personally knew he beat me to the obvious conclusion sister ramona she has had such a lasting impact on so many

children brian and carrie grow up to be talented , successful and caring adults and , for the four days she was with us , it was so lovely to look back with laughter and fond memories and somehow comforting to be looking ahead with hope , shared apprehension and a newly present sense of mortality together sharon with steve and brian in sharon and bob sharon grew reflective as she was leaving to return home let 's not let so much time pass between visits , she said at this stage of our lives well , you never know her words have resonated and made us resolve to be in closer touch more often

friend how much he or she has meant to you in the past and means to you still now is the time because love shared is never too soon or too frequent and because you never know
