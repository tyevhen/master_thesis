last year the daughter of one of my patients called me mom is acting really strange she 's being aggressive , and she thinks my dad is still alive i do n't think she slept last night do you think she needs an increase in her medication ? tame impala elephant my patient was a sweet year old woman with a psychosis heavy bipolar disorder who could get paranoid from time to time , but was never violent , and had been stable on a low dose of medicine for many years i told her daughter , if she did n't fall down and hit her head somehow , i think she has a urinary tract infection uti you should take her in to see her primary care doctor if she 'll let you otherwise , you might need to take her to the er a few hours later , the daughter called me back , quite amazed you were right ! her doctor says she has a bad uti how did you diagnose that over the phone ? i'm sure all my psychiatrist doctor readers were guessing the outcome right away utis rather famously turn into strange behavior in the elderly , particularly in those with dementia one time when i was on call in the emergency room , we got a consult for new onset obsessive compulsive disorder in year old my fellow resident and i exchanged looks and told the emergency room intern to wait for the results of the urinalysis before we were consulted year olds do n't develop ocd out of the blue without something else medical going on we were correct she had a urinary tract infection the ocd resolved with antibiotics the tricky part for doctors is that these utis can occur without any of the usual symptoms we are used to hearing about no incontinence , fever , or urinary urgency or sometimes the patient ca n't tell us about these symptoms so we already know that urinary tract infections can cause pretty weird behavior in vulnerable people recently brian miller , md from georgia health sciences university wrote an article in psychiatric times about his recent study in the journal of clinical psychiatry a prevalence study of urinary tract infections in acute relapse of schizophrenia not only do i have a subscription to jcp , but my academic access should grant me full access , but on a sunday morning i was unable to get a copy of the full text because jcp 's website is horrible in desperation i emailed dr miller , and on monday morning he very kindly sent me not only a copy of the full text article , but also his letter to the editor in schizophrenia research thank you ! schizophrenia is associated with hugely increased mortality , and those afflicted die in increased numbers and earlier from almost every major leading cause of death heart disease is most famous blamed on the increased schizophrenic tendency to smoke and to the effects of the medications , but schizophrenics have an fold increased risk of death by pneumonia is it from lack of self care and not being organized enough to go to the doctor for serious medical symptoms ? maybe that has been the assumption but recent studies have shown what is no surprise to followers of evolutionary psychiatry schizophrenia is not just a brain disease , it is a disease of immune function schizophrenics have major abnormalities in levels of inflammatory cytokines , c reactive protein , and reduced neutrophil activity neutrophils are a first line response to inflammation and are vital to keeping us safe from bacterial infection despite all these abnormalities , dr miller notes in his paper that there are no studies of the prevalence of infection at the time of infection of hospitalization for acute illness relapse in patient with schizophrenia as all clinical psychiatrists will know , schizophrenics can remain relatively stable for many years , then have terrible relapses of psychotic behavior often going off medication or substance abuse is blamed and may well be responsible but sometimes something else is going on and it may well be a bacterial infection dr miller studied healthy controls and some long term schizophrenics admitted with acute psychotic relapse he found that those hospitalized with schizophrenia , men and women , were times as likely as controls to have a urinary tract infection of subjects in the acute relapse group had serologic urinalysis evidence of a uti as opposed to of stable outpatient and of controls there are reports of certain antibiotic treatment associate with increased risk of psychosis cipro and gatifloaxin are known is it the antibiotics , or the uti they were treating ? it is well known that elderly and particularly demented patients are vulnerable to odd behavior caused by urinary tract infections it is not beyond the realm of possibility that people with schizophrenia are vulnerable to the same pathology the time is coming that schizophrenia is recognized as a full body immune dysregulation disorder , from the gut to the brain to the neutrophils at that point are the psychiatrists going to be removed from the picture and the allergists and rheumatologists to step forward ? we 'll see
