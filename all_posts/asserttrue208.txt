ever since irving kirsch published his famous meta analysis of fda clinical trials on antidepressants , showing that half of trials produced no separation from placebo and that antidepressants are generally of dubious clinical worth except for the most severely depressed patients a result that was consistent with another famous meta analysis , published in jama , various apologists for the pharma industry have tried to spin the results in a more drug favorable light one of the most interesting counter spin papers is the report by stefan leucht and colleagues in the british journal of psychiatry the leucht paper can hardly be considered unbiased , since the lead author received fees for consulting and or lectures from bristol myers squibb , actelion , sanofi aventis , eli lilly , essex pharma , astrazeneca , medavante , alkermes , janssen johnson johnson , lundbeck institute and pfizer and grant support from eli lilly , while another author received fees for consulting and or lectures from janssen cilag , sanofi aventis , johnson johnson , pfizer , bristol myers squibb , astrazeneca , lundbeck , novartis and eli lilly still , it 's an interesting paper and deserves to be read in detail smd a proxy for effect size for studies of non psychiatric medications white circles versus psychiatric medications filled circles , right the paper attempts to put criticisms of antidepressant effectiveness in context by showing that when studies and studies of studies meta analyses of antidepressants are stacked up against studies of regular medicines for somatic conditions , antidepressants do n't come out looking so bad to illustrate their case , the authors prepared the accompanying chart showing effect sizes actually standardized mean differences for various medical studies white circles versus studies involving psychiatric drugs solid circles what the authors basically tried to show is that if you transform a big bunch of heterogeneous studies into smd form mostly using responder data , not remission or cure rates , and do n't put confidence intervals on the dots , you find that psychotropic drugs are , on the whole , not inferior to other drugs however , if you dig into the data see table of the leucht paper , you find that psychiatric drugs have the strongest data in a comparison of drug versus placebo for relapse rates rather than primary treatment effects the highest blue dots on the graph are from this kind of data the fact that people relapse in huge numbers when they withdraw from drugs is thus shown in the graph as a strength for drugs , when in fact it 's arguably a weakness relapse rates are known to be higher for drugs , for example , than for psychotherapy but even if you do n't back out some of the high points , response rates for antidepressants are generally unimpressive , with the ratio of drug response to placebo response being to in one case , to in another case , and to in the third of the three analyses looked at when you combine this with the fact that to of drug responders eventually relapse , the overall picture can hardly be described as encouraging i was also struck by the fact that response rates to antipsychotics , for schizophrenia patients , is quite unexpectedly poor here , the only two studies cited which were by leucht and colleagues showed a response rate of for second generation antipsychotics versus for placebo and for haldol versus for placebo the low response rates here may reflect leucht 's admirable tendency to rely on more recent meta analyses early and generally smaller meta analyses of nearly all the psychiatric drugs showed much larger effect sizes than more recent studies speaking of placebo , the leucht review offers a striking demonstration of the power of the placebo effect , showing , as it does , that placebo response is significant even for diabetes for metformin , the only drug reported , stroke , breast cancer , and antibiotics to no doubt spontaneous remissions account for some of the cures reported for placebo but the same is true in mental illness which is notoriously episodic , regardless of category it would have been quite telling if leucht had produced a graph similar to the one above showing only placebo response rates the graph would look quite similar to the one they produced albeit with dots shifted slightly lower such a graph would demonstrate that placebos for psychiatric trials are non inferior to placebos for other drug trials of course , one problem with analyses of the leucht kind is that they 're biased in favor of published results we are n't seeing results from studies that showed no efficacy , because such studies are n't generally pubished very often this is an important omission , because we know from the work of kirsch and others that fda is sitting on a ton of clinical trials that showed safety , but not efficacy , for a variety of psychiatric drugs indeed , this was a major finding of the kirsch meta analysis see link at the top , which drew from published and unpublished fda trials obtained by freedom of information act request kirsch found that half of antidepressant trials submitted to fda failed to establish meaningful separation from placebo and those trials rarely got published , or if they did , their data was conflated with data from more successful trials to learn how drug companies hide data and spin lack of efficacy into efficacy , read the excellent paper by spielman and parry , from evidence based medicine to marketing based medicine evidence from internal industry documents leucht et al claim , with their paper , to have put psychiatric drugs in the proper medical perspective to some extent , this is true on the whole , though , it does n't change the fact that drugs for serious mental illness schizophrenia , bipolar , depression , etc are ineffective producing no response , or even a negative response for the majority of people who try them , a result that 's clear from table of the leucht paper i am done writing a mental health book , words that 's part science , part memoir it 's not an anti psychiatry screed , although it 's appropriately critical of many aspects of the profession the footnotes will let you decide which parts are more or less believable than other parts to learn more about the book , add your name to the mailing list and return
