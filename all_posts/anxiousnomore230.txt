photo by picturejockey so i made it through today not scot free like the last couple outings , but i did n't have a full blown attack i got a really yummy salad at lunch and it filled me up before my main meal came so when the meal came and i was n't hungry , i started to feel stupid , or that i should be able to eat more like everyone else i started focusing on whether anyone was watching me and i could feel my anxiety get to a level see anxiety scale post for more info then , when i started to get lost in my negative self talk and the butterflies were soaring , i was saved by the bell my phone started ringing and it was ty i was able to excuse myself and talk to him and refocus and calm down when i got back in everything got much better i was still feeling a little stupid , but i packed up everything i knew i would n't eat and left a bag of chips open that i could occasionally munch on no one said anything to me even though i felt at least one set of eyes a lady who already has confronted me about not eating enough watching me i just ignored her and tried to get distracted in the conversations around me it worked the wedding reception i lucked out of and got there when no one was there and i ended up having to leave after maybe minutes to make ty 's softball game which is where i am writing this as they are getting slaughtered big time so all in all , i got lost in my thoughts , but was able to snap out of it before it got out of control not a setback at all i think i do n't have to be anxiety free every time in order to have a successful situation i think for me , baby steps are learning to manage my anxiety , not focusing on stopping it cold turkey if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like anxiety of jury selection should be a reality tv show a year later same scenario , different outcome bbq update we all fall down linkwithin
