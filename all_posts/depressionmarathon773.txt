between running speedy workouts and painting for hours on end , i am sore my legs hurt from my speed workout i'm not used to running that fast anymore , but that 's what my training plan called for , so i did it of course standing and painting my basement for hours probably contributed to the sore legs , and i know it 's the reason for my aching shoulders ! i need an ice pack ! i needed some sustenance after my long day of painting and running , so i went out to eat with my mom and step dad they are full time rv'ers , and they will only be in town another two weeks i'm bummed about that they were supposed to stay until the end of october , but their plans changed they 're leaving at the end of september instead worse yet , they wo n't be coming back next summer they 've been here three summers in a row , and it 's been really nice having my mom around she left when i was twelve , and i had spent very little time with her until they began coming here for the summers years ago i 've enjoyed spending time with her of course , the fact that she cooks for me is nice , too i 'll miss that i 'll miss them i'm sure my mom would be surprised to read that last sentence we do n't exactly have a touchy feely relationship i'm still fairly guarded around her i do n't know why it 's just the way it is i 've gotten a lot better over the past several years i think just being around her more has helped it also helps that i 've learned to live life through the aa program i 've learned to be more honest , grateful , and real and that has helped me be a little more open with my mom i still do n't know if i 'll be able to tell her i 'll miss her though is n't that dumb ? i envy people who have easy relationships with their parents i envy families that express their feelings for each other there 's a lot of trash in our past in my family we also were n't raised to say things like , i love you strange ? i do n't know that 's just how it was is but like i said , i 've gotten better with my mom , and i'm a work in progress , so i 'll keep working on it i 'd love to hear how things were in your families is my situation weird , or is it more normal than i think ? do you tell your parents you love them ? do you have kids who say that without a thought ? or is it rare to hear those words in your family , as it is in mine ? just curious and on that note , i'm off to rest my weary bones in bed good night
