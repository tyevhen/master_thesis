would you not intervene if you heard someone speaking in the same way to speak to yourself ? would you give the same standards to others that you give to yourself ? i would hope not whether you believe it or not , your body is amazing ! did you know your heart beats about , times a day ? thank you , heart , for pumping blood through my body at that ridiculous rate thank you , heart , for keeping me alive because i am alive , i can do so many wonderful things you have , miles of nerves did you know your fastest nerves send impulses at up to feet second at up to impulses per second ? now i know why i am nervous and impulsive all the time ! but if i didn t have nerves or impulses , i wouldn t be able to make any decisions at worst , i wouldn t be able to love , or be a friend to anyone i also wouldn t be able to feel nervous excitement before a big race i wouldn t be able to be scared during a thunderstorm and riding a rollercoaster wouldn t be that fun although , i don t like them anyway your body has more than muscles what is your biggest muscle ? you re sitting on it yup , the next time you are analyzing your caboose in the mirror , remember that it is your largest muscle and for good reason too ! it allows you to sit and it allows you to stand if you didn t have a tuh shee , you would have to spend your life in a wheelchair without all the rest of those muscles , you wouldn t be able to run , play with your kids , bake cookies , read a book , write a letter , ride a bike , kneel in church , sing , laugh , cry you can recognize over , different scents with your sense of smell your memory is most connected with your sense of smell than any other sense , including sight my favorite smell is incense at mass i know that our parish priest uses different types of incense because sometimes it reminds me of austria and sometimes it reminds me of my childhood i love the comforting feeling of smelling a home cooked meal and i love the smell of fresh cut grass oh , and the smell of campfire on my clothes the next morning makes me smile and then i do laundry whether you believe it or not , your body is amazing when i am tempted to body bash , it is helpful to remember all the wonderful things my body can do when i look at my body with gratitude , i contently walk away from the mirror with a smile on my face if i look for the negative , i will find the negative if you look for the negative , you will find the negative too if you stand in front of the mirror with the intention of picking out your flaws , you will find them , no matter what you look like instead of focusing on the negative , focus on the positive thank your body for all the amazing things it can do without my body , i couldn t read a book watch a movie play the piano paint a picture plant a garden hold a baby go to mass drink a cup of coffee mow the lawn go swimming go shopping with my sisters take a walk with my husband ride a bike with a friend play at the park with my nieces and nephews and so much more two challenges of the day do the word challenge above and instead of body bashing today , thank your body for all the amazing things it can do your body is incredible make a list of all the things you love to do and put it on your mirror to help you remember to be grateful you are beautiful you are loved you are worthy and deserving no matter what you look like information cited from honey crunch and oats , millville cereal company distributed by aldi inc , batavia , il you don t see that kind of footnote everyday ! i may have cited it wrong , but i couldn t find how to cite a cereal box in my all the grammar you need to know to be successful in life reference book j
