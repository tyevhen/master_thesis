the knights of badassdom in the spirit of the halloween season , i watched the knights of badassdom with my boyfriend as expected , it was both cheesy and hilarious for those of you unfamiliar with this phenomenon , here is the youtube official trailer in summary , joe is an intelligent underachiever who lives with his accidental millionaire friend in a castle when joe is dumped by his long time girlfriend , his friends decide it would be a great distraction to kidnap joe he wakes up at a larping live action role playing expedition at the fields of evermore a large parking lot near a forested park there , an epic battle is about to take place it 's all going pretty well until joe 's sorcerer friend accidentally summons a succubus that looks exactly like joe 's ex girlfriend the succubus wanders around the forest attacking larpers , who mistake her for a lost larper soul who has stumbled upon the wrong larping event joe and his friends must send the succubus back to hell this movie is exactly what you would expect from the summary it 's silly it 's funny if you get larp and it 's gory , but only in a humorous way one of joe 's friends is played by peter dinklage of game of thrones fame yes everyone you can stream this on netflix for humor , originality , and quality larping reason for watching thought this would be a nice touch for the halloween season
