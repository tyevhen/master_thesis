in less than hours i will be starting my new job i'm anxious i have no idea what to expect i do n't know if i'm going to be orienting tomorrow , or treating patients , or a little of both i'm way more nervous than i expected i would be i'm especially concerned about treating outpatients so i'm hoping tomorrow is more focused on the nursing home crowd , but like i said , i have no idea what 's in store i 've been preparing for this new position by going through some of my old textbooks , and that 's led me to some major organizing behavior in the process of digging through boxes of physical therapy textbooks , i threw away two full boxes of old psychology textbooks from my first career i did n't stop there , however i began going through much of my stored stuff i now have two and a half large boxes of stuff to go to the salvation army , and i 've only just begun i 've been wanting to rid myself of extra stuff for some time , but i 've been too overwhelmed by the prospect of it to even start the project now i'm committed i began the process at one end of my upper floor , where all my junk is stored i'm planning to work my way across the room i had a huge garage sale a couple summers ago i felt like i rid myself of extra stuff at that time , but now i realize i have much more to purge i'm not sure where this urge to purge is coming from , but i like it i feel burdened by the extra stuff it 's weighing my down somehow i want to have as little as possible i figure if i have n't thought about it , looked at it , or needed it in the last two years , it 's time for it to go ! and i do n't want to sell it i just want it gone if it has value to someone at the salvation army store , that 's great ! i feel relieved to have finally started the purging process i do n't know if this need to purge is related to the new job for some reason , i think it is , but i have no idea how it 's related or why it would be it just feels like it is i guess i 'll have to take that one up with my therapist unless you all have some ideas now i 've got to finish preparing for the dreaded first day i 'll let you know how it goes
