not because of anything i 've done according to those who 've tried to reassure me just because and this is where i need help i can act on my perception , which may or may not be true , and go after this person with both barrels that 's what i would have done in the past not very effective part of me wants to say , fuck it ! fuck them ! i want to leave them in anger without saying a thing of course , that also solves nothing in fact , my situation would be worse i 'd be a non speaker full of resentment ! that sounds like a prescription for mental health disaster not a great option speaking to this person would be a better option i need to say something , but i do n't want to say anything ! i do n't want to deal with this bs ! one of the benefits of volunteering , versus a paid position , is staying out of the office bs ! that 's how it 's supposed to work , anyway i resent having to deal with this crap ! i'm pissed i have to deal with another person 's perceived character flaws ! lord knows , i 've got enough of my own to deal with ! i did n't do anything to this person , but i'm apparently not on her christmas list that 's her shit ! why should i have to deal with it ? but i do if i want to speak publicly again , i must deal with it there 's another shitty thing about being forced to deal with this just because i deal with it maturely hopefully does n't mean i 'll get the outcome i desire i can control my response to the perceived slight , but i ca n't control how my response will be received this fact makes it even more difficult for me to approach this person i do n't want to expose myself , make myself vulnerable to this person , and then have nothing change i guess this is the risk i have to take if i want any chance to continue speaking this sucks i do n't like it i feel resentful and i feel cornered forced to act , despite the fact i did n't participate in creating the situation what would you do ? what would you do ?
