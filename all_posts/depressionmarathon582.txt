i 've been home for a few days now i'm not doing very well i called my mother over the weekend , and she flew into town yesterday i was lucky she had a free ticket to use , so she 's here for the next week to help me out we have one month worth of bills to go through , tax information to gather , and general housework to accomplish it 's really hard for me to ask for help , but i'm glad she 's here i was basically a basket case for the last few days i think things will be easier with her here to help i returned to work yesterday afternoon for four hours again , i felt like a fish out of water i feel like i'm barely holding it together i'm afraid i'm going to crack if someone looks at me cross eyed people welcomed me back , but i could barely stand it i felt all questioning eyes upon me i was very uncomfortable i go back tomorrow for another four hours , and i'm not looking forward to it this illness has really torn me down this time i feel totally beaten up my self confidence is shot i feel incompetent at work and at home i have a sponsee calling to continue going through the big book of alcoholics anonymous , and i feel incompetent to guide her on her sobriety journey , too i feel worthless and useless depression has cut my legs out from under me this time , and i'm not sure how to get back on my feet it 's been a long time since i 've felt this beaten just beaten somehow i 've got to drag myself back up into the realm of the living i'm not there yet i 've got to get back on my feet , exercise , go to work , socialize , attend to my commitments , and live life on life 's terms again it 's easier said than done i'm praying for a reprieve
