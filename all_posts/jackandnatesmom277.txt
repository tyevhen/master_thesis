well , i guess that as of this sunday i do n't have a baby anymore for me , three has always been that cut off granted it feels like nate has been a baby much longer than jack was , i am sure that much of that is due to the language delays just wanted to write a bit about his birth now , as i will be too busy this weekend with his little party already i have nearly asphyxiated myself from blowing up so many balloons you will see why later on in the pictures really all i would need to do to explain everything about nathan is say , take jack 's story and flip it on it 's head that 's nathan from pregnancy , to birth , to infancy , that 's nathan whereas jack was a surprise , nathan was the product of a month waiting game while trying to conceive i was sick as a dog with nate , i think partly because i was so busy chasing around a two year old other than that , the pregnancy went pretty smoothly if you hate birth stories , you need to skip the next couple of paragraphs well really , the rest of this post i was very dissatisfied with how jack 's birth went enough so that i changed doctors before i became pregnant with nathan this practice was great , very supportive i really wanted to try for a drug free delivery , even after the pain of the first time around i am a pretty anxious girl to begin with , so this was a tall order i know all women hear that childbirth pain is partially caused by , or made worse by , fear we all scoff at this , and claim that this theory was brought forth by a man i decided to work with it though , knowing myself as well as i do , and enrolled in a hypnobirthing class oh john poor poor john there we were with all of these granola ish parents lying on the floor , doing visualization that 's love right there when nate turned breech it was the most lively discussion of the whole class every suggestion you could think of was flying at me from every direction conveniently , we had an acupuncturist in our class and she brought me a remedy that i was supposed to burn by my foot yep , but by the time she got it to me nathan had turned i think he was scared , haha the class was very relaxing even john admitted to having no idea how much time had passed during these meditations i was skeptical though how was i to concentrate on this cd and my breathing through so much pain ? i begged for drugs the first time around i was convinced , had not one doubt , that nathan was coming early he was due on new year 's day drove my family crazy with this even remember having an argument with my mom because i wanted my parents to come for christmas she was still working and said she could either do that or come when the baby was born i said she did n't need to choose i was that sure do n't think my mom doubts me anymore i was so sure that by december th i had all of the christmas shopping done , all of the presents wrapped i baked batches of cookies that day as well the nurses benefitted from that one so anyhow , there i am , and i am not making this up , wrapping the last christmas gift , with the last batch of cookies in the oven , i stand up , and pop my water broke ! that never happened with jack , at least not until right before he was born i kinda freaked out to be honest john was upstairs lying down with jack while he was falling asleep , so i decided to call the doctor first , figured we had several hours to come in since i was n't really having contractions yet but no , she wanted us there within an hour i technically was n't full term yet i think i was or days shy of it so i arranged for someone to come watch jack and then went upstairs to grab john he was completely asleep ! it takes awhile to wake him up and i was n't able to do it without waking jack too , since he the lightest sleeper in the world i remember looking at jack and having this overwhelmingly bittersweet feeling this boy had no idea how much his little world was about to be rocked , and this was the last time i would see him and be just his mommy we headed to the hospita and were taken to triage the nurse swore up and down she was n't seeing any amniotic fluid i wanted to sit up and scream oh no bleep ! i do n't come to the hospital unless it 's time to come to the hospital i am a nurse and i am telling you my water broke luckily , i held it together , and when the ob examined me she said that nate 's head had just come down really fast so i was n't leaking fluid anymore , but my water was broken so there , ha we were admitted , i was i think cm , not much doing , just minor contractions that changed very quickly i popped my cd in and my headphones on and tried to relax to my surprise , i really did drift off , really was able to concentrate on my breathing , was in the zone kinda freaked john out in between listening we would walk , and walk , and walk i would keep the breathing going throughout , and it really worked for me the best thing i can think of to compare it to is the feeling you get when you are in good shape and in the middle of a long run spacey and focused at the same time and unable to feel your legs they checked me after a few hours and i was centimeters ! i got all cocky almost there , this is nothing ha i was cm for hours let me tell you , hypnobirthing can only get you so far ! after hours of that , when i hit transition i thought i would literally kill my husband i mean , it was like a scene out of a movie i asked for ice chips , john brought the ice chips , and i asked him why the hell he kept putting ice chips in my face and he said because you asked for them i screamed at him to get away good times the baby 's head was not coming down far enough turns out this is the one way in which nate was like big brother he turned sideways in the birth canal i will never forget , about an hour before i delivered , the ob who had been with us all night went off duty she had been staring at me for much of the night saying things like you ca n't be cm because i was so calm when she left , she looked at me and said jenny , you do n't need any pitocin , you do n't need an epidural , and you are going to do this with no help all of the things that had been done to me with jack she was telling me that i did n't need it was inspiring i 'll cut to the chase and say that she was right i needed none of that i did it myself at first i thought there was something wrong there were so many staff in our room ! turns out that the nurses , social workers , and birth coaches all need to see at least one drug free delivery a year to stay current and it was december well hello there everyone and to top it off , this was also the day that the computerized order and medication system went live so everyone was trying to figure that out too entertainment i'm not gonna lie my ob cried at my delivery this was not for a good reason i had to be seen in her office every weeks for months it was rough but worth it in the end anyway the nice things about that delivery i got up right away , i could take care of my baby right away i had pain , but i felt in control of my own body i never even needed an iv and nate was amazing still is of course he fed right away , he was alert , he was quiet just a joy john had to go home that night to be with jack as we did n't have anyone who could stay with him so my friend joann came and spent the evening with nate and me it was one of the most peaceful nights of my life he ate right away every time , when he fell asleep i put him in the little bassinet and he just stayed there it was amazing ! i will never forget the births of either of my boys , but i have to be honest nate 's was really special , almost spiritual in some ways one of the best , most empowering experiences of my life , and look what we got !
