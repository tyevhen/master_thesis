oy , if you 're very sick and very dangerous , texas is not the place to be oh , it never was and maybe it never will be in maryland , if someone is in the hospital and wants to leave , the vast majority of the time , they get leave if the staff thinks they should stay , they get to sign a leaving ama form against medical advice in rare instances , if a voluntary patient wants to leave , but they are felt to be imminently dangerous , then they can be certified , and held on the floor until there is hearing at the hospital where i did my residency , hearings were held on wednesday when an administrative law judge came in for that purpose , so how long a patient was stuck there without 'due process' depended on what day of the week this went down in texas , you can be committed against your will , but apparently as i 've learned from yesterday 's new york times , if you 've signed in , you ca n't be held and committed , no matter how sick , psychotic , and dangerous you are really ? i'm back to my original thought oy ! from advocates seek mental health changes , including the power to detain mr thomas , who confessed to the murders of his wife , their son and her daughter by another man , was convicted in and sentenced to death at age while awaiting trial in , he gouged out one of his eyes , and in on death row , he removed the other and ate it at least twice in the three weeks before the crime , mr thomas had sought mental health treatment , babbling illogically and threatening to commit suicide on two occasions , staff members at the medical facilities were so worried that his psychosis made him a threat to himself or others that they sought emergency detention warrants for him despite talk of suicide and bizarre biblical delusions , he was not detained for treatment mr thomas later told the police that he was convinced that ms boren was the wicked jezebel from the bible , that his own son was the antichrist and that leyha was involved in an evil conspiracy with them he was on a mission from god , he said , to free their hearts of demons what a travesty and here in maryland , yesterday a court sent a year old boy , tried as an adult , to prison for life , commuted down to years , for a school shooting attempted murder the boy took his step father 's gun , which fortunately , was not a rapid fire weapon , but a shotgun i think , and before he could get too many rounds fired , a heroic teacher tackled him and the single wounded victim survived the boy left a suicide note , but his plan to die that day was foiled he 's reportedly been improving with treatment in a county detention center , and he pleaded guilty to the charges , no insanity defense sought , no trial necessary , just a hearing for sentencing i wo n't comment on whether i think it serves society to send a child to prison with adults for years to those who oppose involuntary hospitalization under any conditions at all , i have to ask , what do you think should be done if you become so psychotic that you believe it 's necessary to kill your own children and eat your own eyeballs ? in texas , it 's clear you 're free to do so and the state will just kill you
