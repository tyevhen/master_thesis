michael marth makes the interesting case that the fat years are over referring to the years of predominance of fat client applications like eclipse rcp over browser apps he notes that the traditional orthodoxy that web uis while faster to develop than thick client apps are not powerful enough to compete with standalone thick clients is largely a quaint fiction now ajax , better widget libraries in things like jquery and ext , and emerging features of html have made web uis powerful indeed but are the fat years really over ? as much as i want to agree with michael and do agree , for the most part , nevertheless it seems to me the world is filled with counterexamples of apps that are both popular and fatter than fat there 's eclipse itself , which is a monster that simply wo n't go on a diet there 's openoffice and word each of which is so heavy as to give new meaning to the word obese ditto excel , powerpoint , and outlook and then there are the adobe apps photoshop , illustrator , indesign , acrobat , framemaker the ground shakes when these apps walk it seems to me the fat years wo n't really be over until browser based alternatives to the adobe apps and the likes of eclipse and openoffice have succeeded to the point where adobe no longer has a reason to live something tells me that wo n't be happening any time soon
