i got the draft copy of jack 's new iep today in his school folder the meeting is in a week , and parents have to get the materials ahead of time fine i did n't want to look the fact that it even came with the disclaimer that not much will be different because jack is going to be reassessed should have tipped me off and this is true , next thursday i will be signing consents for this reassessment his label thus far has been developmental delay , and this will be changed to autism ok fine but i looked anyway really ? after all i have heard and been told this year , the talk of the weakness of his grip and his sensory issues , he still only needs minute ot sessions a month ? ? they did increase his special education time , which was an hour a week they increased it to hours a week out of hours in school when i already know that he has been having an aide an hour a day and this is not adequate this per his teacher so this increase does n't even cover what he 's getting how does this make sense ? ? ? someone please explain this to me once i sign consents for assessments they have weeks to complete them and then when they draw up the new iep they have weeks to implement the changes i am not a mathematician , but does n't that take us almost to the end of the school year ?
