how strange is the lot of us mortals ! each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not , though he senses it but without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people albert einstein self portrait , inside , oil on panel , x , is a reflective piece , literally and metaphorically my reference photos were taken right next to a window , but without direct sunlight , hence the darkened interior behind me and the brightness on my skin i have been painting a lot of exteriors lately coastlines , skies and greenery have been on the easel because of the upcoming portraits of newfoundland show in november i suppose i gave myself a bit of a test would i crave to return to the figure ? i let it happen of its own accord and , not surprisingly , back i came my next two pieces are quite personal , hence the self portrait this is the first piece a simple painting really , but with hints of something else underneath after spending so much time in the fresh beauty of the outside world recently , i am looking at that dichotomy of desire between a life spent at the easel inside and the the tests and trials one undertakes when home is a distant and abstract concept that balance between wanting to be outside exploring and embracing the elements must be balanced with that equal enthusiasm to convey those memories by expressing oneself as authentically as possible with the paint i love each equally they provide a wonderful counterpoint to one another this good fortune does not go unnoticed and each day i am thankful for all of it i am going to show a couple of shots of the painting in process here i think it is a great opportunity to look back and see how the painting has shaped , changed , refined and worked itself out i apologize for the blurry shots after the first painting session i wanted to try to convey a luminosity in the flesh in this painting light colours are fun to paint , especially white , because there is such a variety of colours found within it so here i was blocking in colour and trying to develop a base layer of flesh tone but with variety as well there is so much examination that must be done with painting a constant re assessment of line , shape , colour and tone sometimes i am guilty of not looking at the reference enough and that 's when errors happen so there are a number of things that are occuring all at once checking the accuracy of the shape form line , mixing the accurate colour of paint and applying it correctly after the second painting session the most progress was made between the second and final painting sessions i would gather that i spent about hours on this painting , give or take when is a painting finished ? it is never finished it is up to the artist to draw the line , as it were what i really wanted to do was to bring the outside inside through the reflection in my eyes sometimes i notice that the colour that i mix on my canvas is not the same as the one that goes on the panel i know this is an impossibility , because it is the same colour , but it shows how much surrounding colours have an effect on the pigment you apply it is quite unbelievable to me actually i will mix a colour , compare it with the reference , and then transfer it to the painting , however , when placed next to paint already on the canvas it changes , it surprises me and i need to remix does n't it show how everything is relative that everything is connected and and each colour thing person is dependent on surroundings people culture to be true and accurate ? perhaps i am stretching it here but i think there is some truth to that it is a tiny example of a larger picture , and perhaps i can learn a lesson or two by applying paint on my canvas as well as applying these principles to daily life too this is a closer shot of the final painting this painting will be at abbozzo gallery for the osa in the gta show happening in july , the ontario society of artists is a fantastic organization promoting ontario based artists this exhibition will involve several galleries in the greater toronto area below is some information about the exhibition osa in the gta july th , abbozzo gallery oakville , ontario opening reception july th pm i hope to see you at the opening reception ! it is not by muscle , speed , or physical dexterity that great things are achieved , but by reflection , force of character , and judgment cicero
