i'm not sure what to say i was going to update you regarding the jerk who is still copying every word of my blog , but in light of the recent events , i'm not sure that 's worthy of complaint las vegas i'm at a loss for words there is no way to explain or excuse one person savagely mowing down hundreds of innocent people with an automatic weapon no way unfortunately , the spotlight has turned to the he must have been crazy argument i cringed when i listened to the radio on my way to work yesterday morning , as they discussed the likelihood that this individual was mentally ill so far there is no evidence he was , but mental illness is easily speculated and blamed it makes me uncomfortable the reality is the vast majority of people with mental illness are not at all violent that 's a fact , but that fact seems to get lost after tragic , senseless , otherwise inexplicable events i understand the need to explain the unexplainable perhaps this person did have an undiagnosed mental illness , but the spite and venom with which mental illness is discussed disturbs me rather than spurring on a call to action , such as better , more accessible treatment for people with mental illness , these events seem to further the stigmatization instead that sucks having said all of that , i admit , i do n't have any answers to this dilemma none of us can control what others do i'm glad i'm open about my own battle with mental illness i believe my coworkers , running buddies , and friends now have a better picture of what a person with mental illness looks like and maybe that changes the conversations in their homes and offices just a bit i do n't know what i do know is in instances such as this , my behavior is the only thing i can control my thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy
