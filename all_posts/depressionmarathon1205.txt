only a depression blog could follow a post labeled laughing with a post labeled struggling the essence of depression in two sequential posts gotta love it struggling i am struggling i am struggling with my thinking i am struggling with my attitude i'm tired of this illness i'm tired of being sick i'm tired of taking a handful of meds morning and night just to function like a semi normal person i think about quitting them i forget them i never forget my meds but i have forgotten them lately is that because i'm feeling pissed off about needing them , or is that because my concentration and memory are worse two sure signs of impending doom am i struggling with my illness or with me ? is my depression getting worse , and therefore i am struggling with my thinking and my attitude ? or , is my screwy thinking and negative attitude bringing on the vacuum of depression ? who the hell knows ! who the hell cares ! chicken or egg egg or chicken this constant conundrum is yet another reason depression is so personal and confusing if a brain tumor was getting larger , i would not be contemplating these questions ! friends and family would not contemplate such questions , and doctors would not probe for some triggering event everyone would understand that sometimes a tumor just grows sometimes depression just grows , too , but that 's a lot harder to wrap one 's mind around even i , the mentally ill person , often find that fact unacceptable there must be a reason around and around i go my thinking is disjointed , distracted , and punishing i feel impatient , ambivalent , and angry my temper is short my serenity shorter am i diving into the funnel of depression , or am i self destructing of my own free , stubborn will ? does it matter ? around and around i go chicken or egg egg or chicken fuck it ! fry the chicken and scramble the egg ! resolving nothing , i still feel like crap i'm still struggling struggling
