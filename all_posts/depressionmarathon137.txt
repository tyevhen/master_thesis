i'm back from my weekend in duluth where , if i was n't still injured , i would have run grandma 's marathon i had a nice time , but not great i felt conflicted most of the weekend and kind of wished i had n't gone but at other times i was glad i was there i spent most of the time with my mom and stepfather i saw my friends a bit and i spent some time alone down by the lake and on the golf course it was warm and sunny , no good for running a marathon , but fine for visiting the weekend got off to a rough start when i saw a dog get hit on the highway within minutes of leaving home the dog was severely injured and likely died i cursed the owners for letting their dog run loose so close to a busy highway but i could n't get the image of that poor dog out of my head for the rest of my hour drive it sickened me , and the repeated imagery was quite distressing i spent a couple hours thursday afternoon at the marathon expo , where i picked up my race packet anyway , and then had dinner with my friends and a large group of their friends and colleagues that was fun , and the distraction finally relieved me of the dog images , an extra bonus my stepfather and i spent a few hours golfing together friday we 're both beginners , so it was at times frustrating and at others comical we had a good time , though my parents and i finished off the afternoon with a late lunch , some ice cream , and a walk down by lake superior i planned to watch the marathon saturday morning , but for the second year in a row , i did n't by the end of the evening friday , i was feeling mounting disappointment about missing the th anniversary edition of my hometown , and favorite , marathon i woke up in a funk saturday morning , so i went out for what turned out to be a bad breakfast with my parents instead of venturing down to the race the funk continued after breakfast i could n't even lift myself from my mom 's couch despite the beautiful duluth day finally , after dozing on and off most of the day , i dragged myself out to a little golf course nearby i planned to just hit some practice balls , but there was hardly a soul on the course , so i played a relaxed nine holes instead that was a good decision the time alone , the exercise , and focusing on something besides missing the marathon was good for me after taking my stepfather out for father 's day breakfast early this morning , i drove home i wanted to get home i'm still not sure how i feel about the weekend overall i guess it was okay i'm happy to be back in my home , though i picked up jet from the dog sitter , gave him a hug , got some exercise , and after finishing this post , i 'll likely be ready for a nap i like my house it 's not much , but it 's my space , and i'm comfortable in it after my weekend away , filled with mixed emotions , i needed to get back here i'm looking forward to resuming my regular routine
