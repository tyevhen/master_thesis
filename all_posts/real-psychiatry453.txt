asthma is an annoying and sometimes fatal disease i have first hand experience with it because i have had asthma for at least years like many of my personal medical afflictions that i have posted about on this blog it was initially missed and not treated according to recent studies , that is still a common experience when i was a teenager , wheezing when mowing the lawn was apparently considered a normal reaction when i developed a more systemic reaction right in a physician 's office , my parents were taken into an adjacent room and advised that it was apparently all in my head and it was some sort of psychosomatic reaction the psychosomatic reaction responded well to epinephrine injections and diphenhydramine even when i was in medical school the treatment of asthma was shaky i was taking theophylline pills twice a day for several years and the patients i began treating for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were all on aminophylline drips and corticosteroids we all had to memorize those protocols and of course know the mechanism of action now invalidated that was based on sunderland 's nobel prize winning work on cyclic amp today theophylline is considered a tertiary option for uncontrolled asthma rather than a first line treatment as a fourth year medical student , i presented a very well received seminar on slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis or srs a now known to be a mixture of leukotrienes eventually the treatment of asthma changed and glucocorticoid inhalers became the treatment of choice for a while as any primary care physician or asthmatic patient knows no two asthmatic patients are the same as an example , peak flow meters are routinely used to measure asthmatic control no matter how badly i am wheezing , i can always max out that peak flow meter asthma is a complex disease with varied presentations and the current treatment algorithms are complex with varied medications the diagnostic criteria of asthma seem relatively straightforward and are listed in the table below diagnosis of asthma see additional details in national heart , lung and blood institute reference and reference below recurrent symptoms of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness eg wheezing , chest tightness , cough , shortness of breath objective assessment as evidenced by a airflow obstruction as least partially reversible by inhaled short acting beta agonists as demonstrated by any of the following increase in fev of from baseline increase in predicted fev of from baseline increase in pef liters minute of from baseline b diurnal variation in pef of more than c no other causes of obstruction fev forced expiratory volume in second liters pef peak expiratory flow medicine texts have traditionally used breakpoints in the above parameters to distinguish mild , moderate and severe asthma despite what seem to be clear diagnostic criteria a recent review in the new england journal of medicine states most patients with asthma have mild persistent disease which tends to be underdiagnosed , undertreated , and inadequately controlled the reference cited in that review points out that only in patients achieved good control of their asthma there has been a sudden surge in research on asthma phenotypes , endotypes , and endophenotypes endophenotypes are subtypes of a particular phenotype that are thought to have a common pathophysiological mechanism or in the case of psychiatry a biochemical , neurophysiological , neuropsychological maker that allows for the subclassification if you have attended any serious psychiatric genetics course in the past decade you have probably heard about endophenotypes gottesman and gould published a widely cited paper in the american journal of psychiatry in discussed the concept and its application in psychiatry there have been references to papers on endophenotype in the schizophrenia bulletin alone , including a special theme issue a group of asthma endotypes have been suggested by corren he uses the definition of endotype as a subtype of a condition defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism the classification was a consensus of experts looking at clinical characteristics , biomarkers , lung physiology , genetics , histopathology , and treatment response the following endotypes were identified asthma endotypes allergic asthma childhood onset , hypersensitivity to airborne allergens , th mediated inflammatory process , eosinophilia of blood and airways , inhaled corticosteroids less effective , ige antagonists are more effective aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease aerd chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps , severe bronchospasm if nsaids are ingested , marked blood and airway eosinophilia , increased expression of leukotriene c synthetase , response to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists and lipoxyenase inhibitors allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis abpm colonization of airways by aspergillus fumigatus , increased fungal specific ige and igg , elevated blood eosinophil and total ige levels , elevated airway eosinophils and neutrophils , requires oral corticosteroids and antifungals late onset asthma pulmonary function testing is more impaired than allergic asthma , marked eosinophilia in blood and airways , need oral corticosteroids may be mediated by il cross country skiing induced asthma ccsa triggered by exposure to cold dry air and intense exercise , not usually due to allergies , inflammatory infiltrate consists of lymphocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils rather than eosinophils , airway remodeling with thickened basement membrane , not usually responsive to inhaled corticosteroids the tables on diagnosis and endophenotype are remarkable for their parallels with psychiatric diagnosis and research the available endotypes do probably not capture all of the clinical scenarios of asthma because patient behavior is a significant factor the endotype classification of asthma by experts is interesting in that it includes a treatment response dimension and this has been avoided in psychiatry at the diagnostic level like mental illnesses , asthma is a complex polygenic disease with considerable clinical heterogeneity using endophenotype approaches very similar to the approaches that have been applied to the study of schizophrenia offers the hope that classification and treatments of subtypes will be more effective and the connection between the genetics of the illness , pathophysiological mechanisms , and subtype will become more apparent although the parallels with mental illness are clear , asthma researchers and clinicians treating asthma have the advantage in that they can proceed without the stigmatization that only accompanies psychiatric disorders and psychiatrists george dawson , md , dfapa barranco p , p rez franc s c , quirce s , g mez torrijos e , c rdenas r , s nchez garc a s ,
