my mother and i drove out to check out a campground today , oka national park , that we thought might be good for the summer montreal unschoolers gathering we figure since we came up with the idea so late , only a few months before we want it to happen , we should get everything done as soon as possible ! and i'm very happy to say that i think we 've found the perfect place ! ! it 's only about minutes from downtown montreal , and it 's also a really lovely place it 's lovely in the winter , and looking around , we think it 'll be even more beautiful in the summertime ! there 's even a swim able beach on a large lake why we were especially interested in this campground park was because they have a building with twelve rooms to rent , but you can rent as little as five rooms and get the whole place to yourself ! here are the pictures i took on our tour of the g te sous les pins here it is from a couple of angles inside , there 's a lot of lovely wood a dining room a downstairs hangout room my mom thinks those tables are perfect for playing bananagrams ! the upstairs hallway , which is entirely comprised of bedrooms each bedroom sleeps three people , with the option to add a fourth bed which would make it wall to wall beds each bedroom also has a sink and closet space for those who would prefer to camp , either for money reasons or because it 's more fun , there are campsites right by the g te , as in a two second walk , so that really would n't affect your ability to hang out in the main building at all also , the park includes several historical chapels and oratories see the little white building on the hill ? that 's one of them ! the staff there were even super nice , and very knowledgeable , so we were just pretty impressed with the place in general nearby oka village is lovely , and my mother and i decided to drive through it and make a list of important local stores i found it funny that , by chance , the grocery store and the liquor commission where at the top of our list really , what else do you need while we were there , i hopped out and took a couple of pictures , including of this old church , that i 've always thought was gorgeous quebec has an abundance of lovely old churches ! all the old buildings are one of my favorite things about montreal and surrounding area right by the church is where the ferry is in the summer the ferry goes right across the water , to another scenic little town called hudson on our way home , but still only minutes from oka national park , we pulled over to take a closer look at an old , yet still operational , monastery having now looked the place up online , i know that it 's not only operational , but open to visitors ! next time i'm out that way , i totally want to see inside that building so , it was a really nice day out the weather was beautiful , and we were both so pleased to have found such a pretty place for the gathering , that 's also so close to the city ! ! now we just need to find a good date we 're thinking maybe july nd to th or th ? we 're not sure how attached the americans who want to come are to july th celebrations though , so that might not work the jazz fest would be on then , with tons of free music , so it would be a great time to hang out in the city if that date does n't work , there are plenty of other music festivals with lots of free shows it 's just that the jazz fest is both the biggest and bet known ! i 'll be setting up a website for the gathering soon both because i love playing around with wordpress , and because it 's practical to have all the info in one place ! if you 're interested , do n't forget to join the yahoo group summer montreal unschoolers gathering really excited about this , and hope to see you in montreal this summer ! peace , idzie
