there is a study from the mayo clinic that seems to conclude that forgiveness is good for you they say that holding a grudge can adversely affect your heart and your nervous system this ought to give great comfort to the religious among us because the bible states the same thing and , not so oddly , many psychotherapeutic systems believe in forgiveness , as well the research shows that if you hold a grudge it raises yourblood pressure and heart rate when subjects imagined forgiving the person they felt more relaxed but of course the first step for them is to acknowledge the pain step number , is to find a new way to think about it finally , begin to experience emotional relief it all sounds pretty straightforward except ! this is no different from cognitive therapy , which also asks patients to think in new ways about the hurt what it is actually doing is rerouting the hurt from the right frontal area to the left prefrontal and guess what ? the left , when busy concocting ideas and rationales , actually suppresses the structures in the limbic feeling area so that the person feels more comfortable but it never really touches the pain and , as many animal experiments show , when you tranquilize with a pill or shot the animal seems relaxed but when you measure the deep physiology there is a raging inferno going on there is no magic to all this if we don t address history there can never be a real cure
