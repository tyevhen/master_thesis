hi friends ! i did n't take pictures at my baby shower , but my friends and family did as i await those photos , i thought i 'd show you this cool gift before i take it apart my amazing friend sue who threw me the shower with my mom made it it 's a cake of diapers , but has more than that in it in addition to diapers , it 's made of onesies , washcloths , and the like all rolled up ! it also holds sets of those little baby mitts to protect their face from getting scratched there are loads of baby hair bow clips , puppets , car seat toys , teething toys , soft books the list goes on and on ! it 's been so fun to look at and discover new things my husband and i will both be sad to take it apart ! so , i wanted to make sure to document it here with a photo she placed the cake on a tin platter and all the elements are tied to a wooden rod that goes up the middle there are decorative ribbons wrapped around each layer that hide the little ties she added the toys as the frosting last and voila ! a shower cake ! thanks sue ! we love it ! save you might also like baby shower it 's getting interesting reflecting linkwithin
