two weeks ago , i dropped from mg to mg in the past few days , i 've noticed that i'm feeling a bit sharper , mentally i 've begun craving healthy food again , after several years of craving salt , fat , and sweets normally , i'm one of those lucky people who can normally look at a plate of cookies dispassionately not so on lamictal best of all , there 's been no drop in my mood whatsoever ! the downside i 've had some gi issues constipation and gas my muscles are stiffer i 've also been really tired , but this might be my body 's way of telling me it 's ok to lower my ativan dosage as well
