so dinah , roy and i ventured down to washington dc to the american psychiatric association conference to talk about the use of computers in psychiatry i was hoping to get a picture of our feet under the panel table , but that did n't happen what did happen was that various shrink rappers met a couple shrink rap readers , and we appreciated the feedback you gave us i hope our fellow psychiatrists enjoyed all the presentations at that session as much as we did i personally enjoyed hearing patients talk about how online discussion boards helped them get better that was pretty cool , and not something you hear every day i thought it was pretty brave of them to put their histories out there in public , and i appreciated their willingness to do this for the education of psychiatrists thanks again
