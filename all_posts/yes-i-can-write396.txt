thank you for your suggestions to my previous post ! i think i 'll do 'a week in the life of an unschooler' type thing , following both michele and signe 's suggestions well , not the suggestion to talk about signe , but the unschooling one but for now , i wanted to share this exert , which i very much like i 've written in the past about how misguided i find the whole green living thing you can check out my past posts on it here and here , and since this excert says so simply why i dislike the whole green thing , i figured i 'd post it too the whole individualist what you can do to save the earth guilt trip is a myth we , as individuals , are not creating the crises , and we ca n't solve them take our crazy energy consumption for the past years the story has been the same every year individual consumption residential , by private car , and so on is never more than about a quarter of all consumption the vast majority is commercial , industrial , corporate , by agribusiness and government so , even if we all took up cycling and wood stoves it would have a negligible impact on energy use , global warming and atmospheric pollution i mean , sure , go ahead and live a responsible environmental life recycle , compost , ride a push bike but do it because it is the right , moral thing to do not because it 's going to save the planet if we really want to understand why this happened we have to ask ourselves another question why is it that we seem willing to live with the threat of apocalypse rather than trying to seriously alter a world where consumption , of anything , is seen as unrelieved virtue , production , of anything , is regarded as a social and economic necessity , and more , of anything like children or cars or chemicals or phds or golf courses or recycling centers , is unquestiononly accepted ? that is by kirkpatrick sale oops i just made another political post , did n't i ? oh well so now i shall try and keep track of what i do this week as an unschooler just so you know , it 'll probably be boring p most of the the learning i do involves thinking , reading , and discussing , which although very fascinating to me , is not so much fun to read about ! oh , and here 's a couple of quotes that i 've found recently , and loved they 've also been added to my quotes page none are so hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free goethe the hardest battle in life is to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing it 's best , night and day , to make you like everybody else e e cummings i love quotes peace , idzie you might also like green anarchy earth day anti civ and environmental quotes new quote and anarchy linkwithin
