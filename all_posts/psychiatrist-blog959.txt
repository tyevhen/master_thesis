yes , shrinks get stressed out , too can i tell you about it ? i hate paperwork , in case i never mentioned it and i hate dumb things that are mandated by institutions and do n't make sense so i'm getting ready to go to apa this weekend see you there ? and i'm trying to tie things up it 's not going so well here 's my list medicare remember i told you that i moved and tried to change my address with medicare ? ah , downloadable forms on the medicare website , and not one of them is a change of address form to change my address , i had to re enroll pages then they wanted my office utility bills but i do n't have utility bills , they are included in my rent i faxed my rent invoice it has my address , and it says office rent on it it 's a very nice office i figured i was done two days ago , i got a letter from medicare i 've been denied my application as a doctor of medicine i can appeal why ? i did n't send in three things downloadable form giving access to my bank account so they could pay me only i'm not an in network doc they do n't pay me ever my participating agreement i'm non par and wish to stay that way my utility bills as proof of address am i the only doctor who rents space with utilities included ? i called twice if i wo n't give them my bank account numbers and routing information , i'm out which means i have to leave my clinic job where i 've been for years i do n't have to fill out a participating agreement and they 'll take another copy of my rent invoice i have days to appeal from the date on the letter which came days ago the letter is dated in april it 's now may th and i'm really not happy about giving them my bank account information what happens when they pay me for patients i see at the clinic ? i'm salaried there , i do n't get paid by the patient , the clinic does if i do nothing , i'm quickly opted out , and that 's a good thing unless you 're my medicare patient and you no longer can get reimbursement or you 're the clinic that wants me there have other people had to give their bank account info to change their address ? never done this before time expended who knows hours if you 're a non par provider could you offer some words of wisdom here ? next problem clinic says i need to be tested for tb along with all the other employees so i get a ppd placed , no big deal only i work there one morning a week , and in the past , i 've read it myself or had a dr friend sign off on it , because it 's a hassle to get to the hospital , park , and take off work for this now i'm told i ca n't read it myself or have another doctor read it , unless it 's an internist , pediatrician , or pulmonologist okay , found a friend , still have to get the form faxed in time expended hours next problem my cell phone blitzed last night i called they said i needed updates and they 'd push them through whatever the phone worked , i thanked them , and half an hour later , i was on my merry way only then the phone did n't work and my kid 's phone did n't work i called back i held i powered off , i powered on , i removed the sim cards , i read the numbers , i switched the sim cards , i powered on and off and ate the batteries and prayed for ducks to come the phones are n't reading the sim cards i need to get new ones okay hours i got to work today the phone works fine i called at t ca n't be the sim card husband 's phone works fine must be the degrading tower what 's a degrading tower ? does it crumble ? why does husband 's phone work ? very strange , no explanation , but tonight , all the phones work time expended hours i suppose the last thing is the book time expended , hours our editor wants it in mid may i think that happened it 's almost there we still need a little polish on the last few chapters and a table of contents and suggested reading if you know a shrink book that 's been helpful to you , please let us know in the comments we 'll try to stick it in hanging on for http www patobriens com patobriens havefun hrricane asp thank you for humoring me tonight , please send a bill
