despite my best efforts the dive in my mood continues actually , rather than a quick dive , it now feels like a gradual , suffocating , slide underwater really black , heavy , murky water the symptoms i'm experiencing have multiplied over the past couple days and today depression took away what little energy i had left i'm heavy , exhausted , and slow i 've been trying to do what i can to get out , keep to my commitments , and talk to friends though i admit i have n't done too well on that score socialization is always the first to go today , i lost running that 's a scary sign , as that 's often my last bastion of normalcy but today i tried and failed okay , perhaps i'm being too hard on myself i did n't totally fail i did get some of my run accomplished , but very unlike me , i could not complete the miles i had scheduled and the miles i did run were so difficult , i was incredibly frustrated i was forced to begin walking far from home my body just would n't go jet and i slowly made our way back it was a long , cold , misadventure i'm concerned i certainly do n't want to go through another depression episode i want to keep moving forward i want to keep working , running , and socializing i want to feel the feelings of life , not stand outside myself and coldly observe i'm going through the motions without feeling i want to be in motion instead i'm speaking to a high school class about depression tomorrow hopefully that will help get me out of my head for an hour i'm also scheduled to see my therapist , which i certainly hope will help turn the tide i want and need to get my head back above water i'm low , so low up is the only direction i have left to go
