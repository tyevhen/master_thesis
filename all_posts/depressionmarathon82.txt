i'm encouraged today after only two ect treatments , my mood and thinking have both improved i have another treatment scheduled for tomorrow , and i'm hoping to discharge home saturday i'm already really antsy to get out of here i miss jet i miss running i miss my living room after returning home , i 'll likely have outpatient ect treatments next week , which will put me back at work the following monday i'm anxious to get back to work as well with no time off benefits , i'm not sure how i'm going to pay my bills in a couple of weeks , as there is absolutely no money coming in right now as i was explaining to one of the nurses last night i do n't receive any employment benefits because i do n't work full time , and i do n't work full time because my depression worsens every time i increase my hours , and i need to work full time in order to receive benefits for the times when my depression worsens and takes me out of work it 's a vicious cycle i 've been stuck in for years that cycle is not going to change in the next couple of days , however , so i'm trying to have faith things will work out as they should what else can i do ? i'm grateful and relieved to be feeling a little better i'm glad to be nearing the end of my stay here this is a healing place , but i miss my home
