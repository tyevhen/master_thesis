the badge of shame a big , fat , pompous splash screen , letting you know whose priorities really matter disclaimer this is an opinion piece all opinions are my own and not those of my employer maybe i'm getting old and cranky maybe i 've been in this business too long actually , scratch that i'm sane and normal it 's the industry that 's screwed up here 's what pisses me off i abhor monolithism , or the appearance of it and i hate when it steals precious seconds or minutes out of my day day in and day out every day over and over again when i turn my computer on , it should just be on ready to go kind of like well , like my phone , for example which is , after all , my real computer when i fire up photoshop or openoffice , or any other pathetically oversized mountain of bloatware , it should just violently start , before i 've even raised my coffee cup to my mouth or appear to start , at least show me a screenshot that looks like photoshop trick me into thinking it 's running cache my ui gestures until the world has finished bootstrapping run my gestures against an image in the cloud make my gestures appear to do something interesting fool me into thinking the damn thing is running better yet , make it so i'm so f cking tired of looking at splash screens whether adobe 's , microsoft 's , or anybody else 's a splash screen basically tells me , in very clear cut terms , that my time is worth nothing whatsoever it 's a fresh reminder that users' needs do n't count as much as programmer convenience does the customer can wait we 've got more important things to do like show you this test pattern with our programmers' names on it thomas knoll is the first name on the photoshop splash screen , right ? i know it by heart now so do millions of others , i'm sure , not because i am intimately familiar with the history of photoshop and thus know that thomas and his brother john were the originators of the program , but because i 've seen that freakin' splash screen so many times in my life , it 's burned permanently into my visual cortex you know what ? as a consumer , i'm tired of that crap it has to stop the madness has to stop splash screens have to stop bloated slothware that takes seconds or even , or to load has got to stop let 's be perfectly blunt a splash screen communicates sloth if i were shantanu narayen ceo of adobe i would outlaw them immediately either that or commit seppuku in disgrace please understand , i'm not here to pick on adobe specifically after all , i work for them microsoft , far more than adobe or anybody else , deserves top billing on the sloth wall of shame imagine if your phone or ipad took as long to boot as a windows laptop would you use it ? would it be usable ? why then are we still using desktop pcs ? well , as it turns out , we mostly are n't but i guess that 's the point i'm sorry to have used the f word f cking' a few paragraphs ago , i really am every bone in my body recoils at using that word in a blog or anywhere else but we 've long since passed the point where i can remain reasonable on this subject the subject of monolithism in software design i remember when whole operating systems ran in less memory than firefox leaks in seconds , for crying out loud yeah , so , i guess i am old and cranky but you know what ? it 's time somebody said something slothware is a non starter it no longer meets the criterion of minimally usable as set by iphone and similar devices it does n't deserve to live stab it in the heart with a wooden stake , i say it 's time to move on i can think of lots of ways to make bloatware look lite e g , show a ui right away and let an instance of the program in the cloud operate against my gestures , until the local copy boots fully and can re sync with me put up a lite ui until the heavy one finishes loading for heaven 's sake , you can just give me a simple game to play while the program boots do something useful , something that makes me feel like a human being do n't just force me to stare at a pompous billboard for whoever created the program that 's the height of arrogance and uselessness it gives the middle finger to the customer i say it 's time to kill bloatware or at least convincingly fake its death and put the user back in control make big programs feel lite as a user , i want to feel empowered , not belittled trick me into thinking big programs are already running because after all , they probably are , in the cloud somewhere we need to get this right , because today 's user of desktop and laptop software and enterprise software , i might add will not stand for standards of software behavior that were , frankly , already pathetically inadequate in it 's now users have smart phones and tablets that come on like a light switch , apps a blazin' the bar is higher now monolithism , or the appearance of it , simply has to go let me put it in even starker terms if we in the pc software biz keep treating customers like pathetic dolts whose time is worth nothing we deserve the fate that 's waiting for us
