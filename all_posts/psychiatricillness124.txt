here 's a photo from my hols , a traditional english seaside holiday ! hopefully to cheer up the post i have internet access back , had it for about days now my mood is all over the place as there is a man about who i'm not sure whether is interested in me and i am not sure if i'm interested but think he seems really nice and i 'd like to find out i'm feeling particulary low tonight i had a few days off work after my holiday as i was really low then decided to sort myself out have buzzed non stop for the last few weeks and now my mood has crashed again i wish i knew what normal was , maybe this is normal ? ? maybe i just try to hard to feel better when i am feeling normal maybe that is what sends me hypo ! i think the key is to just accept my different moods , not hate them and not fight them ! i do n't think there will ever be a man who can cope ! isit even fair to impose my moods on others ?
