six years ago today , i took my last drink it 's another birthday for me it 's hard to imagine my life today had i not quit drinking in fact , i doubt i would have a life today it 's much more likely i 'd be dead and even in the dark moments of these recent weeks , i know i am privileged to be leading the life i lead i have safe housing , a healthy body , the time and ability to do things i love , a wonderful dog , a new relationship , and i'm surrounded by amazing friends and professionals who care about me none of that would have been possible without sobriety i'm humbled by and grateful for my sobriety today
