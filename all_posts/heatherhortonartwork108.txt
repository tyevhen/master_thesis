i know not how i may seem to others , but to myself i am a small child wandering upon the vast shores of knowledge , every now and then finding a small bright pebble to content myself with plato jim , bennett 's high island , oil on canvas , x , is the first painting from my upcoming solo exhibition of newfoundland inspired artworks that will be on display from november nd , i have been surrounded by these images and ideas ever since returning from the rock and i wanted to share one of them with you i have spoken before about how some paintings are deliberately constructed , envisioned in a dream or in a moment of inspiration the reference gathering for these paintings are organized , often shifted , frequently examined and sometimes re examined sometimes they work and other times seemingly clever ideas must be disregarded however , other times a little serendipity happens and you capture an image that you know will instantly be a painting that is the case with jim , bennett 's high island two of david 's good friends , jim and cyril , took us out to explore the surrounding islands off the coast of wesleyville on the northeastern side of the island we headed out in cyril 's sturdy sea runner boat and i managed to capture some reference of him that has become a painting as well we chopped across the water across to bennett 's high island , an island that david blackwood has incorporated in his work frequently , an island surely filled with strong memories there used to be a beautiful , old lighthouse on the island , which has since been replaced by a very practical , simple affair that pulsed red regularly every evening without fail the four of us climbed bennett 's high island , each wearing the functional and necessary galoshes that would deter the wet and spongy earth from reaching our feet labrador tea was everywhere , and there was an array of different seasonal berries underfoot as well partridge berries and blueberries were the most abundant as the very popular cloudberries bakeapple had already been picked and was rather scarce as a result there were broken crab shells littering a clearing of exposed rock that jim explained were the handywork of intelligent gulls who had learned to drop crabs from a high altitude in order to crack their tough shells i marveled at their resourcefulness while jim was climbing i had my camera ready to take a picture of whatever interesting composition presented itself jim wended his way up through the foliage and i took a few shots of him his figure created an interesting shape as he negotiated the terrain and i knew that there was a painting that i could make from the reference as soon as i had shot it i remember how the skyline was interrupted by his jacket , the undulating green and ochre waves broken by his figure it was a sparse but had movement it was a deliberate path towards a place up ahead i loved how it served too as a metaphor , and perhaps it is because of its spare composition that this element is emphasized here i like that his face is hidden , as , ironically , it adds more of a personal connection for me i can be jim and so can you we have been and perhaps we will be still i like that we cannot see the lighthouse , that we cannot see what he is walking towards as usual , the information not provided in my paintings is what i find exciting i enjoy painting part of the story , but not all of it if all of the narrative is there for us to see , what mystery is there ? the fun is the guessing , the wondering , asking the questions that we will never know the answers to , yet we continue to ask them regarding the exhibition , it has been a pleasure creating these paintings , reliving the moments of being there , trying to capture the essence of that time with the paint it is a way to take the journey again , and when the paintings are all assembled in the gallery i think it will happen one more time here are some details about the show if you are able to , please attend ! newfoundland portraits november nd , abbozzo gallery , oakville , ontario opening reception november th , pm if you are interested in seeing any of these paintings please contact abbozzo gallery they will be happy to answer any of your questions take good care , heather travelers , there is no path , paths are made by walking antonio machado
