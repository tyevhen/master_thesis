my posting of sine wave has been thoroughly interrupted by a number of things below , the next poem in the progression to mania at the carnival we ride the swinger , hang by chains high above the asphalt and circle an electric maypole i close my eyes , lean back , go intentionally limp and let my long frame hang like middle aged spaghetti beneath the pirate moon the air is cool , i am a fat bird in a chair i open my eyes , flap wings , stick out my dodo legs and yell , i m jesus ! and pigs shall fly ! but who else sees the strands of kairos through light from funhouse mirrors ? three corndogs later we board the tilt a whirl , our sail a shell of glittering , metal flake pink we orbit the vortex of our little track , our feet sucked centerward thrown against our moving wall , sarah chants redrum , redrum , while i laugh she hasn t seen the shining but does the voice so well ! there is a red room full of men and bulls and one man meant to put an end to it it s said his blood stains everything except the stars which bleed their light so profligately still barely dent the darkness we come to a stop pendulum fashion the carnie steadies our decline by hand as hendrix sings , are you experienced ? have you ever been experienced ? i sing , well , i ha ave the carnie smiles published in absinthe a carnival is a great setting for attempting to portray the mindset of hypomania notice that the speaker experiences intrusively cosmic spiritual thoughts , pre messianic if you will because he 's not yet manic , he does n't believe he 's the chosen one , though he 's making noises in that direction one old friend , familiar with my disease , nicknamed me the kentucky fried christ sarah , now , must have been about seven when i wrote this my last post was unashamedly religious , describing my testy understanding of my faith nothing like relgion and politics to stir things up i wanted to add something to the discussion i believe christianity is best communicated interpersonally , not with giant revivals and crusades if jesus was about anything , it was about the unique needs of each person , something that dr paul tournier wrote about eloquently in his the meaning of persons people often wonder why christ was so unpredictable , how he appeared to act differently toward each person he encountered , from the woman at the well he forgave to the pharisees he cursed in public the answer is simple he changed as the person changed in order to pierce the veil of defenses and he always knew what to say to cut to the heart of the matter in regard to spiritual impediments recall the rich young ruler of whom he asked all his worldly possessions the man went away saddened but could n't give up his wealth it 's as if christ had a neural probe to locate the one thing , the one attachment that crippled whomever sought him such defects were more important to him than physical healing , the demand for which literally wore him out heal someone physically and they still die heal someone spiritually and they live forever thine at kilorats , ce
