the recent study in the american journal of psychiatry by gibbons , mann , and colleagues regarding the relationship between ssri usage and suicides reads more like an exercise for undergraduate students to find obvious errors than it does a real peer reviewed study sounds mean , but keep reading the abstract of the study includes the following in both the unites states and the netherlands , ssri prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased after u s and european regulatory agencies issued warnings about a possible suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients , and these decreases were associated with increases in suicide rates in children and adolescents so less ssris more suicides , according to the authors let s see if this study actually shows such a relationship look closely at the above graphs click to enlarge from the article note that the decrease in ssri prescriptions from to was very slight across the , , and age groups , which is the timeframe in which suicide rates for those aged increased notably the larger declines in ssri prescribing for youth occurred from , which happens to be when the suicide rate for those aged appears to have decreased from per , see table page here to per , see table here yes , i know i am comparing data for ages to data on ages , but i think this makes sense when one considers that the suicide rate for those and under is much lower than for those aged actually , grouping suicide data for ages makes little sense to me given the vast differences in suicide rate within this age group it is important to note that the authors of the paper did not have data from , but there is nothing from the u s ssri prescription data cited in their paper that even suggests a relationship between decreased ssri use in youth and an increased suicide rate , as the decrease in prescriptions was minimal pay close attention the authors ran a total of zero statistical analyses to examine the relationship between ssri prescription rates and suicide rates in the united states that s right , zero so they put up a couple of figures without a single shred of statistical evidence , then claim that declining ssri prescriptions are associated with an increase in suicide rates any peer reviewer who was not drunk or on a high dose of seroquel should have noticed this gigantic flaw in the discussion , the authors state while only a small decrease in the ssri prescription rate for u s children and adolescents occurred from to , the public health warnings may have left some of the most vulnerable youths untreated this is unadulterated speculation , which as i just mentioned is not supported by a single statistical analysis in their paper it is also hard to imagine how an fda warning in mid october could make suicides earlier in the year increase one can only wonder to what magical time traveling extent an fda warning in october could have increased suicide rates earlier in the year this is so mind bogglingly obvious that , again , the peer reviewers were possibly inebriated during the review process , or the editor published the paper over the objections of the reviewers am i being too nasty ? i'm just trying to figure out how it got published and good science is not the answer the authors then proposed the following we estimate that if ssri prescriptions in the united states were decreased by for all patients , there would be an increase of , suicides per year in addition in children years of age , a reduction in ssri prescriptions would lead to an estimated increase of suicides per year given that ssri prescriptions for children under age already underwent a reduction of approximately from to , we expect an increase of suicides per , children in this age group since there are approximately million children in this age group , we would expect additional deaths by suicide in relative to , or an increase of in this age group preliminary suicide data indicate a suicide rate in year olds of per , , holding steady from this does not support the predictions of gibbons and colleagues granted , the data are preliminary , but i d be surprised if they showed a large change in the direction that gibbons , mann , and their team predicted again , let me state that these are only correlational data and that data from clinical trials as well as other sources trumps these types of studies in any case at the very least , when doing correlational research , try to control for covariates other variables of interest , examine trends over a longer time period than one year , and maybe actually run some statistics oh , and avoid conclusions that require belief in time travel there are even more potential problems , but the authors missed so many glaring basic issues that it makes no sense to go any deeper if data based on correlations is going to be trotted out to scare physicians into prescribing more ssris , then it should be examined whether the correlations provide even preliminary support for the idea that ssris might reduce suicide i 've criticized many studies on this site for a variety of concerns like here and here , among many examples , and i think the present study is among the worst offenders of basic research methodology until we clean up the science , do n't expect much real progress in the mental health treatment world background here and here major hat tip furious seasons
