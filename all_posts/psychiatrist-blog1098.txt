this is a post for clinkshrink , but she 's so busy lately that i thought i 'd stick it up so in maryland , to the best of my knowledge and i could be wrong we have this idea that if someone is criminally insane and needs hospitalization , they should probably stay in the hospital i'm not aware that forensic facilities take people on field trips like i said , i could be wrong , i do n't treat inpatients and i do n't work with designated forensic patients the piece below caught my attention , it 's from the seattle times on thursday , phillip arnold paul , who had been committed after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the slaying of an elderly woman , disappeared during a field trip to the spokane county interstate fair with other eastern state hospital patients and staff members the escape prompted an extensive manhunt that ended sunday when paul , , surrendered to authorities near goldendale , klickitat county , about miles from the fair it was the second time that paul had escaped from state custody the photo , by the way , is of a cow at the maryland state fair , and has nothing to do with the story of the escapee from the state hospital in spokane i just like cows
