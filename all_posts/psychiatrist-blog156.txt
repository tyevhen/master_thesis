sometimes , i like to bother pharmacists they are the nicest people , and very patient about looking up medication costs for me once , i wrote a post called the co t of being depressed , where i compared the cost of anti depressants today , i'm writing over on our clinical psychiatry news website about the surprisingly high cost of abilify here 's the short form , but do surf over there for details i called three pharmacies and compared prices on abilify please remember , this data is for three pharmacies only a single mg tablet cost between and dollars more do n't cost appreciably less per pill so a day supply ran at a local independent pharmacy to at wal mart if you do the math , you 'll realized that at wal mart there was some discount for bulk the pill price for tablets is about cents pill less than for pills a single mg tablet runs a mg tablet costs the same as a mg tablet which is the same as a mg and mg tablet a mg tablet costs the same as a mg tablet it costs a whole lot less if you split the pills this stuff is expensive you 'll note the graphic above is an animated abilify commercial i hope the pharmaceutical company appreciates the free advertising
