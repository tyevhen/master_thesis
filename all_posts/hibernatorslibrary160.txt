communities of transsexual women called hijra have existed in india for centuries they began as a holy group which could bless people and places and remove the evil eye but as the british colonized india , the hijra began to be shunned and stigmatized these communities still exist in india today , but now the hijra are generally beggars and prostitutes they are often shunned by their families and by society in general those who were once great have fallen due to western stigma i will share my thoughts about two documentaries about the hijra the first is called harsh beauty , which was distributed by frameline , a nonprofit lgbt media arts organization this hour long documentary is almost entirely in hindi and tamil , with english subtitles it is interview style focusing on several people these people range from holy people who ask for alms in exchange for blessings to politicians to prostitutes unfortunately , it appears that the former more presentable categories have very , very few people , whereas the majority of hijra are beggars and prostitutes in some ways , the trans communities in india are tighter than those in the us in india , the hijra live , work , and die together they form very strong bonds however , this also means that they do not have strong relationships with their birth families they do not live with their families or marry at east not conventionally , as i 'll discuss later in fact , many have been shunned by their families , or must visit them only discretely transsexuals in the us have to jump through an amazing amount of red tape for years in order to get their surgeries , but when they have the surgery it is in a safe , sterile , finely tuned environment a man woman surgery can rearrange the nerve endings to form a clitoris although this is a major surgery in the us , and it takes much dedication to jump through all the hoops , it seems to me that the hijra must be even more dedicated than american trans people to get their operation in india , the surgery is much more brutal than it is here there 's no anesthesia because this is a spiritual ritual the boy stands naked in a temple looking up at his deities then , the guru cuts off his manhood testicles and penis there is no delicate reorganization of the nerves in this surgery after the surgery , hot oil is poured on the wound for days to help it heal this procedure may make me shudder in its brutality , but i doubt it seems brutal at all to the hijra community as i said , to them it 's a spiritual experience after the surgery , hijra from all over the area will come to have a huge festival of celebration because a new member of their community has been initiated i would say this documentary was an excellent introduction to transsexual culture in non western cultures however , because of its format interviewees speaking in a foreign language , and very little other action , it was n't the most dynamic of documentaries stars for good coverage of an excellent topic the second documentary i watched was the third sex , which was episode , season of national geographic 's taboo series this film had a fantastic description of a hijra festival which takes place in koovagam , tamil nadu this festival celebrates the wedding of the god aravan , who was destined to die in battle in one day he prayed to be married before his death , but no woman would marry him and become a widow so quickly widows do not have very good lives in india so the male god vishnu came in woman 's form and married aravan every year , hijra from all around india flock to koovagam to celebrate their own marriage to aravan it is a happy marriage festival with much celebration then , the next day , the hijra cover their faces in turmeric , beat their chests , wail , dress in white , and morn the death of their husband watching this documentary was a much more enjoyable experience than watching harsh beauty it was more dynamic and had beautiful filmography however , it was also more sensationalized and less realistic and informative than harsh beauty of the two , i think harsh beauty was the better stars for dynamic filmography and interesting topic
