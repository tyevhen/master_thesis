a reliving of pre birth and birth imprint will evoke the exact same reactions as at the time of the original trauma but in the absence of a reliving , the reactions or fragments of the memory will persist , such as a fast heart rate or high blood pressure there will be a racing mind racing because it is being mobilized by deep level imprints there will also be the inability to think clealy confusion we are dealing with imprints before we had organized thoughts , so not thinking clearly is understandable there will be difficulty sleeping , especially falling asleep when we relive a complete early pre birth memory of which a high blood pressure was a part , then in the total reliving that fragment of the memory will also be included , and the patient should consequently see relief from the intrusive symptoms if aspects of the original reaction are missing , the reliving is not complete and therefore not curative if we medicate blood pressure and keep the high level reaction under wraps the complete reliving is not possible that is one danger of taking tranquilizers we feel better but in generally we will live a shorter life any deep symptoms such as a constant low grade fever or chronically elevated body temperature all point the way to the brainstem and some parts of the limbic brain that is , they point to perhaps a pre birth experience pointing out the route the patient ultimately will have to travel we may not see the problem for decades and therefore cannot imagine how early someone s heart problem began the way out for the anxiety case is usually stroke or heart attack realistically , the real way out needs to be the way in feeling the anxiety untrammeled , naked and bare for what it is and was pure terror it is panic in the face of the threat of death at birth most of the current problems in neurosis can be traced to anxiety which is the most primitive reaction we have in common with many primitive animals such as the lizard we need terror to alert us to danger strange to say that we need terror but it is true and a nation of pill takers are voiding any chance at real health by suppressing the warning signs it would be like suppressing the forerunners of a heart attack angina just to feel comfortable i know how necessary this can be it is not a moral position but one of survival take obsessions patients will be openly anxious if they cannot carry out their rituals , the same if we are not allowed to act out any of our neuroses sexual rituals are another example the rituals , in short , attempt to bind the anxiety the content of the ritual may have little to do with the base but is a channel for first line reactions as are many phobias , as well so again , what is it , this anxiety , and where does it come from ? the way i found out is simply going to work every day and observing patients in a session , as a patient is near the deep feeling of hopelessness or helplessness she often runs an anxiety attack she has shortness of breath , butterflies in the stomach , pressure on the chest , high agitation and a feeling of near death she feels totally agitated and wound up and has no idea how to stop it and it goes on until those feelings are connected and resolved the person has no idea what is going on , it is incomprehensible , which aggravates the anxiety state this is not an idiosyncratic happenstance anxiety appears in nearly all of our patients at one point in a session as they approach the first line these feelings were so shattering when the baby was an infant that it was immediately repressed in the interest of survival and also in the interest of maintaining a functioning neo cortex it is an automatic process that keeps us from being overwhelmed it allows us to survive in the most drastic circumstances can we imagine how the fetus or baby feels in the face of this terror ? that fragility is still there inside overwhelmed can mean non functioning , yet most of us have children , have to go to work , do the shopping etc there is no time for dysfunction enter tranquilizers the reason it is called anxiety and not terror , even though it is the very same feeling , is that sufferer never knows where anxiety comes from and don t know what it really is we therefore treat them as separate entities anxiety began its life so early that it can seem totally unrelated to what is going on twenty years later because of the disconnection , anxiety seems to hang in space with no specific antecedent once the patient feels a trauma at birth gasping for oxygen the anxiety becomes the terror and the fight for life that it is and was it now has a home and an owner so again , where does it come from ? a high level of anxiety in the mother will contribute to stress and later anxiety for the fetus there have been many studies bearing this out cited in later chapters an anxious , pregnant mother , responding to her outer world is stirring up the metabolism of her fetus , who is also responding to his environment if mother s anxiety goes on long enough , it will become a permanent state in the fetus , and change him for life it so looks like genetics that we easily mistake it for heredity after all , the baby seems to be born unable to sit still or learn in school the mother s anxiety will over stimulate the fetus and impair her nervous system , creating a child with an imprint of a high level of stimulation she may feel overwhelmed by every little thing that happens throughout life as an adult she might respond to her husband asking her to bring the salt to the table he is met with an angry , do you really expect me to do everything ? get it yourself everything becomes too much because it was during womb life everything that was too much , then , is laid down as a substrate , and all new demands work against that substrate so one little new request made of her as an adult has a magnified impact and if by chance she made an error on something she would immediately turn it around to make the accuser wrong she cannot be wrong and immediately transfers terrible feelings of having made a mistake so that the other person feels wrong he ends up defending himself again , it is not so much that she has done something wrong , but that small error has resonated with something very important in her that may mean i am not loved if now this person suffers panic attacks it means that the basic terror is close to the surface hence the chronic feeling of being overwhelmed overwhelmed by feelings we see an example of this in the monkey study discussed in a later chapter mothers were given cocaine which stirred up and agitated them , not unlike a maternal anxiety attack , and we saw the result impulsive offspring more likely to take drugs as adults anxious monkeys take to alcohol as do we and what makes them anxious ? sporadic and unpredictable separation from the mother lack of steady love let us suppose those fears were channeled into elevators , a fear of being enclosed as the object of terror the terror is deep brain the focus is higher brain psychotherapy cannot cure a deep brain terror by a discussion with the higher brain it is not where the wound lies there can be circumstances in life that could create such a phobia , such as being stuck in an elevator or another enclosed space as a young child , but real terror a life and death event , only rarely derives from happenings in late childhood the imprint is the origin , terror becomes the reaction , and phobia becomes the focus we need to separate each so we understand the problem , and then address the imprint with its reaction the imprint generates all of the rest for a fetus , the mother s womb is the external world a womb environment that keeps the fetus in an alert state eventually becomes part of the baby who will be a more aggressive , hyperactive child who cannot focus or concentrate in class he will grow up hyper vigilant this may be useful if he becomes an undercover cop but is bad for his longevity conversely , if the carrying mother is depressed for a lengthy period of time , her baby may go into down mode , perhaps for life as a personality characteristic he may love cocaine later in life or even better , methamphetamine , which puts the body in an up position anxiety is often manifested by choking or smothering sensations , dizziness and a feeling of impending doom and quite soon the patient will cough and choke in a session that is a harbinger of a birth pain that is breaking through during a reliving of the birth trauma later on , when immersed in the experience there will often be coughing and bringing up sputum in large amounts there is now the context actually , doing that coughing and choking in exaggerated fashion while anxious will help a person feel better and we recommend it to our patients when they do not have deeper access for the moment it is simply the discharge of the some of the energy of the feeling none of these need a cortex or higher level brain function that is one very important reason that words cannot cure it it is basically visceral and sub cortical these manifestations are coughing , suffocating , drowning telling us that they emanate from a very primitive brain organization and from a time when there was only an inchoate cerebral structure lacking a fully developed neo cortex to handle trauma there is no insight that can treat it because it began its life long before we had words first line knows no words or screams patients never scream when in the birth sequence , there are only grunts and moans if there are childhood cries or words or screams it indicates higher brain levels are involved and therefore not a true reliving we simply cannot fool the lower brain the higher one ? yes otherwise , how on earth would we elect psychopaths to office ? when we do not have lower level access we are not anchored into feelings so we cannot judge the veracity of what others are saying we fail to see nuance or subtleties because we cannot feel it we just don t get it we should get it because otherwise we can be fooled or tricked terror is what we see in lower animals who are frightened by another animal their reactions seem like pure panic we see this in some individuals who undergo mris the minute they are enclosed in a steel and cement sheath panic surges forth it is approximating what happened originally it takes the confines of such a machine to reawaken the primitive feeling the patient may believe it is the machine that is producing anxiety , but it is the primal panic from the confined , enclosed space the womb in which he tried to exit for life what the mri does is stimulate a resonating memory not a memory in the way we usually think of it , but it sets off a bodily reaction if we do have this kind of anxiety having an mri exam , we can be fairly sure that we endured a difficult birth or pre birth it is , in short , a differential diagnostic tool to separate out those with healthy births from those with traumatic births we can teach the technicians who perform mris to tap the leg or foot of the person at irregular intervals so that one cannot organize a full fledged anxiety reaction or offer an eye mask so that the person stays unaware of his surroundings when this distraction fails there might be an anxiety attack so now we have one good reason not to use words when treating those with many first line symptoms we are dealing with a non verbal animal rummaging around in the lower reaches of our nervous system it is basically visceral as our insides feel as though they are exploding the hysteric is a good example someone with barely any control , unable to concentrate , scattered , all over the place , explosive , overreacting , seemingly overcome with feelings at all times this is someone with first line lower brain damage , deprivation during womb life , at birth or just after words are not going to slow this person down who seems like she is in a rush all of the time , including a rush to get the session over with she wants to get better now ! she needs to be allowed to go to those remote places that drive her driven by very early deprivation of need this is far below the verbal level or if the person is not able to access the deep brain we can give painkillers that will suppress its force for a time until she can feel her feelings too often , the therapist or physician sees their job as eliminating the symptom , because it is considered a sort of a mystery that is unfathomable and of course the symptom is uncomfortable and could be life endangering and when we just attack the symptom there is the tacit assumption that it is there for no good reason otherwise why not attack the source ? battling symptoms is usually a vain exercise there is no end to it
