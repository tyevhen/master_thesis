some days i am so thankful i don t have to go to work the last few days have been no fun temps in the teens with wind chills in the single digits we had a little snow that turned to ice it won t melt for another day or two , i m sure when it s like this , i tend to hibernate i haven t left the house in several days our beagle , fred , has a winter coat to wear , but he still can t stop shivering when he is outside out spitz , mindy , on the other hand , loves the cold and snow her only frustration is that fred doesn t want to leave the garage we lived in pennsylvania the last several years before retiring the cold gave my muscles all kinds of problems even worse was the ice i never felt safe often , i had to wait in my car until someone arrived to help me into the office once i was indoors , i never left until closing time we moved to the south for two important reasons the first was to be near my wife s family the second was to escape the cold fortunately , winters are short and ice storms are infrequent because i was born and raised in minnesota , i am often asked if i miss the snow my response is always the same no if i want snow , i can drive two hours north or east and be in the mountains right now , all i am waiting for is the warm up in a couple of days we re supposed to be in the s and s again that is a winter s day i can enjoy
