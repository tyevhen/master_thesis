i was in tears three times before lunch this morning i now feel drained and like shit first a vendor we use at work told my boss i had refused to answer her question ok maybe i did not answer it but it was pm on monday evening and i had done a whole days work on sunday and been in the city on a course all day ! ok , this pissed me off but i took a walk , could see where she was coming from and got over it a bit later i found an email from my boss telling me to note the words she had used and think about the impression i was giving her now that really annoyed me i am doing my best and have been working hour days this week so things did not slip while i was out the office how dare he pick me up on this ! anyway , i talked to him for a bit and he reassured me i was doing ok and said i could go home once i had done the essential stuff ! ok i got over that one again ! next i went to lunch and i forgot my security pass i knocked on the window and asked the security guy to let me in not only did he want to know where my pass was that would be fair but he started saying i can not leave it behind as if i would lock myself out on purpose ! he was shouting at me 'how are you going to get back in ? ' how the hell was i suppose to know ! i just walked away from him as i knew i could not take anymore i sent my boss a text message and he came down to let me in i was in full tears by this point i could not look at him he understood and let me be i bumped into the security guard again and he apologised for not helping me apparently he was talking to an off site boss who had reprimanded them all because people had been found onsite without passes last week he felt bad but it was not his fault i was upset i still could not look at anyone because i knew i would start bawling rather than silent tears rolling down my face i finally got to the canteen to meet my friend by then the table he was sitting on had filled up and i could not face strangers i told him what had happened and we are going to meet on friday i'm still on work email now , i'm just trying to keep the essentials ticking over but i am trying to rest i can cope with these lows now but i'm not sure i can cope with people reactions to them if anyone tries to be nice and if i do not know them well , it makes me worse the people i know best seem to just keep me company and let me know they are there they except i'm having a bad day as a good enough reason for the tears ! i think i need a rest
