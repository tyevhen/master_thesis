i made the mistake of checking my bank account balance yesterday let 's just say that if my account balance was a pile of rocks , i would not have a very big pile of rocks in fact , if we lived in a society where rocks were used as a sort of primitive currency , i would not have enough rocks to pay rent this realization prompted me to reevaluate my spending in an attempt to find things i could cut out of my budget here are my total superfluous expenses for the month of june food that tastes good fancy tampons overdue movie rentals one issue of cosmopolitan magazine midol highlighters dessert i had no choice but to eliminate all but the most essential expenditures , so i resigned myself to a more spartan existence day one without my luxuries went surprisingly well , until about pm it is at about that time that i usually have dessert when i realized that i was not going to get dessert not even the next night or the night after that i began to panic for the first time in my life , i briefly considered prostitution how hard could it be ? craigslist has turned the world into a virtual street corner my mind started churning over the angles i could use to advertise myself slightly used model female companion all original parts previous owner fairly low maintenance miles per pint of ben and jerry 's or equivalent amount of chocolate tampons so sexy an ad of this magnitude would surely garner me all the chocolate and fancy tampons i could ever dream of ! i could even buy two different colored highlighters if i felt so inclined ! just as i was getting excited about my prostitution fueled candyland , my boyfriend reminded me that i respect myself too much to actually go through with selling my body for dessert and feminine hygiene products but i am not so sure my moral standards get a little hazy when i am facing this kind of deprivation my boyfriend also brought to my attention that i would n't actually be making as much money as i thought because i would definitely have to get myself a pimp for protection my boyfriend is always looking out for my safety and well being ! i have not , as of yet , put up my ad on craigslist , but it is almost lunchtime and i am already sick of rice
