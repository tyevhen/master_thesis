medicare has been using a flawed formula to annually revise medicare fees to all providers the formula results in a larger and larger cut each year , which often gets temporarily fixed at the last minute due to the current dysfunctional congress , the expectation is that it wo n't get fixed this time around , and so this year 's cut ! will stay in place , resulting in many doctors , nurses , psychologists , social workers , and other providers to drop medicare what we need is for them to repeal this flawed sustainable growth rate sgr formula , and replace it with something that makes sense please click here to take a few minutes to let your elected representatives know what you think about this thank you
