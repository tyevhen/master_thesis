nervous people like to be in control , or at least think they are in control we do n't like change we crave stability and knowing that everything is just the way we want , or like , it i'm no exception , and this weekend has been taxing for me i have been planning a large event in st louis for more than a year , and it takes place next weekend recent events in ferguson have caused me to have sleepless nights , racing thoughts , and feelings of dread my stomach has been jumpy for days i fear no one will show up , that my event will be a failure , and that i will be blamed being in recovery , however , i also must acknowledge that i have absolutely , positively , ultimately no control whatsoever over what is going on there i am taking an exaggerated sense of responsibility , as i , or anyone else , could never have anticipated what happened by checking my e mail and the news frequently , i have been trying to give myself a sense of control , but these activities only heighten my anxiety to protect my mental health , i must recognize that i am powerless in this situation as dr low would remind me , although i feel helpless , the situation is not hopeless the conference is still a week away recent events have proved that the the situation can change quickly , sometimes for the worse , but sometimes for the better our event is more than minutes away from ferguson , and my fears that no one will show up is a reflection of imagination on fire rather than reality the next few days are going to be uncomfortable i ca n't change my feelings or sensations , but i do have control over my thoughts and impulses by applying realistic thinking i can temper panic and not overreact to news events i need to keep busy , keep positive , and deal with events as they happen , as anticipation is almost always worse than realization
