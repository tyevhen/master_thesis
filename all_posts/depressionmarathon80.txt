i just returned home from my second outpatient ect treatment i was struggling with sadness and feeling low prior to the treatment , but now my sadness is overwhelming i feel as if someone has died , and i believe that someone is me i 've died i feel dead i'm overwhelmed with hopelessness , sadness and confusion i ca n't make sense of the world anymore why would god want someone to suffer so ? what is the meaning behind these incredible feelings ? why ? why ? why ? why is not a question i normally pose but i guess my desperation is showing through when i try to move i feel as if i'm wading through quick sand when i attempt to think i feel as if the gears are gummed up and sticky visually , lines that should be thin are thick , surfaces that should be smooth are rough everything is slow everything is slow i am so low sitting here hurts i'm having trouble piecing my thoughts together i do n't understand what 's happening there is a vacancy within which wo n't let me go and i just want it to quit
