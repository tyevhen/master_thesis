i think one of my biggest struggles right now is viewing my depression as a character flaw as opposed to an illness when i am feeling more down than usual , instant criticism pops in my head , i am weak , i am a failure , and i am good for nothing why can t i be different ? what s wrong with me ? thus starts a downward spiral of self hate i begin to despise who i am rather that the disease from which i suffer when i said i had depression a couple years ago , i mean that i had severe depression that needed immediate intervention had i not received help at that time , gone to the hospital , started medication , and seeing a counselor , things would not have turned out so good i will say that i am recovered , meaning , i am recovered from severe and even moderate depression however , i think i still struggle with mild depression on a day to day basis in order to keep my mild depressive symptoms in check , i monitor my stress and expectation levels , i try to pay attention to early warning signs , and i have reoccurring chats with my husband about my moods in addition , i regularly update my coping skills list to make sure it reflects the best possible ways to help me get through the tough times these things are really important i don t want to go back to the way i was before also , part of staying away from severe depression is recognizing that i still have mild depression i am not completely cured as my psychiatrist would say when i have bad days , when all i want to do is stay in bed or wallow in self pity , i often make matters worse by beating myself up about it i think my persistent depression must be the result of some character flaw some defect in who i am as a person and , therefore , i must be beyond hope falsely , i think my depression is something i ve brought upon myself it s because , i am lazy , i am self centered , and i am ungrateful sometimes , depression becomes a part of how i d describe myself quiet , artistic , patient , depressed i apply the same resolve to trying to be happier less depressed as i do for trying to be more patient in reality , depression is an illness that imposes itself , unwelcome , in my body and in my brain in this way , the disease is not so different than any other disease of the body , like cancer or diabetes i might be more susceptible to it because of my genetic makeup or my introverted personality , but that doesn t mean i gave myself depression or if i tried harder , i would n't have it and that doesn t mean i am a bad person depression is not a character flaw it is not the result of some sin or vice it is not a descriptive adjective if i knew someone suffering from cancer , would i describe them as fun loving , determined , generous , and cancerous ? no i need to remember that mercy when i am dealing with my own struggles depression is not part of who i am not part of my character but is an unwanted illness that i hope to recovery from someday
