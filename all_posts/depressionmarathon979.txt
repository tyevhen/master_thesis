things are coming around i'm slowly feeling better i think the assignments my therapist gave me are a large part of this healing process i 've written out two schedules on one schedule i 've got boxes to check if i 've done minutes of exercise , taken puck out for his exercise , and if i 've avoided chocolate for the day oh yah , i 've given up chocolate for awhile when i feel mentally bad , i tend to over indulge in the yummy stuff , and then i end up feeling worse ! so i get a star if i 've made it through the day without devouring chocolate so far , so good in fact , knowing i 've got boxes to check every night seems to be helping me stay on track and feel better the other schedule i 've started is a running schedule i'm thinking about doing the richmond marathon in november i'm following a runner 's world training program rather than using my own less thinking for me i have n't yet decided if i am going to actually run the marathon , but i figure having the schedule will help get me out the door and focus my training it 's only been two days , but so far the schedule has nudged me forward it 's working i do n't necessarily like having a regimented , scheduled life however , right now it seems to be what i need being accountable to my therapist and myself , physically putting the check in the box , and having someone else tell me what to do i e the running schedule seems to take a little stress out of my day it 's a good thing i guess i 'll keep keeping the schedules for now
