dear ms curtiss , i bought the kindle version of your brainswitch book , and found it very helpful i do believe that many of us suffering from depression have a wrong thinking problem , and your green frog technique is very helpful i am wondering if the words one recites have to necessarily have to be nonsense words for instance , i am memorizing some phrases of moroccan arabic for when i visit my daughter who is teaching there this winter as long as i am reciting the phrases , it seems to work the one caveat here is that depression definitely makes it hard to memorize well , thank you for this great book i am sure drugs do work , but in my case , they stopped working shokran , thank you ! dear d , any cognitive activity works to 'thoughtjam and distract the neocortex from acknowledging that depression is taking place in the subcortex moroccan phrases or mathematical formulas , nonsense rhymes , anything works without that acknowledgment and concentration on it , depression soon weakens a b curtiss
