in the clinical encounters case featured here two days ago , i presented the story of a psychiatrist who goes for a urological procedure and discovers that one of his former patients is the nurse assisting people wrote in to suggest ways he should handle this awkward situation and i was struck by the idea that some suggested he tell the urologist that he knows the nurse in a social setting because he ca n't tell the other doc that the nurse was his psychiatric patient and the assumption that the urologist would be understanding , and that perhaps the urologist should have policies in place in case of such events do surgeons think this way ? i assumed the urologist would be angry his time had been allotted for the procedure , and it 's a surgical procedure with professional staff , what 's the big deal ? to a surgeon , i think you see the best , and if the best is your friend , then so be it , a body 's a body it 's not unusual for clergymen to be treated by their parishioners , for medical staff to be treated at their own hospital and by members of their own department , and for surgeons to operate on colleagues in small towns , there is often very little choice as to who delivers your baby or shrinks your head traditionally , psychiatry is a bit different , and we maintain some distance in the program where i trained , this view was not felt to make sense if you 're sick , you go to the best , and we are the best psychiatrists would have their family members come in for care , and there were times that people in the department were admitted to the inpatient unit and yes , i mean psychiatrists as well as nurses , staff , residents , and med students for those who insist that the stigma of a label or a treatment necessarily destroys you it ai n't so it all makes me , personally , a little uneasy i like my privacy , even for the most mundane of medical things , though i do think that if i had some unusual , or difficult to treat condition and the 'best' was someone close to home , i 'd get over it very quickly
