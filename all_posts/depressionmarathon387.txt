i do n't have too much to say tonight , although there is quite a bit going on , mostly in my head i struggled over the weekend with continued memories and flashbacks from my teen years of course each memory seemed to be laden with heavy emotion , and what to do with the many emotions became an unending challenge tonight i am mentally and physically worn out over the past three days , most of my recurring thoughts and emotions centered around pam , my step sister who was killed years ago my entire miler after work on sunday was filled with memories of her i even felt her presence , running with me step for step , as i circled the golf course on my way home that was pretty cool but it was also sad i ca n't stop wondering what she 'd be doing and what our relationship would be if she were alive today i'm glad for the memories , but i'm tired further challenges to my mental state came from a couple of recent heavy conversations , one with d about our tense moments last weekend , and one with a friend who owed me an apology both conversations went well , although neither was perfect , and more could have been said , but the emotional expenditure left me spent running , usually a savior , did n't help it only further depleted my energy stores i barely finished of my scheduled miles on saturday i finally just gave in and walked home my body just would n't go sunday 's shorter jaunt was barely any better i'm not sure what 's going on , but i'm quite certain my recent mental gymnastics have not been beneficial physically either and that 's where i'm at right now i'm physically and mentally depleted i'm sad i'm sore i'm tired i'm done i do n't have any more to say , because it would be too much it would take more energy than i have left to give i just want my brain settled and my body recovered and i do n't want to talk about it any more good night , friends
