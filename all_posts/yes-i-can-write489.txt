my mother brought home a very interesting magazine today on finding veg news at the health food store , she was sure i would enjoy it ! and i have i 've been a vegetarian for nine years and counting , having decided i would no longer eat meat at age six except for hot dogs and chicken nuggets , and having been completely vegetarian since age eight with magazine in hand , i sat outside in the sunlight reading about animal cruelty , health problems associated with the consumption of meat , and most worrying of all the environmental impact of the meat and dairy industry the animal agriculture industry puts out more green house gas emissions than all of the cars , trucks , trains and airplanes in the entire world that 's a ridiculous price to pay for a burger all was not so heavy reading , however i also enjoyed the section on vegetarian musicians , listing people from many obscure bands , but also quite a few more well known ones death cab for cutie , black sabbath , fall out boy i now have lots of cool sounding bands to look up yay ! along with just reading veg times , i also had an extensive conversation with my mom on the environment and how we can help to protect it , the deplorable animal cruelty that is a regular part of our mass production food system , activism , and how people who are activists or concerned with one of these problems , are usually also concerned with helping society as a whole being strong proponents of social freedom and global responsibility as well as working for animal rights etc i'm going to try very hard to lead a responsible life in every way , and not to add any more nasty stuff to our world if i can possibly avoid it the more i learn , the more i'm convinced that everyone must change their lifestyles considerably if we wish to survive as a species on that note , i decided recently that i want to get involved in some form of activism , to try and help change things for the better after reading for a while , i happened to step into the backyard , just to find that things had gotten beautifully wild since i last explored it ! here are a few pictures i took that show just how much of a jungle it is back there the jungle between my shed and house i have no clue what this plant is , but it sure did grow tall ! a field of mint our gorgeous grape vine the plants are taking over the compost bin ! after photography and supper , i walked down to the dock with some local friends , hung around at one of their houses for a bit , then headed home i think i 'll make tomorrow more interesting listening to today i kissed a girl by katy perry , land of confusion cover by disturbed reading veg times august issue you might also like rise against music , lovely music vegetarianism earth day linkwithin
