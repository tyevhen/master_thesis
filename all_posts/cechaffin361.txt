my last depressive relapse was explained on it lasted about two weeks until i have been euthymic good mooded since , but relapsed yesterday afternoon into a crying spell and melancholy thoughts yes , it does happen that fast but there are again , clear biochemical reasons behind it i 've had a nasty cold and bronchitis i stupidly took an antihistamine wednesday night , the th , because of the cough and runny nose , even though i knew anthistamines can cause a sudden depression in me with my mood stable for three weeks , i idiotically ingested small doses of a pain medicine which can mess with my mood i mentioned this in my last relapse posted , although that one began earlier to be fair , i had run out of my usual pain medication , celebrex , because for once the clinic had no samples , but i could have done something to prepare for that i had been exercising regularly and vigorously before i caught this cold the abrupt stop in exercising would naturally lower my endorphins and make me vulnerable to a mood dip i remember father mulcagey sp ? from mash treating an alcoholic dog what he did was give him a whole bowl full of whiskey the dog drank it all and became violently ill afterwards the pooch turned away from liquor with disgust how this differs from humans ! i know better than to mess with certain pain medications ! i know better than to risk antihistamines ! but i was feeling what manic depressives call bullet proof because i had had three good weeks , nothing could hurt me ! three good weeks and i forget everything i ever learned not that i forgot i failed to respect what i knew this is sheer stupidity , and typical of humans , who will return to the bowl of whiskey over and over again and never really learn a thing , behaviorally speaking in this sense my relapse is certainly deserved i trust that it will be short lived because i have been more well than not over the last two months i feel shame attached in reporting this why do we never learn ? why do so many of us keep indulging in risky behavior when we know better ? paul addresses this in romans and , but i ca n't grasp his solution , nor do i experience it i'm just as human as the next guy if not more so when it comes to temporary pleasure , self control has never been my strong suit i also feel as if i must be well for my younger brother 's birthday party march , which is silly , of course , as it puts conditions on my unpredictable disease i only pray i do n't go underwater too long another negative factor is that kathleen has since gotten my cold and is quite miserable and the heat went out last night so she was cold besides i hate to see her suffer pain from degenerative changes in her hip and a ruptured disk continue to plague her as well i hate seeing her suffer , have therefore not mentioned my temporary relapse , as she suffers too much already look at how precipitous this relapse is ! i wrote about poetry yesterday morning , and by afternoon i was in a melancholic fog , and today i am writing about myself and my illness again you know i'm well when i'm not writing about myself , but perhaps this dip will give me the opportunity to describe how it is to come out of a depression more fully at two kilorats , ce
