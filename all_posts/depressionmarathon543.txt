a few weeks ago , i had a wacky thought and joined an online dating site i do n't know what i was thinking i was quickly overwhelmed and left the site within a few days but just before i left , i met someone we had our first date last week he took me to lunch at one of the finer restaurants in town as usual , i was worried when do i tell him about being in recovery ? how do i introduce the fact that i have depression ? what if he discovers my blog ? these and many other questions were racing through my head as i prepared to meet him for the first time fortunately for me , i met a rather enlightened individual we had a nice time together , and when we parted , it was with the intent of seeing each other again despite my wishes to the contrary , after spending more than three hours together , he knew almost everything there is to know about me he asked many , many questions , and i answered him honestly each time all of my history came out he even knew about this blog , but only that it was about depression and running i was n't prepared for what happened later early that evening i received an e mail from him he had read my blog ! i was stunned ! i 'd never dated anyone who read my blog most of my family do n't know about my blog , and the ones who do have agreed not to read it the information here is very personal , and i do n't feel comfortable having family members read it i did n't quite know what to think about my date reading it , but i knew it made me feel vulnerable i was worried i was certain my tales of hopelessness would send him running in the opposite direction after messaging him my concern , he phoned to tell me everything was okay not only was he not scared off by my blog , he actually felt it helped him to know me better he complimented me for surviving this journey i 've been traveling again , i was stunned who was this man ? since that conversation , we 've seen each other again it went really well we 've been in daily contact every time i receive a message from him i smile i like that but i'm not jumping in with both feet yet online dating can be so temporary i'm living in the moment right now i'm having fun i look forward to seeing him again , but i'm not planning too far ahead i like him , and if it 's meant to be it will work out as it should it 'll happen one day at a time
