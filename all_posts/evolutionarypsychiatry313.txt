back in july , i wrote a number of posts about zinc there was zinc ! which remains one of my most popular posts perhaps it was the exclamation point ? , zinc , depression , and everything , and the optimistically titled zinc clarity by all means go back and dig in , but the summary here rather like magnesium , zinc is wasted and sequestered during periods of inflammation , but zinc is also necessary for our brains to work properly low serum levels of zinc have been measured in adhd , depression , and anorexia , and zinc repletion has been shown to help the symptoms of those illnesses , at least in small studies though for anorexia with need for weight gain , zinc supplementation should really be standard of care , as the data is good hunter gatherers averaged mg daily above the rda safety zone upper tolerable limit of mg daily , but below the lowest level where there begins to be issues with copper absorption , which is around mg daily , but is likely not a serious problem until mg daily a standard american averages much , much less than all those numbers , somewhat below the rda of mg daily , and as zinc is available mostly in egg yolks and other animal foods , a vegetarian has a serious risk of being deficient , as does anyone on a thiazide diuretic medication cool well , as always , it is not quite that simple as i mentioned in zinc , depression , and everything , zinc deficiency does n't necessarily cause depression though it might play a role in fact , depression inflammation will cause low serum zinc low serum levels of zinc are a biomarker for depression , rather like high c reactive protein is a biomarker for inflammation please , please , please do not take crestor for the sole purpose of lowering your c reactive protein do n't do it ! on wednesday when i was tooling through the journal of affective disorders , i found this new study from the same zinc obsessed polish group who have produced a slew of papers over the last several years , serum zinc level in depressed patients during zinc supplementation of imipramine treatment the researchers took patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder from inpatient units and outpatient clinics , and also recruited healthy age and sex matched controls with no mental illness and , interestingly , no family history of depression or mania the healthy controls had their serum zinc measured once , the depressed subjects four times before , and , , and weeks after starting antidepressant medication treatment all the depressed patients were treated with an antidepressant imipramine , but the patients were divided into receiving placebo imipramine or zinc imipramine during the data analysis after the experiment , resistant and non resistant groups were established by how the patients responded to the treatment it also happened to line up with now long they had been depressed got it ? so in the end , you have four groups of depressed patients treatment resistant receiving imipramine zinc treatment resistant receiving imipramine placebo non resistant receiving imipramine zinc non resistant receiving imipramine placebo some results all of these are statistically significant unless i note otherwise serum zinc levels were lower on average at baseline in the depressed individuals than in the healthy controls the serum zinc levels of the long term resistant depressed patients were lowest of all serum zinc over the twelve weeks increased in all the depressed patients except the treatment resistant imipramine placebo group yes , that means that anyone who felt better by depression rating scales at the end of the weeks had a higher zinc level , whether they were given placebo or zinc supplementation the treatment resistant group who received zinc also had a higher zinc level at the end of the treatment than at the beginning , but it was still much lower than both non resistant groups everyone remained lower than the normal controls , but the treatment responsive groups were fairly close based on review of other zinc studies and the results of this study , the researchers concluded the following it is unlikely that low blood zinc level in depression is due to lack of appetite or from hpa axis hyper stimulation that occur with depression they felt it was specifically due to inflammation as zinc levels are negatively correlated with inflammatory markers , like il and neopterin , and even more specifically due to either a decrease in the protein that carries zinc around in the blood , or the increase in il leading to metallothionein sequestering zinc in the liver therefore , it can be inferred that normalization of the serum zinc level in treatment non resistant patients was the result of the abatement of inflammatory processes during remission of the depressive episode the entire paper reads like that it is thankfully quite short in other words , inflammation causes depression and low zinc levels successfully treat the inflammation and your depression gets better and your zinc levels rise why did i call this post zinc revolution ? well , here we have something heretofore unknown in psychiatry a simple blood test that could , if all this pans out in more studies , monitor treatment resistance and treatment response in the old days they would do tedious dexamethasone suppression tests and even , sometimes , in research , spinal taps to measure serotonin levels and the like certain features of depression would correlate with some of the measures , but there was nothing found that would give you a real physiologic clue for most patients with depression not to mention here we have real proof that depression is n't all in your head it 's in your blood , too , right there in the inflammation , measured by the biomarker zinc we can measure treatment resistance and response already , via diagnostic interviews and symptom scales all these are subjective , but similar to how a neurologist would measure treatment response to migraine medication an objective blood test could be a nice addition to the psychiatric armament , but it is the principle that matters , and i 'll repeat it here depression is not all in your head
