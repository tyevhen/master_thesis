lately i have been obsessed with the thought of sodium in my food i can even taste the saltiness in foods where before i did not particularly taste it i look at the sodium content on food packages and at times i am shocked and astounded by the sheer quantity of sodium in the foods we eat everyday , the food we think are healthy take for example whole wheat nachos you 'd think that by making it whole wheat it would be healthier , and it is , by a smidgen i was comparing the nutrition content on the packages and the whole wheat option had more sodium than the bad regular nachos why is it necessary to add so much sodium to foods ? our bodies definitely do n't need it , in fact it 's bad to have too much ! even if we respect serving sizes , by eating many prepared foods , we exceed out daily quotas by so much it 's unbelievable since i have been on sick leave which is ending in a few short weeks i have had more time to actually cook , so i am sure my body is benefiting from it i use very little salt in my cooking always have , which is good since prepared food , the stuff i usually wind up making when i work for its convenience is so full of sodium hummmm food for thought thanks for reading ! you might also like do you believe in ghosts ? visit to the emergency broken mirror ? ? ? linkwithin
