i found this inspiring piece on the kduk website this morning helen devine found a way to help explain kennedy s disease and the current research associated with this rare disorder when research meets poetry we have seen at first hand now passionate and driven the research team at ucl is what we didn t helen is at the front line in the fight against kennedy 's disease , and to further raise awareness , she entered this poem in a medical research council competition that sought creative writing from researchers that told readers ' why does my research matter ? ' we at kennedy 's disease uk were delighted that helen was one of the shortlisted finalists this year sadly , she didn t win , but we feel she 's a winner with this great explanation of kennedy 's disease and the vital research she and the team are carrying out at university college london ucl the max perutz science writing award aims to encourage and recognize outstanding written communication among mrc phd students the annual competition challenges entrants to write an word article for the general public answering tine question 'why does my research matter ? this is helen 's fantastic entry an ode to the androgen receptor neurodegenerative diseases occur when nerve cells die we certainly know that it happens but we are n't quite sure how or why parkinson 's disease would be easy and alzheimer s or huntington s too they 're probably near the top of your list if i asked you to name me a few but spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ? not heard of it before ? there 's something special about it , let me tell you a little bit more weakness in the arms and legs make it tricky for patients to walk weakness in the face and tongue make it hard to swallow and to talk the faults in the androgen receptor a particular genetic mutation male patients have the disease women pass it to the next generation when the receptor binds testosterone the troubles really start patients get weakness , infertility and problems in the heart the disease is slowly progressive with no treatment and no cure i'm hoping that might change if i can understand it a little bit more so i'm going on a journey to find out why these cells die i am searching for the pathways using microscopes and dyes the very first step is to find a way to make a good human model studies from other cells and mice may not snow the real disease problem induced pluripotent stem cells are an exciting new innovation stem cells from patient skin cells have the androgen receptor mutation motor nerves from stem cells i grow them up in a dish and once they are fully grown i can study them with relish stress , transport , mitochondria possible avenues to pursue in the course of the research i may find something new stress is hard to deal with in research and in a cell i can go for a little jog but a cell ca n't in a well so they have a special mechanism the neat shock response its name if this is n't working correctly then it may be to blame axons carry the messages one end of the cell to the other a traffic jam in this transport can lead to a spot of bother , motor nerves are very long so they are at great risk if blockages and hold ups mean transport is n't brisk mitochondria provide the energy a cell needs to survive if the fuel supply is n't good enough then the cell can start to die so if their shape is faulty and they are n't working right tine cells start to malfunction pack up and say goodnight if cell death is like a puncture discovering it is not enough the next job is to fix it and that can prove quite tough motor neurons on a plate will be a way to screen for a drug to reverse cell death that would de the dream sbma is a rare disease but patients still need a cure i hope i can identify a good one that 's what my research is for the findings that i find may also hold the key to overall common pathways in neurodegenerative disease my research is for patients with sbma for whom taking journeys is hard and for whom it is a challenge to read this poem out loud
