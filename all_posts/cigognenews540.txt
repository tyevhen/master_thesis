so the head of the imf is alleged to have sexually attacked a maid his friend , the philosopher bernard henry levi wrote a piece in france saying , i am a close friend of strauss kahn for years and i know he would not do anything like that he is not that kind of man so you say but does he really think he knows anyone ? does he know what goes on in private in a man s home ? can he tell a man s sexual proclivity through a friendship ? i doubt it why ? because nearly all of us have secrets and a secret life it is the nature of neurosis that we hide part of us that we have fantasies no one would even dream of i treated a famous athlete who needed to wave his penis at women he was at that moment out of control do you think his friends would know about that ? how about another well known athlete who was addicted to porno magazines and addicted to have to dress up in women s clothes do you think his friends knew about that ? we got to the basis of all that his mother left him when he was five to go to work he was left with a cold nanny who never touched him the only way he could feel close to his mother was to hold her clothes and later rub them on while he masturbated a way of getting relief from his terrible tension and unfulfilled need he was close to his mother it was his way of feeling loved something we will need and something we nearly all act out in different ways to feel some warmth it can be stuffing ourselves with food , to feel fulfilled , acting out sexually in order to feel held and touched you name your poison so let us get back to mr kahn he comes out of the shower and he sees a maid he is supposed to have jumped her if i tell you that at that moment he was psychotic would you believe me ? so let us define it he gets sexually aroused now on top of that there is triggered many other imprinted impulses lying deep in the brain nervous system and for that moment it is all bursting through his neocortical control apparatus there is any number of current studies indicating that our memories are imprinted dating back to just after conception those memories are imprinted low in the brain , beginning with the newly developing brain stem and limbic feeling brain they are imprinted into the reptilian alligator brain there is indeed a snake running around in our heads and it contains the memories engraved why back before birth that have a life or death urgency to them under current emotional physiologic stimulation those memories impulses are dredged up with the current situation through a process called resonance they join together and become a dangerous ensemble threatening our control apparatus in everyday life there is not enough stimulation to cause that dredging but when sexually aroused it can be all triggered off it can happen when we are extremely frustrated or furious about something we really don t know anyone until we see her or him under stress or some kind of excitement so mr levy you really don t know you are not going to see it at a dinner party but you will see it in our therapy when we lift the lid of repression and a patient becomes immersed in all of those early memories that is how we really get to know someone otherwise , in the absence of great emotional stimulation the shrink knows very little about his patient he only sees the surface so even the doctor cannot see what the patient is really like we help put the patient under stress not by threatening to hurt her , but by simply finding a way to allow emotions to rise emotions that are a serious threat to the integrity of the organism in one patient every time he got close to his deep lying pain he had an erection there we saw the connection between emotional arousal and sexual behavior so at a certain moment deep lying pain resonates with sexual arousal critical judgment is gone and one is in control by unconscious pain that is , his thought judgment is waylaid by all of his impulses at once in psychosis it is a permanent affair all of one s very early pain takes control of mental processes and the person is delusional and paranoid he is psychotic the difference is that in sexual assault it is momentary , set off by high level sexual arousal which then triggers off other deep lying pain sexual arousal raises the stakes , as it were if she were an older person it may not have been a problem but otherwise he was out of control in control by deep forces his possible lack of early love or trauma while being carried by a just an example highly depressed mother lowers the bar of acting out his gating system cannot hold back the tide others who do not have those early imprints can have a functioning repressive gating system that can keep control so it is the nature and strength of the gates that determines who will act out out of control and who won t and those gates depend on the nature and strength of early trauma for their strength gestational trauma , followed by an early lack of love in the home , plus traumas in school can all bind together to produce leaky gates and a subsequent act out so who gets pushed over the boundary and who doesn t ? we are meant to be controlled by our reptilian brain because it involves basic survival mechanisms to get of the way fast , to hide when in danger , and to attack when necessary , etc some of us had traumatic gestation and some only had major traumas after birth the earlier the trauma the more powerful it is that last point to attack when necessary gets mixed up with current sexual stimulation his snake brain took control and he allegedly attacked when the neocortex can safely put the snake back in his hold there is no more danger
