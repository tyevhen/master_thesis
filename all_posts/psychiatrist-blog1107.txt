somehow , i missed this one thanks to buggy for pointing it out ! what do you do when your shrink 's away and you 've got a crisis ? wait ? call coverage ? a group of new yorkers have set up their own speed shrinking networking service in bookstores and taverns from the ny times , august , , vincent mallozzi writes answers to life 's worries , in minutes bursts instead , ms tang went to talk about her fears with a panel of eight psychiatrists and psychologists offering three minute sessions of what was billed as speed shrinking to those whose regular therapists were on vacation or to anyone else needing a very fast dose of advice at first glance , this appears to be a funny , lighthearted thing , said one of the therapists , jonathan fast , who is also a professor at yeshiva university but what i have discovered is that these brief conversations absolutely turn into real therapy you start with the classic what can i help you with ? and make a really fast assessment so this is not what i do i have no super rapid diagnostic skills and no magical wisdom worth imparting in minutes i thought they invented grandmothers for this stuff and mr mallozzi makes therapy sound a little too trite and a little too self consumed for my liking psychiatrists are good at diagnosing and treating psychiatric illnesses , and some are good at psychotherapy i do n't think this conveys any level of expertise for life decision advise for strangers ah , but this was n't really one we 'd pass by on shrink rap
