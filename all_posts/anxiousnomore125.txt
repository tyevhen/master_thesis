right now i am all alone in my bedroom and all is quiet the baby is sleeping , my husband is away giving someone a ride home , and i have been reading old posts from this blog and reading all of the warm heartfelt comments that readers have left me i am filled right now with a real sense of peace that 's sometimes hard to come by , and with it being so much easier to complain about everything that is wrong in life , i thought it would be nice to note the good things too like peace even if it is only for a brief moment , before reality sets in again , before the baby starts to cry or the basketball game gets turned on and the chaos begins its a nice feeling , like i am right where i am supposed to be and it 's all of you who has brought me that peace , so thank you even though i have never met any of you , we are a tight little family in our own way where we can be open and honest i read one post where i thought , oh no what if so and so read this and knew it was me ? but then i realized there is something very liberating about being so open and honest and i think opening up on this blog has really helped me because then i no longer have to bottle it up inside its no longer a secret and that leaves me feeling at peace wishing you all a little peace for your new year you might also like discipline and peace in the home what to do when feeling overwhelmed they 're here we must see past what it seems linkwithin
