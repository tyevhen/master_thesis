there 's no shortage of online readability checkers that claim to show how readable your text is via this or that metric but few online tools especially free ones attack the readability problem with as much gusto , or in as many ways , as pro writing aid sadly , that 's pretty much where the good news ends my test drive of pro writing aid did n't find it to be much of an aid but i give the creators an 'a' for effort they 're on the right track , at least the way the tool works is , you paste a bunch of text into pwa 's online form and click the analyze button about ten seconds later , you 'll see a summary report , with a column of links down the left side having names like overused words word cloud sentence variation grammar adverbs passive sticky sentences clich s and redundancies repeated words and phrases phrases summary diction vague and abstract words complex words alliteration analysis pacing consistency sentiment time dialog homonyms you can click on any one of these to see potential problems highlighted in your text unfortunately , potentials outnumbered actuals quite a bit in the testing i did i used several pieces of my own writing for testing , as well as sample chapters from the adventures of huckleberry finn you 'd think the latter would 've thrown a lot of flags and warnings , but oddly enough , it war n't that terrible bad different writers will get different mileage from this kind of tool , so go ahead and try it yourself you may very well find it useful for me , it was like using a spellchecker in that i spent the vast majority of the time dismissing things that a computer would flag as wrong but that a human would know were right the adverbs passive tool was puzzling it flagged every adverb including every occurrence of only , but highlighted few or no instances of passive voice in any of the five writing samples i tried each sample averaging , words the word cloud feature makes pretty pictures but is otherwise useless the overused words report flagged instances of it in chapter of huck finn , saying that about instances could be removed in point of fact , i could n't find any instances that warranted removal that 's not to say the overused words report is useless but as i say , it tends like many of the other tools to report far more false positives than it reports good catches a fundamental problem with utilities of this sort is that they do n't make allowances for the huge differences between dialog and narrative , in a piece of text that contains both such as a chapter from a novel the reason this is a big problem , obviously , is that spoken english is quite a bit different from written english it 's different as to vocabulary , diction , syntax , word length , sentence length , sentence variety , pacing , use of clich s , constructions based on slang , and probably two or three dozen other particulars you ca n't treat dialog and non dialog text as one and the same thing they 're distinct what works for one wo n't necessarily work for the other i saw this when i passed a piece of dialog intensive sample text through the pro writing aid analyzer and noticed many more flags in areas of spoken english than in areas of expository english another potential problem with utilities of this type is that they make no distinction between writing aimed at adults and writing aimed at children or young adults or for that matter , writing aimed at a professional audience vs writing aimed at a lay audience it would be nice if there were a way to specify the intended age group for the writing sample in question , so as to get an age appropriate readout of things like diction and sticky sentences long story short pro writing aid was a disappointment , for me but i recognize that it might well be a boon to others so by all means , try it out yourself and let me know what you think
