lilly has been busy pushing duloxetine cymbalta via its depression hurts ad campaign as well as i suspect drug reps educating doctors about its wonders i did a brief literature search via pubmed to see what all the hype was about i found one study that compared paroxetine to duloxetine which found no significant benefit for duloxetine over paroxetine link here i could n't find anything else comparing it to another medication seems like its modest benefits are similar to the rest of its competitors , many of which can be purchased much more inexpensively in generic form then there is the issue of flooding journals with highly similar studies for example , one study examined the effects of duloxetine on males versus females link here another examined the effects of duloxetine on whites versus blacks link here but wait , there 's more an article comparing whites to hispanics link here all of these include overlapping authors do these really warrant separate publications ? could n't these data , which i bet are from the same database , have been published in one article ? none of these articles indicated that gender or race was related to safety or outcomes , so this seems like an obvious attempt to plaster journals with references to duloxetine so that an air of scientific credibility can surround it , resulting in higher prescription rates when marketing and science collide , duck and cover apparently this strategy is working well for lilly , as cymablta sales are soaring in the absence of evidence , just flood journals with unimportant findings in droves and watch the cash flow increase
