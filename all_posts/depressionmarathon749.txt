what a crappy day ! how 's that for an opening line ? no two ways about it , it was wet , sloppy , cold , dark , and windy today unfortunately , i was scheduled to run miles my final miler before tapering for dallas i sat in my recliner and finished my first cup of coffee , all dressed up and ready to go , but not willing to challenge the elements there was a slurry of rain and sleet falling from the sky the wind occasionally whipped the slurry sideways and the temperature ? it was a balmy degrees my heart sank i did n't want to put off my run , but i did n't want to venture out either it was a conundrum finally , after three hours waiting for the weather to break , i pulled on the gortex and headed out the door it was raining fairly hard , and the wind was still blowing i told myself i 'd at least do , and if i had to , i could finish the final at the gym but i hate treadmills things started okay , but by mile five i was already huffing and puffing i walked a bit and kept on going by mile i was soaked to the bone and my hands were getting cold i had purposefully run far from home , and i 'd begun to regret that decision heading into the wind from miles did n't help i stopped several times to regroup , refill my water , or take another gel it just was n't my day , and i'm sure the extra pounds of soaked clothing did n't help this was a tough run i started toward home fourteen miles showed on my watch only six to go , but i was wet , and my hands were freezing i had flashes of pep but long stretches of heavy legs and sluggishness my watch turned over to twenty miles as i stepped into my driveway finished thank god this was a tough , tough run maybe it was the weather maybe it was just a bad day i do n't know it was another exercise in perseverance i'm proud of myself for sticking it out , although it would have been nice if it was just a little easier ! now it 's taper time the dallas marathon is three weeks from tomorrow despite today , i'm happy with where i'm at i will be ready come race day now , it 's time to rest
