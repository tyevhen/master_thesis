i really was n't sure about starting yet another blog , but i did get an awesome new camera , and i do want to do the day photo challenge , and what better time to start it then the new year ? so , every single day i 'll upload a picture to my new blog here it is ! awkward angles in other news , here 's what our new years eve looked like if you click to enlarge this pic , you 'll notice that the time in the corner of the tv screen reads i hope everyone had a cool new years eve ! peace , idzie
