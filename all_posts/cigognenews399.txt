the simple truth is progressive , and that pertains to psychotherapy the question is whose truth ? simple the patient s always you won t find it in the theories of the therapist nor in her techniques as obvious as it seems , the truth always lies in the patient that is why he comes to us , because the painful truth is there but he usually doesn t know it and even when he does he does not know where it is or why but if we never get to his truth there is no progress progressive in therapy we are there to treat him and not our theories we are not after cleverly designed statistical outcomes but biologic ones each treated patient is a kind of test and ultimate support of what we do we learn from patients not them from us we are not the fountains of wisdom but students of the human mind , and we learn at the source we don t delve into books to find answers to our questions we observe our patients all we need to know they hold within so long as they come to us for answers they force us to look into the wrong places and the answer remains elusive it is a mutual delusion they trust us to have the answer , and we take it as a sacred trust that must be pursued we are both wrong , deluded by the history of psychotherapy and by the zeitgeist deluded by the pedestal we have been put on , deluded by the desperate need and pain of the patient , deluded by socially institutionalized consensus that we professionals are the holders of secret truths about the unconscious when i see patients each day i feel like i am going to school , getting my maturity degree in humility , eager to learn what lies in her unconscious she is the holder of sacred truths we have only found the way to access them if our delusions had not fooled us into a false role we all would have found ways for access how about talking to the patient ? not pontificating which is so seductive how about following the trail of feeling , probing because we are interested in her , not in our theory we can t teach interest neophytes often make mistakes because they are not truly interested , nor empathic they want to get ahead ambition is the enemy of feeling remember again , the simple truth is progressive , and it is the secret for progress in psychotherapy it is a simple thing the minute we try to get complex and brilliant we fail the patient is not interested in our discourse she wants to get well and so does he and she holds the secret of her cure and that is what patients have to understand when they claim , i am not getting anywhere , and if we answer defensively yes you are all is lost because that is also a feeling not getting anywhere at birth could have been fatal patients need to know that we both go at the speed she can tolerate and no faster we cannot hurry feelings besides she dictates the pace , not us what a relief not to have to have the answers what a relief not to be brilliant all of the time i always ask my patients not beginners if i made a mistake because they now know themselves better than i they sense the mistakes and we must leave the way open to be corrected that is how we learn no more the professorial pose , the measured speech and the implied brilliance in our insights no more acting out being the protective father patients need to learn about their needs , not have them fulfilled in the office by the shrink it is so tiring to be the all knowing , omniscient soul we all can relax and the therapy will go swimmingly
