is change while i was working , this quote became a mantra for my team we knew that we could not expect that what worked yesterday would work today or possibly tomorrow this saying went well with , if you keep on doing what you have always done , you ll keep on getting what you ve always got in other words , we had to continually look for ways to improve if we expected to survive and , we had better be willing to accept change learning to live with kennedy s disease requires your acceptance of constant change progression , a misnomer in my book , means that what you could accomplish in the past might not be able to be done today it is one of the hardest pills to swallow in my opinion yes , it happens gradually , thank god , but it still happens and , you had better be mentally and emotionally prepared for it when it occurs when i was in my thirties and early forties , this change was far less noticeable it was something you could tell little white lies about e g , bad knees instead of facing the truth that something ugly was happening the progression word at some point , however , i could no longer fool myself it wasn t much later i realized i could no longer fool my friends and associates i had to accept that something was happening that was irreversible i have mentioned many times that one of the blessings of kennedy s disease is the progression it is slow approximately a year when your onset was just a few years ago , the doesn t sound like much at all however , when you have been dealing with the disease for thirty plus years , the is accumulative and quite evident in most everything you do again , as difficult it is for me to say , the slow progression is really a blessing can any of us imagine living with this progression if it was or a year ? wow nelly ! now that would be difficult to deal with so , change is major part of our acceptance process we must live with it and somehow find a way to deal with it because the one thing we know for certain is there will be more change and , with this change will come greater wisdom and a better understanding of our purpose in this world
