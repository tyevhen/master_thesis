i wrote my last post mainly about my diminutive okinawan american friend , ralph , because otherwise he said he would n't read my blog readership immediately plummeted and he has yet to acknowledge the great honor i have done him however , all is not lost i want to prove to ralph that a poem about bowel care is more interesting than he below , a first draft on helping regularity knowing that he is less than shit will likely not discourage ralph in the least from his monumental narcissism , but if readers cooperate it might give him pause just enough pause to consider pausing for that special moment kiloneutral , ce loosening up or how to prevent hemorrhoids lugubriousness , despite its sound , can lead to constipation douse it with hoison sauce and louisiana assonance , sublime your glossary with fresh oysters and okra , habaneros , jalapenos and dragon claws add roughage of indigestible poems replete with fillers culled from second rate sonnets , needless modifiers and articles , superfluous conjunctions swallow hackneyed emotion as you would an oil puddle with rainbow slime do n't swallow the sun , it burns absorption , irritation , bulk these are the trinity of flow grind up a broom handle and make a sawdust patty , fry in bacon grease , coat with tabasco , follow with heaps of water hail irritants and bulk as friends senna to flex your colon , psyllium to mulch your stomach , grasshoppers dipped in chocolate for the chitin , try not to vomit use bisacodyl in a pinch the more you eat what ca n't be used absorbent without being absorbed the happier you 'll be done right , you 'll hardly need to push your anus thanks you heartily !
