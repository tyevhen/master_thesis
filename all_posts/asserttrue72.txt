events of recent days have been chilling we 've witnessed a shocking exercise in the power of non democratically elected officials who meet behind closed doors without even any formal minutes taken to bring a debtor nation to the brink of humanitarian disaster while dictating the terms of an economy 's dismantling it 's like buying a new car , falling impossibly behind on payments , then having an army of thugs show up to ransack your house at four in the morning and meanwhile they steal your clothes on the way out this is how business is done now ? somehow , the new germany feels an awful lot like the old germany ft 's wolfgang munchau notes that greece 's creditors have destroyed the eurozone as we know it and demolished the idea of a monetary union as a step towards a democratic political union munchau goes so far as to say in doing so , they reverted to the nationalist european power struggles of the th and early th century they demoted the eurozone into a toxic fixed exchange rate system , with a shared single currency , run in the interests of germany , held together by the threat of absolute destitution for those who challenge the prevailing order but it was not just the brutality that stood out , nor even the total capitulation of greece the material shift is that germany has formally proposed an exit mechanism on saturday , wolfgang sch uble , finance minister , insisted on a time limited exit a timeout as he called it a member state pushed for the expulsion of another hans werner sinn , architect of temporary exit the still entirely theoretical notion of temporary exit was first broached in germany by euroskeptic hans werner sinn , who talked about it and warned of the consequences of bailout economics in a powerful , prescient interview with der spiegel the idea actually makes a certain amount of sense the only way to achieve a currency devaluation and accompanying renormalization of a struggling import economy is for a country to leave the euro and go back to a non pegged currency but then , in the event of success , why would such a nation choose to re join the eurozone later ? and in case of failure , would it be allowed back in ? we may yet see regime change in greece , but meanwhile the real regime change is in northern europe , where let there be no mistake germany now rules all matters money related , with an iron fist and it does so via a non democratically elected body that , for all the talk of rules , operates beyond the law and favors certain members over others in greece 's case , the sch uble sinn doctrine of temporary exit is a disingenuous ruse as uc berkeley 's barry eichengreen points out given greece s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis , the government will have no choice , absent an agreement , but to print money to fund basic social services it is inconceivable that a country in such deep distress could meet the conditions for euro re adoption inflation within of the eurozone average and a stable exchange rate for two years between now and the end of the decade if grexit occurs , it will not be a holiday it will be a retirement the germans know full well there is no such thing as temporary grexit they also know there is no way greece can survive the punitive provisions of the agreement they 've now agreed to enact even supposing the greek parliament would sign off on such a ludicrous package the ultimatum alexis tsipras has taken home with him requires primary budget surpluses net of interest payments rising to of gdp by , which can only worsen greece s depression the spending cuts that would enable this come straight out of gdp as greece 's depression deepens , deficit targets will be missed , triggering additional spending cuts and accelerating the economy s implosion as eichengreen says eventually , the agreement will trigger grexit , either because the creditors withdraw their support after fiscal targets are missed , or because the greek people rebel triggering that exit is transparently germany s intent therefore , one can only hope that tsipras is already hard at work on a plan c , which would involve somehow wresting control of greece 's banks from the troika before massive bail ins occur , printing a new currency , repudiating ecb debt , and charting a new course for greece it may , of course , be too late for any of this the tsipras government could be toast before the week is up meanwhile , the lesson for periphery nations including great britain and france , in the larger sense is clear do n't expect help from your peers if you enter the eurozone if you get in trouble , your peers will break your goddam legs take your furniture , your clothing , your food , and your dignity , and kick you to the curb , calling you names the whole while update july hours utc gmt the greek parliament is hours away from rejecting voting on the suicide package tsipras brought home with him it 's unlikely to pass , of course more likely is that a new coalition government will have to form , or elections will need to be held but is there time or money for that ? atms will run out of cash soon the cash economy barely working , now will falter will basic necessities run out ? will a miracle happen ? i pray greeks will continue to amaze us with their incredible ability to endure the unendurable i fear what could happen otherwise i fear dare i say it ?
