i'm frustrated i'm going to new york city in a few weeks , alone my minnesota lynx are playing in game , the final game , of the wnba championship in a couple of days , and i want to go but if i go , i 'll go alone there 's a fabulous concert coming up i 'd like to attend i'm not going i decided not to go because i do n't want to go alone i have nothing against being alone i spend most of my time alone , and that 's actually how i prefer it i choose to run alone of the time i frequently travel alone i go out to eat alone i 've even gone to movies alone but sometimes it is nice to share experiences with others the problem is i'm not all that social i really only have a few , okay , close friends and while i love and value my friends , having so few friends is not conducive to finding a companion for outings at least that 's what i 've discovered recently it does n't help that i'm single and all of my friends are married with children they 've already got busy schedules and in house companions even if they 'd like to socialize , it 's often difficult for them to find time so despite asking various friends to accompany me on outings lately , it has n't worked out i'm frustrated it would be fun to share new york with a friend , to attend the wnba championship , to go to the concert with someone , but i 've not been able to find anyone free to join me i'm not frustrated with my friends i'm more frustrated with myself for having such a small circle my frustration has led me to question my current path the self analysis has not been kind i must need more friends , i think , but that seems like a really tall order why is it a tall order ? why do n't i have more friends ? is there something wrong with me ? do i have trust issues ? on and on i go it 's not pretty i do n't know the answers to the questions , and i'm trying not to spend a lot of time contemplating them while i wish i had companions to accompany me at my whim , that 's obviously not reality i love and value my friends i love and value them regardless of if they can attend a basketball game or not and while i'm frustrated with my lack of playmates , i'm apparently not frustrated enough to change it i e develop more close relationships yet so i guess i should stop complaining now
