sometimes i feel myself being held back in writing , by feeling that everything i write should be profoundly or wonderfully something wonderfully interesting informative thought provoking but then i realize that is n't the point or at least , i do n't want it to be the point to me , writing is such an important part of my life , and whether or not what i write is always good or not should n't matter as much as the fact i am writing , and by doing so i'm working out thoughts , finding new ways of looking at things , breaking the huge block a blank screen or piece of paper often represents , improving my writing abilities a while back , in a conversation with my mother , she referred to writing as a passion of mine instantly , that just did n't feel right to me it 's not a passion , i told her , it 's part of who i am those words stuck with me , because as soon as i said them , i realized how true a statement it was even if i lived to be without ever coming across another computer keyboard or blank sheet of paper , i 'd still be writing in my head i'm constantly thinking of posts and articles , going over different points , literally writing out bits in my head , figuring out what sounds best i regularly turn conversations into dialogue in my head , as well , moving words around and slightly rephrasing things until it all sounds just right , like a passage in a novel i do n't think i ever go more than an hour without thinking about writing it 's just such an integral part of my life , though one i do n't often stop to consider properly and when i start to let myself get caught up in perfectionism , i forget that as part of who i am , part of my life and my being in this world , my writing has no more of an obligation to be perfect than any other part of my life i want my writing to be just as imperfect and in the moment as a conversation with a friend or my musings as i daydream in the sunshine as imperfect as an argument with my mother , or the incredible anger and grief over a terrible injustice i want my writing to reflect me , and to reflect my life , in all it 's imperfect complexity someone once made a comment online about life being an art , and i love that i also want to reverse it , and say that art , all arts , painting and drawing and writing and playing and singing and molding and building , should be lived as life life is art and art is life i think this post is a perfect example right here i went from blankness of mind and blankness of screen to waxing poetic about writing ! i really love writing peace , idzie you might also like life happening insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging and writing from the heart how i learned to read and write how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! linkwithin
