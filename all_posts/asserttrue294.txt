in , a plos one paper by ahmed et al proposed a phylogeny for mycobacteria in which m leprae the leprosy organism is shown as a relatively recent branch off a very long tree , with m tuberculosis depicted in a decidedly fanciful schematic as being of relatively recent provenance , years , diverging from m canettii a recently discovered cousin of tuberculosis million years ago the rather fanciful phylogenetic picture of mycobacterium evolution presented by ahmed et al click to enlarge the only trouble with this picture is that we know it 's wrong more exacting work has shown that m tuberculosis is at least million years old , and one paper estimates that the common ancestor of tb and leprosy may go back million years if the latter figure sounds dubious , consider that until recently , m leprae was n't thought to have any sister strains that could aid with dating the organism phylogenetically but in , the situation changed dramatically when it was realized that in mexico , a distinct form of leprosy known as diffuse lepromatous leprosy dll was actually due to a genetically distinct variant of mycobacterium known as m lepromatosis when the genome for the latter organism was analyzed , it was found to contain the same stupendous assortment of pseudogenes contained in m leprae , but detailed analysis of polymorphisms in the genomes of the two strains led to a surprising finding divergence of the strains appears to have occurred around million years ago another team found that the massive pseudogenization event that caused m leprae and its cousin , m lepromatosis to become saddled with a record number , of pseudogenes probably occurred on the order of million years ago the age and stability of the pseudogenes in m leprae can only be described as stunning conventional evolutionary dogma says that pseudogenes will inevitably be degraded and lost over time surely m leprae ca n't be conserving and repairing pseudogenes over million year long timespans ? pseudogenes are discardable junk or are they ? an analysis of buchnera aphidicola the tiny enterobacterial endosymbiont of the pea aphid put the half life of pseudogenes in that organism at million years human dna reportedly contains over , pseudogenes some of these pseudogenes are quite old parallel nonsense mutations caused a pseudogenization of the uricase gene in apes during the early miocene era million years ago we still carry the pseudogene in question and it gets transcribed according to a report by james t kratzer and colleagues at the university of texas , austin despite being nonfunctional , cdna sequencing confirmed that uricase mrna is present in human liver cells and that these transcripts have two premature stop codons the inevitable conclusion is that pseudogenes are not , and should not be considered by default , junk dna to the contrary , the default assumption should be that pseudogenes are ancient and conserved because in most cases , that 's exactly what they are what causes genes to go pseudo ? why are they conserved ? what are they really doing ? i 'll tackle some of those questions in a followup post stay tuned
