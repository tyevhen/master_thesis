i asked the people of twitter whether they would be happy to see a series on education here on my blog and many were happy with the idea this series will include advice , tips , my thoughts , mental health and anything else that can be to do with education and motivation if you have a specific topic you want me to write about , do n't be afraid to let me know you can buy determination ? many times a day , i hear and read about people lacking motivation and or determination where can i buy some motivation and determination ? you ask well i have come up with a solution over these last few months , i have felt drained and i suppose i have lost a bit of my determination but , looking back to last year i questioned what it was that encouraged me to keep going whether that be through my a levels , discrimination and general self improvement i ended up writing a little speech and it has relighted my fire to go full steam ahead one think of all of the people that have said you could n't do something for me this is the biggest determination recall all of those comments people made about you , saying that you ca n't do it , you 'll never make it all of those times they made you feel awful recall these and use them to your advantage show these people wrong and show them you can do it beat them and have the last laugh never , ever let someone make you feel small , and if they make derogatory comments , know that they will regret it because you will succeed two think about what will happen if you achieve what you want to if you want prolonged periods of sadness and hurt because you knew you could 've tried harder , then do n't work for what you want you 'll end up in a worst state or imagine where you could get to you 've worked incredibly hard with blood sweat and tears yes , you 've missed out on a few gatherings with friends , not eaten what you wanted , but you 've achieved your goals and this has made you elated and so happy , and ultimately got you where you 've wanted to be this happiness lasts for a very long time in comparison to the blood sweat and tears you 've shed i know where i 'd rather be i am not going to let myself get behind and have it affect possibly years of my life , making me sad , wishing i 'd done something at the time do n't make your life harder than it needs to be three think of all of those times you 've been disappointed with yourself all of those times others may have been better it 's never useful to compare , unless for this reason ! think of the times people have gloated about how far they 've gotten , and how secretly unsympathetic they were to you well , take this anger from the disappointment and other people and show yourself and the others that you can do it you will improve and you will beat the others and again , have the last laugh work it and win it you can do it , so do it now you have the power to change it , so why not start now ? if you want it enough , you will get there work hard , play hard best wishes , amy xx
