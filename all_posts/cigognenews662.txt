we do know that each level of brain function can incorporate the previous lower level and represent its sense or meaning to higher levels which then code it in terms of the specific function structure of that level as the imprint is registered , it will take on a new coloring as it moves upward hypoxia as a choking , suffocating sensation on the brainstem level becomes being suffocated by one s husband on the emotional level and then there is the last level rationalization for the lack of freedom in a given situation the patient starts with the latter she suffocates me , and then over time moves downward until she arrives at the primal event that started it all so early memories become elaborated on higher levels of brain function and are incorporated into those levels and interpreted differently depending on the level of brain tissue but they are not separate entities it is all an ensemble of levels that produces a complete memory when we relive a non verbal pain or trauma in infancy we are at the same time reliving the residue from earlier in womb life the events are united under a resonance factor that makes a higher level of brain function trigger off a deeper and more remote feeling to put it differently , each early preverbal imprint is ramified on higher levels so that feeling fully on the higher level automatically has us feeling the earlier aspects of the feeling because of this we can over react or under react to events in adult life as we see in our therapy , it may be one cause of erectile dysfunction the feeling of being overwhelmed because of even slight pressure to function in the present or the inability to get going at work to summarize there seems to be a time in gestation when pain or noxious stimuli impinge , but we are not yet able to produce our own gating chemicals , such as serotonin and endorphin , resulting in un gated pain when i refer to gating , i refer to electrochemical process that blocks the transmission of the pain message across the synapse this residue will continue and may lead to bouts of anxiety later on in life it becomes free floating , unbound fear or terror it can then be focused on elevators and a phobia is born this is not due to heredity but rather to experience in the womb part of our in uterolife , therefore , takes on hurt at a time when the system can do nothing about it nevertheless , it affects all later development at , we may suffer from panic attacks that began its life in the very early months of our mother s pregnancy it is pristine , ready to spring forth whenever we are vulnerable no talk therapy can affect it because it involves a vegetative , primitive nervous system which was only adequate to register pain and terror during womb life this is a nervous system impervious to words so insights leave it absolutely indifferent that is why new experience does not change the neurotic she goes on having the same experience , the imprint , over and again it is a sealed off feeling that remains as part of a survival function the womb experience leaves us fragile for a lifetime so that any insult or lack of love in infancy and childhood weakens us all the more and the imprint can dictate chronically low levels of serotonin that is why we need drugs that work on lower brain centers below the intellectual in order to suppress these imprints for a time
