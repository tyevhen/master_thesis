a screenplay is no place to be timid , tentative , or reserved i 've read eight spec scripts in the past few days , by unknown writers most of the scripts were garbage , two were salvageable in theory , at least one of the salvageables was a romantic comedy the problem with the comedy was that it was good , but not great i liked it but did n't love it why did n't i love it ? first , the scene descriptions were novelistic instead of telegraphic that 's easy to fix secondly , the dialog in each scene began too early , with throwaway lines the characters greeting each other too much setup again , not hard to fix not so easy to fix is the fact that the humor just was n't over the top the author fell in love with her characters and thought everything they did was inherently adorable and or hilarious i suggested some touch ups here and there , but frankly it 's the author 's job to make it great all i could do is point out some really obvious areas of potential that were glossed over the hero of one script , an adorable nerd think forty year old virgin , has managed to convince a beautiful woman to accompany him to hawaii one scene has him sulking in the bar , alone the bartender , a burly hawaiian , finds the hero sulking , sipping at a drink , listening to a ukulele player he asks our hero something like you look like you could use a friend want to talk about it ? the hero says nah , i'm just going to listen the bartender talk to me , bro i have a b a in psychology mr sad sack says no well , if this is a comedy , i do n't like sad bar scenes my rewrite of this encounter has the bartender saying talk to me , bro i have a ph d in psychology our hero perks up what are you doing working here ? bartender dude this is where the crazy people are not a knee slapper , but enough to keep the interest going it has the ring of truth people with doctorates sometimes do end up tending bar , in this great economy of ours and yeah , bars are where the crazies often hang out in the next scene , when the author has the hero wanting to comfort a young lady nearby who 's crying in her beer , the bartender in the original version of the script warns our hero off do n't do it , man she a crazy one the line had zero impact before i gave the man a ph d at one point , the hero admits to his traveling companion the beauty girl that he was engaged once he explains that it did n't work out boring scene not at all in keeping with the character 's virginity or apparent virginity , up to that point i suggested changing it to him saying actually , i was engaged once to the little mermaid his partner says a cartoon character ? he says but it was doomed she had this , you know , fishy smell again , not exactly a knee slapper , but the point is , this is a comedy with far too many boring backstory scenes why not try to make the boring parts a little more interesting ? it 's not an option , it 's a requirement turns out the heroine was also engaged and still is to a fabio like muscle dude with a cleft chin i suggested a line or two of our hero warning her that if she marries fabio , she 's going to wake up looking at a butt chin about , times in her life and if you smell inside there ? there 's chin smegma no , it 's true chinegma chin cheese etc this comedy 's premise is that the main character the year old nerd virgin has a brain tumor , and he 's trying to scratch off items on his decidedly eccentric bucket list what the author did n't do is take advantage of the obvious liberty this guy has to do whatever he wants and say whatever he wants to whomever he wants if he 's dying , he 's free to go nuts right ? instead , he does the most tepid , boring stuff it takes courage to write comedy i told the author , the first thing you have to do is go through the whole script and exaggerate everything you possibly can when the tattoo artist tells our guy to bring a stick to bite on , that 's not good enough the tattoo artist should tell him to bring a broom handle to bite on , or a baseball bat , or whatever think big , think outlandish , magnify things , make them colorful bigger than life , as we say we 're at the movies let 's see something fun another comedy script i read suffered from the same problem of too tameness everything was tame when it should have been out of control , outlandish the hero , at one point , robs a bank his stick up line i know this is going to be a drag for some of you , but this is a stickup huh ? in my mind , i had the guy leaping onto a counter or table , firing a gun in the air , and saying in roddy piper fashion listen up assholes ! i'm here to floss my teeth , and kick ass and i'm all , out , of dental floss ! women scream a man tries to make a phone call the hero points his gun at the man 's crotch i would n't try it , superman , unless you want to be a goddam soprano ! when you 're writing for the big screen , you have to be visual not just talk talk talk , which is another common problem with spec scripts and you have to think big outlandish do n't be timid leave timidity behind write like you mean it slay the audience , or die trying if you 're a screenwriter , novelist , actor , director , agent , or industry person and you 'd like to get a sneak peek at my script , greeners , write to me and include your twitter handle if you have one my hushmail dot com address is kasthomas all inquiries kept confidential
