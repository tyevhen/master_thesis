yesterday was my th birthday in some ways , it seems rather surreal that i 've been around this earth for years in other ways , it seems like no big deal nothing much has changed i'm the same person i was two days ago , despite the change in age ! yet since my th birthday , so so much has changed it 's been years since i was actually happy on my birthday throughout most of my teen years , my birthday stood as a reminder of all the things i had n't done one more year where my life was n't where i wanted it to be but as i'm sure i mentioned before , this past year , especially the past months , has held so much change , and lead to such a different perspective on life , on who i am , and on what i want i'm no longer pining over what has yet to happen sure , there are still plenty of things i want to do , but i will do them and for now , i'm happy at where i am in life , and content that i 'll figure out where i'm going so this birthday , i went outside , breathed in the beautiful spring air , played music , and laughed life is good i 've never been much of a st patrick 's day celebrator , although i certainly have irish ancestry , and love celtic culture and music so although i'm not doing much to actually celebrate today , i wish you a happy , joy filled st patrick 's day , and leave you with this song , 'the night that patty murphy died' by great big sea peace , love , and happiness , idzie you might also like birthday time ! my th birthday a th birthday and a week away a year in posts linkwithin
