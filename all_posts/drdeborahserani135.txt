scientists at state university of new york at downstate center have discovered a molecular mechanism that maintains memories in the brain by inhibiting the molecule , researchers say they can erase long term memories , much as you might erase a computer disc the molecule called protein kinase m zeta preserves long term memories through persistent strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons this is enzyme is similar to the mechanism storing information of s and s in a computer s hard disc by inhibiting the enzyme , scientists were able to erase a memory that had been stored for one day , or even one month the article abstract can be found in science magazine this research may be a breakthrough treatment for acute trauma , post traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain , just to name a few and this discovery may unlock the mystery to alzheimer 's disease and other memory loss disorders i love research , but i ca n't help but think of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , the movies paycheck and total recall , where memories were erased i hope this newfound research will be used for good purposes resources science daily
