in case you have n't already seen it , be sure to check out our clicky iphone grand rounds ! it was years ago i was a resident on an inpatient unit and the patient was floridly manic i do n't remember the details , what i do remember was that she was running on empty , high as a kite , going revolutions per minute , you name the cliche there was a reason why she was on an inpatient unit and not being seen by an out patient doc she was n't getting better and , as is often the case with people suffering from mania , she had no insight that she was ill , she was feeling good really good and oh so energetic , and even louder than that , and so what 's the problem here ? let me outta this joint ! we 're talking , i'm trying to reason with her , and finally , she screams at me in a way that stays clear long after her name and the details of her life have oozed from my memory , you 're problem is you 're not italian ! you do n't understand true emotion ! ! she had a point i'm not italian , by the way and who defines what emotional response is true , what is valid , what is right to have ? so once patients get the label of bipolar disorder , they come under an added scrutiny that makes them , and those who know they suffer from this disorder , subject to both added analysis of their reactions it often leaves them feeling invalidated , or questioning themselves in a way that adds an entirely new dimension , if not burden , to life i can have a feeling it 's just my feeling i may question if it 's valid for me to have that feeling come on , we all check out our feelings how often do you ask was it him or me ? or comment that everyone thinks he 's a jerk , just to be sure you 're not the one being overly sensitive people with bipolar disorder take this a bit farther if they 're angry , irritable , have a great idea , in a good mood , in a bad mood , have trouble sleeping and the list goes on then they 're ill no bad hair days for the labeled labile they , and everyone around them , are constantly questioning their sanity there are other labels , though , and they are n't all about mental illness perhaps you 're a worrier , you want people to be considerate of the fact that you care about them , but they do n't like to check in this particular example is for us moms maybe they check in so you wo n't worry , or maybe they label you neurotic , or over protective , or something that lets them blame you for your concern , that frees them from responsibility or maybe you 're very sensitive a trait that can be a very positive thing , especially if you 're sensitive to the needs of others but once you 're labeled as such , then the someone who says something that upsets you is n't held so accountable no biggie that i made georgie cry , he 's too sensitive , you know emotions are a funny thing sometimes i wish they could just be what they are and taken for face value and even if i'm not italian , let it be known on the record that i 'll eat pasta and gelato with glee and enthusiasm
