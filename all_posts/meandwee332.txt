i hope you had a great weekend ! i had a wonderful mother 's day what fun we had ! we went to the acton arboretum and walked around i got to try out my new lens that chris gave me for my camera chris made me my favorite dinner chicken rolatini and stuffed mushrooms yum ! he also made me a hardcover book from kodakgallery using pictures of paige and me and he wrote a whole little rhyming story about why i am a great mom it was so sweet i cried and cried he made sure the pictures illustrated the line of the story on that page kind of like a children 's book it will be my treasured possession , that 's for sure it was a wonderful time to reflect on the past year of mothering little p and how much work it is and how much reward where it does n't even seem like work i feel lucky every day speaking of lucky maren and paige are forging quite the bond lately frolicking and kissing and such it warms my heart when i see these two getting along so well paige is even learning to finally pet maren in a gentle and loving way even if it only lasts a few seconds be back soon ! ! ! ! save
