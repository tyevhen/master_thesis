you are the music while the music lasts t s eliot this is a painting of my good friend conrad he is a singularly fascinating person who i am very fortunate to know the course of our conversations is totally unpredictable and therefore , a pleasure to engage in he is a man of many talents , and this includes music one morning he was singing a new song to me when i saw the way he was sitting on his chair and wanted to paint him , just as he was a few weeks later we recreated the pose and he sang another song , just before i shot the reference photos i envisioned a painting that was heavy to the one side with space and breathing room on the other side i was pleased when conrad chose darker clothes as i knew it would create a nice contrast in values on the canvas as with many of my pieces i wanted simple shapes with room for the eye to move around in and rest , contrasted with areas of detail as well it was truly wonderful to be in a creative environment where music and art coexisted like that human beings are very strongly visual by nature yet there is something so evocative , so poignant about music it resonates with me in a similar yet strikingly different way than art i wanted to try to capture that energy within conrad , on the canvas the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity alberto giacometti
