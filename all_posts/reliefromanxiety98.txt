it 's time to finish what i left in regards to driving journey ! for those of you that have n't been following my driving journey i started driving when i turned and by the summer i had booked my driving test i'm now during that time , i had severe panic attacks and anxiety over it every lesson was a massive struggle in the end , i cancelled my driving test and i never saw my driving instructor again because before one lesson , i had one of the worst panic attacks i have ever experienced and completely lost control i decided to leave driving behind me i picked up driving again this summer , at the age of i finally felt ready to tackle one of my biggest anxiety triggers i had driving lessons all summer and booked my test , which i took and unfortunately failed after months away at university with no driving and now at the age of , i rebooked my driving test over last christmas and i passed ! it must have been one of my proudest moments considering my driving has been a battle of over years getting my license through the post was super exciting ! i was more nervous the second time around even though i knew what to expect i thought i had failed the test at a few points , but they turned out to only be minors i managed to control my anxiety through breathing and having the understanding that it was n't the be all and end all if i did n't pass i would just have to try again nevertheless , i did pass and my year battle is over i did n't think i was capable , but it shows that you are stronger than you think amy xx
