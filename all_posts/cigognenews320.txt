there is a term that we will need to consider in the therapy of depression resonance it would seem that when trauma lack of love is set down early on , there is a specific frequency to the neuronal circuit it may be that feelings that are laid down on top of that imprint will resonate with the same frequency thus , something that happens in the present can set off an early memory by its corresponding frequency it all forms an interlocking neural network a minor or major current situation , losing a boyfriend , can trigger off the original gloom and doom when the defense system is weak doom and gloom is the byword in depression i will explain it , not from statistical studies , but in the flesh and blood accounts by my patients thus , a relatively innocuous event can plunge us into gloom and doom because the feelings are related within a single network if we do not understand and acknowledge the originating imprint we can neither understand nor rid ourselves of depression all we have left is to advise , cajole and manipulate the patient , dealing in the here and now we know that there is a close correlation between high blood pressure and depression , as there is between migraine headaches and depression our body is screaming through its high blood pressure but all we can do is sit helplessly by infusing drug after drug into the patient to control her symptoms we have extracted the symptom out of the person for treatment , instead of seeing how the symptom emanates out of a biologic history when we don t understand that history we are confined to an ahistoric therapy we then make the symptom well rather than the person
