the following letter to my blog was ostensibly about depression but i found something in it that to me is astounding it also sounds kooky but it is not she grew an inch at age twenty three and she made no big deal about i grew and then she went on to other matters growth happens pretty often and the patients always seem to have that belle indifference about it like it is expected and not surprising i guess with all the other emotional improvement it may not be a big deal , but it is to me because it means that when you undo repression you undo not only a mental phenomenon but a total physiologic one , as well and it means too that the patient has already gone very deep and normalized some hormones , including those that control growth how else to explain it my wife 's foot size grew by a size and she could not understand it for years until we began to get many other reports about growth and i have noted that there is sometimes a wisdom tooth growth after the age of forty i have never much pontificated about this so as not to influence patients and others but it seems to me to be a monumental affair , not because of the growth but because it means that so much has been liberated in the entire system so , yes , i would expect the depression to be lessened or eliminated it is all of a piece the system is one integrated affair so that change in one area means change in many others , as well yes , it is great that depression was cured but the proof of that is found in bone growth and and change in brain waves , vital signs , etc looking back to the way i was at the beginning of therapy , i can see how many things have changed for a start , i have grown over an inch since my twenty third birthday i am much more relaxed in general , able to go out and live life without too much anxiety i am not nearly as afraid of people as i used to be , and i do not let anyone push me around or take advantage of me i am more spontaneous , following my impulses whenever it feels safe and appropriate to do so i have periods of optimism and enthusiasm for life when it seems that i have been given a second childhood during these times i feel good to be alive whether playing sports , listening to or playing music , watching a movie , talking with friends , or simply sitting quietly and doing nothing i have more friends , and i can be myself around them , rather than trying to impress them or get them to like me i have less anxiety during stressful situations , and i make better decisions to resolve problems my memory has improved i am not scrambling around to take care of myself anymore i am less stuck in my head and more aware of what is going on around me people used to think i was stupid because they would say something two or three times before i heard them i have better coordination playing the piano despite almost no practice and i have discovered that i have a fair talent for ball sports i can cook for myself now , which is a recent and exciting development i have had a huge block in that area food tastes different as well before therapy i had to smother my food with herbs and spices to give it any flavor , whereas now a small amount seems to go a long way i get depressed from time to time , but even when i feel really bad i know that it is just a feeling and i do not consider suicide i notice my act outs and curb them for instance , when my job is going badly i find myself obsessing about winning the lottery when i feel bad about myself i tend to bounce from therapist to therapist , afraid to stick with the same person in case he or she grows impatient with me going against my fears is the way to feelings most importantly , i have a sense deep down that i am going to be all right , which i could never have said a few years ago in conclusion , i would say that depression is a state of emotional flatness resulting from a strong system of defenses there is a voice beneath conscious awareness complaining that all is hopeless and that there is no point in living , but it is never heard because the defenses are working overtime how does one cure depression ? the platitudes my parents fed me certainly did no good , and i suspect that most self help systems only push the voice of doom somewhere more obscure but ultimately just as damaging the only real changes in my life have occurred after feeling , connecting to the source of my pain the voice is being heard in part one is not feeling sad for no apparent reason but for a reason that is known and felt this second childhood is a great gift to anyone reading this who is a long way from being able to do therapy , let me say that there really is hope above all , find friends that accept you for who you are , and look after yourself you deserve the best
