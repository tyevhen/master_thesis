i have come home sick again today sometimes i just think it would be nice for someone to ask how i am ? or whats wrong ? or how is the new medication going ? but no this is an illness people struggle to talk about and despite my openess and informing people i am changing medication , no one asks me how it is going , how i am feeling or why i have gone home sick two days in a row it 's not a lot but it would mean a lot to me while i am feeling fed up and sick of all the meds i feel like an overweight fast approaching middle aged women who lives on the outskirts of society i can cope with much of the weirdness , jerky movements , discomfort , inability to sit still but i so desire to feel a partof the gang and one of the crowd but i 'll never be that and i have always known that being myself is fine and i have confidence to be myself but i still wantto be one of the crowd too i have an appointment with my gp on monday and the psychiatrist on wednesday i'm thinking of staying at home for a few days
