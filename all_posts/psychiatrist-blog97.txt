i received an email from the apa the other day noting the following apa learned today that medicare providers who file health insurance claim forms are having a large number of their claims returned due to a change in the reporting requirements that went into effect on october , medicare contractors are returning claims for correction or resubmission to mental health professionals who fail to indicate in line item of the claim form whether icd or icd codes are used for services that were provided prior to october , , icd codes should be used even if the claim is filed after that date for services on or after october , , icd codes should be used icd codes are indicated by using a in item icd codes are noted with a really ? the codes look totally different , medicare ca n't figure out if the codes are dsm iv tr codes or icd codes ? especially since it might be safe to assume that codes filed after october st are icd o codes if they look like icd codes ? i generate the forms with a computer program , and i went to add the to the template so it would automatically populate every form , but the program does n't even have a box as you may know , from the roughly medicare posts i 've written , i often feel jerked around by medicare in the past couple of weeks i got a form back saying that it was being rejected because i had my name , address , and npi number in both box and it does ask for it twice and i 've supplied it this way for years i took it out of some of the forms , but not everyone 's then i got a form back because my address was not in box i guess they could n't get the information from box , millimeters away i added my address to box and resubmitted the form i then got the same form rejected because my npi number was n't in box , but the first rejection said nothing about my npi number missing again , it 's in box anyway so , i'm waiting for all my october claims to bounce back , which seems like a tremendous amount of needless work for medicare and a mild headache for me , and an unfortunate delay for my patients who count on timely reimbursement from medicare yes , yes , i know , this is why you 've opted out i just ca n't get there without feeling guilty
