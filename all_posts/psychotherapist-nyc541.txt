when you 're healthy and your life is going well , all other things being equal , it 's easy to feel good about yourself but when you develop serious medical problems , it can change how you feel about yourself and about life in general when people develop serious medical problems , they often have a sudden sense of their physical and emotional vulnerabilities in ways they might not have experienced before how serious medical problems can change how you feel about yourself reactions to being diagnosed with a serious medical problem shock , fear , anger , sadness if the medical problem is unexpected and potentially life threatening , people often experience shock at hearing the diagnosis initially , a sense of disbelief can create a sense of emotional paralysis and confusion when the shock wears off , people often feel a combination of fear , anger and sadness about the unfairness of being diagnosed with the illness each person 's experience is different these feelings do n't occur in a linear way or , necessarily , in this order they can happen all at once or in any order however it happens , it usually takes people outside of their everyday experience and it can change their perception of themselves being treated as a sick patient a day before you received a diagnosis of a major medical illness , like cancer or heart problems , you probably thought of yourself as a husband , wife , mother , father , brother , sister , friend , an employee and all the other identifications that we all take on in life suddenly , after you 've been diagnosed with a major medical problem , your doctors identify you as a sick patient , a cancer patient , a heart patient or whatever diagnosis is applicable this is n't a criticism of the medical profession it 's just the way it is in many medical settings , especially hospitals when this happens , you can feel like you 've been reduced to one identification your diagnosis you 're more than your medical diagnosis but each of us , no matter what our health issues might be , is more than any particular diagnosis we 're whole people with relationships , histories and , hopefully , dreams for the future after a while , if you take on the identification of your diagnosis , it can change how you feel about yourself , reducing you to a list of symptoms words are powerful for the sake of maintaining a healthy emotional attitude , it is far better to be thought of as a person with cancer rather than a cancer patient or whatever diagnosis applies you might think that this is just a matter of semantics , but it 's not words are powerful when you 're identified as a cancer patient , the implication is that this is your primary or , worse , your only identification but when you 're identified as a person with cancer , the implication is that there is a lot more to you than just your medical diagnosis you 're a whole person with a life that includes your medical diagnosis but also goes beyond your illness rather than losing your sense of self to your illness , you maintain all the different aspects of yourself research has shown that a positive attitude can have a significant effect on recovery so , maintaining a healthy sense of self can make the difference between having a good or a poor medical outcome so , how you think of yourself , including your sense of identity , is important finding new meaning in life while dealing with a serious medical problem i know there are exceptional individuals who are given serious medical diagnoses who find tremendous new meaning in life they appreciate every day , their relationships take on new meaning , and they might even find a renewed sense of spiritual connection finding new meaning in life while dealing with a serious medical problem while this is certainly impressive and something to aspire to when you 've been diagnosed with a serious medical problem , a lot of people , through no fault of their own , find if very difficult to get to this place emotionally , and pointing to these exceptional people can make these other individuals feel blamed for not being able to reach such an enlightened state your internal and external resources if you 're fortunate enough to be an individual who is resilient and who has a good emotional support system among family and friends , your chances for maintaining a healthy sense of self , despite the illness , are better resilience and a good emotional support system help to maintain a healthy sense of self as a resilient person , who has emotional support , you might have an awareness that , during the course of your life , you 've overcome other challenges and you could see your medical problems as one more challenge to be overcome but not everyone is fortunate enough to be resilient and have a support system in addition , sometimes , prior emotional trauma can get triggered when you 're diagnosed with a serious medical problem at that point , you 're not only dealing with the current medical problem , but you 're also dealing with the emotions that get triggered from prior trauma under these circumstances , it 's not unusual to feel powerless feeling powerless , due to the current situation as well as feelings triggered from the past , can cause you to feel anxious or depressed suddenly , your life looks a lot different from before your diagnosis people who
