before saying anything more about genetic studies , i want to talk about a problem that 's quite common in scientific studies it 's colloquially and somewhat inappropriately , since the analogy does n't hold known as the winner 's curse in economics , the idea of winner 's curse comes from the observation that the winner of an auction often overpays maybe you 've noticed this phenomenon yourself , if you 've participated in auctions ? it 's not just that people get into a frenzy of bidding and drive prices too high that 's not really the core idea here the core idea is more like this suppose a laptop goes on auction and there are ten people in the room all will bid on it every one of the ten persons has an estimate a top bid in mind for the true value of the laptop the average of those ten estimates might be let 's say however , an average bid does n't win an auction , does it ? the highest bid does and that might be considerably in excess of the winner 's curse phenomenon comes into play in science a lot , because for example when a systematic review is done for various studies that found the effect size for a given type of medical treatment , the effect size often turns out to be larger in smaller studies in theory , a treatment should give roughly the same effect size in all different sizes of study if aspirin is a successful treatment for headaches of the time , a study involving people should show that , and a study involving people should show that instead , what you often see is here i'm making numbers up aspirin works of the time in a small study and of the time in a large study you can see how this might happen suppose four different teams of scientists who do n't talk to each other decide to investigate the effectiveness of a vitamin milkshake as a hangover cure and suppose that the true effectiveness of this cure over a large enough number of studies and subjects is actually about however , our four teams , working with very small study populations hence , a high potential for statistical noise find effectiveness of , , , and the teams that got the lowest numbers probably wo n't publish their results the team that got probably will this sort of thing happens in science a lot and helps explain why , for example , some of the early twins studies on schizophrenia found high concordance rates over for schizophrenia in identical twins versus fraternal twins , in relatively small studies , whereas later , much larger studies have found rates as low as winner 's curse is a well known ascertainment problem in science that affects studies of many kinds , including some of the recent large genome wide associataion studies that have produced findings that failed to replicate when other teams decided to do similar sorts of investigations i 'll be talking more about that about soon note for a more technical discussion of winner 's curse in genetic studies and what can be done about it , see sebastian z llner and jonathan k pritchard , overcoming the winner s curse estimating penetrance parameters from case control data , am j hum genet apr i'm working on a no nonsense , skewer the sacred cows book about mental illness if you 'd like to follow the progress of the book , sign up for the mailing list , and be sure to check back here regularly thanks !
