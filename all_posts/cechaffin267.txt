first , there is a new post which got posted as an old one , writing and personality if you scroll down it 's not just whining i wonder , can i work out my own psychology on paper or do i need a therapist ? is writing enough ? i 've written reams before trying to understand my melancholy , and the writing has helped somewhat with acceptance but not with the actual depression as in my essay , my struggle with literary narcissism , among other character defects , i am most worried about a lingering bitterness , i fear , about never getting my due but why do i demand my due ? why should i need praise and publicity to validate my art ? i used to be content just to write a good poem now i want it published or or praised or paid for i do n't write to be published or for contests , naturally , i write to write but the darkness of feeling as if i got a raw deal disturbs me rejoice with those who rejoice that 's hard to do when they are preferred above you and you honestly believe your work is superior but i have been there before emotionally , rejoicing wit others instead of jealous , and hope to return there again this week , rather than stay at home , write and weep , i 've been coming with kathleen to town in the morning i hang out at a coffee shop , go online at the library , exercise at the gym somehow i manage to fill the day and according to my rules for depression i am doing the right thing it 's better to be around people and out and about than cooped up with two cats and the two hemispheres of my brain , both pairs fighting i just got my first rejection for my eliot book yesterday it 's what i expected at least the editorial board of mellen press gave it a good read i'm thinking that self publishing is the easiest way to give my work a chance out there with the proper promotion , you can do ok sure , i 'd feel better if some august press wanted to feature me , but the chances of that happening , though not great , can only be played out if i continue to query for years i am on the cusp of giving in to self publishing , however , and selling my books on demand at least then i 'll have a tangible record to hand someone and prove i'm a writer , avoiding that embarrassing question about vanity press but hey , whitman did it , and others having completed all my past writing projects except for my theological tome , in search of the spirit , it 's time to look forward to a new subject and i think it 's time to give in to my friends and few fans , who always find my life more interesting than my writing , what they 're always asking me for yes , i'm talking autobiography , the memoir of a manic depressive doctor and poet , both in hospital and jail and out it 's been done by mark vonnegut and kay jamison , but no matter in an age of inauthenticity the audience still craves the authentic , the personal , for their vicarious delectation i'm about out of time at the library computer this is my th post on this blog amazing and since i installed the site meter sometime in , over , have come this way i'm grateful to be heard this blog has proven to be more of a comfort to me than i imagined i wanted to show off my writing , especially humorous essays here , but ended up in the confessional mode because of my disease whether a fortuitous change or not , it is what it is and i yam what i yam i'm craigie the mental man ! kilorats and fragile , ce
