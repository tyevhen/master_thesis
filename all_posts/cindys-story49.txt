the dark path suicide to me my thoughts through time suicide the unthinkable the weak the bad the wrong the sinful the crazy the untrusting the distant suicide the lucky the wanted the possibility the desired the believed lie the escape the possible hope the way out suicide the near the desperate plea the choice the undoable the tried the failed the sorrow the shame or a change no suicide no the choice to stay alive the facing of the fears the reaching out for help the death to the control the choice to step and step the giving death and life to christ the moment by moment return the living once again then not the end but the beginning where my life is not my own and christ holds me for his joy yes he knows my every need and he provides in his own way amazing ! he loved me all along i wait he knows when to bring me home ! suicide do n't let it be your end turn choose trust look up hope give it all to christ rest let your life begin the new path to life anew amen yes amen cindy
