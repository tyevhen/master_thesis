roy has convinced me that e publishing on amazon is the way to go with my novels and my summer project is to get them up on amazon 's kindle direct one option on the kindle e publishing allows for authors to give their books away for free for a few days to promote them , and if this is an option i can use , i will be offering the first book , home inspection , for free to our shrink rap readers i 've been aiming for a july th release date , but the wretched derecho and the power failures that have ensued may have slowed things down the young woman who is designing a cover for me had a tree in her bedroom and no power for days , so we 'll see a lot needs to get done in the next few days for this to happen by the th i just set up a facebook page for home inspection , if you 'd like to read a little about it , click here while i wrote this novel many years ago , it is very much like a book version of the hbo series in treatment the entire course of the book takes place in a psychiatrist 's office and dr julius strand struggles with his own issues many of the same issues that in treatment 's dr paul weston faced around divorce , relationships with his children , and finding meaning in his life as he helps two patients sort through their own romantic confusion but wait , you do n't have a kindle or an e reader ? you can download a free kindle app to your pc , mac , ipad , android , blackberry , iphone , or itouch if you 'd like a real book , i'm hoping to simultaneously get the books up on amazon 's createspace which will allow readers to order hard copies , but i have n't even begun to figure that one out more novel news soon
