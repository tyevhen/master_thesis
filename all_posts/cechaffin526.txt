i m a confessed christian but sometimes i go through phases when i wonder what use it is and subsequently feel attracted to another path more than usually still , other religions don t satisfy my hunger for realism the history of the jewish people and their rejected messiah , given to the gentiles , seems too good to be true but one thing that makes me think the bible true , or inspired , is its incessant need for material reality in order to confirm spiritual things circumcision , crucifixion , animal sacrifice , the remnant of which is the eucharist judaism is very concrete another reason if the bible were propaganda why would it so painstakingly include all the failures of its heroes ? david was a murderer and adulterer , who in his dotage let the royal house go to pieces , which led to a national schism after christ repeatedly told the disciples he would die in jerusalem , all his disciples deserted him after his arrest save the youngest , john and these pantywaists became apostles further , whoever described the foibles of the disciples in detail must have been pretty close to the action compared with other traditions , the stories in the bible smell of reality , like the straw of a manger not just spirituality i thought i d write about something other than myself and i did it in under words , amazing btw , i'm absent a poetry student right now for the first time in a long time , so if you know anyone who wants a poetry tutor , check out the course description in the new poet 's market they speak of poetry coaches i just learned of life coaches ! i think the need for coaches is a fine example of a service economy keep those kilobunnies hopping , ce
