i'm recovering from my weekend away it was so nice to be on a lake in a nice spot with someone i care about i just wish it was n't hours away that long drive was exhausting ! but it was worth it puck and i spent the weekend with my new friend , d , and we had a great time together the sun shone brightly the air was warm we ran we boated we grilled out we talked it was really nice we had several nice , long talks over the course of days , but we did n't discuss the big d depression was not on the topic list i felt good about that decision we were still getting to know each other , and the time was not right i feel more strongly now that there will be a right time , and i feel more confident that it will be okay when i do tell him i'm less anxious than i was , but i'm sure it will still be nerve wracking when we have the discussion one of the other nice things d and i did together was a mile long run saturday morning there is a very nice bike trail near his home in fact , that bike trail is where we first met we ran through the woods together , and although he thought i 'd run faster than him , we matched paces really well i do n't usually run with other people , but it provided us with more time to get to know each other it was a relaxed , fun run i'm getting back into my normal routine now work has been very busy and shows no sign of slowing down my training continues to go well i ran a , mile repeats today it was a hard workout , as i think i'm still fatigued from the weekend activities , but i got it done and i have my last miler prior to the marathon scheduled for this saturday only weeks until my next mile race ! things are going well i'm still smiling from the weekend it feels good to have something so wonderful to smile about i wish d and i lived closer to one another , but that 's not the way it is we 'll just have to work a little harder if this thing is going to work out and right now i certainly hope it does
