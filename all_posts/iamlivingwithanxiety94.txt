ugh i had one of those days you probably know them the freakout days where bad news exacerbates your anxiety i knew i was in a tailspin and for a while did not want to stop it finally , i realized this was counterproductive to my mental health i sat in my office chair , took some deep breaths , and told myself that i had had enough amazingly , it worked so i rewarded myself with cupcakes last night sometimes you just gotta treat yourself !
