i just had my semi annual visit to the muscular dystrophy association mda clinic it is always an experience the clinic i attend has neurologists and students from emory university school of medicine i have been attending this clinic for over five years my neurologist is linton hopkins , jr , m d , and he is great i always enjoy seeing him dr hopkins is also very supportive of the kennedy 's disease association he always introduces me to his students as a rare bird the mda clinic also gives me an opportunity to educate upcoming doctors on kennedy 's disease of the students have never heard of kennedy 's disease or spinal bulbar muscular atrophy , so that always makes it interesting the mda clinic is also a valuable resource for other services a mda representative is always on hand to discuss other needs and opportunities these representatives are quite knowledgeable and have a long list of other resources readily available this visit was interesting because i am looking at getting a new wheelchair knowing that the next chair needs to last five years or more before being replaced , i have to make some decisions as to my current and future needs the mda representative recommended that i schedule an appointment with an occupational therapist ot at the emory hospital this ot is familiar with progressive disorders and will have a much better understanding of my future needs unfortunately , emory is a two hour trip each way i do not look forward to spending a long day on the road and sitting in a hospital , but this might be a good opportunity one additional benefit is that this therapist has several chairs available for testing to make certain i am comfortable with the capabilities and controls reference the mda , i recommend that anyone who has kennedy 's disease should register with them they have a multitude of resources and support services available my only complaint with the mda is that they do not have any group or person focused on kennedy 's disease support it is a rare disorder that is one of the primary reasons why the kennedy 's disease association was formed fortunately , both organizations offer somewhat unique , but complimentary services so , if you have kennedy 's disease and have not registered with the mda , please go to http www mda org in the middle of the home page is a form to find your local office in addition , if you have not joined the kennedy 's disease association kda , go to http www kennedysdisease org near the top of the home page is a join the kda button you will be glad that you joined both organizations until friday then , stay healthy and upright
