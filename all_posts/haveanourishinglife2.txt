depression is not your cross to offer up depression is not yours in the sense that it is not yours alone god is not commanding that you get through it by yourself or without help from other people if you think it is your job to deal with your mental illness , then you are being prideful not recognizing that you have depression is one thing , but rejecting treatment on the account of your faith is quite another depression is not something you should just offer up , keep hidden , or try to mask with work or busyness offering up your suffering and uniting it with christ 's on the cross is a very holy thing but let 's figure out what that really means suffering is a part of daily life it looks different now than it did even years ago but despite our smartphones , air conditioning , and microwaves , suffering keeps popping up in different forms ! we just ca n't get rid of the darn thing depression is excruciating suffering first hand experience every task is an impossible mountain to climb you can try and try to get through life and offer up the suffering , but eventually you will run out of reserves and are in danger of giving up i think every healthy minded person can agree that suicide is not god 's option for you when i had depression , i thought it was my cross , mine , to offer up i kept trying and trying to offer up this suffering , but it was leading me further and further away from god i did n't realize i had depression at first it was just this suffering that i could n't explain i truly believed i had to work through it , offer it up , and be content with god alone suffices let nothing disturb you , let nothing frighten you , all things are passing away god never changes patience obtains all things whoever has god lacks nothing god alone suffices st teresa of avila does god alone suffice ? heck yes remember , he created us he is our divine master we are his he created us he created us as human beings with a soul and a body is our body in the way ? sometimes it sure does feel like it god is not asking us to have a contest to see who can torture themselves the most he is asking us to accept the suffering that has been given to us , not to go out and purposefully seek suffering for it 's own sake in and of itself suffering is only good because it can lead us closer to god god alone suffices because when the kids are hungry and crying at my feet and i'm also starving because it 's an hour past lunch time , i serve them first because i know god alone suffices i can sacrifice my needs in order to take care of them first after they are ok , i can make lunch for myself god alone suffices for me to delay my immediate needs to take care of others and serve him through it god does n't intend for me to give up eating entirely god alone suffices , because we are utterly dependent on him even though god alone suffices , i have to humbly eat to keep myself alive i have to take showers and order more contacts humbly i am not a robot nor above human requirements can you serve god when you have depression ? sure thing but you can serve him better when you are treating the depression can you serve god with a broken leg ? most definitely ! but you can serve him better when you are healthy it would be ridiculous to reject a cast or disregard the advice to stay off your feet for a while in order to let your leg heal when you get a broken leg , you are still offering up the suffering even if you humbly accept healing we have to humble ourselves it 's all about humility humility through the suffering and the healing he give us realize that he made us as human beings with a human body and he asks us to take care of it humility bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people sometimes , the suffering we have in this life is not related to whether or not we earned it depression is not the result of something you did or did not do you do not deserve depression theologically speaking , we deserve far worse because of our sins , our perfectly just god has the power to send us all to eternal suffering but in his mercy , he sent his son to suffer for us any suffering we have , any sacrifices we make , can never make us worthy of heaven ! ! we can only get to heaven because jesus died on the cross for us so let 's humbly accept our measly little suffering god gives us in order to let us be a part of his eternal plan it 's like when i let my son , dominic , help me make cookies the whole time i'm thinking , patience , patience , patience is dominic helping ? well , yes , but my two year old could n't do it on his own we know this life on earth is not our end goal that 's what makes us different that 's what makes us unique from the rest of the godless society it is easier to live through the suffering now , because , when we 've done everything we can to take care of ourselves and still experience suffering , we can take comfort in the fact that it is only temporary living in the world but not of the world not that we reject our humanity and try to live as gods we have to live in this world until god says our time is up because it 's all about his timing , he requires us to take care ourselves until he calls us home treat your depression do n't reject the medicine or counseling because you think god is asking you to get through it on your own he 's not he 's asking you to humble yourself and ask for help so that you may serve him to your fullest potential and help other people along the way
