warning this post contains whining and complaint i returned home from the hospital yesterday i had plenty to do we had a huge snow storm while i was an inpatient it took me almost hours to snow blow the inches of snow out of my driveway and off my sidewalks all the while jet had a blast exploring his new , deeply filled yard he 's always good for a chuckle unfortunately , that was about the full extent of my chuckling for the day i 've kept busy since returning home , but i'm struggling i was feeling incredibly cooped up and restless in the hospital i had to get out of there , and truthfully i felt ready to come home after snow blowing , i attempted a run with jet that was a lesson in frustration it always amazes me how quickly i lose fitness despite doing some walking , yoga , sit ups , push ups , and biking while in the hospital , i felt as if i had n't run for months it was discouraging , as i was really hitting my stride , running hard and fast , prior to hospitalization things got worse last night this damn illness has me over a barrel life , it seems , has been sucked from within i'm tired i'm tired of the struggle i'm tired of the fight i'm in that empty , painful place those of you with depression will recognize instantly like a leaden cloak this amorphous , nebulous illness confines and oppresses me there is no clear way out shifting and heavy and impossible to shake , i am cloaked in deplorable darkness it is a darkness pulling at me , willing me to quit it is despicable and dense i am trapped without fight i have no pithy , positive spin today i am hurting , and tired , and feel like giving up and that 's all i 've got
