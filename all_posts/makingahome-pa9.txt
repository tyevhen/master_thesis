it has been so gray , dreary , cold , and rainy here for way too long when i woke up yesterday morning , the sun was actually out and the sky was blue and i was so , so happy i'm telling you all , i do not tolerate gray days very well which is completely ironic since i live in western pennsylvania , which happens to be one of the least sunny places in the united states really now go figure anyway , the sun was out yesterday when i woke up , and i immediately felt so much more energized and ready to go about my day i had herbs , veggies , and flowers that i wanted to plant , and i had a big pile of my handspun yarn that needed heat treated and hung out to dry i managed to get all of the yarn simmered and pulled out of the pot and hung outside to dry i'm not kidding when i say that a mere ten minutes after i hung out the skeins , lily yelled into the house that it was thundering i thought she was mistaken , but then the wind started to blow and the rain started to pour from the sky thankfully , lily 's warning gave me time to grab the skeins and put them on the back porch it was a short lived rain it probably only lasted less than an hour , and then the sun did come out again and remained out the rest of the day i can live with that and while it rained , we ran to our neighbor 's nursery and picked up a few hanging baskets and flowers we also stopped and picked up a couple of fleeces that a neighbor was giving to me since she was literally just going to throw them away gasp i have no idea what type of sheep she has she did n't know either her son had bought them for her at an auction however , i 'll clean the wool and play around with it and see what it 's like it ended up being a pretty productive day the yarn dried i got all of the plants into the raised beds i prettied up our landscaping with some flowers and i enjoyed doing all of these things while replenishing my vitamin d levels
