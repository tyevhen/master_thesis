i have n't blogged in four days and the universe has n't shifted my mood has improved up to the point where blogging seems like some kind of external burden instead of a welcome distraction my operative secret has been pretending to be myself strange how a change in mood changes one 's valuation of things let ethicists debate that and they have the marquis de sade everything that is is good anon happiness is a side effect of right behavior and i do n't feel like going out tonight , honey we need to talk not again ! it 's like being a low rent jeweler , stringing these cliche 's together into a necklace of tears still you see the mood determination factor kennedy met with khrushchev after morphine injections for his back jack the junkie , as history fondly recalls him how did this affect berlin , i wonder ? and his wife ! model pretty and model thin too bad he preferred the upholstered couches i wrote a decent poem in the last year , so i was told by twenty comments at a poetry forum recently , the gazebo you want to see it ? among schoolchildren a old man in a brown cardigan walks a black chow on a chain leash beside a fence where children throng and in a supplication of small fingers reach through galvanized diamonds of steel , each clamoring for a touch , the soft substantial feel of mammalian welcome trusting , dependent fur how many would trade the fence for the leash ? i dedicate this poem to my old friend , poet john benson , whom i spoke with last night for the first time in years and who is thinking of starting a blog tell him yes ! one of the brightest and funniest men i 've ever known his son , david benson , is a poet as well i thought of a couple aphorisms it is hard to create a literature that captures its time and outlives it great poetry communicates an involuntary experience as to the second aphorism above , i'm talking about the book you ca n't put down , the movie you ca n't walk out of , the poem that , once you begin it , there 's no turning back you 're hooked poetry ought to be that pleasurable poetry ought to make that kind of impression to do that today poetry must strive to be open and concise , colloquial and precise , syntactic and musical , but most of all experientially epigrammatic a shot of indelible snapshots to shoot up in words i have previously written about logopoetry and power lyrics if essays interest you my point is simple either we accept that the audience for poetry will continue to dwindle to irrelevant proportions while we experiment and re invent the wheel , or we fashion a poetry muscular enough , compressed enough , compelling enough to command attention from the multitasking modern mind i take some comfort from the swedes' retrogardism here 's another of mine that wants to be a power lyric about the bracelet you sent me a silver bracelet damn i'm good , it said i found it heavy and constricting , painful in its alien density i was forgetting my body again , how any restriction burns like handcuffs , even a watchband , but you know this so i hung it from my key chain i like the heft of it there , i like to stretch my knuckles against its links and feel the ache of constant use relax what if all the righteous faded by subtle increments to stark transparency until no one could see them but themselves ? left to our sordid board games , would we even notice their absence ? in this scenario you 'd have disappeared before we met i'm so glad i see you ! and this bracelet , whether it rings my wrist or jabbers with the keys , proves you see me , too ! you saw the poor boy in the rich man 's house you clothed him in your sea green light you kissed him with your coral lips , sucked poison from his stonefish heart and smoothed the ragged seaweed from his brow with patient fingers , saying , you are loved , little boy , you are loved this one is likely too dense for a power lyric a power lyric should be more direct , i think , require less of the reader here epistemology i kick at the rock , sam johnson , break your bones but cloudy , cloudy is the stuff of stones ii we milk the cow of the world , and as we do we whisper in her ear , 'you are not true ' richard wilbur perhaps that one is too riddle like but i love it that first poem of mine ended in sort of a riddle hmm here 's another poem that approaches my ideal the heaven of animals here they are the soft eyes open if they have lived in a wood it is a wood if they have lived on plains it is grass rolling under their feet forever having no souls , they have come , anyway , beyond their knowing their instincts wholly bloom and they rise the soft eyes open to match them , the landscape flowers , outdoing , desperately outdoing what is required the richest wood , the deepest field for some of these , it could not be the place it is , without blood these hunt , as they have done , but with claws and teeth grown perfect , more deadly than they can believe they stalk more silently , and crouch on the limbs of trees , and their descent upon the bright backs of their prey may take years in a sovereign floating of joy and those that are hunted know this as their life , their reward to walk under such trees in full knowledge of what is in glory above them , and to feel no fear , but acceptance , compliance fulfilling themselves without pain at the cycle 's center , they tremble , they walk under the tree , they fall , they are torn , they rise , they walk again james dickey my aforementioned poet friend contemplating a blog , john benson , turned me on to this poem wordsworth , go fish it is silly to put my own work on the same page as dickey or wilbur , but in the blogosphere of the cyberuniverse it is perfectly acceptable i am content if any of these show , however enanescently , how poetry can not only matter but actually attract more readers obviously my mood has improved , as i said at the outset , though i do not put my faith in this appearance yet thanks to all of you for your encouragement , faithfulness and patience during these last two years i am not saying it is over if it holds i may blog about it thine , craig erick
