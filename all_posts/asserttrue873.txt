i stumbled upon the floppy drive raid story see previous blog as part of a google search to see if any such thing as a memory stick flash drive raid array is available for vista no such luck , of course but there are quite a few blogs and articles on the web by linux users who have successfully created ad hoc flash raids from commodity usb hubs and memory sticks i recommend this june article from the linux gazette and this even more entertaining , not to mention better illustrated , piece by daddy kewl definitely do not fail to read the latter ! linux supports this kind of madness natively macos is even better for this evidently you can plug two sticks into a powerbook 's usb ports and configure them as a raid array with native macos dialogs details here how i envy mac users !
