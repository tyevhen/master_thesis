the full title of the article published in bmc psychiatry is even more suicide attempts in clinical trials with paroxetine randomised against placebo the authors are aursnes , tvete , gaasemyr , natvig they performed a bayesian analysis a form of statistical analysis on whether paroxetine paxil seroxat is related to an increase in suicides in clinical trials here s what they had to say , starting with some background last year we wrote a paper suicide attempts in clinical trials with paroxetine randomised against placebo that hit the front pages of newspapers worldwide , our publication demonstrated an increased intensity of suicide attempts per year when using paroxetine compared to placebo , and caused glaxosmithkline gsk to come up with a comment since then gsk has provided additional data to the american food and drug administration fda , as the agency required new documentation on paroxetine this also resulted in a briefing document from gsk in which they admit that there is an increased risk for suicide attempts associated with paroxetine then the authors mentioned that , in the current study , we analyzed the data gsk presented in their latest report by the same bayesian approach used by us in our article we included only the double blind , parallel design studies with patients randomized to either paroxetine or placebo , as recognized by gsk in the briefing document these studies contained and patients to the treatment and placebo groups , respectively they resulted in and suicide attempts , respectively , as compared to and in our study the studies lasted weeks , and we obtained and patient years in the treatment and placebo groups , respectively what did they find ? we found that the posterior probability that medication with paroxetine is associated with an increased intensity per year of a suicide attempt is with the pessimistic prior , with the slightly optimistic prior and with the slightly pessimistic prior hence , we can be at least sure that paroxetine increases suicide attempts this is stronger evidence than the p value equal to given in the briefing document i am not a bayesian statistician , so i can t necessarily critique their method very well i can tell you that these conclusions match fairly well with evidence marshaled by healy and others that paroxetine as well as other ssris are indeed related to an increased suicide risk feel free to read other posts here , here , here , and here and their related sources at that point , i think you will see that , based on clinical trial data , there is indeed a greater risk for suicide on ssri than placebo
