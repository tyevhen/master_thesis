i just came in from a quick grocery store run , and as my mom and i pulled into the driveway , we saw a robin just a little ways along the street ! now , as you probably know , robins are a sure sign of spring and then to make things even better , when i got out of the car , i heard a sound that i'm very familiar with geese ! and sure enough , when i looked up i saw the distinctive v formations heading across the sky when the canada geese come back , it means spring is here ! woo hoo ! i walked into the house with a huge smile on my face also , an unschooling friend is coming to visit in early april , which makes me very happy ! we can wander around downtown montreal , sit around by the water , or simply chill in my room listening to music whatever we end up occupying our time with , i'm sure we 'll have a good time ! another thing that 's been making me very happy lately is music i'm in love with virtually all types of music , but something i love particularly is celtic inspired rock and folk most of my favorite songs are celtic inspired i just love it so here are a few wonderful songs in that category that you may want to check out the bard 's song by blind guardian the islander by nightwish loser by ayreon other than that , my life is too quiet i'm bored so i need to think of some new activities to start , some new things to do hopefully i 'll come up with some things soon , before i go entirely out of my mind ! edit oh oh , and i also really enjoyed dressing nicely last night ! i 'd gotten very used to just throwing my clothes on with no attention to what actually makes me happy , but last night i pulled out some of my punk and goth type stuff and felt that i looked very nice i really do have to put the effort into my outfits , because i feel so much happier , and much more confident , when i feel like my clothes not only look good , but also reflect my personality and individuality i changed my blogger profile pic to one from last night peace , idzie you might also like trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! beauty lovely music bright spring days , and long summer nights linkwithin
