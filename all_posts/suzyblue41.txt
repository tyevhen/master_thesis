ok so quinoa is like my new favorite thing ever ! it s a type of seed although it can be prepared just like rice quinoa is a complete protein , containing all eight amino acids and has been recognised by the united nations as a supercrop for its health benefits whats even better is that it is so versatile that it can be eaten with almost anything ! being a student , i m always trying to come up with cheap , easy and quick meals to avoid grabbing the supernoodles or cheesy pasta out of my cupboard , so the other day me and my flatmate decided to play chef and see what tasty dish we could come up with ! we ended up creating a sort of pepper and tomato warm quinoa salad , which actually tasted pretty nice , although next time i think adding some chorizo along with the chicken and veg would give the dish a little extra flavour ! but the great thing about this recipe is that you can change it to suit you ! so easy , so quick , so yummy ! happy cooking ! ps , the lack of blogging was due to having no wifi for ten days , but i'm back for good now yay ! ! related posts fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration
