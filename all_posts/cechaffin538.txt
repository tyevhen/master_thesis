today 's poem is the tenth in the manic half of sine wave and the th poem in the ms it 's also one of my personal favorites , though to explain that would ruin the poem in your hands the desert two lane flashes its white segments so fast you forget the asphalt discontinuities and think the dashes connected toward some future rendezvous where night and morning join in a secret sunrise of stars that explains all the causalities that propelled you here but your eyes are sucked back to this moment , furious and finite as a fly seizuring against a screen the yellow smears on your windshield are souls you ve hurt without knowing the whistle through the window is your suspicion of yourself the radio plays country because you really are that simple when it s time to pull over , you are no closer to but no farther from your goal in a waking sleep you imagine topiaries of exhaust in the shapes of visionaries jesus , blake , jules verne were they just as rooted to the moment ? or did they veer off in the underbrush ? the wheel is in your hands published in eclectica yesterday our neighbor , i'm not creepy , was noted at dusk on his outdoor patio in only a white towel , while a naked young woman ran out his door and back several times she was , well very good looking , her body athletic without losing the requisite curvature i poked my head out the door to say , is everything ok ? mike inc said , fine come , meet my girlfriend was standing outside naked at the time but instead of greeting me , she ran back inside i heard no shouting or signs of distress , the woman could not have been over , while mike i'm not creepy is on medicare , pot bellied , with sticks for arms and stringy white hair streaming from his scalp in two big patche like larry from the three stooges mike 's socially impaired and kathleen and our neighbor , noel , swear he stinks almost all the time from body odor being over a foot taller than he , i have n't noticed so how does he snag a hot chick ? we think mike 's scam is as follows he seeks out young female hitchikers and asks them if they 'd like to come home and pose for some artistic photographs and he , no doubt , has to get close to the subject for the sake of art usually in a photographic session the photographer keeps his clothes on , yes ? i hiked five miles yesterday with kathleen , brutal climb near the end but i pigged aoout last night and lost any advantage from the exercise still , careful observers may have noted that i lowered my weight from to in my profiel mood holding i can tell because i irritate kathleen now thine in poetry and adventure , ce
