my day did n't start out especially well the heat and humidity were headed to record highs i had driven along a highway choked with traffic and construction projects to a doctor 's appointment that was frustrating the wait was long , the appointment brief and the doctor 's manner brusque i felt distinctly unheard and , as i left , i ruminated about being seen as just another older person on the medical assembly line disappointed , angry and a little depressed , i decided to stop for lunch at nearby diner before braving the torn up highway traffic to head home the place was moderately crowded and noisy feeling pissed off and more than a little sorry for myself , i hunkered down in a booth , picking at my senior special omelet though the waitress was quick to refill my coffee cup , she was uncommonly slow to bring me my check i finally waved her to my table she smiled oh , your check has been paid already , she said a couple who left a few minutes ago told me that they wanted to make your day better than it appeared to be going it was a magic moment this gracious and generous couple , whoever they were , made my day i felt an instant lightening of my mood and flood of gratitude for their kindness it had nothing to do with the amount of the check or my actually getting a free lunch after years of insisting there was no such thing it had more to do with strangers noticing that i seemed unhappy and taking steps to brighten my day and it occurred to me that if such kindness could make such a difference to me in my minor funk , what a blessing it could be to someone who was really struggling and how often we tend to pass others by without looking or noticing or caring what if we smiled at others more ? what if we started more friendly conversations ? what if we paid it forward with a random act of kindness ? particularly at this time , when we 've divided ourselves into warring factions , trump fans and trump haters , red states , blue states , conservatives and liberals , religious and non religious , we too often forget that whatever our personal beliefs , convictions and preferences , we all usually feel soothed and surprised by another 's kindness the most obvious opportunities to be kind come with those closest to us a surprise phone call to a lonely , elderly parent or other relative a show of interest in a child 's project or passion along with honest praise and encouragement a gesture of kindness toward a spouse like quietly deciding to vacuum the living room because you know your spouse hates vacuuming , surprising him or her with a netflix movie he or she has been wanting to see or with tickets to a sports event or concert telling him how much you appreciate all he does or giving her the most credit when someone compliments you on how well your children have turned out there are , to be sure , so many times when we take those we love most for granted or when , tired and desperate for a few minutes of peace and quiet , we wave off a talkative , inquisitive child there are many opportunities to be kind with co workers , colleagues , friends and neighbors being gentle with their feelings , protective with their confidences , listening without planning a response , teaching an insight or skill without minimizing their current efforts , finding something positive about them and letting them know you notice , especially when life is not being especially kind to them and then there are strangers whose lives we can impact in ways we may never know with a smile or a happy surprise like my free lunch or a gesture that feels quite ordinary and unexceptional , but may be meaningful to them yesterday , i reached a jumble of supermarket shopping carts a step ahead of another woman who was looking troubled and tired i wrested one of the shopping carts free and gave it to her she looked startled , then smiled oh , thank you ! she said i always have trouble getting a cart out of all that mess how did you know ? i really appreciate it ! and she smiled again it was such a small thing really but it brightened both our days yes , i was smiling , too when i am kind to another , i feel better myself and you never know when making a small gesture of consideration and kindness can bring comfort to those who may need it most randy walters , , the owner of wimpy 's paradise , a burger place in chandler , arizona , practices daily kindness on such a scale that he was recently the subject of an article in the arizona republic he has launched kindness campaigns he rallied community support for a single mom and her daughter who were living out of their van he uses his restaurant to raise money for a pay it forward fund to help feed the homeless and to benefit veterans and police officers and there are daily kindnesses promised on a sidewalk sandwich sign in front of his restaurant , offering customers and those simply passing by unconditional acceptance and free hugs , with the admonition let 's become a world of hugs and help , not hate and hurt community reactions have been overwhelmingly positive and results of this man 's many kindnesses immeasurable walters told the reporter that one day a muslim man came into his restaurant and asked randy for a hug after hugging him , walters noticed that the man 's eyes had filled with tears he said he was thankful for the hug because his and his family had been the target of so much hate in recent months in another instance , a depressed young woman walked in one day asking about free hugs when walters hugged her , she clung to him , weeping she told him she had planned to kill herself that day but that this hug , this warm connection with another , had given her new hope for walters , his restaurant is n't just about food but feeding hearts and souls we may never know the full story of the stranger we briefly encounter or the co worker who always sets our teeth on edge we may never agree with the loved one whose world views differ so from ours human relationships are , by nature , imperfect but whatever the challenges , whatever our own troubles may be , we can make the choice to be kind and , perhaps , to make a wonderful difference in the life of another
