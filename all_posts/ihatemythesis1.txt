it 's funny how during the most exciting and eventful times of my life i am the least likely to write understandably it 's because we are the busiest during our most exciting moments , but it is a little sad for the pasttime of blogging and so i must apologize during my absence i have been transformed from miserable grad student to near alumnus to my left , is a pile of paper it 's nearly a foot high it is five copies of my completed thesis waiting for monday morning to roll around so that i can drop it off at the bookstore for binding in about nine hours , i should be done forever certainly , the final days have been fun and eventful and i will make my best effort to recount them soon btw , i have started a new blog for the new and improved chapter of my life sharing it with you will involve sacrificing my anonymity i 'll have to think about that one for a while
