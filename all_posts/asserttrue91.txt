anyone who has taken time to dig into the data in an attempt to see how the american economy is really doing ca n't help but reach a startling conclusion , which is that we 're all being lied to , essentially , by the fed and other prosperity cheerleaders who think we 're in a recovery the facts do n't add up we 're being told unemployment is so low , the fed now needs to raise interest rates on the other hand , it 's clear that way too many people who want to work ca n't find work there are three unemployed people for every job opening in the u s , and gdp went negative in the first quarter if gdp is negative for two quarters in a row , that 's the definition of recession so who 's right ? are we in a recession ? or are we in a recovery ? the stock market is up nasdaq is up from a year ago at this time some people like donald trump and carl icahn , but there are many others caution that we 're in a stock market bubble , a historic shift of assets caused by trillion of qe others say no , stocks are properly valued right now because corporate profits are high who 's right ? it turns out there 's a really interesting explanation of what 's going on with corporate profits i 'll get to that in a minute stay with me it 's worth it but first , let 's dispense with the notion that unemployment is under control i want to quote from a recent blog post by david stockman remember him ? he was a republican u s representative from the state of michigan and the director of the office of management and budget under reagan t he fed s current soft target of on the u unemployment rate is downright ridiculous when in the year you have million adults not in the labor force of which only half are retired and receiving social security benefitsoasi and a u computational method that counts as employed anyone who works only a few hour per week then what you have in the resulting fraction is noise , pure and simple the u unemployment rate as a proxy for full employment does not even make it as primitive grade school economics at the present time , there are million adult americans between the ages of and to take a plausible measure of the potential work force that amounts to billion potential labor hours , if we accept the convention that all adults are at least theoretically capable of holding a full time job , hours year and pulling their share of society s need for production and work effort by contrast , during only billion hours were actually supplied to the us economy , according to the bls estimates technically , therefore , there were billion unemployed labor hours , meaning that the real unemployment rate was , not ! unemployment may not be , but it certainly is n't that 's a propaganda figure that bears no relationship to reality it 's likewise not credible to believe that an injection of trillion into the banking system via qe based bond and mortgage buybacks has had no effect whatsoever on the stock market no government agency has ever introduced this large a distortion into the markets before some of the stock market runup almost has to be because of qe but are n't corporate profits driving stock prices ? are n't profits legitimately high ? yes they are higher now than in the peak , just before the meltdown what 's driving profits ? the answer is potentially long and complicated , but one of the major drivers is low labor cost the cost of human labor as a percentage of final sales shown above has been dropping as businesses find more and more ways to get more done with technology , without having to rely so much on warm bodies it turns out that most of the rest of the high corporate profits picture first graph can be explained by the fact that the most profitable corporations are becoming vastly more profitable than less profitable corporations , due to the winner take all nature of the internet economy the same income inequality picture that emerges when you look at the top of wage earners which produces a sharply up sloping curve , with all other earning groups having flat lined also emerges when you bracket companies by profitability the richest companies are simply getting exponentially richer which drags overall average profitability up the results are clear when you separate corporations into five different brackets , by profit margin , and look at their profits over time , something patrick o shaughnessy of o shaugnessy asset management has done recently at his blog when corporations are separated into five bins , by profitability , and their profit margins compared over time to , you see that around , with the emergence of the internet , the top group starts to pull away from other groups bottom performers took huge dives in the yk timeframe after the internet bubble burst and in the meltdown beginning around , with the arrival of the internet , top performing companies see their profitability veer upward bottom performers went off the chart low after the internet bubble of burst , then again in the profit margin increase of the last years has not been broad based , shared by all companies in all brackets , but rather has been concentrated in the highest profit margin group also , the effect is more pronounced for certain sectors like technology and financials than other market sectors patrick o shaughnessy has charts for various sectors on his blog be sure to take a look today , the worst performing quintile is at minus or so , with the best performing quintile at what 's happening here is that companies like google , facebook , microsoft , apple , etc are able to establish monopolies in their respectives spaces they compete against themselves there are no competitors , for those compaies it 's a winner take all environment if you happen to establish yourself as top dog , the gross and often , the net profit margins are incredible and the competition is locked out so yes , corporate profits are doing well on average , but really , the average as usual is not a meaningful indicator of what 's really going on in reality , we have a mostly fake non broad based recovery that 's producing more and more structural unemployment as technology displaces workers permanently from jobs , something i 've blogged about many times before , with corporations using cheap , low interest money from the qe wealth effect to buy their own stock back rather than expand the business and this is happening in an environment of sinking labor costs and rising barriers to entry , with the internet guaranteeing a monopoly for certain highly successful companies the result is that the richest companies are getting massively richer wealth inequality at the corporate level is this a formula for a sustainable economic recovery ?
