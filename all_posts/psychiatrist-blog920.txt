social networking adds a whole new dimension to human interactions i used to ask people about their relationships during my initial psychiatric evaluations , and would include questions like are you close ? when did you last talk ? i 've had to change this because now talking means oh , talking in person , on the phone with a voice to voice conversation , via text message , a note on a facebook page , an im chat , an email message they all count we 've become a weird world and oh , yes , i 've spoken to roy and clink this morning a couple of emails , so i'm not sure if they 've heard yet clink wrote on my wall in the last day or two , i tagged her in a photo of an orange mushroom , and we 've had numerous text messages and roy and i actually spoke on the phone yesterday all inspired by the request of our publisher for a photo of us for the book the big issues have been addressed i got a unanimous vote for curly not straight , and clink has refused to pose until she gets a haircut okay , i'm rambling off topic so people talk in therapy about their fb relationships they get upset about things that are written on walls , they feel spied upon by family member friends , friends and enemies alike oh , but the family would be torn apart if we unfriended each other ! so the other day , i realized i 'd been unfriended i used to get regular newsfeed tidbits from someone i work with i realized they were no more , and i wondered about what was happening in his life first off , let me say that they were a little unsettling at times anyway lots of i do n't like my job groans , and his boss had said to me once , i think he forgets who his friends are well i decided to check in on george and i searched him on my fb search bar ah , he only lets his friends see his info , it tells me but i am george 's friend ! i shout not really , but it makes the plot more interesting and then i realize that i was george 's friend not anymore i'm left to wonder why did i offend him ? i thought he liked me i like him did he decide he wants to rant in ways i should n't see well that 's okay how do i now act with george in 'real life ? ' do i ask about this ? i wo n't what could there possibly be to say other than to make george uncomfortable did he think i 'd notice ? does he want me to ask ? roy is groaning about now , he says i over think these things
