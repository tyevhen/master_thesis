as of thursday evening , i once again became a hospital inpatient i was admitted after i became aware of an increase in my suicidality i hate to write that , because i know many of you come here looking for hope and life but my reality right now contains little hope unfortunately , my reality is filled with scary thoughts , which i no longer find scary and that is alarming , regarding hopelessness and suicide my mood is low my concentration and memory make simple daily tasks challenging my energy has been lost things are tough i'm in the right place i'm not sure how much more i have to say posting here requires brain power and energy , both of which are currently in short supply one more thing i can say , however , is despite this monstrous and debilitating illness , i am fortunate i am fortunate to be in a therapeutic place with expert and compassionate staff i am fortunate to have supportive friends and family my mother changed her flight home so that she will remain here for at least one more week in order to assist me my friends , wendy and tiffany , visited yesterday morning and we laughed out loud together for the better part of two hours that is the first , and only time i 've laughed , i think , in more weeks than i can count so there are a few things worth my gratitude in these moments of despair , i am working to remember i still have fortune mingling among the pain and i pray the pain subsides sooner rather than later
