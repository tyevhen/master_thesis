we can function even with our anxious symptoms on the surface , this statement appears obvious but when in the throes of a deep panic , it can be difficult to remember this extremely important lesson when i'm extremely anxious , the stranger in the brain warns me to not continue what i'm doing obviously , the task at hand is distressing , so it must be stopped , or so the brain reasons but through recovery i 've learned that these thoughts are distressing but not dangerous and that thoughts and impulses can be controlled i can move my muscles and complete the activity washing dishes , closing a door , reading a book , and so on and , by doing so , my muscles will reprogram the rattling brain i have been attending recovery meetings for about six months now , and i'm pleased that dr low 's comments are starting to pop into my mind without much conscious effort for example , the other day a co worker 's response to my e mail caused an initial flare of temper but instead of working it up , i quickly spotted my symptoms and remembered that temper creates tenseness which leads to more symptoms within minutes the temper passed and perhaps it 's no surprise that i ca n't remember what that e mail was about ! i apply the same principle when on the road it 's so easy to slam the horn when someone cuts you off or moves too slowly through an intersection , but the resulting symbolic victory is not worth the temper and guilt sure to follow i endorsed for writing this post
