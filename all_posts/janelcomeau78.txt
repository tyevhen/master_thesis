i recently finished reading j k rowling 's 'a casual vacancy' those of you who stalk me on goodreads already know this i had had the book for some time , but never managed to psyche myself up to reading it the only thing i 'd heard about the book over and over again was that it was n't harry potter eventually , though , i caught sight of it on my bookshelf and , despite it not being harry potter , my curiosity got the better of me and after i 'd finished it , one thing really stood out to me if this cover were one shade brighter , you could actually land planes with it harry potter and the casual vacancy are practically the same book sure , on the surface , one is about an orphan conquering the twin demons of blood purists and puberty , and the other is about a small town realizing that people die sometimes but when you really delve into it , there are some oddly specific things that the two worlds share things like it 's worth noting that i'm not including the cuckoo 's calling in this analysis , because technically , that was a robert galbraith novel , and seriously , people , i'm a student i do n't have the time or money to read things that are n't textbooks right now twins twins account for somewhere between and births for every thousand episodes of pushing out a live baby in other words , if you 're pregnant , your odds of getting an extra bonus baby are between that 's not a lot of twins statistically speaking , you are more likely to believe that lizard people run the government than you are to bear dual versions of yourself in one go of the important characters who show up in the harry potter series , six of them fred george weasley , padma parvati patil , hestia flora carrow are twins , which leaves the harry potter cast clocking in at twin roughly quadruple the actual rate apparently twins are magical beings , because even loony luna lovegood goes on to have her own set of twin boys but as twin filled as harry potter is , the casual vacancy is even worse two niamh siobhan fairbrother of the characters are twins , which puts this book at a whopping twin rate no good can come of so many twins so what does this mean for any future books ? readers should expect to see more and more incidents of multiple births , until rowling finally gets her hands on a copy of brave new world and writes a novel starring eighty three identical teenage clones shitty , shitty fathers look , it 's not exactly a secret that j k rowling has some daddy issues she and her own father have what wikipedia calls a difficult relationship in other words , he auctioned off a collection of the autographed first edition books she gave him for christmas in order to save his failing burger truck business rowling 's animosity towards her burger peddling paternal figure shows up in more than just her adolescent diaries , however it 's splashed all over her writing peter and joanne rowling , in a rare moment of not despising one another virtually every character in both the harry potter series and the casual vacancy has a catastrophically shitty father figure look at harry potter voldemort 's father abandoned him , and his mother 's father was an abusive , shack dwelling hobo snape 's father may or may not have liked to 'argue' with his fists sirius black 's father disowned his teenage son for not being enough of a wizard nazi dumbledore 's father got a life sentence in prison for torturing three muggle children malfoy 's father indoctrinates his only son to a life of serving an immortal lord of racial purity and death , and makes his year old child promise to murder the most powerful wizard who ever lived even remus lupin , who is portrayed as kind hearted , responsible and trustworthy , instantly turns into a child abandoning shithead the moment he 's entrusted with offspring in fact , the character who is arguably the purest of heart mr neville longbottom is one of the only characters who grew up without any father figure whatsoever father son bonding just interferes with snake slaying but the harry potter books are n't the last stop on the 'horrendously irresponsible father' train oh , no the casual vacancy is so chocked full of heinous fathers that it 's actually the driving theme of the book andrew price 's father steals things he can easily afford and beats his entire family whenever they dare to breathe too loud stuart 'fats' wall 's father loudly and openly expresses that he ca n't stand his child and he never wanted a son in the first place sukhvinder jawanda 's father is too busy performing open heart surgery and making middle aged panties drop to notice that his own daughter is carving herself up like salami every time someone calls her stupid in other words , if you live in a j k rowling novel and a person came out of your balls , you are probably a horrible human being good fathers coming perilously close to death even j k rowling seems to have realized that filling up her novels with nothing but child molesters and offspring abandoners is a quicker ticket to therapy than to a book deal in order to keep the psychiatrist 's prescription pad at bay , she sprinkles in the occasional father figure who truly loves and cares for the tiny humans he humped into existence harry potter has james potter , arthur weasley , and sirius black , whom i'm counting as a father because i seriously do n't have a lot to go on here , rowling the casual vacancy has barry fairbrother and howard mollison anyone noticing a pattern here ? here 's a hint every single one of those men either dies , or comes incredibly close to being offed before his time in harry potter , james potter 's death is one of the events that sparks the entire plot arthur weasley picks the wrong night to take guard duty and inadvertently ends up as a snake 's midnight snack interestingly enough , that run in with nagini in book five was supposed to be arthur weasley 's ultimate demise , but j k rowling realized that his death would leave her series completely devoid of decent fathers , and changed the outcome of the scene sirius black stepped out of the blue to prove that good parents do n't have to be your birth parents , and that even people from cartoonishly evil nazi families can overcome their past , but all of that amounts to nothing when he suffers a tragic death by haunted curtain bed , bath beyond just got deadlier in the casual vacancy , barry fairbrother 's death is the entire point of the book , and there be spoilers up ahead , mateys , howard mollison suffers not one , but two attempts on his life at the same time this goes way beyond coincidence if you 're a father in the london area , try to avoid holding hands with your children in public , lest j k rowling spot you and bludgeon you to death with her typewriter teenagers meddling in things they do not understand and now we come to the real underlying theme of j k rowling 's books harry potter is essentially a seven volume instruction manual for how to screw up absolutely everything and then stumble ass first into success it starts from the very first book in harry potter and the philosopher 's stone sorcerer 's stone , if you 're south of the th , harry is told , over and over again , to kindly stay the fuck away from the third floor corridor , because it 's not entirely unreasonable for adults to want to keep an year old child away from a giant , feral headed dog puppy ! er puppies ? of course , harry the wonder boy does n't listen , and promptly charges through dumbledore 's seven circles of hell to retrieve the philosopher 's stone , defeat voldemort and save the day he 's the hero here ! except had harry not intervened , quirrel would have stared hopelessly at the mirror until voldemort got bored and mind crushed him he had no way of getting it out harry is literally the only human capable of getting the stone , so if he never shows up , voldemort 's plot is still just as foiled the outcome of the story is exactly the same if harry is n't in it at all reminds me of someone else i know harry 's further exploits including playing with evil diaries when he 's told not to , playing mind footsie with voldemort when he 's told not to , and fighting the world 's most evil snake lord behind dumbledore 's back when he 's told not to , only to have other people swoop in at the last minute and help him save the day but he and his friends are n't the only teens to stick their noses where they do n't belong the casual vacancy is the adultiest adult book ever , about adults doing adult things like holding elections and dying of brain aneurysms , and it 's still chock full of curious teenage meddlers growing up sucks , kids the entire plot of the novel is driven by shitty , shitty kids doing shitty , shitty things with consequences they ca n't even begin to comprehend the book blurb may tell you that it 's about a small town trying to throw an election to find a replacement for a dead town counselor , but do n't be fooled it 's really about chronically unsupervised teens trying to find out what happens when they post their parents' secrets on the internet and make out with their friends' parents so if you 're anxiously awaiting the release of miss rowling 's next masterpiece , you 're welcome i 've already given you a sneak preview what other patterns have you noticed in your favourite books ?
