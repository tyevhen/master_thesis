when i told a told a friend ah , clinkshrink i was going to start a blog , she said , your patients will read it ! is this a problem ? my first thought was i have a novel out there that opens with a mental health professional stumbling upon her cross dressed husband , how much worse can it get ? true , most of my patients have n't stumbled upon my novel , and so far , none of those who 've read it have fired me it 's a funny issue though , being a psychiatrist , trying to maintain some neutrality for the patients i'm not a psychoanalyst , but i do keep things fairly neutral both because i think my personal affairs would be a distraction in therapy , and because i want my privacy there are no pictures of my family displayed , and so far the most self revealing thing i 've done is to put a red sox cap on the table in my waiting room the morning after they won the world series on the other hand , being a writer is a somewhat public event , at least in brief spurts google has changed everything , and some of it beyond my control i 've googled me as have some of my patients and i'm in a bunch of places , including tied to a faith based site called psycho babble run by dr bob it 's not me , but another em , there are a few of us out there i'm trying to figure out how to be the em 's who 's listed in who 's who in london so , i guess my patients can unearth what they want , and i will admit to the red sox fan stuff , even the novel with a transvestite , and the op ed rant about malpractice reform still not certain what i 'll write about here , i do n't plan to talk about my patients in a disrespectful , disparaging , or revealing way finally , i'm left with the question of is this wise ? for vague reasons perhaps even is this safe ? other doctors seem to vary with how identifiable they are on the web , and i have n't found another psychiatrist blog that is n't anonymous maybe there 's a reason , maybe i'm missing something here , and should mask my identity tell me what you think
