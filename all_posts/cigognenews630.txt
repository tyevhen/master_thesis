those internal events , sensations such as being crushed or suffocated are engraved onto that salamander brain they may seem to the system as menacing as a virus or as that threatening snake the only difference is that the snake is inside encasing deep terror in fact , when those feelings are menacing , the system reacts just as if there were an attack by a virus the immune system is compromised , basic repressive chemicals are diminished and we may well run a fever when a patient of ours gets close to those feelings he can run a fever of several degrees even when he has done no exercise at all or even more strangely , body temperature can drop several degrees in minutes during a session this is due to a dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system more on this in a moment anxiety is the avatar of feelings what does it feel like ? it feels horrible it seems like it cannot be shut off nothing i can do will stop it why ? because it is so remote in origin , so seemingly inaccessible as to be considered a given , something that is inherent in us , something we can only hope to barricade ourselves against it is just about always from gestational life or at birth before we can hope to eradicate it we need to be sure about what it is anxiety is not like a current fear there is always the element of terror about it there may be a current justifiable fear which some call anxiety the impending death or severe illness of a relative , for example there may be great fears for their safety and health it can be a terrible threat but i prefer to reserve the term anxiety for something that resonates with very early trauma it is easier to understand and anxiety should automatically direct us to origins anxiety starts its life as pure terror , a visceral reaction , which during womb life is the highest level of brain function operating it gets transformed later on to phobias or to free floating fear we are able to dampen it with a variety of defenses but it is never less forceful than originally let me state that again pure primal terror never changes it is defended against , filtered and softened by higher brain processes but it never changes its internal effects it is biologic it is that reptile again doing its thing and because its origin is so early and so remote and deep , and because the various psycho therapies remain on the surface , we had to wait for medication that worked on those lower brain centers where the pain originates in order to calm ourselves doesn t it make sense for a therapy to try to go deeper , as deep as where those medications work ? early in gestation the fetal brainstem will respond to external noises , even the sound of the mother s voice , with head turning , reflective body movements , and heart rate changes if there is a serious accident to the mother while she is carrying , it will undoubtedly affect the brainstem limbic systems of the fetus , and with possible effects on its heart function , as well the baby may be born fragile and delicate , plagued by a constant underlying fear and quick to startle it is an anxious baby there may be colic involved which may signify the presence of anxiety which is expressed in the skin and biologic system but it is telling us something crucial later on , there may be the adoption of booga booga ideas it is what it sounds like to contain the feeling that was barely contained by the skin earlier on after birth it is erupting again what does a fetus do in the face of trauma ? it reacts viscerally if we ve had this kind of trauma , we will have a predisposition to go on acting viscerally for the rest of our life we then develop stomach problems , palpitations , colitis , ulcers , cramping , breathing problems , and do not know why it is why we often don t know the origin of a problem when a patient presents us with colitis , for example if a problem is solely and seriously visceral , chances are its origins date back to birth , or before look to the brainstem , and we ll find the source it creates the need to keep busy and have plans it is a constant state of agitation when there is an anxiety attack we can be sure that its origin is very early when the brainstem and parts of the limbic system was the most evolved nervous system available midline structures and organs is where we most often see ailments that have an early start in our lives digestive and breathing problems are therefore often of first line origins clearly , bedwetting and later sexual compulsions are of first line origin colitis , as well so when we try to treat sex problems with a constrained focus on the sex organs we may be making a mistake the focus is far too narrow it is not the penis or vagina it is the brain , the lower brain the sex organs just follow orders anxiety is often projected onto or attached to something in the present to justify its existence , but that is often just a rationale the brainstem imprints the deepest levels of pain because it is developed during gestation and handles life and death matters before we see the light of day almost every trauma experienced during womb life is a life and death matter the brainstem doesn t speak english or any other language imagine trying to communicate with it about its pain with words when there aren t any we develop problems such as high blood pressure or insomnia or ulcers the brainstem is carrying an imprinted memory of a trauma and expresses itself through the avenues already selected previously in the viscera there may be a vulnerability in the stomach so that the anxiety load is discharged there , and the appearance of constant cramps later in life when the lower level imprint tries to inform the frontal cortex about its near death experience the blood pressure goes up as does the heart rate it is a warning about stored terror the brainstem is screaming at the neo cortex , the thinking mind listen to me ! i need to tell you about something , you ve got to hear this i ve got a connection to make let me through it is screaming by way of high levels of bio chemicals , such as noradrenaline , glutamate , and cortisol , the language of its biology and the cortex is talking back with increased output of serotonin , saying in effect , sorry , you ve got information i don t want to know about try later ! yes but if you don t let me out , my blood pressure is going to rise dramatically sorry i have to protect my mind after all , i don t want to go crazy a memory imprinted in the brainstem may have serious consequences for many survival functions thus , a chronically rapid heart rate and high blood pressure can presage cardiac problems decades after the imprint settles in through a feeling session it can be traced back to womb life why the chronic rapid heart beat ? it is part of the imprint it is a reaction to the engraved memory it is held in place so long as the origin is not addressed or relived the danger is therefore omnipresent that s all it means , at the end of the day danger do we really want to eliminate our warning signs ? when a patient relives early terror , then ceases to compulsively check the locks on his doors twenty times a day , he has solved an important mystery this , without any prolonged discussion of the obsession he felt unsafe , profoundly unsafe early on the obsessions controlled the terror that he didn t even know he had the left frontal cortex was saying , i d better check the locks it makes me feel more comfortable since the terror is there , he never can feel safe for long the obsessions continue the feeling of being unsafe was seeping up in small increments from the right brain it was immediately staved off by the obsession on the left i ll be safe if the house is locked is the unconscious formula i ll be safe if no one can penetrate me if we were to prevent the obsession , we would see panic and helplessness again , which is what happens in our therapy but it must be done in a safe , controlled atmosphere to feel deeply unsafe one has to feel totally safe in the present that safety , dialectically , turns into its opposite
