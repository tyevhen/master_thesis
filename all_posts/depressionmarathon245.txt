the past month and a half has been a bit of a slog for me if you 've been following along , you know that but things may be changing once again , the light seems to be returning i'm not dancing a jig just yet , but i'm hopeful this brighter trend continues the simple act of feeling hopeful is in and of itself an improvement hooray for improvement ! i'm leery of getting my hopes up , of course the rollercoaster of symptoms has taken its toll but i'm enjoying feeling better today one day at a time i 'll take it one day at a time , keep taking the next right action , and use the supports i have in place to hopefully finally disembark this ride i had a good day yesterday it was cake night cake night is a night of celebration where family and friends are invited to celebrate sobriety anniversaries with those of us in recovery it happens once per month last night we gave out cakes and celebrated years of sobriety i was responsible for of those years prior to the meeting , i had a wonderful steak dinner with friends , some of whom were also celebrating , and then we all attended cake night together it was wonderful to be surrounded by a room full of family , friends , and miracles i never tire of hearing the stories of lives changed by sobriety i am so grateful for the life i have today , depression and all a life that would not be possible if i were still drinking today is dawning bright , warm and clear i'm looking forward to going for a run walk with jet i'm having coffee and catching up with an old friend this afternoon and i'm hoping to begin putting my house back in some sort of order depression has taken a toll on my surroundings , too i know i 'll continue to feel better if i can clean up a bit hoping you all have a bright , clear day , too carry on , my friends
