when i have data crunching to do , i like to do it in the browser excel gives me a headache teaching myself how to write excel macros does n't leave me with a transferable skill a skill that can be used outside of excel it just makes me an expert at excel which i do n't want to be at least if i crunch data with javascript , i learn javascript skills that i can apply to web page design , ajax programming , scalable vector graphics programming , canvas programming , and lots of other scenarios what do i mean by crunching data in the browser ? say you have a text file containing some data open the text file in chrome or firefox , then use control shift j to get to the browser 's javascript console there you are you 're ready to crunch data how ? let 's say your text file contains a table perhaps you took an openoffice table and used the table to text menu command to render the table as tab delimited text presumably there 's a tab separating each columnar data item and a hard return at the end of each line perfect you 're ready to program use control a to select all of the table or highlight the whole thing by swiping across the page with the mouse in the js console , type mytable getselection tostring now you have the whole table in one variable alternatively , instead of selecting all , you could grab the entire text file programmatically this way wholepage document getelementsbytagname pre innerhtml when you open a text file in a browser , it always puts the text in a pre element the method getelementsbytagname always returns an array , even if there 's just one item in it as in this case to get the one and only item in the array , use index zero to get the text of the element , use innerhtml to get the rows from your table rows mytable split n by splitting on every newline carriage return , you get an array of table tows to get the columns for row which is actually at index in the array columns rows split t by splitting on tabs , you 've created an array of column items when you want to display something in the console , do console log columns in this case we 've chosen to display the first column item which is at index zero this is all familiar enough stuff to experienced js users i'm showing the basics here for those who might be new to programming if you 're new to programming , you need to be reminded arguably that array items are indexed in zero based fashion the first item is at index zero , the second item is at index one , the final item is always at length minus one if you 're new to the chrome javascript console control shift j opens the console plus be sure the console tab is selected , you 'll want to take note that you need to use shift enter to type new lines in the console just hitting enter executes whatever code is in the console write a line of code , then shift enter to continue writing on a new line to recap a quick way to crunch data is to put your data in a text file , open the text file with your browser , select all content , then use getselection tostring to load the selected content into a variable alternatively , load the whole text page with document getelementsbytagname pre innerhtml from there , you can parse and crunch at will
