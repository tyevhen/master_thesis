how to convince your parents i will start off by saying first and foremost just doing it or doing it anyway is not something i recommend , but i would be calling the kettle black if i said i did n't do this once in my lifetime so you want your parents to let you have a piercing , but you have no idea how to convince them or everything you have already tried has done you dirty ? do n't fret ghouls and girls i have a few pointers that may or may not help you out a little in pushing your parents towards letting you have one i will link my youtube video discussing these pointers as well to this blog so you can watch it and whatnot , do that here right here ! but in this blog i will give a few examples of what i mean as opposed to just my key pointers that , however , is where we will start off michelle 's key pointers to convince your parents to let you get pierced have an educated speech best time for the piercing especially if still in school stipulate a contract or agreement show pictures and discuss how it can be hidden or covered explain process and maybe even go to parlors lets just start off at number and and go down the list i will break down everything stated above so hold on to your socks ! have and educated speech if you just go to your parents and say i really want one , they 're not even that bad , so and so has one , i can always just take it out if it becomes a big problem , and hoopblah like that , there is no reason your parents should be swayed on letting you get your body stabbed that 's whiny and sounds very bratty for one and a little irresponsible even so the best thing you can do is go with a list of educated facts and sit them down , explaining why you should be able to get the piercing and why it really is n't that big of a deal if you are trying to sway your parents on letting you get snakebites , then make sure you can dish out just about every fact you know or researched on a legitimate body mod website about the piercing set up a table that weighs out the pros and cons pros its a set of oral piercings located on the lower lip oral piercings tend to heal easily and are n't a huge hassle to take care of continue list here cons the lip can sometimes swell up a lot and make the bars uncomfortable but luckily sipping on a cold icee or slurpee helps reduce a lot of that swelling continue list here you get the picture basically just make sure you let them know everything you can possibly let them know about it and so on best time to get pierced if you are trying to convince your parents to let you get a piercing my next most immediate thought after you being under the age of legal consent to sign the papers yourself is that you 're still in school whether it is fast approaching high school or high school itself as usually you have to be at least with parental consent to get a piercing you must still be studying at the institution so with that being said , there is usually a good time to get pierced , instead of getting pierced in the middle of the school year and having to hide it or take it out some schools do n't mind piercings but others have strict dress code rules against i know my high school did if you are in school , tell your parents the average healing time of a piercing you are trying or wanting to get , and tell them what you think is the best time to get it unless it is a tongue ring or a septum , or something easily hidden by clothes , i would recommend that you suggest getting it during a break of at least weeks so usually around december holidays or during the summer stipulate a contract or agreement sometimes it takes a fair trade to convince parents to let you have something this method of earning it not only gets you a piercing or whatever else you may want but also guarantees your parents that you will do something in return now do n't get me wrong parents may lie sometimes and agree to let you get a piercing in exchange for one favor or another usually to your benefit whether its grades or other but that would be teaching bad morals like lying ! so hopefully the agreement you both reach is valid and you can work something out to satisfy your piercing wants show a picture and explain how to cover hide it sometimes a really effective way to convince them its not that bad is to show them what it actually looks like it can be really beneficial to just show a picture of the piercing in place on a person do n't show them someone heavily pierced , just maybe that one piercing and explain how it can easily be hidden i know my parents were very anti nose ring and also very anti microdermal but upon actually seeing how little and cute the piercing was they did n't mind it all that much so sometimes the best thing to do is rub it in their face in the nicest way of course ! explain process and introduce to parlors let them know the process of the piercing this includes the actual piercing process , explain how it is sterilize , done , and taken care of it 's always good to have information on how the piercing is done and the healing time of it if you need any help explaining , try to convince your parents to go to a parlor with you and talk to a piercer the professionals are trained to handle situations like this if you get stabbed they get paid , and who does n't like getting paid to stab someone else lol totally serial killer these are the best pointers i can offer to help you swoon your parental units i did not including convincing them on ear stretching , as i find it to be a totally different ballpark and i find that many people do n't know the best ways to go about it so that may end up being an entirely other post all its own if you have any questions or need any advice however , feel free to email me at catacatlysmic live com or you can follow my social media links !
