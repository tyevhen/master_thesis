we 're supposed to get another inches of snow starting after midnight tonight , and despite several unseasonably warm days , we still have inches of snow on the ground from the christmas storm plus some additional snow last week needless to say clinic will be closed , and i'm cooking up some stew for a warm and cozy snowed in day tomorrow with that amount of snow , the plows can push up banks feet high at the end of the driveway they probably wo n't melt completely until late april or may ! well , here 's the recipe of the evening as usual , thrown together carton of beef broth glug glugx or so of red wine a pound of grassfed stew meat usually i would brown this but i was feeling slow and gentle cooking methods today , or perhaps lazy one onion chopped three small potatoes , peeled and chopped carrots , chopped cup cooked rice to thicken leftover excess from fried rice in the fridge marrow bones , roasted at in the oven on a cookie sheet for half an hour , then put with tongs into the stew stalks of celery , chopped a bit of baby spinach , chopped celtic sea salt , light grey , by the grain salt society , coarse ground , lb , pepper , kelp flakes that 's just the amazon link of course i do n't use a pound of salt ! boil on high for a bit , then set to low and boil for a long time toward the end i will add some chunks of pasture butter and maybe even some olive oil remove the bones before you eat ! i usually use bones , but i found a source of grassfed marrow bones not miles from the house , so now i do n't have to wait for my infrequent pound orders of grassfed beef marrow bones from my home state this will feed four of us several times for a couple of days , so i do n't sweat the rice and potatoes here 's a picture from a previous winter maybe i will have some new ones tomorrow !
