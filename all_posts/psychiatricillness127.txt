i wandered off into the city this morning i got the tube i am starting to feel more confident in european countries now i worry a lot about the british stereo type of never trying to speak the language , assuming others just know english and not making the effort i think this has all come from the french though i have never heard it from anyone else ! anyway , i went to the cathedral today , it was quite nice i kind of feel a presence when i go i do not know if it is the old buildings or some sense of religon i kind of feel warm and supported like i am not alone i lit a few candles and prayed too my mum told my dad off in a cathedral once as he lit a candle she said you were only suppose to light them in remembrance of someone i had lit one too for a friend of hers who was always good to me i never told her ! i never went to church as a child so i do not know what i am suppose to do i like that sense of warmth but would not dare talk to anyone i liked the visit more here in spain than at home in the uk there were more people about , confessions were being made and a service was going on in one of the side rooms it did not feel so weird i am really starting to blame my family for many of my fears and anxieties i feel so guilty about that but i am learning that nothing they told me and the fears they put in my head are unfounded got to run , my taxi to the airport will be here in mins
