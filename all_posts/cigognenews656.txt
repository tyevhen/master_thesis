if we have trouble in our emotional life we need to examine our life before birth when the whole system is gearing up for life on the planet , gestational life has already constructed a crucible for that life outside the womb life in the womb is perhaps the most important time of our lives so much of adult symptoms and behavior can be traced to that epoch so what happens in the womb becomes a harbinger of what to expect , all on an unconscious level so we anticipate a catastrophe , ruminate constantly about it , never realizing that the bad thing has already happened we are actually worried about the past , not the future if we could drop into those past feelings there would be no more worry about the future but that past is remote , maybe occurring before we set foot on earth no wonder it is a mystery i have written about the prototype , the now print that is engraved in the neurophysiologic system even before birth any severe trauma while the mother is carrying can be imprinted into his system where it may well remain for the rest of his life here it may change the brain circuits and cause a permanent deviation in the function of organ systems there is less possibility of that kind of imprint occurring after birth it is now print because it is setting down a prototype of heuristic guiding value that will direct behavior thereafter it is memory of survival , of what worked before to save our lives and it worked when the input stimulus may have been a life and death matter as so many traumas during womb life are this will happen despite the fact that there is no fully functioning neo cortex to remember the scene it happens below the level of conscious awareness , which is why we cannot get there through the vehicle of language here we have a learning system that is distinct from the verbal learning memory system that we will develop later it is neurophysiologic memory the prototype folds all that surrounds a feeling memory , compresses and instills it into a general principle that directs behavior the principle is survival when confronted with an obstacle , for example , it is best to retreat , not confront here is where passivity was life saving what the body learns is not struggling for air when the mother is anesthetized at birth , but retreating into less use of energy and oxygen passivity to undo that imprint , not so easily done , we need to return to the brain that registered it we need to relive it why ? because the deviations of the system are built on that memory imprint all this has already been decided sub cortically she is no longer leading a conscious life we can begin to see why adults do not make profound change even though many have undergone psychoanalytic therapy or have taken lsd or extasy , can claim deep change biologically it seems that this kind of metamorphosis cannot take pace for the imprint of pain is sealed in and cannot be opened again it has a label , not to be open before feeling therapy once the window for fulfillment of need is closed , that is , when the need must be fulfilled to avoid pain , i seriously doubt that any comprehensive change can take place if someone says that the patient must then be offered a new ending for what he relived , or that she needs extensive insights afterward , we understand immediately that we have enlisted the aid of the adult brain and undercut what the patient has felt during the session we know that in reliving gestational life or the birth trauma we are succumbing to deep and long , slow wave brain signatures , which denotes life before birth to then appeal to the late developing new comer , the neo cortex , with its faster frequency wave to finish off the sequence cannot work when we add a complex intellectual discussion to the mix we confound the work of the deep unconscious essentially it takes the patient into higher brain centers the neo cortex the same can be said for early childhood pain where the brain that should be employed , the right feeling side , is abdicated for the left brain explanatory , understanding one in short , we continue to talk to the wrong brain a patient with a very rapid , left frontal cortical signature cannot be feeling until we bring her into the feeling zone the frontal thinking apparatus must recede for a time and again , language only plays a secondary role one way we help patients into the primal feeling zone is to offer tranquilizers to the patient for a short period of time to push down some inordinate pain from gestation or birth the overload of pain and all levels may prevent a person from integrating one feeling at a time we must remember that in dealing with very early life we are mostly describing the work of the right brain the left brain focus will not get us there yet after a year of our therapy the left brain often achieves its full force so that each side is more in equilibrium with the other a more harmonious brain it s not just the brain that is in equilibrium it is the body temperature , blood pressure and key hormones in short , the person is in equilibrium except in rare cases of perhaps genetics no person who is in harmony should show high resting cortisol levels for a therapist to offer a patient an understanding of his motivation , or to propose a different ending for his feeling pain , negates the whole notion of the critical window that is a time when needs can only be fulfilled and at no other time that is an awfully important idea that means that corrective emotional experiences by a therapist cannot make profound change indeed strategies by a therapist , no matter how well meaning , can have only a limited impact to rely on a more advanced , later evolved brain to produce change is a vain exercise the only way to resolve the earlier trauma is to travel back there neuro physiologically and resolve on that level once the critical window is over with closed , nothing can reopen it but feeling
