ever since the progression of kennedy 's disease began to require mobility aids or some type of assistive devices , i purchased only what was minimally needed to get by my reasoning for this was twofold my ego would not allow me to consider purchasing anything more than i currently needed my frugalness others might call it something else could not justify buying anything that i did not currently need anything more would be a waste of money this philosophy set up a scenario where every two or three years it seemed like i always found myself needing something new an example of this process occurred with my first wheelchair i knew that sometime down the line i would need a higher seat or a lift seat because the initial cost would have been about , , i declined a couple of years later i break my tibia and fibula and cannot place any weight on that leg for several months if i had bought the lift seat system , life would have been substantially different during the recovery in addition , because i installed in our van a rear entry interior lift ramp bruno joey for the chair only , i could not go anywhere during the recovery period because i could not transfer to the van 's seat last fall when i was looking at replacing my wheelchair , i reevaluated my thinking process and decided it was time for a change now , whenever i have a new need , i determine what i currently need as well as my possible needs within the next three to five years this process helps me better compare products , options , and pricing my last two purchases satisfy both my current needs as well as potential future needs for several years to come the wheelchair , for example , has several options i currently do not need nice to haves , but also are options that i will probably need in a few years this brand also has several other options available easily added at minimal cost should i ever need them the beauty of this new way of thinking is that i will not be scrambling trying to find something at the last minute that will satisfy a new need i am now looking at my proposed van purchase the same way why spend money on a vehicle and potentially not be able to drive it after a few years without additional modifications because of the progression of the disease or some unforeseen additional need ? this is new uncharted territory for me we will see if this new way of thinking holds up over time , but right now i feel confident this is the right way to go
