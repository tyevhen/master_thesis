the news media has published numerous pieces exploring various aspects of what happened at penn state the sports culture , the prestige of the program , the money it brought into the university , the parallels with the catholic church , and so on what kept action from being taken by administrators after an employee allegedly witnessed a violent crime ? what kept that employee from stopping a violent act ? what kept him from taking further action later ? the media has looked at various aspects of these questions , but two aspects have received little attention is there a difference between the way men and women react to these events , and are there factors that actually inhibit men from taking action in these circumstances ? here is a thought experiment what would happen if the alleged crime were different if , for example , a man had walked in on someone violently raping a ten year old female child ? would he have reacted the same , observing but not interfering , reporting it up the line , but not taking subsequent action ? what would have happened if one of the administrators who learned of this had been a woman ? my thesis is that it would have been very different if it had been a little girl , and that women involved as administrators would have been far less likely to ascribe this to horse play , look the other way , and remain passive after reporting it up the line to superiors a man coming across a heterosexual rape , whether of an adult or a child , would know immediately that this is a terrible crime and would have immediately stopped it it would be clear that the police should be involved i wonder whether the homosexual act , even with a child , arouses feelings in men that actually inhibit action , that make it easier to turn away and rationalize not taking action it is something that is harder to confront , to even think about to the psyche it is perhaps the most forbidden of crimes , worse than incest again , the purpose of this post is to discuss the general principles , not the individual actions at penn state , of this subject what are the psychological factors that inhibit action when evil is encountered ?
