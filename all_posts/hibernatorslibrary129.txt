favorite picture of the week so this week i lost one of my employees this particular employee is a very difficult person to work with , so in that way it was a relief but it also meant that i would have to work every single weekend covering shifts from missing employees instead of every other weekend covering the shifts of only one having just finished an incredibly busy week of emt class and mncosa training while working full time , i realized that there 's no way i 'd pass my emt class if i start working every weekend it 's just too much so i quit i actually quit my job well , in truth , i moved down to part time so i'm helping out every other weekend and on wednesdays until my boss can find someone to replace me and or the missing employees it was a hard choice to make , and a hard phone call to make as i hated dumping so much stress on my poor boss but it was what i needed to do as i said above , the emt class started this week it was nothing new since i 'd already finished about weeks of the class before asking to transfer to this semester but i 've now been cpr certified twice in months i feel a lot more confident this time around since i wo n't have another class and a full time job to distract me do you remember me telling you about how i was going to volunteer for columns , which is a program through the mn department of corrections to help a paroled life termer reintegrate safely into society ? well , instead i ended up in the mncosa program , which works with sex offenders reintegrate safely into society remember , this is n't just about the safety and happiness of the sex offender though that 's partly what it 's about to me , but it is also about helping the sex offender not offend again it 's for those people out there who could potentially be hurt that 's what restorative justice is all about my training , which started on tuesday , will last more weeks so i'm going to be very busy until then with my emt class twice a week and training twice a week and full time job for two more weeks the training so far has been pretty interesting learning about the justice system , about sexual deviancy , and talking to a rape survivor who writes and speaks nationally about his experiences and restorative justice if you 're interested , his name is grant watkins , and his book is called unpinned i'm reading it now posts jane eyre , by charlotte bronte the well of lost plots something rotten , by jasper fforde half the sky , by nicholas d kristof and sheryl wudunn the buried book , by david damrosch currently reading books completed watched nothing ! acquired
