i 've been itching to do this face art for so long ! a few weeks ago i went to see the new pixar film 'inside out' even before i watched it i knew that i was going to do a face art inspired by the character 'sadness' i had n't seen much in the way of trailers for the film usually if i'm waiting to see a film i will scope out every trailer , promo and tv spot to take in as much as i can this time i decided not to spoil it for myself ! i had no idea how amazing it was going to be i loved the concept of there being a control centre inside our brains with different emotions huddled around watching our every move and giving us a nudge in the right direction throughout life of course it is a children 's film , but as always some jokes go over the heads of little ones and hit the adults with a barrel of laughs i love the explanation of how we lose memories , as if it 's as simple as someone pushing over a shelf and letting memories scatter all over the place some get lost forever , whilst others roll under some other shelves to gather dust , they become hazy but we can vaguely recall aspects of the memory 'sadness' as a character was me summed up perfectly quite frequently you can find me splayed out across the bed laying face down with my arms hanging over the edge , just so i can feel even heavier i 'll sigh loudly without realising , and 'no' will become my most frequently used word unlike 'sadness' i am lacking a dark cloud to float around on though , i think i 've earned one from all of the tears i 've cried we ca n't live with one aspect of our personalities dominating our lives nor can we be controlled by one emotion , something which the characters learn in the film although my life might often be in the shade , there has to be a light somewhere to cast that shadow it might sound strange , but i'm grateful that i have experienced so much sadness in my life living with depression allows you to truly cherish the happy moments in life sometimes a sad memory can transform into something good initially we might only remember the joy of that moment , but i can often recall times when something sad enabled me to have a good moment sadness brings people together , it creates a calling for comfort , for safety and familiarity if i suddenly descend into a low mood i usually need to sleep it off or have a good cry others might encourage me to try to hang on , to hold off on that nap or to stick around and see that the situation can get better if i were to follow that advice it 's more likely that i would lose the entire day to feeling low whereas if i embrace the sadness for a while , cry it out or sleep for a few hours i can bounce back later and enjoy what 's left of the day do n't shrug off the sadness , do n't run away from it embrace it so the good in life feels oh so much sweeter
