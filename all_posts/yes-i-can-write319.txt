feeling , at the moment , stressed , angry , sad , lost , dissatisfied like i 've got things half figured out , but i'm not quite sure how to proceed i know that in the long term i want to live in a way that works with the earth , not against it i want to live in a supportive sustainable community , one that respects the rights and autonomy of each individual , as well as respecting the earth in a very real way , not a lonely house in the suburbs , where the primary concern is who 's lawn is greener in the short term , i know i do n't want to go to school full time i also feel i need to find a way to support myself soon , because right now , i'm not earning any money , and i'm starting to feel guilty about living with my parents and not contributing financially i also know that i will not work at a job that i feel is a negative thing for the earth or human community all that is fairly straight forward my problem now becomes , how the fuck am i supposed to do it ? ? when you follow the traditional path , it 's all laid out neatly before you a leads to b leads to c , in an orderly path from high school , to cegep , to university , to a job in your field of study when you 're not following a traditional route , however , it 's much more complicated you have to figure it out on your own and i'm not sure if i'm being too picky , or not looking in the right places , or letting fear get in the way , or some mix of all three , but i'm really having trouble figuring things out vegetarian cooking schools do n't exist in montreal or the surrounding area , and with the education fund thingy i have , they 'll only pay if it 's a registered institution now there 's something my parents are kicking themselves over , so taking any old vegetarian cooking course that simply looks interesting is n't an option the only natural health school in montreal focuses mainly on chinese and ayurvedic medicine , and homeopathy , none of which i have any interest in practicing , since i'm far from convinced of their efficacy if you are , that 's fine i do n't dismiss them out of hand , but to be able to practice a form of medicine , i feel you should have absolute confidence in it i want to learn about herblore , herbal healing , and that 's considerably harder to make matters even more complicated , neither vegetarian cooking nor herbal healing are even my primary passions all they are , are things i'm quite interested in , and do n't think i 'd mind doing for a living my primary passion is learning how people learn unschooling my other main passion is finding out about tribal peoples , and figuring out how people should be living all the things that are wrong with this culture , and all the things we could , and should be doing to live happy , healthy , fulfilled lives ! sadly , i ca n't figure out how to turn either of those things i consider them to be pretty interconnected into a way i could actually support myself , and future family , while living in this culture i feel slightly bad for unloading this on my blog , but i 've been snapping at my mom all morning , and ever since flora died i 've just had no patience for anything or anyone , really , so i just wanted to figure out some of what was bothering me , some of the stuff that 's been on my mind i guess what it really is , is that i feel like time is slipping past summer is nearly over , seemingly almost before it truly began , another year is coming up , and i know i'm not doing as much as i could as much as i want to and the weight of disapproval i feel from almost everyone around me feels incredibly heavy i do n't know what to do for most things i have a few half figured out ideas of some stuff i may want to do i'm afraid of both doing something , and doing nothing blarrgh peace , idzie you might also like reasons i'm glad i grew up unschooling against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of unschooling helped me to remain confident in myself my response to some unschooling questions and concerns linkwithin
