so i was born a gemini it 's been part of my identity , always i'm not much for astrology , and i do n't check my horoscope , but it 's something everyone knows about themselves , and sometimes it 's fun and interestingly enough , gemini fits me to a tee here , see if you agree from ganeshaspeaks com ruled as they are by the planet budha mercury , mithuna gemini exhibit a delicious brand of mercurial energy they are quick thinking , quick witted and fast on their feet it 's their curiousity and cleverness that make them such a hit at cocktail parties but they are not just good talkers they also love to listen and learn however , any social setting is good enough for a mithuna gemini since these folks are charming , congenial , and love to share themselves with their friends mithuna gemini mind drives them to talk , to converse and it is not always just idle chatter they need more and more information to feed their intellectual inclinations they probe endlessly for more information as the more it collects the better they are supremely interested in developing their relationships sharing that knowledge later on with those they love is also a lot of fun mithuna gemini are bright , quick witted and is at the centre stage in any party although rational and practical , they also have a surplus of imagination however the fact that they are unsure which twin will show up half the time they are often considered fickle and restless they can be moody and act on simple whims while their effusiveness may be misconstrued as scheming by some , mithuna gemini generally have their hearts in the right place it is this ample energy , which can also paint them as scatterbrained and unfocused but , behind all that restlessness , they are usually busy filing all that information away funny , brimming with life , full of ideas , adorable , inconsistent , capricious , superficial , they are a bundle of maddening contradictions they may deal in everything and are 'know alls' , but at the same time they also have the ability to master skills mithuna gemini are versatile and have an amazing grasp of the subject they choose , although it may not interest them for long they prize intellect and consider it to be the key to all things at work , they are the clearest of thinkers , suggesting logical and well thought out ideas which make them an asset to any team their greatest strength lies in their ability to communicate effectively and to think clearly adventures of the mind are what the twins are all about bestowed with a cheerful face easily detectable from signs of anxiety , tension or unhappiness the gemini face is a dead give away when they try to hide sorrow behind their brand of wit and humour if even for a short while , romancing a gemini is likely to be interesting , adventurous and fun , but the fickle , almost uncaring attitude will manage to break many hearts before they finally settle down although affectionate mithuna gemini can be extreme flirts , but be sure that the partner shares the mithuna gemini sense of humour mithuna gemini never stray if the family life is satisfying however it is best not to rush headlong into marriage give adequate thought before popping the question so apparently , parke kunkle , some guy in minnesota homeland of clinkshrink , no less decides that it 's all wrong everything is off now i'm a taurus but i'm not a taurus , i'm a gemini they want to stick me and clinkshrink under the same stars ? no way and here are the new dates here are the new zodiac dates capricorn jan feb aquarius feb march pisces march april aries april may taurus may june gemini june july cancer july aug leo aug sept virgo sept oct libra oct nov scorpio nov ophiuchus nov dec sagittarius dec jan have you been blown away , too ? what will this mean in psychiatric practice ? will everyone 's personality change ? will people come to talk about the shift between who they are and who they thought they were ? will they fight back ? i know that i'm staying a gemini
