recovered slightly today from yesterday 's frustration and disappointment my brain is still skipping around but less so feeling a bit less unsettled that 's pretty good considering i had to start my day by driving to a family member 's home a family member who , when we last spoke via e mail , wrote some incredibly derogatory , arrogant , sarcastic , cutting , mean , and most of all , hurtful things it was a tirade so out of the blue , unfair , and out of proportion to the issue at hand that i was absolutely dumbfounded rather than continue down that road with him thank you deb and dbt , i responded by apologizing for my part in the disagreement that was months ago i have n't heard from him since i expect he would be perfectly okay with never contacting me again i certainly do not expect an apology we were n't taught to apologize in my family i do n't think i have ever heard my father apologize , and my mother is only slightly better , although that would come as a shock to her we all have an obsessive need to be right all the time and to know a lot or so we think about everything if it were n't for lots of therapy , dbt , and aa , i 'd still be running around justifying all of the stupid things i 'd done or said , and i 'd butt in on every conversation because without my expert knowledge and opinion the world may come to an end ! ha ! i'm sure my family member was stunned to receive nothing more than an apology from me i'm sure it was n't what he expected , and apparently he did n't know what to do with it i expected he would n't i apologized because i was truly sorry , not because i expected an apology in return i did n't it 's ironic for seven years , i 'd utilized hospitals , therapy , and educational groups in an effort to relieve the symptoms of this debilitating illness along the way , i learned many valuable lessons , life skills , and coping tools i learned how to be a responsible , communicative , respectful , and humble adult i grew i learned to ask for what i needed , listen to others , and apologize when i was wrong i grew a lot ! i learned to be direct i learned to be honest i learned to be nonjudgmental i grew up i'm not perfect i said some things to tick him off again , that 's why i apologized but i am having a very difficult time getting past the hurt on one level , i am sad for him because he has no idea that there is another way to live an easier way , in my experience on another level , i am sad for me , and i miss what little relationship we had and you 're thinking , call him ! be the bigger person ! am i right ? that 's a nice thought however , the swords he pulled were old , yanked from his own unhealed wounds , and viciously misplaced when he aimed them at me the lashing meted out was likewise quicksilver sharp , cutting , and still stinging today perhaps i am not all grown up yet , because i ca n't pretend the bloody scars are n't still visible within that 's probably what he would want , pretend but such a beating i ca n't just forget progress , not perfection i guess there is still work and healing left for me yet
