this post has nothing to do with depression or running i am pissed ! whatever happened to human decency ? when , where , and why did it go ? i know you had none of it when you bashed into my car tonight and apparently drove off without a care ! this post is for you my parents did n't always do the best job , but i was taught if you damage something that does not belong to you , it 's proper to own up to it ! side swiping my car in the parking lot , the small parking lot of the meeting place you just left , and swiping it so severely that the paint is actually gone not just scratched definitely qualifies as damaging property that does not belong to you ! it boggles my mind that you could drive off after that ! yes , there are other offices which share that parking lot , but they were all clearly closed ours were the only illuminated windows in the entire complex ! therefore , it seems very , very likely that you had just walked out the door of the same room we had shared with less than people for minutes ! yet , you thought nothing of driving away ? not even a note ? what is wrong with you ? ! the spot next to me was n't even a parking spot ! so you squeezed in there and then could n't find your way out ? now you 've taken my paint and my momentary sanity without a second thought ? after all , i 'll be the one stuck with the , oh i do n't know , repair bill ! no worries , dude , i 've been meaning to eat less anyway
