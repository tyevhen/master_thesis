oh , so much to talk about , but let me begin by sending you over to clinical psychiatry news to read clinkshrink 's latest article on suicide and sunshine other things we could talk about are the op ed piece in the new york times about how in areas where there are trace amounts of the element lithium in the water , there are lower suicide rates see should we all take a bit of lithium the article suggests further study , and perhaps adding lithium to the water supply before you jump to discuss kidney disease , let 's be clear , these are trace amounts , around the starting dose when used as a pharmaceutical agent my sister in law , meg , was kind enough to inform me that there is a tiny bit of lithium in san pellegrino water , but i'm not sure how that measures up to the amounts that occur naturally in places with lower suicide rates we add fluoride to the water , and iodine to salt , why not lithium to the water ? and , finally , there 's a study linking benzodiazepine use to a higher risk of getting alzheimers' disease , with a specific cut off of pills is what it takes to raise the risk i'm guessing there may be other factors here , but this may be yet one more reason not to use these medications
