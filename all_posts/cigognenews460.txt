allow me to relate one research experiment we did to verify my point it was at the ucla pulmonary laboratory we wired two patients to a number of instruments , oxygen levels , carbon dioxide , and blood samples every minutes while they relived , as it turned out , oxygen deficit at birth , something we had not planned at all neither patient observed the other so we had a rather pure experience on the part of both men after the reliving , we did another experiment where each patient mimicked the primal in every way same movements and breathing except being in the past both almost fainted after or minutes in what was clearly a hyperventilation syndrome clawed hands while in the past feeling they breathed very deeply i call this locomotive breathing because that is what it sounds like and seems to emanate from the brainstem medulla , for about twenty minutes with no hyperventilation what the researchers from the pulmonary laboratory found was that when the patient was back in the old feeling and its context of anoxia at birth the body needed oxygen the patient was back there in every way , not the least of which was physiologically it was evidence of the veracity of reliving that patients can and do go back in time and they not only go back psychologically but in a complete biologic state the corollary to this is that the early need for love stays the same and does not change throughout our lifetime we seek symbolic , substitute fulfillment but it is never fulfilling and compels us to go on seeking more and more , always in vain the critical time when need must be fulfilled has past
