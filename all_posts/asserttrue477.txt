as medical and epidemiological mysteries go , autism is surely among the most shocking and tragic autism has been on the rise for decades , but now it 's reached unbelievable levels in , only one in children in the u s was affected by autism now it 's one child in , making it more common than schizophrenia i'm old enough to remember a day when autism was so uncommon that most people had barely heard of the word or knew what it meant when i was growing up , i never saw an autistic child nor knew of anybody who had one today , autism is known to every pediatrician and every school system in the u s , and sad to say , it 's no longer unusual to know someone or be someone whose family has been touched by it the sheer rate of increase in autism 's prevalence rules out any kind of purely genetic explanation the genes for autism existed before why are they only being expressed at high rates now ? autism is better defined and more diagnosable now than in , but even increased efficiency of diagnosis ca n't explain the sheer magnitude of the rise in autism so if genetics and diagnostic vigilance ca n't explain the rise , what are we left with ? environment , obviously in the s , a theory began to take hold that autism is a rare but obviously not rare enough side effect of the dtp vaccine , which protects children against diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis the dtp vaccine was developed in and its introduction coincides with the beginning of the upswing in autism mothers of autistic children were , of course , the first to notice what was happening predictably , the medical establishment along with their shills in the fda , the us public health service , the national institutes of health , cdc , and the health resources and services administration dismissed the vaccine theory outright and warned the nation that to avoid vaccinating children against such dreaded widespread killer diseases as tetanus , diphtheria , and whooping cough would be a calamity of earth shattering , history ending proportions but then along came the thiomersal controversy which is a controversy in the same sense that lung cancer due to smoking is a controversy and global warming is a controversy thiomersal outside the u s it 's spelled thimerosal is what we used to call , back in the day , merthiolate an eli lilly trade name it was that awful orange colored crap that stung like hell when you put it on your skinned knee after you fell off your red three speed schwinn trying to turn a sharp corner at mph incredibly , the makers of dtp vaccines added this neurotoxic mercury containing poison to their products for the purpose of giving vaccines longer shelf life in , the usphs and aap determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure , despite a joint announcement by these same agencies plus fda that there was and is no connection whatsoever between thiomersal , as used in vaccines , and autism the label clearly says for external use only why then do we allow its use in influenza and dtp vaccines ? with great whining and complaining , vaccine manufacturers began taking their products off the market and or removing the mercury from their dtp formulations today there is one remaining dtp product containing thiomersal its name is tripedia and it 's made by sanofi pasteur , inc sanofi reportedly stopped making the thiomersal laced version of the vaccine as of , but it did n't pull any from shelves , so it 's conceivable that there is still some inventory out there regardless , the current dtap version of tripedia may contain trace amounts mcg of mercury left after postproduction thimerosal removal see footnote to this table if you go to http www fda gov downloads biologicsbloodvaccines vaccines approvedproducts ucm pdf and look at the complete drug description sheet on the tripedia vaccine , you 'll find , buried in the small print , this statement adverse events reported during post approval use of tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , sids , anaphylactic reaction , cellulitis , autism , convulsion grand mal convulsion , encephalopathy , hypotonia , neuropathy , somnolence and apnea sanofi has to my knowledge never published its raw data , so there is no way to know how many children in its study populations developed autism it hardly matters , because eventually the truth came out reports showing a link between thiomersal and autism began appearing in journals like experimental biology and medicine see this study and developmental neurorehabilitation this study in geier and geier 's report in exp biol med june vol no , , we find a remarkable statement we were initially highly skeptical that differences in the concentrations of thimerosal in vaccines would have any effect on the incidence rate of neurodevelopmental disorders after childhood immunization this study presents the first epidemiologic evidence , based upon tens of millions of doses of vaccine administered in the united states , that associates increasing thimerosal from vaccines with neurodevelopmental disorders it 's worse than that , though this top secret internal cdc document tells the results of cdc 's own unpublished study on the link between thiomersal and neurological disorders in children n a very large population of study subjects remarkably , it contains a graph of the dose response curve for thiomersal and autism that 's right the association between thiomersal and autism is not only real , it has a straightforward correlation to dosage as a government agency charged with protecting public safety , you 'd think the centers for disease control would 've immediately blown the whistle on the vaccine makers , or at least called for a halt to thiomersal 's use pending further investigation it did no such thing cdc kept a lid on its internal study and instead published work showing no consistent significant associations between thiomersal and neurodevelopmental outcomes as it happens , the lead author on cdc 's published study , thomas verstraeten , was also the author of the covered up internal study after the public study was published , verstraeten left cdc to work for glaxosmithkline , which makes dtap vaccines pediarix , infanrix , and kenrix , plus the influenza vaccine flulaval , which is known to contain thiomersal details of this unseemly story can be found here interested readers will also want to look into details of the simpsonwood cdc conference meanwhile , some of the earlier research showing no connection between thiomersal and autism has not surprisingly been called into question by the same token , anti thiomersal research by the geiers who as professional expert witnesses have a huge financial stake in this matter has also been called into question but the geiers and cdc are not the only ones to have found a link between thiomersal and autism see this study as well as this article on cdc 's data manipulation efforts also read this article and draw your own conclusions about the objectivity of scientific researchers in this area i should add that by cdc 's own admission , vaccines of all kinds are , to this day , allowed to contain and many do contain egg proteins , aluminum salts , thiomersal present in many flu vaccines , interestingly , formaldehyde , and msg if you were wondering why people get headaches to of the time depending on the vaccine after being vaccinated for something , now you know thiomersal aka thimerosal is this the end of the story ? not really the rise in autism has been so sharp , for so long , that thiomersal alone probably ca n't explain the statistics but we know that infants , because their brains are fast growing and because their blood brain barrier is poorly developed , are far more sensitive to neurotoxins like lead and mercury than older children the notion that any amount of mercury should be allowed in children 's vaccines is outrageous speaking for myself , i would never knowingly give a child of mine a vaccine containing mercury , even if there were no links to autism the fact that there are still doctors out there arguing in favor of putting mercury in vaccines is astonishing see also thimerosal to return to vaccines ? , published feb we should be asking are diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis such serious health hazards that we need to be giving week old babies dtap shots ? six weeks is the accepted starting point for giving the first of several dtap shots some doctors recommend infants get four doses in their first year according to cdc the fourth dose may be administered as early as age months , provided at least months have elapsed since the third dose what can you do if you suspect your child suffered an adverse effect autism or something else following vaccination ? you can file a claim with the vaccine injury compensation program this program exists for the specific purpose of providing compensation to children who 've suffered serious adverse effects from any childhood vaccine the compensation covers medical and related expenses , lost future income , and up to , for pain and suffering the average payout is , , and do n't worry , republicans , it 's fully funded by vaccination customers themselves , who pay an extra cents per vaccine for this protection not that any amount of compensation will give a brain damaged child , or the child 's parents , their lives back so now we know autism might never be totally preventable and thiomersal probably ca n't account for of the fold increase in autism over the past years some of it can be accounted for by psychiatric medications see tomorrow 's post but a good start in preventing autism is to protect your child from heavy metals , especially mercury and especially before the age of four and do your own research on subjects like this the medical industry has shown that it ca n't be trusted further reading autism and vaccines around the world vaccine schedules , autism rates , and under mortality , generation rescue , inc aluminum in vaccines what you should know , the children 's hospital of philadelphia note amazingly , this report says it 's perfectly okay to have mg of aluminum injected into your infant in the first six months of life thimerosal content in some us licensed vaccines updated may note if you found this blog useful , please publicize it via your favorite social or other medium permission is given in advance for you to quote any part of this post at length thank you !
