most genomes that are high in a t content or low in g c content show a surprising dna strand asymmetry the message strand of genes tends to be rich in purines this rule applies across all domains i 've looked at except mitochondria , where message strands tend to be pyrimidine rich rather than purine rich the following two graphs makes this clearer this is a graph of message strand or rna synonymous strand purine content plotted vertically , against a t plotted horizontally , for , bacterial species each dot represents a genome high gc low at organisms like streptomyces and bordetella are on left and low gc high at organisms like clostridium botulinum are toward the right the few dots on the far right are intracellular endosymbionts that have lost a good bit of dna over the millennia they tend to be extremely high in a t compare the above graph with the graph below , which is the same thing message strand a g vs a t for mitochondrial dna n genomes there is still an upward slope to the data and in fact it is steeper than it looks , because the range of y values is different in the graph below than in the graph above the slope of the regression line is very nearly the same vs for both graphs but you can see that in the graph below , nearly all the points are below y that means message strands are high in pyrimidines rather than purines i speculated in a previous post that the reason mitochondrial dna is pyrimidine heavy on the message strand is that mtdna encodes a very small number of proteins , in all , and they tend to be membrane associated proteins , which use mostly non polar amino acids it turns out that codons for the non polar amino acids are pyrimidine rich to see if that 's really what 's going on , i obtained the dna sequences for cytochrome c oxidase and nadh dehydrogenase the two must fundamental enzyme systems of mitochondria from several hundred bacterial species actually , i was able to obtain dna sequences for a total of bacterial nadh dehydrogenase subunit l proteins i also succeeded in obtaining dna sequences for bacterial cytochrome c oxidase subunit proteins in mitochondria , these genes are known as nd and cox in bacteria they 're better known as nuol and cyob the graph below shows a g for the two enzymes versus whole chromosome a t , for the relevant organisms message strand purine content was derived from the dna sequences of cyob pink genes from bacteria , and from nuol blue genes from bacterial species the a g values were plotted against host organism whole genome a t content all cyob and nuol sequences tended to be pyrimidine rich but pyrimidine content was less for organisms with high a t content note the slightly positive slope of the regression line the pink points are for cytochrome c oxidase subunit cyob while the blue points are for nadh dehydrogenase subunit nuol two things are worth noting one is that the regression line is upward sloping , meaning that as an organism 's dna gets richer in a t content , the purine content on the message strand rises this effect seems to be universal the second thing to note is that almost all of the points in the graph lie below y , as is the case for mitochondria these two signature mitochondrial enzyme systems , critical to oxidative phosphorylation in bacteria as well as higher organisms , do tend to use pyrimidine rich codons rendering the relevant genes pyrminidine rich on the rna synonymous message strand of dna the hypothesis is upheld for you bio students , a bit of homework you might want to think about why it is that membrane associated proteins are rich in non polar amino acids in human mitochondria , leucine and isoleucine are the most used amino acids together they account for an amazing of all amino acids used in mtdna encoded gene products hint most membranes have a lipid bilayer , and lipids do n't like water
