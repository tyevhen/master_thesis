things have been busy , busy , busy around here it 's beyond pm , and this is the first chance i 've had to sit and write today work has been keeping me very busy errands seem to be multiplying i get one thing accomplished and another pops up i'm keeping up with my aa meetings , at least two per week friends and co workers have had several recent birthday outings and going away parties , including one tonight jet requires several hours of attention per day , and of course , there 's running or weight lifting almost daily but i am not complaining ! i'm not perturbed , even though there was a time when such bustling would have totally overwhelmed me i'm not overwhelmed today i do generally prefer a bit more quiet than i 've had these last few days , but so far i'm finding the energy , stamina , and attitude to keep going i'm keeping up , and i'm maintaining my mood while doing it i'm grateful for that having said that , i'm not long on words tonight i 've still got to make my lunch and find some clothes for work tomorrow i have to pack my gym gear , as i have kettlebell class right after work and i need to gather my aa materials , as my sponsor and i are scheduled to meet after kettlebell class before saying my prayers and closing my eyes tonight , i also need to give jet a little time he was in his kennel for much of the day , although right now he is outside chasing moths around the backyard he makes me laugh ! lots to do , and grateful for the opportunities it all represents goodnight , my friends
