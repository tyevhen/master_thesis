it 's my birthday today i am years old it 's hard to believe i remember when i thought was old ! i 'd go back to in a heartbeat , but only if i could have the life skills and knowledge i have today with me otherwise , forget about it ! those were some tough early years of depression and drinking today i am smarter , sober , and living with this devastating illness up until a couple of days ago , i would have said life is good but today , life still feels heavy and sad my house is so empty , and i feel so alone on this birthday i miss puck so much typically , i 'd have slid out of bed a couple of hours ago to a wagging tail and a smiling , expectant face how could i not smile ? today , my radio blared the npr news for over an hour before i could finally throw off the covers to face the day it was n't until several minutes later that i even remembered it was my birthday not exactly an auspicious beginning i 've already been on facebook , where the birthday wishes with their shiny words and exclamation points almost feel cruel these are the same facebook friends who comforted me with beautiful thoughts and prayers just a couple days ago i know they mean well , and i'm glad for their kind wishes for a good day , but the hurt is still too big a good day , a happy day , feels very far away i lit a candle for puck last night there are a few pet loss web sites out there , and through them i learned of a worldwide , monday night candle lighting ceremony for lost pets at the designated time , i lit my candle for puck i caressed the lock of hair i had cut from his tail before he died i talked to my boy i cried did it help ? i do n't know but i think i 'll do it again next week , anyway as i told my psychologist yesterday , i 'd give anything , and everything , to have just one more day with my boy one more walk one more tail wag one more smile one more moment to kiss him , caress him , and hold him tight i love you , buddy i wish you were here for the beginning of my th year together , we would have a very happy birthday
