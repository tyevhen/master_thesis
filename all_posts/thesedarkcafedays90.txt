i 've noticed a common symptom that arises whenever i have a spell of depression is that i become extremely critical of myself i start to hate myself consider myself worthless , a blight on humanity , stupid , untalented , etc i feel like no one likes me and i just annoy my friends i feel abandoned by my friends even if i normally do like who i am and feel pretty confident in myself , depression leads me to tear myself apart lately , i 've been feeling that way again and i had mostly been able to move past my disappointment in the way most of my friends did little to support me while i was at school and then ignored me once i left school , i 've been fixating on it again i look at my friends leading their lives without ever trying to include me in them any more and think , gee , they are probably a lot happier without me they 're probably glad i'm gone i was just a burden anyways with all my emotional baggage the burden of these heavy emotions is too much to bear for me when they come around i ca n't shake them and move on , but i ca n't resolve them either i ca n't confirm that i have value , and i ca n't do anything to address the hurt people have caused me i ca n't gain any closure i feel voiceless i want to go on facebook and write a nasty post telling them all off and saying what a bunch of loser friends they all are , but i'm sure the consequences of that would n't be worth the meager rewards when i wrote a post for the mighty about my friends leaving me alone in my fight with depression it 's somewhere on this blog here , everyone on fb ignored it and why should n't they ? who wants to acknowledge that they were an awful friend ? anyways , it 's hard to deal with these emotions that 's why for a while i tried turning my hand against myself but it 's so emotionally draining and sad to think of i do n't think i will go back to that
