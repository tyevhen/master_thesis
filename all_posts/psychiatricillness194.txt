today i suddenly understood why so many people do n't like change my boss told me a colleague was returning from maternity leave in november things have been going so well since she left , i have taken on loads more responsibility and i now love my job when i was working with her i felt very stiffled and held back career wise as i had to do as she asked i now have my own studies and have built good relationships with our customers and i am really enjoying work i felt really worried after he told me and my mind went quite blank i stared at the screen for about minutes , the idea of the change really worried me and frightened me in the past i have always always been excited by change and looked at things as a bit of an adventure i never really understood peoples fear of change i think you have to be happy with what you have to fear change ! i think this is one reason why i have never connected with people in the past on the way home from work i kind of realised i have never been this happy before although a part of me hates being on my own so much i feel i have more to loose now than i have ever had in the past i did not feel sorry for myself or sad but i felt really tired like i was about to fall asleep and i had no energy ! ! i just felt like i wanted to go to sleep
