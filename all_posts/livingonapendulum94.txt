so here we are , december , this year is almost over , and again i find myself wondering if the new year will bring something better than the year that is ending i have been wishing and hoping that same wish for many years now , and each year has been a huge disappointment of course each year has just enough positive in it to prevent it from being a complete waste what were the positives of the year do you say ? well lets see all of us are still alive they finally gave my son a name to what ails him again but no help or treatment on the horizon i still have a job the same one i have not been appreciating for a while , but i saw something worst , so i guess it 's good i was able to buy my house the purchase is final in , so id this really a thing ? i have some good friends oh i give up , it would be so much easier to start listing all the bad things so here we go , wishing is an improvement , hope the new house without mold will help my health hope the high new tub will help relax my muscles hope the new stove works better hope that even though the money will get much tighter too tight actually that we will still be able to make it without loosing anything like the car hope the move goes better than things are looking now not packed enough , furniture not ready to go you might also like do you believe in ghosts ? another dream reached what 's new ? linkwithin
