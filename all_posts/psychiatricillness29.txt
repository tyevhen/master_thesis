i am still seeing my r , he is still gorgeous and perfect in every way he is very supportive of me and encourages me to get out more and walk and stuff my mr r left my flat this morning before work and i will not see him again until sunday as i am going to visit my parents for a few days i have seen the nhs psychiatrist and she basically she noted my history , reassured me i would be able to see her when i needed to and discharged me into the care of my gp i feel much better these day anyway so i just hope it continues to last i baked my mum a birthday cake yestrday , i need to get a cake tin on the way home from work so i can transport it it is a sponge cake with jam and butter icing it has cherries and jelli diamonds on top i better get back to doing some work , although i am struggling lots today but in general i like the job and have passed my probation period oh yes , one more thing , i think i have stopped putting weight on , i just need to loose some now to get back to where i was
