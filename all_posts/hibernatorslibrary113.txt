among murderers life after prison written by sabine heinlein narrated by cassandra campbell in among murderers , heinlein follows three convicted murders in the years immediately after their release the blurb describes it as what is it like for a convicted murderer who has spent decades behind bars to suddenly find himself released into a world he barely recognizes ? what is it like to start over from nothing ? to answer these questions sabine heinlein followed the everyday lives and emotional struggles of angel ramos and his friends bruce and adam three men convicted of some of society 's most heinous crimes as they return to the free world however , this is n't only a book about the difficulties of reintegrating like finding a job , finding a home , dating , and figuring out how to live in a world that has matured years while you were locked away it is mainly comprised of doing research into the murderers' backgrounds in order to give an adequate description of their crimes , who they were , who they have become , and what factors have influenced their lives this gives the book a personal flavor it encourages compassion and understanding for the three men and their troubles , without totally discouraging your caution in dealing with such men i'm going to soon be volunteering with people recently paroled , helping them to reintegrate and to reduce their chance of recidivism i thought this book would be helpful and interesting although it spent a little less time focusing on current troubles of the three men , this book was incredibly helpful
