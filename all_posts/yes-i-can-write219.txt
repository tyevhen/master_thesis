something i have heard oh so many times is that , because as teenagers and young adults our brains are not fully developed , we are bad decision makers , and not to be trusted it 's a very frustrating attitude , that really seems to twist scientific data to suite anti teen feelings in our culture what constitutes bad decision making , anyway ? that 's a very subjective opinion when i found this post a while back , i simply loved it it deals with just that subject , and does so in such a wonderfully positive , pro people way it reads in part though teen brains may indeed not possess myelin sheaths that adults brains have , that doesn t make them 'unfinished' , in the sense that the article portrays foolish , flawed , poor decision makers without teen s 'unfinished' brains of the risk taking done in the name of love , art , idealism , adventure , protecting family , would disappear teens excel at taking risks because they have perfectly developed brains for doing so saying they have unfinished brains compares to saying a new moon hasn t 'finished' until it swells to a full moon the teen brain marks one moment in the cycle of the brains life where it has enormous potential for one kind of behavior risk taking , adventure , romantic expression i urge you to read the whole post it 's not very long personally , i just loved it , and will send it straight to the next person who seeks to silence and dis empower a teen by telling them of their faulty brains ! peace , idzie you might also like teenage rebellion an unschooling , respectfully parented unschooling and trust in the adolescent years teenage occasionally sunday means links unschooling is forever part the teenage years linkwithin
