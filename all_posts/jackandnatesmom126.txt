we all have them , our early childhood memories my first memory involves getting lost in a post office and finally grabbing onto what i thought were my mom 's legs instead they belonged to a really tall man ack ! ! ! jack will bring things up some times and it just astounds me the detail with which he remembers some things i am talking about stuff from when he was about months old a few months ago , he asked me if i remembered the time i let him cry and cry in his crib and he dropped his favorite plane and could n't reach it this must have been one of those times i was trying to ahem , transition him to his crib so wanting to test if this was really a memory or just my dramatic child 's imagination , i asked him to describe the plane he looked at me like i was a moron and told me that it was the blue one with the green propeller and red bolt well duh yes dear , i do remember that one we still have it , and he still plays with it today he took his memory to a whole new level of detail recently his daddy ordered him a sopwith camel airplane , as he is back to world war i right now when it came , i looked at john and reminded him that i still had ptsd from the last sopwith camel that he gave him for his rd birthday and that this was the exact same one why do you ask would i have ptsd over a toy plane ? all i can say is this it was bad the plane , you see , is diecast metal , but it has many fragile wires and plastic pieces , that make it not suitable for a small child to play with unfortunately , our son does not have the typical interests of a small child , ie , there are no toy sopwith camels out there that plane broke for the first time about minutes after daddy left for work i superglued it while jack was at preschool , but it broke no fewer than more times that day every single instance was of course accompanied by a massive meltdown the day was absolutely tortuous , and after a certain point , there 's only so much that superglue can do , you know ? well , this morning , after days , the first major piece broke off of his new sopwith camel at least now he has the words to say , glue it mommy instead of just screaming , but it was still a borderline meltdown on the way home from camp today , jack asked me if i remembered his bee birthday he was referring to the fact that i made bumblebee and beehive cookies for his school friends on his rd birthday this was his second area of interest to planes at that time i said yes , why ? he came back with remember how i had that other sopwith camel and every single piece broke off and you called it crap ? i was really sad but now i have a new one , and this one belonged to mr yimsiri watana only john will get that one i guess i shouldnt' be so surprised that he remembered this , as it surely caused him a lot of stress , but still he was only three , and so many other things happened around then , including an awesome airplane birthday party i did so many things to distract him and i thought i succeeded in helping him forget about this incident but here we are , and a half years later and he brought it up without me saying a word i think this is pretty remarkable kids really are little sponges also , it 's a good reminder watch what you say and do people seriously , i said crap when he was three and he brought it up today i am soooo screwed
