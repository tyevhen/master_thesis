regular readers of my blog know that i have practicing dr low s teachings to help me overcome fear of flying recently i had a four hour trip to phoenix and another on the way back i am endorsing for using recovery tools to help me through the experience among those i found particularly useful when booking my flight i chose an aisle , instead of a window , seat when things get bumpy i have a tendency to look out the window , which i think is a fear reinforcing behavior therefore , to better control my muscles i chose a seat away from the window during takeoff , when things are a bit bumpy , i kept repeating to myself , feelings are not facts just because i felt something was wrong and was worried the plane was in trouble did not mean that was reality in fact , quite the opposite i ignored my body sensations sweaty palms , racing heart , etc for the first few minutes into the flight , this was my mantra i focused on reading a graduate school textbook for most of the flight , forcing myself to focus on something objective this way i ignored a lot of the little bumps that are average during any flight when the plane encountered some mild turbulence , i returned to my mantra of feelings are not facts at these times i could not focus on reading i excused myself for that upon landing i gave myself a hearty endorsement in fact , i m still endorsing i am not endorsing because i wasn t nervous i m endorsing because i practiced recovery teachings and am making my mental health a business before recovery , the flight would have been a lot more uncomfortable i have more flights coming up , but i m not dreading them as much as i used to recovery is helping me with everyday , average experiences such as flying
