what a way to start may i ran a pr in a k race today i averaged per mile and finished in it was a small field , but i was the seventh woman overall and third in my age group the was quite a nice surprise i really had no idea what to expect today the race was miles long , and i had n't run more than miles since early december i did n't know how triathlon training , including only running days per week , would translate in a distance race i guess i must be doing something right , because even with this extra weight i'm carrying around , i was still able to run relatively fast last year , i finished this same race in , like i said , a pr was a nice surprise now i'm trying to figure out how to fit in the rest of the weekend 's work between tonight and tomorrow i need to swim a minute interval workout , bike minutes , mow my lawn , attend softball practice , and prepare for this week 's patients i'm feeling just a bit overwhelmed ! could i have another weekend day , please ? after the race today , i came home and demolished the one remaining wall and section of ceiling in my basement that was a little tougher than i had anticipated , but i got all the plaster , sheetrock , and wood out and to the dump my basement is now totally ready to be re finished , a process that will hopefully start within the next few weeks i'm a bit alarmed at how much it 's going to cost , but i'm tired of being without my exercise rec room and additional bathroom down there my basement flooded years ago , and i had to demolish and remove everything secondary to mold it 'll be nice to have a whole house again with tomorrow 's busy ness looming , i think i 'll sign off for now i may try to get my biking in tonight , but i think i 'll just use my stationary bike rather than going outside i do n't think my tired legs will handle hills very well tonight or tomorrow of course , i may choose to sit and watch law and order re runs instead ! have a great evening success means doing the best we can with what we have success is the doing , not the getting in the trying , not the triumph success is a personal standard , reaching for the highest that is in us , becoming all that we can be zig ziglar
