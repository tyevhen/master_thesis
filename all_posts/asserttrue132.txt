goldman sachs aka golden sacks produced a rather interesting little graph , which i learned about by way of the economy has slowed because the fed has already tightened blogs wsj com the key intuition here is that the economy is behaving as if money has tightened note the upward trending blue line at the far right , when in fact the fed has n't acted yet certainly , it feels true enough many money pundits have noted that the low oil price pass through to consumers has n't really shown up in economic indicators the economy is acting as if money has tightened already i do n't pretend to know what 's going on here that 's for professional economists , but it does seem we 've entered a quasi orwellian phase in which of the fed 's effectiveness now can be traced to rhetoric rather than action the only thing fomc members have to do is speak , and the economy responds expectations become self fulfilling for example , according to bloomberg , the more investors believe the central bank will soon raise rates , the more the dollar appreciates , and in turn , the more inflation will fall short of the fed s goal from a story at thecrux com appreciation of the dollar , versus other currencies is likely to persist as long as u s monetary policy is expected to diverge from that of other major economies , said carl riccadonna , bloomberg intelligence chief u s economist how convenient is that ? if expectation drives reality , the fed need n't sully itself any longer with actual interventions it can just manage perceptions so far , that 's been working well enough i want to thank the following great folks who retweeted me yesterday on twitter my advice ? follow these guys they retweet ! have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
