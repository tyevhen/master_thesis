dear little p , i cannot believe the time has flown so quickly and you are already months old ! it still feels like you were born yesterday still , i know i will probably always feel that way this month was n't vastly different from your fourth month the difference is , you are bigger , stronger , and longer you 've gotten so much better at using your hands to play with the toys on your jumperoo and you have found your feet you love to try and eat your toes and you are constantly rolling around gripping your heels your new favorite activity ! and your voice oh your voice ! you 've been experimenting with shrieking both loudly and softly and in very shrill high pitches and lower ones you 're our little opera singer ! you have n't broken a wine glass yet , but you are on your way ! i had to take a break in writing this letter to you just now our cable guy has come to install hd tv ! we are very excited your daddy especially but don t think i m going to just let you watch anything anymore ! while waiting for him to run out to the truck , i gave you a big kiss on the cheek as usual only this time , you turned around and gave me a return kiss back on my cheek ! we went back and forth like this for several kisses in a row as you laughed and smiled of course , your version of a kiss is a wet , open mouthed press into my skin but it was perfect , wonderful , and amazing ! my first kiss from you ! see ? you discover new things every day and i get to come along for the ride and for that , i m so eternally grateful and ever so lucky i ll never understand what i did to deserve you , but i ll spend my life trying to live up to it i m so proud of you love you always and forever , mama save
