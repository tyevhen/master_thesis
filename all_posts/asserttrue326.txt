thomas mccarthy 's offbeat , low budget under , drama , the station agent , is a bit of an enigma the film won numerous awards critics and judges lavished praise on it , of people on rottentomatoes com liked it average rating , and yet i did n't find it to be all that magical i give it three stars , tops does it exude charm ? most definitely are the performances good ? hell yes , they 're better than good so is the cinematography but somehow , long portions of the movie seemed to drag the funny parts were n't laugh out loud funny the plot was threadbare my thoughts wandered as i watched i wanted to come away laughing or crying or moved in some way but it 's not that kind of story what kind of story is it ? the logline is suitably quirky two loners joe and olivia try to befriend an antisocial dwarf finbar mcbride , sensitively played by peter dinklage who has inherited an abandoned train station in newfoundland , new jersey joe , olivia , and fin watch a movie in the station agent bitter and reclusive , tired of living the wee life in a world of big people , four foot five inch finbar moves into the ramshackle station , making it his own special locomotive geek bachelor pad but he ca n't get away from the young cuban american man , joe played by bobby cannavale , who operates a hot dog truck near the abandoned station we 're never told how it is a person can make a living operating a lunch truck at an abandoned station where no train ever stops while walking to town , finbar almost gets struck by a swerving jeep he thus meets olivia harris played by patricia clarkson , a thirty something woman who lost her only child in a playground accident two years ago and is now separated from her husband for a while , it seems as if fin and olivia will hit it off and become an item , but they never do instead , she wants to reconcile with her husband but finds out much later that he 's already impregnated his girlfriend fin also meets a young librarian , and has a tender moment with her but alas , she 's pregnant by her redneck boyfriend , and she goes back to him or disappears from the film , at least there 's a bit of bonding between fin and joe , but frankly the joe character is mostly an irritation to fin and the moviegoer and only barely attains true friend status at the end of the story he 's good natured you want to like him but he 's extraordinarily immature for a grown man he makes the characters in saturday night fever seem complex , multidimensional what the movie needs is a good train wreck , whether kinetic i e , literal or metaphorical i 'd take either joe 's life is mysteriously thin he 's as complex , emotionally , as a year old boy apparently he has no college loans to pay , no wife or child to feed , nothing to do with his time but hang out at the station all day olivia 's life is full of pathos , but it 's latent , rarely overt who are these people ? where are the raging crises in their lives ? olivia lost her son two full years ago it 's in the past her husband is not the kind of husband any sane woman would want to reconcile with where 's the tension ? there is n't any i'm sorry the main character 's arc takes him from bitter and antisocial to less bitter and quasi social but still without a love life that 's hardly a satisfying journey how to fix this mess ? first , make all three main characters' lives train wrecks not only that , actually have joe hang his head at one point and call his life a train wreck so that fin the locomotive history uber nerd and consummate train lover can say please do n't ever say that in my presence joe what ? what 'd i say ? you mean train wreck ? ? fin please it 's repugnant joe whose first language is spanish gives a no comprende shrug re pug nant it means repulsive extremely distressing this sets up train wreck as a metaphor that can be used throughout the movie , while also potentially setting up a funny moment some time later on , when olivia can slip train wreck into conversation innocently , whereupon both joe and fin stare at her and simultaneously say do n't ever say that then joe , on his own it 's repugnant writer director mccarthy took pains to show a scene in which the local store cashier owner whips her cell phone out to take a picture of fin while he 's walking around in the store because apparently , this year old woman has never seen a dwarf before , in her entire life okay , we get it , people treat dwarves like freaks unfortunately , mccarthy misses a great opportunity to lend resonance to the store scene later on , when fin , in a drunken rage , stands on a bar stool in a crowded saloon and yells at people to go ahead , look at me what he should , of course , have done is yell get your camera out , okay ? take a goddam picture at first , no one moves , but fin in my rewrite if i were script doctoring this thing shames the crowd into actually getting their cell phones out he forces them to take actual pictures of him that 's not all bear in mind , there 's a hugely important redemption scene near the end of the movie when fin , glad to be alive after a near death experience , finds the nerve to stand in front of an elementary school class one kid asks how tall he is to give a talk about trains the barroom scene could have given the classroom scene a bit of much needed resonance if it the bar scene had ended with fin duly photographed by the shamed saloon crowd stepping down from the bar stool and saying angrily , of course thank you class dismissed as he storms out of the bar later on , during the classroom scene , we could have fin allow a local newspaper reporter newspapers being a symbol , incidentally , for well past their glory days th century technology , like trains to take a picture of him with kids gathered around him the next day , joe , olivia , and fin or any combination of two of them could be looking at the picture in the morning paper , commenting positively on it , etc note the camera is a potentially powerful metaphor in any movie it 's the physical incarnation of voyeurism which in turn is a powerful motif in cinema fin 's closeness with olivia could have been better exploited they could have cuddled rubbed faces , on the bed , fully clothed then cut to an outdoor scene continuous , night looking at the bedroom window from outside we see the light go out suggesting that more may have then happened on the bed but we fade to a morning indoor scene where we see the two spooning , still fully clothed , atop the still undisturbed bed , fin looking like a pearl inside an oyster with olivia holding him from behind i can think of a lot of seemingly little but potentially important in the aggregate fluorishes that would have made us care more about the characters without resorting to the cheap tactic of making them have sex with each other quite possibly making for a more satisfying for me , anyway film experience with a little work , the station agent could have been even better than it is already that 's not to take credit away from thomas mccarthy , however few people these days can shoot an award winning , highly profitable well over million gross drama for under half a million dollars that 's magic of a pretty high order far be it for me to suggest otherwise
