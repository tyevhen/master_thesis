aubade we like to make love in the morning not because of the light but because my medication levels are lower before the morning dosage since el nino our frequency has increased i do n't claim dawn s light renders us sexier , just less repulsive at night we use candles for the same flattering effect candles can be as forgiving as a good marriage i have a belly and you use powder to keep your thighs from chafing when did we go soft ? the sun is cruel to remind us of our sin against california where youth is beauty and beauty youth that is all you know out here and all you need to know pubished in savoy again , though melancholy , this poem shows progress in depression the speaker is thinking about sex and marriage , even if his take is somewhat depressing , since he ca n't help judging himself by the standards of youth and advertising an aubade is a morning song last night i was surfing the net , looking for ms contests for poetry one publisher required a purchase from their catalogue as the price for entry in perusing their titles , i noticed a former winner was my student of two years ago , whose chapbook , which i assume from the reviews formed the basis for her book , i extensively edited i was given no credit , naturally , nor did she ever write me about her success , about which i am always glad to hear from former students in my judgment she was not ready for publication of a book , although she was rather determined about it anyway , the publisher listed who the judge of the next contest would be that 's always the most important thing in these contests , which i have rarely entered and never won i went to look at his verse on the web and found it prolix and sophomorish as i whined to my wife and editor , kathleen , she gave me no comfort you ca n't have it both ways , she said either you give the poetry world credit and play the game their way , or you resign from it , as i did years ago i hated this either or option , although her logic seems unassailable if i do not respect the judgment of contemporary poetry , i have no right to complain if i have not been mainstreamed into it i do not suffer fools gladly i was blackballed in la when i publicly derided the quality of poets at all the popular coffeehouse venues the world of poetry is small , and never is heard a discouraging word you ca n't say anything critical about anyone else or you will be kicked out of the club there is so much cronyism it is no better than hollywood even the pulitzer committee does n't know what good poetry is anymore , why they usually make safe choices of poets who already have a reputation i tend to bite the hand that feeds me if the nails are n't clean but i love poetry and i believe in mine trouble is , i have very few connections academic or otherwise , and there is no one i can go to and say , give this manuscript a fair reading , wo n't you ? more and more i'm tempted to self publish , since of titles in the u s are self published anyway but all the gladhanding at major bookstores , where i would have to promote my work , and the required networking with no talent powers that be the whole scene makes me reluctant to set forth so i sit here paralyzed , with a blog where i post my poetry at present , unable to embrace the larger world of self congratulatory published wannabes , but unable to give up the dream of poetry i should swallow my pride and jump through whatever hoops i need to jump through unfortunately , when i used to be a featured reader in la , i always had a bad feeling in my gut about the performances and when i quit the game i felt a great relief here 's the link to my column on that experience tempted to television my other column , karaokepoetry , has been de published as kathleen said , you have no right to feel sorry for yourself but i ca n't accept that i have only an either or choice here there is cynical participation , and there is rebellious participation , as in william logan 's case , but even rebellion requires an authority , and if i do n't credit that authority , what is the basis for rebellion ? as to my mood , i'm still stuck in a lingering depression i 'll try to address that tomorrow thanks for reading , ce
