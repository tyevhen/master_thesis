this past weekend i attended a day photography workshop i picked this particular workshop because it was n't too far away from where i lived i paid for it over a month in advance and i was really looking forward to it i knew when i paid i would cross my fingers that my hubby would be in town to watch the little one , but that he could possibly be gone as well sure enough , the day before the workshop he had to fly out of town last minute for the entire weekend it made things complicated which was what i wanted to avoid we were scrambling to find babysitters for both nights but we managed to do it now i had to drop her off on my way there with dinner and a nap in her as opposed to just leaving her with her dad day one i ended up arriving minutes late the first day , a bit frazzled from my circus routine in getting there the instructor made sure to point it out to the class which left me a little uncomfortable right from the start he was poking fun at how unprofessional i was to arrive late and how real photographers are always early i wanted to sock him for not realizing the hoops i was jumping through to even be there , minutes late or not the first day was classroom instruction the second day was an actual photo shoot of two models and a motorcycle , but the location was undisclosed until we were at the workshop when he announced the photoshoot was minutes away , i was again annoyed that added two more babysitting hours onto the next day , and it meant i had to drive on two unfamiliar highways to get to a random overpass driving to unfamiliar places , especially when there are highways involved make me very nervous day two the next day i left much earlier so that i could have plenty of getting lost and freaking out time if i needed it on the way there i thought to myself , i am actually paying someone to torture me like this i put myself in this uncomfortable situation , and its a good thing to do , but i still paid an arm and a leg for it in the end i was so proud of myself i found the location in one piece and i got there early anyone that gets nervous driving knows that after a drive like that you are still a little on edge as i was setting up i asked the instructor a question i do n't remember the question , and i do n't remember his answer except for when he told me i should just relax ! he said that several times to me over the two day course i must have come across to him as a really uptight person that 's not who i want to be however this workshop was a stressful thing for me to do and again his judgmental , transparent comments left me annoyed anyone with anxiety knows that if we could just relax we would in a heartbeat its not easy for us to calm our nerves , slow our pounding heart , and fully enjoy everything i had a stressful but growth filled weekend i learned that even if i do n't like someone 's personality , i can still learn from them i learned that i can do hard things , all by myself and i bet you can too if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email this post was originally posted on aimee 's other anxiety blog , the nitty gritty of anxiety at healthyplace com
