i had a situation recently where i was asked out to lunch very last minute this is something that i don t want to stop happening because i love to hang out with my friends and family however because of the timing , i was unable to really prepare myself for any panic that could arise i told myself on the drive over a few things i thought might help , but i was already a little flustered as i was waiting to meet my friends , i could feel the anxiety come and felt immediately nauseous it has been so long since i had felt this high of anxiety that i wasn t sure what to do at first i thought , i need to get distracted so i went into a store and looked at jewelry that i wouldn t mind owning when i peeked out i saw they were there we decided where to eat and as i was ordering the food i thought i am going to throw up right here in line i wasn t even hungry because i had eaten a late breakfast this makes sense because that is a perfect trigger scenario for me had i been starving i doubt there would have been an issue at all , but when i feel like i have to perform and i don t think i can , that s when i panic so i ordered a light lunch knowing i probably wouldn t be able to eat any of it we sat down and i snacked on a bag of chips and a drink never touched my sandwich i left it in the to go bag i tried to focus on the conversation at hand and a few times i could feel myself lingering on panicky thoughts so i refocused on the conversation i kept thinking of what i would say if they asked me why i wasn t eating when it briefly came up , i mentioned i wasn t feeling well and left it at that after all it was the truth so what did i learn ? if you don t have time to prepare for a potential trigger situation , then do whatever makes you feel the most comfortable i could have force fed myself the sandwich but then i really think i would have been sick i decided to listen to my body and save the food for when i felt hungry sure enough two hours later i was pretty starving and had a yummy sandwich waiting for me in the fridge we are not perfect i don t think i will ever be cured i don t know if i will ever master my panic attacks i do n't always have hours beforehand to fully prepare myself for events but the best i can do is manage them as best i can but when we don t have time to even manage them , then the next best thing is to be yourself and not what you think others think you should be , love yourself for it , and do what feels the most comfortable while still facing your fears my fear is what people will think of me if i don t perform the way i think i should , specifically around food the most comfortable thing would have been to not go at all and catch a movie with them later on or something not food related but i went , survived , and best of all , got to see my loved ones and that s a small step in the right direction positive affirmation of the day i can take as small a step forward as i choose if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like prevent panic have a game plan level panic today what to do when feeling overwhelmed morning anxiety linkwithin
