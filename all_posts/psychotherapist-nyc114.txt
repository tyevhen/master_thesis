's degree he encouraged her to get her master 's degree if she wanted to be considered for managerial position needless to say , nina was disappointed nina looked into various master 's programs that had evening programs because she could n't afford to stop working she hesitated , at first , because she saw how daunting it would be to work full time and attend a master 's program at night but she also knew that , whether she stayed with her current employer or left for another job , her lack of a master 's degree would be an obstacle for her so , she applied to a master 's program , took out loans , and resigned herself to having very long days and weekends filled with work she was surprised to discover that , even though it was a tremendous amount of work and a financial sacrifice , she really liked her professors , her course work and her classmates during the time when she was working full time and attending the evening master 's program , she had to turn down many social invitations because she did n't have the time to socialize it was lonely she also wondered if the debt she was incurring would be worth it in the long run there were times when she considered giving up and being satisfied with where she was in her career , but she knew she would n't be satisfied for long , so she persevered increasing your self confidence and resilience by challenging yourself by the time she received her degree , another managerial position opened up , and her director offered her the job he also met with her to talk about her career path at the company and other possible promotions if she did well in the new managerial position looking back on the experience , nina knew that she gave up a lot in terms of socializing , getting enough rest and taking on student loans
