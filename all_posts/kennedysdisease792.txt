in recent years i have reported several times about crispr and gene editing i am not a scientist , but , to a layman , this sounds like the best possibility for curing kennedy 's disease in the article referenced below , it discusses the potential benefits and possible dangers of gene editing there is much more research that needs to be done , but the possibility of a cure is now closer than ever before us scientists try st gene editing in the body this time , the gene tinkering is happening in a precise way inside the body it s like sending a mini surgeon along to place the new gene in exactly the right location we cut your dna , open it up , insert a gene , stitch it back up invisible mending , said dr sandy macrae , president of sangamo therapeutics , the california company testing this for two metabolic diseases and hemophilia it becomes part of your dna and is there for the rest of your life that also means there s no going back , no way to erase any mistakes the editing might cause you re really toying with mother nature and the risks can t be fully known , but the studies should move forward because these are incurable diseases , said one independent expert , dr eric topol of the scripps translational science institute in san diego protections are in place to help ensure safety , and animal tests were very encouraging , said dr howard kaufman , a boston scientist on the national institutes of health panel that approved the studies he said gene editing s promise is too great to ignore so far there s been no evidence that this is going to be dangerous , he said now is not the time to get scared a short apnews animation video does a good job of explaining the process ap animation marshall ritzel
