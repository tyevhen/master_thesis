here 's a new poem which is also a song song i am the eyes in the ash of the slats of the fence that borders the meadow my eyes migrate to the top of my head like contacts for a flounder fishy , you say ? i cannot deny that the stench of dead flounder can poison the sky rocks do n't talk but neither does god in any language we understand the nape of my neck will not protect my cervical spine from cancer fishy , you say ? i cannot deny that a language of cancer might poison the sky a sheba inu 's butt is white but so is that of the roosevelt elk but first an implantation in your ear for better reception fishy , you say ? i cannot deny that the flounder 's a fish you mistake for a pie for the song go to soundclick and click on flounders enjoy or not , craig erick
