i keep waiting for an epiphany to fall in my lap , bright , shiny , and easy to understand but i know that 's not the way to find epiphanies instead , my epiphany might smell like woodsmoke , or sweat , or autumn maybe it 'll sound like rain on a tin roof , or crickets chirping , or laughter perhaps it 'll look like fresh turned earth , rich and brown , or spray paint on a wall , or the flash of a raccoon 's eyes at night , bright , inquisitive , and utterly wild i do n't know when i 'll find it i guess i 'll have to wait and see but i know i ca n't wait passively as much as i try and avoid knowing so , evade the question , delude myself , i know that if i want to figure life out , i need to stretch myself , to grow , to reach out to walk new paths and meet new people and the thought of doing so scares me shitless so i make excuses that are half true , procrastinate , and wait for bright shiny epiphanies to fall in my lap if i believed in god , as such , i 'd pray for strength as it is , i know that i have the strength , i just need to do it to let go of so much piled up fear , and uncertainty , and self doubt , and a million other emotions i can do it i know i can actually doing anything , on the other hand , is considerably harder god , the divine , the universe , the great mother , and anyone else who 's listening , give me strength peace , idzie you might also like making transitions and following passions against the current talk from the toronto unschooling trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! new bio , updated about me page linkwithin
