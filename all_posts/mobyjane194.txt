there are three more questions that i wanted to answer from the letter in the last post if someone asked you in less than one minute explain to me the best you can what depression is and why you think it is choice , what would you say ? answer depression is a neural pattern habit of despair and hopelessness that triggers off suddenly or when the fight or flight response is triggered by downer thinking there is a chemical consequence in the brain for every thought one thinks the depressive neural pattern will be stronger and more compelling the longer one stays in depressive behavior thinking about how depressed you are , concentrating on how bad you feel , withdrawing from interacting with people , talking in a sad , weak voice , and withdrawing from physical or mental activity that might lead to more positive thinking and therefore more positive emotions the choice concerns one s behavior when depression hits you can get busy with exercise , work , entertainment or interacting with others to distract yourself from your painful feelings and pursue positive activity which can lead to better feelings when you stop thinking depressive thoughts , the brain is not encouraged to continue to produce stress chemicals because the fight or flight response powers down will my mom most likely be like this for the rest of my life ? if so , will she ever be able to have a normal relationship with me ? answer not every one has the intellectual understanding , the knowledge of helpful mind techniques , the sustenance of some faith in a higher power which can come to one 's aid , or the physical stamina to pull themselves out of depressive thinking if you are self consumed with depressive thinking and behavior , it is almost impossible to get out of depression the neural pattern continues to re trigger it is not possible to have a reciprocal loving connection with someone who is depressed because depression is an extreme disconnect from present reality and a shared reality with others in favor of an extreme concentration upon one s own painful inner emotional experience it is possible to have a fairly normal relationship with a depressed person but the non depressed person will have to take the more active role it is more difficult to connect with a depressed person but there are many other reasons that make it difficult to connect to another person we are all a varied combination of good qualities and the seven deadly sins once we reach adulthood , we start to understand that our happiness does not depend upon our relationship with another person our happiness depends upon self handling our own negative emotions , accepting them , and moving forward with our day in some positive direction by learning how to take care of ourselves despite our very real and frustrating difficulties how will this most likely affect me and my younger sisters as we continue to grow up with a mom who is never quite 'there' physically and mentally ? answer the answer to children of families whose parents have failed them is for the older ones to help the younger ones and draw the family circle together to include the failed parent to the extent possible but not to count on the failed parent for guidance and nurturing because it is beyond their capability guidance and nurturing will have to come from others , from other relatives , from caring friends , from mentors , from self education and books and from ones own developing spiritual strength as one steps forward with hope and faith in a higher power that can be continually called upon the only option should be to proceed in a positive direction both physically , mentally and spiritually negative thinking and negative behavior should never be an option negative thinking and negative behavior will occur they should be acknowledged , accepted and one should move forward anyway , in a more positive direction i am convinced that the truth of life is available to any human being , but they must find it by continually turning away from the negative toward the positive nothing good comes from bad good only comes from good nothing positive comes from the negative ever hope this helps a b curtiss
