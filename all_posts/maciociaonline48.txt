heat is an extremely common pattern in practice and it is therefore very important that we understand its aetiology , pathology , diagnosis , patterns and treatment to give an idea of the frequency of heat in practice , in my clinic in england in a database of over patients , had a red tongue and a pale tongue in other countries with a warmer climate , i suspect the incidence of red tongue and heat would be even higher one reason why heat is so common is that it is often the consequence of emotional stress , but this will be discussed later i have decided to write something on heat also because i find that even in chinese books , the subject is not discussed properly and the terminology used is often not precise as they sometimes use the terms heat and fire interchangeably and they are not the discussion of heat will be structured under the following headings aetiology of heat full heat heat from qi stagnation empty heat distinction between heat and fire damp heat phlegm heat external heat latent heat yin fire heat and the levels aetiology of heat first of all , when we talk about the aetiology of heat , we mean full heat or wind heat , not empty heat this is because empty heat derives from yin deficiency , so the aetiological factors that lead to yin deficiency eventually lead to empty heat in my experience , the most important aetiological factor leading to yin deficiency is overwork i do not mean excessive physical work but aoverwork in the sense of working long hours without adequate rest , leaving home in the early morning and returning in the late evening for years on end this life habit is also combined with stressful situations at work or the commute and irregular eating all these factor combine to deplete yin of the stomach , liver and kidneys yin deficiency eventually leads to empty heat in my experience , there are three major causes of full heat emotional stress , diet and an external pathogenic factor that penetrates into the interior a emotional stress all emotions eventually lead to heat and that is why a red tip of the tongue is so common and also such a reliable indicator of emotional stress initially , emotions affect only qi and do not cause heat directly they cause either qi stagnation or qi deficiency or both thus , initially and i stress initially , all emotions affect qi only emotions such as worry , pensiveness , anger , fear , shame and guilt cause qi stagnation emotions such as sadness and grief cause qi deficiency however , also the emotions that cause qi deficiency , often also cause a concomitant qi deficiency for example , sadness and grief weaken lung qi a weak lung qi in the chest leads to come impairment in the circulation of qi in the chest and therefore to some qi stagnation as well after some time and this may not be very long , e g weeks , qi stagnation leads to heat as all emotions affect the heart , the tip of the tongue becomes red all emotions affect the heart because the heart houses the shen and the shen is the one that recognizes and feels the emotions when we say ai feel angry who is that ai ? it is the shen of the heart anger will affect the liver automatically but it is the heart who afeels it this picture shows a good example of red tip the tip is bright red a different shade than the rest of the tongue body and it is also swollen b diet first of all , it is important to realize that when we say adiet in the context of aetiology of disease , that includes drinks indeed , excessive consumption of alcohol is probably the main source of heat in a diet any type of alcohol is hot and the higher the alcohol content , the hotter the drink thus , vodka is hotter than wine apart from alcohol , all meats are hot or warm but especially lamb and beef therefore excessive consumption of these two types of meat is also a source of heat all wild meats are also hot , e g pheasant , grouse , rabbit , deer , elk , reindeer , wild boar , etc apart from the above foods , most spices are also a source of heat , e g mace , ginger , curry , cumin , chilly , etc c external pathogenic factor penetrating into the interior an external pathogenic factor frequently penetrates into the interior if it is not expelled at the exterior stage when this happens , every external pathogenic factor has the tendency to change into heat thus , even wind cold can turn into heat once in the interior indeed , this is exactly what happens in the stages patterns from the shang han lun the tai yang stage is characterized by wind cold and this can transform into the yang ming stage of stomach heat of course , external wind heat and summer heat have even a stronger tendency to turn into interior heat i find this aetiology of internal full heat actually quite common , especially for lung heat many people suffer an invasion of wind heat if the wind heat is not expelled at the exterior stage , it may go into the interior and turn into lung heat or lung phlegm heat this is more likely to happen when antibiotics are resorted to this is called residual heat , i e heat left over from an invasion of wind heat it is very common in children this type of lung heat is often symptomless but the tongue shows it very clearly with a redness or red points in the front third the tongue below has red points in the front third lung area clinical manifestations of heat the general clinical manifestations of full heat are a feeling of heat , red face , thirst , anxiety , red face , dry stools , scanty dark urine , a rapid full pulse , and a red tongue with yellow coating beyond these , it is difficult to generalize as other manifestations will depend on the organ affected note that some of these symptoms and signs may be caused by empty heat too and therefore tongue and pulse are important to differentiate full from empty heat in empty heat the tongue is without coating and red and the pulse must have some empty quality and especially floating empty aside from the above clinical manifestations , there are other diagnostic guides which indicate heat any raised , red skin eruption which feels hot , indicates heat for example , acute urticaria normally takes this form as for pain , any burning sensation indicates heat for example , the burning sensation of cystitis , or a burning feeling in the stomach any loss of blood with large quantities of dark red blood , indicates heat in the blood as far as the mind is concerned , any condition of extreme restlessness or manic behaviour , indicates heat in the heart a lung heat cough , slight breathlessness , feeling
