can i crush cipralex ? this is what some people asked me on my email , well yes you can if you have to , but it wont taste good , its better just to take the pill and swallow it at as it is besides the pill melts in the body anyways if you want you can cut the pill into two or three and take each part seperated , but best thing to do is consult with your doctor email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
