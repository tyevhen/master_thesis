hi friends ! here is a crappy mccrap quality photo of me at weeks yay ! i took it in a dusty mirror and see all my lovely laundry i need to put away ? these are things i should get to but probably wo n't for a bit why ? no real reason except for laziness i figure i 'll get to it it 's just a question of whether or not it will be within this decade in pregnancy related bits it 's getting much harder to breathe and i pant after the slightest movements after i take a sip of my water i find i need to take a break to breathe it 's worst after i eat of course all proof that my organs are now squishing together desperately like on the elevator when everyone begs to fit just one more in and they each pray the other does n't fart i 've also officially moved my spot in the living room from the couch to the big stuffed chair my husband always sits there but i 've now deemed it impossible to get up and out of the couch without wanting to jump off the roof , so he has sweetly offered to make the couch his new spot for the rest of my pregnancy i have severe pain in my right hip and i partly blame the soft couch for this my husband 's hip acts up on him as well after sitting on that couch , so it just makes it nice that he 's switching with me you 'd think we 'd just get a new couch , but we all know it 's just not that easy it goes on the someday list of things that would be nice i have a doc appointment this week to check little p 's growth and see her via ultrasound hopefully she is continuing to do just fine my belly seems bigger and she is still practicing her audition for that show so you think you can dance , so all signs point to her doing ok i 'll be sure to keep you posted ! i 'll be back soon with a sweet children 's book we found the other day and a story or two from last summer be well ! save you might also like weeks weeks weeks linkwithin
