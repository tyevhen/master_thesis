d was here over the weekend he arrived friday and left yesterday we had a wonderful time together it was so nice , i'm missing him a bunch today we ran an mile race saturday morning , which went fairly well for both of us it was a gorgeous morning for a run , and we ran on a beautiful , woodsy , paved trail we 're both training for marathons right now , and this race fit right into our training schedules we spent time before and after the race socializing with the other runners i am lucky to be a part of a very kind , fun loving , running community it was a nice way to start the day shortly after arriving home and cleaning ourselves up , we left for another adventure i arranged for us to do the ropes course at a local environmental learning center saturday afternoon first we took in the main street of a small , charming town nearby they were having a weekend celebration , so there was a lot going on we took in the sights , did a little shopping , and had a little to eat before heading for the ropes course the ropes course consisted of six events feet in the air the course is in the middle of the woods , on a foot bluff , so you walk among the tree tops while out there it starts with walking from one foot tower to another on a long log and finishes with a stroll along a single wire before taking a zip line back to earth it was awesome ! i'm not afraid of heights , and of course i was safely harnessed into two overhead wires while up there , so i was surprised at how nervous i got the log was pretty easy , but the second event was called the cherry picker , and it was nerve wracking ! by the time i finished , i was dripping with sweat d had the same experience it was really challenging but really fun , too we were both glad we went i 'd like to go again we wrapped up saturday with a lovely dinner at one of my favorite restaurants after our busy day it was nice to get dressed up and have a really good , relaxed meal yesterday we spent time outside with jet we went for a long walk around a small lake and even took him out for coffee with us it was difficult when it was time for d to go but we had a really nice weekend i'm already looking forward to seeing him again
