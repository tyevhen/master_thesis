last weekend , someone took my marathon sticker magnet off of my car i don t know why anyone would steal anything , let alone a stupid car magnet i should have just left it on my fridge i get that it may come across as being vain and egotistical to publish yourself as being among the few completers of a marathon of the u s population to be exact maybe some people don t like it and want to teach a lesson to those horrible people who put stickers on their car or maybe some people think they could never run a marathon so no one else should run one either i m pretty sure that s called envy in my opinion , the sticker is no less vain than a high schooler wearing a letterman jacket with all their varsity letters and awards sewn onto the coat well , maybe some people don t like those either i think it s good to celebrate your accomplishments obviously , bragging is another thing but , if you have a healthy pride in who you are sometimes its called self esteem , you are more likely to achieve other goals in the future setting goals and striving to accomplish them is a huge part of maintaining good mental health for me , completing a marathon was so much more than running miles sometimes , i feel like i have not accomplished very much in my lifetime it is really easy for me to believe the lies of depression and get down on myself because of this each time i saw the on the back of my car , i was reminded of that time in my life when i defeated my inner demons , persevered , and overcame incredible mental obstacles for me , that sticker represented a bigger reality the beginning of my defeat over depression i was not trying to brag or to make other people feel inferior by placing that sticker on my car i was only remembering that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me maybe next time i ll make my own sticker that says phil because that is what i really meant to say i'm over the sticker really , i promise but i'm taking something out of this experience i should never judge another person i have no idea what is going on in their life or in their mind perspective changes how we see other people and what they do going forward , let us remember to encourage each other s strengths and to affirm each other s talents and gifts there s not enough of that in the world instead of comparing ourselves to others , let us recognize our own gifts and instead of cutting people down with gossip in order to make ourselves feel better , let us remember how each one of us is unique and has a specific purpose in this world
