one reason i have been thinking about which may be why i am a little down is my sleep patterns does anyone know anything about sleeping too much also what about diet and exercise can that help ? i go to bed each night between pm and pm and wake up around am to am i get at least hours sleep each night that would be manageable and not a long way outside the normal range apart from i rarely stir in the night and i have a lot of trouble getting up in the mornings i spend most of the working day yawning and ca n't wait to get back home for a nap if i go and lay on my bed i can be asleep in less than minutes it is really hard to cope with as i do little more than work and sleep monday to friday leaving the weekend full of household chores mr r would like to go out more in the week but i just ca n't manage it , it leads to me oversleeping for work once i get behind on the housework and laundry i start feeling low , i eat junk and want to sleep more it all gets into a viscous downward spiral which i desperately need to break ! oh where to start i think i 'll go for a short walk before bed as the evenings are lighter and i want to try staying up a little later tonight to see if i am any better tomorrow
