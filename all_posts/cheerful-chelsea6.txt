this time of year is particularly difficult for those with depression january went by all too quickly as did february i was willing myself to really kick start my 'health kick' all the while feeling incredibly down , exhausted and hopeless this desire to feel fit and healthy is n't a new year fad , it is a constant desire to be the best version of myself for me i'm not doing it for anyone else , i'm not attempting to meet anyone elses standards or views of the 'ideal' body i just want to like what i see reflected back at me , i do n't want to feel the pinch of too skinny jeans , i do n't want the constant reminder that i'm slightly unfit as i ca n't catch my breath as i walk up a steep hill long ago i mastered the wrong ways of losing weight i was thinner , i weighed less but i felt awful for the past few weeks i 've been walking as much as i can it 's alarming to see how little i moved when i was really depressed i walked my dog as much as i could , others subbed in for me when i was particularly tearful other than that my movements were limited to going back and forth between my bed , the bathroom , the kitchen and occasionally venturing out for a food shop with someone a weekly trip to waitrose any other supermarket works just as well really racked up the daily step count ! nowadays if my step count is lagging a bit i 'll go off to asda because it 's huge and pace up and down every aisle , even the ones i do n't need to go along , just to push towards my step count most people can achieve the daily recommended , steps fairly easily if they work in the big city or are generally on their feet for most of the day for me it is one of the achievements that i need to remember and hold on to when i am feeling useless and worthless the small goals soon add up and as time goes by you 'll forget when you last felt out of breath despite my good intentions , depression can still get to me , infiltrate my goals and set me way back along my line of progress the photo above depicts one of my greatest achievements last year surprisingly not mastering how to ski i tried , i really put every ounce of effort in that i could muster that does n't mean that i will never try again i hope i will that trip was almost a disaster for me i did n't feel like i deserved to be there , i failed at skiing therefor i did n't deserve to eat the lovely food or go out to beautiful places with everyone else my subconscious was punishing me further when i had already been kicked down i 've recently realised that my subconscious frequently meddles with my thoughts any compliment i receive is immediately squashed in my mind , declarations of love are translated into pity , even my own ambitions of losing weight and exercising more are stomped on by the voice telling me there 's no point , you 'll always be chubby it will take me a long time to reprogramme my subconscious , it has been polluted by anxiety and voices that really did tell me i was useless , fat , undesirable , the second choice and first to lose i'm doing my best to stay on track by creating motivation boards displaying the things i really want to achieve , words reminding me what i enjoy doing , reminders of what i regret not doing during the days i feel down i 've also drawn up the next few months so i can see when we have social events coming up , my motivation to keep doing something physical each day so i feel comfortable and possibly confident when i have to dress up i'm not going to let another summer come and go by with me feeling uncomfortable in summer clothing , feeling ashamed as my thighs chafe after being liberated from jeans only to feel super uncomfortable in shorts and dresses fingers crossed these thoughts carry me through the bad days i just completed a day squat challenge , i ca n't say that i 've ever done , squats before ! it felt great and after a rest day i will be progressing to level of the squat challenge and adding a abdominal challenge into the mix too !
