photo by simon flanagan last night i had two girls and their significant others over the men left to go rent a movie and the three of us were left to just talk at first it was a little awkward , not knowing what to say , but the conversation quickly turned to something very interesting i ca n't remember how the topic came up , but one girl confessed that she suffered from depression and how she just barely got off her meds because her fiance thought she did n't need them duh ! she seems normal because of the meds so now she has been off them for about weeks and she is extremely emotional , crying all the time she talked about how she has panic attacks and passes out sometimes , and how hard it is for her to make friends because she is so self conscious about what others think about her then the other girl opened up about how she thought she had depression too and how her husband would get offended when she would talk about it because he assumed if she was depressed it was because of him somehow she said she also had a hard time making friends because girls have always been so mean to her in the past i was sitting there thinking , this whole time i was worried about me and my anxiety and what they thought of me , while they were worried about themselves and what they are going through and what i thought of them ! for awhile i thought the first girl did n't like me because she was so quiet and never seemed to talk to me or want to get to know me in reality she was so shy and did n't think i liked her it also made me realize just how supportive tyler is of me and my anxiety it really makes me grateful for the ah ha moment so we talked about how we should hang out more since we all have so much in common and we have fun together it was a real eye opener for me you might also like ever thought about therapy by phone ? we must see past what it seems are we talking ourselves into panicking ? what to do when feeling overwhelmed linkwithin
