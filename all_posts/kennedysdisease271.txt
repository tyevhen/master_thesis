i am a fairly healthy person i hardly ever get sick and fortunately have not had any serious illnesses because of my good health , i occasionally forget what happens when i do come down with something like all things in life , if you forget you will be reminded again , and even again if necessary friday morning i woke up with some aches and fasciculations i thought that was unusual because since i started taking dutasteride the aches and twitching have been relatively minor as i prepared breakfast , i noticed my left arm was very weak initially , i blamed my old friend , kennedy s disease my minute exercise program went well , so i put aside the aching and twitching and went about my business by early afternoon my neck , shoulders and legs were aching almost painful and , even though it was degrees , i felt chilled i was wearing a sweater and had a blanket over me and still could not stay warm by dinnertime my stomach was upset and i was applying heat to the shoulders and neck pressure gas built up in my chest and abdomen i could hardly stand up from my chair by early evening i went to bed early , but could not sleep my fever broke around midnight if i had an hours sleep that night i would be amazed the next morning i could not sit up in bed i was just too weak i could not get any food down so i sipped on coke and up throughout the day the pressure in my abdominal area was still very intense fortunately , march madness was on tv and in between my constant napping i was able to watch some of the games by evening , i got a half a bowl of soup down my first food in over hours extra strength gas x also seemed to help last night i had a good nights sleep and woke up feeling a lot better this morning my stomach is still telling me with its gurgling and rumbling that i am not totally well , but at least the aches are gone breakfast tasted good this morning food at last wonderful i am maybe recovered today , but i am definitely on the mend i did a light workout this morning and it felt pretty good , but i could tell i was still weaker than normal because those of us living with kennedy s disease are already weakened , any normal illness can cause us more problems it is a reminder that i need to be cautious when out in public i cannot afford to be exposed to colds , the flu , and other transmitted viruses and bacteria any illness that weakens a normal person can become detrimental to someone with kennedy s disease my mother always said wash your hands often keep your fingers away from your eyes never shake hands with anyone when you are not feeling well she was always a little smarter than me be safe and healthy !
