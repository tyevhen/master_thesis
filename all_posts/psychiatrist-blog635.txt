there 's an article in the new york times called if you 're happy and you know it , must i know too ? i thought it would be a story about moods , but it 's a story about writing and emoticons by serious people one person said they hated them and un friends anyone who uses emoticons or lol or omg fortunately this person is not my friend , so i do n't have to worry about this , but i did think that life is too short to expend a lot of energy on such thing and the article talked about how emoticons were initially used by teens and frothy adults what 's a frothy adult ? i thought beers were frothy so i looked it up and i learned that frothy means light and entertaining but of little substance lol ! so shrink rap will be adding a new feature we will be adding a feature to our sidebar where every day all three shrink rappers and the duck will be posting an emoticon to describe our moods i'm guessing we 'll have to remind roy sometimes , but he may be able to find an app that lets him post his mood from his iphone , and then he may decide to change it hourly this will enable readers to better decipher our posts within the context of our mood states hope you enjoy this new feature and please do end your comments with a smiley face or other emoticon
