despite returning to work for two short days , and despite getting back on the road to run a couple of times , i'm struggling i'm having a really difficult time accepting just how low i'm feeling i am so , so low , i hurt i physically hurt i woke up twice last night in physical pain , but there 's nothing physically wrong with me right now i'm just that low my depression is now manifesting itself in physical pain i can hardly stand it the physical pain is new i do n't recall my depression ever manifesting that way before i'm tearful , too tears , also , are not my normal but i 've been having a difficult time holding them back lately i'm crying a lot this episode does not seem to be letting up at all i'm not sure what else i can do and doing anything is getting more and more difficult as my energy and motivation are in the toilet i'm feeling crushed and overwhelmed i did make one decision this morning i called my mother she lives in another state i asked her to come visit , to stay with me for awhile i'm sure she was shocked i asked she knows things must be pretty rough if i'm to the point of asking her for help she agreed to come she 's going to arrive tomorrow night and stay for two weeks she 'll probably drive me nuts at some point , but i'm going to be my most patient self because i do need the help i'm relieved she 's coming i'm most relieved because i think her being here will take some pressure off my friends i'm feeling really guilty i'm worried my friends are getting worn out and i'm becoming a burden i do n't want to be a burden i like my friendships to be equal parts give and take , but i'm worried i do n't have a lot to give right now i find myself pulling back from friends more and more , which is exactly the opposite of what i need , but like i said , i do n't want to be a burdensome friend it 's yet one more difficulty of having such a low mood depression sucks i'm tired and worn out i'm tearful and in pain basic , everyday functioning is slow and difficult i'm running out of ideas i do n't know what else to do this illness is pulling me toward stopping and giving up it 's kicking me when i'm down , and there 's not a whole hell of a lot i can do about it i'm getting kicked thoughts and prayers greatly appreciated
