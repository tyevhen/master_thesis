i wrote another topic post for cracked com today because i desperately need money and famousness and maybe i can get a real job there someday especially if i use my newfound source of celebrity to stage my own death and then magically revive myself and offer to write a weekly column about my experience of the afterlife sneak preview there 's lots of pie and everyone gets pillow top mattresses and it 's christmas and your birthday every day but your parents do n't try to swindle you out of presents by celebrating both of these special days with only a single gift giving session anyway , if you liked my article on bears and you want to read a similar but way more awesome article on land sharks , go here also , i 've been reading up on blogging success strategies and apparently i'm supposed to explicitly encourage you guys to subscribe to my blog so consider yourself explicitly encouraged the subscribe button is in the upper right hand corner , just below my blog heading i think you just click it and then click something else and then you get email notifications whenever i write something new until they invent blog update pagers , this is the best i can do to give you instant updates i guess i'm also supposed to encourage you to be evangelical about my blog whatever that means if you can figure out how to do it , it will supposedly help me become famous enough to blog for a living and then i can entertain you forever without having to worry about stuff like how i'm going to survive the winter i read about a lot of other things i'm supposed to do if i ever hope to get rich and famous from my blog , but i do n't know how comfortable i would be with implementing tips like create controversy and optimize your post titles for search engines i'm not about to start writing posts like ways to abort your gay married , al qaeda loving baby for or less ! so i 'll just stick with asking you to subscribe and be evangelical god forbid i start showing up on google for that sentence update you guys it 's like you are trying to make google think i'm a bad person update wtf you guys ? seriously ? the list of terms for which i am ranked first on google is growing so far , these are the subjects for which i am widely considered to be the best source of information mandatory sex party jessica alba cat diarrhea ways to abort your gay married , al qaeda loving baby for or less ! masturbate by sticking hermit crabs up their pee hole do you realize that if i had adsense , my blog would be riddled with ads for hentai ? do n't google that okay , google it , but do n't blame me when you become addicted to anime porn and beastiality simultaneously p s spellcheck does n't know the word beastiality or the word hentai that 's probably a positive sign for the world
