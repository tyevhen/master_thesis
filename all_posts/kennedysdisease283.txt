time flies it is hard to believe that a little over two months ago i started taking dutasteride i reviewed my daily journal this morning and continue to be positively surprised i am sure you remember that i was impressed the first couple of weeks i could sense some positive changes happening at the same time , i thought , and occasionally still think , that it could be the placebo effect whatever it is , however , the experience has been very positive my long exercise program has grown to minutes every other day the number of reps i am performing is up a minimum of and in some cases up i find that i have to just stop an exercise , because i am not fatigued and the muscles do not seem to be any weaker the strongest muscle groups are the quads and the shoulders i have also increased my every other day routine by i was trying to explain to dr fischbeck the other day the new sensation i have been experiencing recently the muscles feel different they feel stronger i feel more in control something i have not felt in some time i am experiencing a kind of tightness a positive statement in my major muscle groups after my exercise program , i know i have exercised , but i do not feel fatigued i am not cramping my muscles are not twitching all over they are just there if that makes any sense at all i am also wondering if the benefit i am seeing is because i am exercising daily if someone did not exercise the muscles , would they feel what i am ? whatever is happening , it has been all positive from my perspective i realize the mind can play games on you and the power of the mind can accomplish almost anything , but for what it is worth , this feels like the real thing i ll keep you advised of my experiences , both good and bad
