the predicted , feared crash finally took me down i could n't make it to work on monday morning i contacted my friend and co worker , wendy , and she made the minute trip to my door apparently my voice was slow and thoughts dark my memories of that morning are already a bit fuzzy after wendy and i spent half of the morning in the emergency room , i was admitted to the inpatient psych unit for treatment that 's where i am right now i 've already completed two ect treatments with another scheduled for friday yesterday 's treatment left me stiff and sore , but the doctors figured out the right dose of pre medication today , and it went much better my friend , wendy , was just here to visit , and she thinks i sound better already i'm hoping to get out of here by the weekend and continue my ect treatments as an outpatient next week ect likely sounds barbaric to some of you , and i admit , it is not my favorite treatment option , but it has always worked when i 've needed it the process is actually quick and painless , as i am sedated throughout the procedure after the treatment , i spend several hours sleeping prior to slowly resuming my day i do feel a little lighter already , but i hate the forgetfulness which accompanies getting my brain zapped hopefully , the memory deficits will not be too bothersome , and the benefits of the ect will pull me out of the pit i do n't like feeling so dark and slow it 's been a long time since i 've been this low i hope initiating the quick ect intervention will keep this episode short lived my life is waiting outside these doors
