i hope you know that the title of this post is sarcastic a reader wrote to us and asked if we 'd address the issue of whether people with bipolar disorder should have children i have been asked how i could have had children knowing i had bipolar and the person asking would never have known i had bipolar if i did not told them i enjoyed thinking about this , but i'm punting i really do n't like the idea of putting a value judgment on who should or should n't have children truly , there are a lot of people out there who should n't have babies because they ca n't take care of them , but do , and a lot of wonderful people who 've been born to people who maybe should n't have had babies , but did , and we 're all glad they got born anyway there are no guarantees in life , and i 've never heard anyone put out a blanket statement that people with psychiatric disorders should n't have children thoughts ?
