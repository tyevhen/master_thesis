i 've been having some tough days my fatigue level continues to climb and it is now affecting my functioning and my mood my mood has definitely taken a dive toward the bottom of a very dark pool , and i'm not sure how long i can hold my breath i'm feeling the all too familiar signs of depression sneaking in first those familiar symptoms were presenting themselves one at a time , but over the last two days they seem to have been settling in en masse my mood is low my energy is low my thinking is off my motivation sucks i want to sleep all the time , yet my nighttime sleep is disrupted it 's difficult to face the day it takes everything i have to put on my therapist role at work i'm overwhelmed with simple tasks things are n't getting done and i do n't like being out in public i'm a little worried i hope acknowledging the symptoms here , writing them down , and reminding myself they are just symptoms of this chronic illness will help experiencing the symptoms today does n't necessarily mean a full blown , long , drawn out depression relapse is on the horizon staying aware of and on top of the symptoms may allow me to put up the fight i need to keep my head above water drowning is not a foregone conclusion , right ? yes , i am concerned scared , even but i 've been here before i 've had struggles that were just that , short lived , temporary struggles i need to keep pushing myself forward through the morass i know i wo n't feel better if i pack it all in , lie on the sofa , eat pints of ice cream , and set myself up with back to back to back law and order reruns , even though that 's what i really want to do i know i can do better than that tomorrow is another day i hope a better , lighter day i will do what i can thanks for listening , my friends
