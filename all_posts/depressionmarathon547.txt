after a nice , marathon prep , easy run on tuesday , i got my bike out for a group ride last night it was my first ride of the season , and i 've never ridden in a big group before remember , i'm supposed to be tapering for my sunday marathon i was hoping the group ride , also the first of the season , would be a shorter , easier one it was fairly low on mileage , miles , but it was hardly easy we rode up and over several long , steep hills very early in the ride , which wiped out my quads it was also very windy , as there was a storm blowing in and because there was a storm blowing in , i rode fairly hard in order to beat it when will i learn ? i woke up today with dead legs ! so much for tapering i just hope i did n't do too much potential damage to sunday 's effort speaking of learning , i found out a little more about my potential new job today i interviewed this morning for another position in a different skilled nursing facility nursing home but i found out the position involves treating mostly outpatients of all ages and diagnoses i have n't treated outpatients for ten years ! that scares me outpatient physical therapy requires many skills , most of which i have n't used for ten years i'm not sure if i want to dust the rust off or not i like my skilled nursing facility patients , and i thought that 's what i was applying for in this case in order to take this position , i 'd have to get out the old textbooks and re learn lots of long forgotten techniques i'm not sure what to do if i should be offered the opportunity i want this position to be a good fit i have to think about the fit over the next hours , as i 'll find out more on saturday that 's when the interviewer plans to call me back i can barely stand staying where i am now , but i do n't want to put myself in another stressful position either there is something to be said for the devil i know vs the devil i do n't know any thoughts ? i sure could use some assistance on this one
