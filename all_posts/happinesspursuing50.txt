a comment on my last post are you alright ? please just post a single line to let us know k i m really touched , thanks i m doing ok here are some highlights from my rambly life for the last few weeks i ve been immersed in two speeches that i ve been hired to present early next month i ve had a lot of trouble with them because , though i love the topic and the research is a fun to do , anytime i work on them i start to think about the speeches themselves and my mind clamps shut given my social anxiety it should be no surprise that i m pretty nervous about them i understand that lots of people have trouble with public speaking so i have no way to compare my reaction to others but i haven t been sleeping , i m drinking even more than usual which was already more than is healthy , my other work has been neglected , i ve been prone to overreact often with rage basically i m a nervous , twitchy wreck i have a good friend who s enthusiastic about everything that i do i have few friends but she has lots and most of them seem to like me i asked her if she could gather some of them for a rehearsal of my speech she did and sat night i got to give it a dry run things went pretty well although i have some clear holes that need patching they kept telling me that i m charmingly disorganized the interpretation is obvious otherwise life is churning along one advantage to having a major roadblock in one s future thinking is there isn t room for a good , all encompassing depressive episode things haven t gotten really dark since i misinterpreted my st john s wort dosage earlier this summer that might be the herb or it might be the speech if the dark engulfs me later next month i suppose i ll have the answer to that one finally hide seekis being released on wednesday i really enjoyed this book look for my review here tomorrow or wednesday it s made me think again about aromatherapy new agey flotsam and jetsam aside this might be a helpful thing for me i think i ll look into it sometime after the speeches
