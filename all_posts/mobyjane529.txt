hi a b ! hope things are fine with you these days would you be open to assisting me with a quandary i am in ? for many years i have wanted to go to graduate school in the area i lived in previously , for years , tuition rates were too high i did n't go i moved here years ago there were no master 's degree programs in theology , the degree i was seeking now there are starting january , with the spring semester , the program commences the tuition is very reasonable , relatively speaking the entire program will cost a little over , for the years , plus books it will be a blended program , online on saturdays in the classroom trouble is , every hours i change my mind about whether i should go or not i felt elated when i first heard about it a week ago but since then have waffled like crazy while the cost is reasonable for grad school , it 's still a fair sum of money that i do n't want to blow i'm yrs old i should be saving money right now also , i ca n't promise there will be a return on my investment so far as employment is concerned if i go for it graduate , i 'll be at least then , looking for work in the field for the st time in my 's currently i do volunteer work through my church , offering pastoral care in the hospital i also have yrs of training in hospital chaplaincy how do you make a decision like this ? i feel like a push me , pull me from dr doolittle 's menagerie ! thanks ! g o dear g o you make this decision the way you make any decision you make your decision from the love of something rather than fear of something it is tricky , but nothing good comes from fear it s tricky because you have to separate things out that have nothing to do with love but have been kind of glomed onto love , like winning or being safe , or impressing people a b curtiss
