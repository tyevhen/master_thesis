it 's easy to get the impression , when reading popular articles about antidepressants , that drugs like prozac , zoloft , paxil , celexa , cymbalta , luvox , etc are primarily psychoactive drugs that specifically alter brain chemistry indeed , this is what the drug companies want you to think depressed ? take this pill it 's designed to work on your brain will it cause side effects ? maybe , but they 're just side effects this is a mistaken view of pharmacology drugs do n't produce side effects they just produce effects also , serotonin is not a brain chemical it 's a total body chemical well over of the serotonin in your body is in your intestines and sex organs only occurs in the brain so when you take an ssri , the drug reaches your whole body it does n't just head for the brain and then , incidentally , produce side effects people who take antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri class quickly realize this truth , namely that ssris are whole body drugs , because the first effects most people notice and complain about in clinical trials are digestive and sexual dysfunction effects in clinical testing , ssris seldom fail to separate from placebo on those if you 're lucky enough to be one of the or so of patients who see beneficial psychological effects , good for you , but in the meantime , the physiological effects which can range from mild nausea to drowsiness to erectile dysfunction , or if you 're really unlucky , diabetes or gastrointestinal bleeding will be every bit as real as any effects on your brain how common are sexual side effects from ssris ? if you read the package inserts for the drugs , they all downplay sexual side effects the inserts rarely tell of more than of patients complaining of ed , reduced libido , or difficulty reaching orgasm the real world tells a far different story in one of the largest prospective studies of its kind , the spanish working group for the study of psychotropic related sexual dysfunction found that the incidence of sexual dysfunction with ssris and venlaxafine effexor is high , ranging from to possibly , the remaining to of patients were still too depressed to care about sex the patients in question were taking prozac n , zoloft n , luvox n , paxil n , effexor n , or celexa n in the spanish study , paxil was associated with significantly higher rates of erectile dysfunction decreased vaginal lubrication compared to other antidepressants meanwhile , males had a higher rate of dysfunction than females vs , but females experienced more severe decreases in libido , delayed orgasm , and anorgasmia some studies of sexual side effects have shown a dose response relationship what 's interesting about this is that most ssris have a flat dose response curve for psychological effects in other words , the physiological sexual effects are dose dependent , but the effects on mood generally are not i 'll devote more discussion to the latter in a later post the takeaway for now is that if you 're on an ssri and you do n't like the sexual side effects , ask your doctor to reduce your dosage to the minimum effective therapeutic dose because taking more than that generally does no good anyway a second takeaway is if your doctor keeps upping your dose , it means he or she has n't read the literature the literature says that beyond a certain dose , more does n't do anything tomorrow a look at why and how ssris mess up your sex life latest biochemical findings
