remember a few years back when i was posting parts of a novel i was working on ? if you do n't , that 's fine , it was a long time ago and then i got side tracked writing shrink rap and blogging and pod casting and blogging some more recently , i 've started working on double billing again , and i got some feedback from a professional on what would make it more marketable i 've tried to incorporate those suggestions , and part of this involved re working the story in third person , rather than as a first person narrative if you enjoy fiction , i 'd love to get your thoughts on the first couple of chapters , before i once again think about searching for an agent , or maybe kindle e publishing this oh , please beware , there 's no erotica or sadomasochism , if you 're a shades fan , it may be a bit dry if you 're up for reading , click here and thank you !
