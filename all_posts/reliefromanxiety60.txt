after passing my driving test in december , my next goal was to drive alone for those of you who have been with me throughout my journey , i started driving when i was , but unfortunately i had to stop my driving until i felt well enough the other day however i got my first car ! little did i know how expensive it would turn out to be , but i would pay that just for the freedom any day my first drive alone was very scary ! i felt the adrenaline rush through my body and my heart come through my chest , even if it was just a drive up the road this continued to go on for many weeks , until it appeared that my body just used to driving and calmed right down i think that worry of the unknown and that i had to completely rely on myself was the anxiety provoking part but as the weeks passed , i got more confident and i travelled further only last month and sometime throughout the summer , i took it upon myself to do a three hour motorway drive to somewhere i had never driven to before but , i did feel calm and collected and i did have the ability to do it and it turned out to be not as bad as i envisaged this is how everything seems to be with anxiety it 's always worse than it seems you 're stronger than you believe as well being more capable then you think you are and might just shock yourself with the challenges you undertake i know i have for those of you still learning to drive , or struggling to drive you will get there it may be a rollercoaster , but it took many years to get to where i am today , but i still made it and so can you best wishes , amy xx
