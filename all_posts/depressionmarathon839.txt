it started yesterday during work , after work ? i do n't know exactly when it started , but by last night i was on the phone to my psychologist i went to bed feeling low and with a headache i woke up feeling miserable and with a migraine i went back to bed and slept for hours the rest of the day has been only slightly better i struggled through my workout , ran only one of my multiple errands , and took puck swimming so i would n't have to expend any energy walking him i just got out of bed again it was another hour and a half nap this time i'm tired my head still hurts and i just ca n't motivate to do much of anything it 's been an awful long day is this a post triathlon let down ? is this the stress of starting a new job ? i'm not sure what it is , but i do n't like it feeling so low and lethargic makes going to a new job much more difficult it makes training almost impossible i do n't have time for this i ca n't afford to be lazy and stupid right now i'm feeling pressure to pull myself out of this quickly get over it move past it now now now but i know feeling low and lethargic will only be magnified if i sit here and stress about feeling low and lethargic i know that , and yet i'm stressed ! i need to be sharp at work i need energy and motivation to train i'm not feeling patient i'm not reminding myself that this , too , will pass i want it to pass now around and around i go i'm stressed i'm feeling low and lethargic i'm stressed about feeling low and lethargic the more i stress about how i'm feeling , the worse the feelings get around and around i go
