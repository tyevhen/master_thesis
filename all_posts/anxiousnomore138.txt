i have friends who are very open about their feelings they are able to communicate the good and the bad very easily and openly i on the other hand have always leaned toward not expressing them this is hard for me to do as a friend , and was even a manager for some reason having to look one of the employees in the eyes and tell them what a great worker they were was really hard for me easier to understand why it was hard to tell them they were slacking or needed to do better , but it s a little strange that even positive feedback is hard to express i think it s all wrapped around what they will think of me for saying that , or it is just embarrassing for some reason i think growing up that was just how it was in my family positive feelings or problems weren t openly discussed or expressed very often or maybe just not often enough it got me wondering if that behavior somehow contributed to my panic attacks because had i been more open about feelings with people , than it would be easier for me to let them know when something made me uncomfortable but years of holding things inside only makes them fester until they are out of control so i want to throw it out there are you the same ? is expressing how you feel to others something you struggle with ? do you think it could somehow contribute to your anxiety ? or are you very open about your feelings to others ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like blog against abuse day what to do when feeling overwhelmed even more about morning anxiety its all about your attitude tips for going to the doctor to talk about your anxiety linkwithin
