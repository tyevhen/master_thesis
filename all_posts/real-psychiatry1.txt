balovaptan rg autism is a difficult to treat disorder , especially in the case where it is associated with aggression as the patient ages , physical redirection and behavioral approaches can not be effective in that case , the patient 's living situation can be placed at risk as an inpatient psychiatrist , i would frequently see patients admitted to my inpatient unit who had been living at home until their parents could not longer provide the necessary care the expectation was that the inpatient stay would help with that transition care of the older person with autism and aggression is further complicated by a nearly complete lack of public resources in terms of stable living environments with staff present to assist with behavioral problems the only medications that have been fda approved to treat autism are risperidone the first approved atypical antipsychotic medication in the usa and aripiprazole antipsychotics can exert an anti aggression effect in the case where aggression is part of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder it is also used as an off label indication for treating aggressive symptoms in personality disorders and autism one of the main studies in autism was done by mccracken , et al and published in that study showed a significant improvement in irritability , aggression , and self injury in the treatment group relative to the control group in the study irritability as measured by that subscale on the aberrant behavior checklist was significantly improved in of the treated group and that improvement was maintained at months the mean daily dose of risperidone was mg to a group with a mean age of years by comparison , the lowest effective dose in adults is mg with typical range of mg for most conditions the limitations of atypical antipsychotic therapy are well known and they were observed in this group of children over the course of the course of the week study they included increased appetite , a weight gain of kg , and drowsiness of the neurological symptoms anticipated with this class of drug including akathisia , tremor , dyskinesia , rigidity , and difficulty swallowing only the tremor was more frequently observed in the risperidone treated group relative to placebo the rate of withdrawal from the study was times higher in the placebo treated group the authors concluded that within the limits of their study design that risperidone was safe and effective for the treatment of tantrums , aggression , and self injury the fda package insert for risperidone was modified to include the indication treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents aged years fda approval for risperidone was in followed by fda approval for aripiprazole in the wording in the package insert is slightly different under the indications section for aripiprazole irritability associated with autistic disorder although i do n't have any actual data , clinical use in adults suggests that aripiprazole would be the most prescribed agent for autism because it is generally seen as having a more favorable side effect profile the putative effects of psychiatric medications are generally extrapolated from know receptor affinities and atypical antipsychotics are generally dopamine receptor d and serotonin receptor ht antagonists aripiprazole is described as a partial agonist activity at d and hta receptors and an antagonist at hta receptors because of the limitations of this class of medications other molecular targets have been sought vasopressin and oxytocin and their receptor systems have become targets of interest by some research groups the best paper and the only paper i was able to locate that was a comprehensive look at the research supporting this approach as well as the discovery path and synthesis of the ultimate chemical compounds is reference below it happens to be authored by chemists from roche , the company that has been awarded fda breakthrough status for it newly approved autism drug balovaptan rg interestingly none of the structures listed in the article matches the final structure given above the paper is a testament to modern medicinal chemistry not so much on the synthesis end but how compounds are screened for activity at specific receptors all of the preliminary animal data point to the vasopressin g protein coupled receptor va a va antagonist was thought to have possible anxiolytic , antidepressant and pro social properties because of the similarity to oxytocin and potential candidate drug needed to not block v receptors mediating antidiuretic effects in the kidney and not counteract the prosocial effects of oxytocin the authors screened , compounds at a concentration of m and had a hit rate of looking for an orally available , cns penetrant and selective va antagonist they identified compounds with suitable dmpk drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics parameters that might be suitable for human studies from there they used a chemogenomics approach based on the assumption that proteins with similar binding sites similar ligands they developed a list of human class a gpcrs g protein coupled receptors they used this approach to look at the amino acids that form the transmembrane pocket for gpcr receptor sequences at this time i cannot locate an fda approved package insert for balovaptan , more detailed information on its medicinal chemistry , or the details about the trial entitled the vanilla vasopressin antagonist to improve social communication in autism a phase ii trial of balovaptan i have located the author of a paper on the vanilla trial that may have been associated with the drug getting approval and have requested that article i did locate the fda podcast that briefly discusses how balvaptan may be a breakthrough drug for autism spectrum disorder because it might address the core social deficits of the disorder the podcast suggests that the company will not be filing for approval of the drug until the only experimental data that i could find was a proof of mechanism study that basically looked at some purported measures of vasopression va antagonism , the authors used a compound rg that is not the balovaptan rg designation in a randomized , double blind , placebo controlled , two period crossover study of subjects with high functioning autism the subjects had a mean age of and a full scale iq or a single mg dose infusion over two hours was administered the subjects were tested on paradigms that looked at eye tracking , affective speech recognition , reading the mind in the eyes thought or mood test , olfactory identification and scripted interactions to look at interpersonal skills they were also rated on global functioning and anxiety the only significant result was a change in eye tracking with the compound of interest the global rating of improved function was slightly improved there were four adverse effects from rg but not placebo there were no serious adverse effects or early terminations based on the currently available information , the proof of concept paper for a similar vasopressin va antagonist provides modest proof at best as any clinician knows , in order to diagnose autism it requires not just a knowledge of the criteria , but clinical experience in observing autism there is a high degree of subjectivity in the popular media that has resulted in applying what appear to be diagnostic criteria to a number of very high functioning celebrities and concluding that they are on the autism spectrum reading through the objective measures used in this paper is concerning and makes me question the validity of several of the tests i suppose the proof of concept at the pilot study level is justified by the eye tracking test since this is the single test with the most research in the disorder and it represents a clear clinically observed finding what i will be looking for in future papers or the vanilla study paper if i can get it is a more robust demonstration of objective findings i think one of the best ways to do that is to use a stratified sample of subjects according to severity of the disorder it is always disappointing when the press leads with a story like this and there is a data vacuum let 's hope they release some studies of balovaptan and the package insert information , but that might not
