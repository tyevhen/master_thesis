hashing and hash algorithms are a pet interest of mine understanding hashing at a low level takes a fair amount of meditation most programmers are too busy for that thus hashing is not well understood outside of , say , cryptography circles as it turns out , the guy who did the amusing boredom graph cartoon see yesterday 's blog also has written one of the best overviews of hashing i 've seen in a long time be sure to see his excellent hash functions and block ciphers page as well study the material on bob 's site save yourself years of meditation
