when an adult with adhd sets out to complete a goal , it is a rare day when he remembers he set it heck , i'm lucky if i remember to bring my wallet when i go out shopping yet , keeping my goals in mind is exactly what i did for the past thirteen months i 've grown and stretched , and now it is finally time for the reckoning after all , what good is setting a goal publicly if i do n't just as loudly report on my successes and failures ? the goal to finish a picture book , a chapter book , and a novel by december , and submit them to a publisher each project has its own unique challenges , not the least of which is actually reaching the end after the beginning has been written i aimed high to test myself i knew i would n't likely finish the whole list , but i wanted to shoot for the stars and land on the moon , not shoot for the end of the street and talk about how nice the moon was this time of year i listed ten obstacles that would get in the way of me reaching those goals today i will focus on how the first two obstacles affected me they were multi iron syndrome and choosing one thing to work on , two very adhd centric problems frankly , they were opposite sides of the same coin and they warred over my time like hungry seagulls in a mcdonald 's parking lot my year looked a bit like this write picture book blog for healthyplace com start chapter book blog for healthyplace com blog for healthyplace com blog for healthyplace com notice chapter book had become a bit novelish in length blog for healthyplace com blog for healthyplace com blog for healthyplace com change my story chapter by chapter , thus forcing endless rewrites blog for healthyplace com decide to quit a good gig because there was no way i could finish my chapter book like this write another picture book what ? focus in on finishing my chapter book , which was now officially a middle grade novel celebrate my th birthday dang so it was a failure , right ? no although i wanted success in the form of a finished manuscript or two sent off in the mail somewhere , i also wanted to push myself and understand what internal stumbling blocks i could overcome i wanted to bite off more than i could chew so i could learn to chew more what i determined was that the way to keep multi irons syndrome in check truly was to focus on one big project at a time this was n't new i had written about it before however , setting these goals put that epiphany to the test the distractions did n't go away , but my attitude about them made all the difference when i decided to stop writing for healthyplace and focus instead on my novel , that was the hardest and most important decision i made all year perhaps other people could blog all over the place and write a book in their spare time while being a full time dad with a tic disorder , but i could n't i had limits what i like about recognizing limits is that i can then figure out how to work around them they 're not walls in my path they 're speed bumps i celebrated my newfound freedom not by blogging a lot again here , but by writing a new picture book then i accepted that i spent the year writing over articles for healthyplace and that doing so ate up my novel time it was all ok i was proud of what i wrote there then i rolled up my sleeves and started writing like mad the closer i got to my birthday deadline , the less i wrote here soon , all i was posting were audio clips on the run i even stopped tweeting excessively was this really me ? yes , and i was loving it i may not have made my goal i discussed my fatal writing flaw in my previous entry , but i had learned how to write productively i had learned how to push away the distractions and use my hyper focus to my advantage i had learned how to tame this aspect of adhd this will be key going forward next time i 'll discuss distractions adhd and how they played a part in my splintered books project follow me on twitter for my adhd escapades at splinteredmind or my novel writing project over at douglascootey and if you 're a glutton for punishment you can friend me on facebook as well
