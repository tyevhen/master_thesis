at least a couple of times a year someone will write and question the accuracy of the dna blood test for kennedy s disease this normally happens because a man has identified many of the symptoms he has are also related to kennedy s disease kd it is my understanding that the dna test is accurate yes , that still leaves less than one percent available for error of course , there is the possibility that a person is borderline kd that means his cag repeats are it is also my understanding that borderline cases can exhibit some of the symptoms , but not all of them the progression is also not as evident the two dna tests that i had showed a scale similar to the following normal borderline and above kennedy s disease spinal bulbar muscular atrophy or sbma so , borderline could be diagnosed as normal by some doctors and also explain why a patient experiences some of the symptoms in a study conducted a few years ago , it was reported that the higher the cag repeat count the earlier the onset meaning the progression is also more apparent over time i happen to be on the higher end with a i have known others with counts in the low s that did not exhibit any noticeable symptoms until the late s or s boy would that have been nice wikipedia defines these type disorders as trinucleotide repeat disorders also known as trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders , triplet repeat expansion disorders or codon reiteration disorders are a set of genetic disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion , a kind of mutation where trinucleotide repeats in certain genes exceeding the normal , stable , threshold , which differs per gene the mutation is a subset of unstable microsatellite repeats that occur throughout all genomic sequences if the repeat is present in a healthy gene , adynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene wikipedia also explains kennedy s disease as sbma is caused by expansion of a cag repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene trinucleotide repeats the cag repeat encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein the greater the expansion of the cag repeat , the earlier the disease onset and more severe the disease manifestations
