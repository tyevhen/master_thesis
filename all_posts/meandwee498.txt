hi friends ! i hope you are having a good monday ! i'm busy here on the homefront working on some wedding invitation work for a few clients it 's delightful to be busy when it 's cold outside ! i'm weeks along today and i guess this is the week the baby opens her eyes and blinks they say you can hold a flashlight to the belly and she will see the difference they also say if you listen carefully you can hear her heartbeat well , i ca n't but supposedly my husband could we 've tried it but no luck so far i 've noticed i 've started getting more tired if we are out running errands we went to the mall on saturday and i kept having to stop to breathe and adjust my hips oh , the hips ! i wanted lunch badly and wanted to cry when the restaurant was all the way at the other end of the mall like a football field or an actual continent away it 's the first time i 've actually considered using one of those personal riding scooters i would have settled for a segway , a wheelchair , a plane , a zepplin , jet pack or the like with chris' gentle encouragement and cheers we made it and the food was good once we got seated of course it 's amazing how tired i was after just a little bit of walking i spent sunday recouping it 's pathetic ! but i wo n't feel bad about it since my body is busy with important things behind the scenes it wo n't be long before i wo n't be able to claim that and just have to own up to the fact i'm a lazy bastard we also spent time getting our little dog maren up to date with a new leash and collar and some new toys everything she had before was falling apart or useless so our first little one is now looking quite snazzy ! i like making sure we are giving her plenty of attention while we can spoiled dog the little sucker just does n't know what 's coming ! save
