i have been referred to this website to help me understand myself http www psycheducation org it looks familiar to me , i think i stumbled onto it before when i was looking for a correlation between weight gain and bipolar medication this time i am reading the whole thing as it has a lot of very interesting studies and conclusions one interesting aspect is the morality gene i will copy here most of this article but i strongly urge you to go to the very website and browse it i would assume i am a blue person chapter why are some people so affected by stress ? yellow people and blue peoplereviewed , new link , yellow people and blue people we 're going to start with some graphs do n't worry , the whole story is not going to be like this but once you see what 's on them , i think you 'll agree that what they show is extremely important here 's a set of four results the main point is the same in all of them you 'll learn in a minute that the different colors stand for a single factor which determines in part how badly someone 's life may turn out , depending on how many stressful life events she goes through take a look i 'll tell you what the graphs mean , and then what that factor is , below as you can see , if a person has very few stressful life events defined in a moment , below , they may still have symptoms of depression , but it 's not very likely if they have a lot of those events , then they are much more likely to have depression especially if they 're a blue person by comparison , the yellow people can have a lot of stressful things happen without increasing the likelihood of getting depressed look at the difference if you 're a yellow person , even stressful events only raises your likelihood of full major depression to about lower left hand graph but if you 're a blue person , those stressors raise your chances of depression to almost ! what is the color factor ? it 's a gene it 's just dna it has nothing to do with anything you ever had any choice about you were just born this way the gene story gets a little complicated , but if you do n't understand the explanation that follows , that wo n't matter too much what i want you to see is just how much impact a gene can have on a person 's experience of the world think about it if you 're a yellow person , you could easily look at blue people and think hey , pull yourself together , you wimps i 've been through the same or worse , and i'm all right ! then they could proceed to explain to the blue person just what they 'd done to come through those stressors okay here 's how you do it , see ? you just have to they could attribute their success to god , or their own determination , or the great support from their friends all those explanations could easily have some truth to them too but look at how much impact the genes alone have if you 're a blue person from birth , your risk of depression when stressed is a lot higher similarly , if you 're a blue person , you could look at the yellow people and think what 's wrong with me ? they 've been through the same stuff and they seem to be doing okay then you could proceed to explain to yourself why you 're struggling so much it 's because i'm just weak if i tried harder , i 'd be better off why do n't i seem to be able to try harder ? you can imagine some of the variations on this i should n't have tried to go to college , i just do n't have what it takes , or it 's because i drank so much alcohol all that time , etc and even here , there might be some truth to those explanations but what if a big part of the explanation , for why your mood is so affected by stress , comes down to your genes ? would n't it be ironic if meanwhile you were telling yourself it is your fault ? source http www psycheducation org mechanism moralityorgenes htm of course some people will never ever believe the results of these studies as fact , they will continue to believe that people who get stressed and depressed are just weak and worthless , but this is all a very interesting read nonetheless well thanks for reading
