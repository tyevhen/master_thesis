i was on the back porch thinking about image transforms the other morning , and it occurred to me that we just assume that many types of data are either one dimensional , two dimensional , or three dimensional , etc with nothing in between , despite the fact that fractals are everywhere in nature and we apply transformations and convolutions dimensional dct , in the case of jpeg to the data without regard for the data 's true dimensionality so i'm left wondering how do you do , say , a d dct or dft ? what if i want to convolve the fractal residue of a time series ?
