it s often claimed that ect prevents suicide but there are no suicide studies comparing ect and sham ect , and the existing literature fails to support the contention that ect is protective against suicide what 's more , there is considerable evidence that ect itself can lead to death with regard to suicide read and bentall looked at studies comparing suicide rates of groups who have and have not had ect see table ii of their paper references here only out of studies claimed a significant suicide protective effect for ect one study dates to , the other to hence both date to the era of unmodified ect ect without anesthesia the era of mental institutions , where patients under lockdown and or continuous monitoring could hardly be expected to carry out a suicide ironically , in one of these studies ziskind et al , , two patients died during ect in the other study , people with manic depressive psychosis who never got ect were compared with similarly diagnosed individuals treated with ect huston locher , six patients of the untreated group and one patient of the treated group killed themselves during a follow up period of between three and seven years it is impossible to determine whether the different suicide rates can be attributed to ect , however , because the untreated individuals were more disturbed than the treated group twice as many v were classified as having severe illness , and more v came from disturbed families mental illness , alcoholism , criminality , etc but also , significantly , more patients in the untreated group v were men it s well known that men have a three fold higher suicide rate than women in their decidedly pro ect book , shorter and healy again , see references here , cite five studies to support their claim that ect prevents suicide one study is mistakenly cited twice with different authors , namely the study by ziskind et al , reporting on chemically induced seizures using the gaba inhibitor metrazol so the actual number of ect studies is four but since the ziskind study conflates ect data with metrazol seizure data , there really are just three one of the three studies is the paper by huston locher , already discussed above also cited are papers by avery winokur and nimh kellner et al , the avery study recorded deaths among depressed patients three years post discharge there were four suicides among the who had received ect and four among the who had not hardly a convincing show of ect s suicide prevention capabilities the nimh study , meanwhile , was not a study of suicide it was a study of suicidal ideation it provided no data on suicide rates there remains no definitive evidence that ect prevents suicide most of the evidence on this subject e g , huston locher , comes from an era when ect was not available as an outpatient procedure in other words , it comes from the days of mental institutions , when patients were either in confinement and thus prevented from committing suicide or under intensive medical observation , in conditions that would make suicide much harder to achieve on the other hand , there is considerable evidence that ect itself kills people textbooks and consent forms claim that the risk of death from ect is very small the american psychiatric association has said citing no references published estimates from large and diverse patient series over several decades report up to deaths per , treatments apa gives a reasonable current estimate of the risk as at most in , , which is the number quoted in many consent forms this is far from an accurate estimate frank reviewed articles in which psychiatrists had reported ect related deaths of , ect patients , there were ect related deaths , or one death per , people , seven times greater than the official apa claim impastato reported deaths caused by ect and calculated a mortality rate of one per , patients overall , with a death rate in people over age of in fifty times higher than the american psychiatric association estimate at the mayo clinic in minnesota , out of , ect patients died within days of treatment nuttall et al , the paper reporting this result claimed all deaths appear to be unrelated to ect , despite six being of unknown cause and two being from heart attack or stroke outcomes known to be associated with ect eight additional patients died within two weeks , of cardiac events what makes these results especially hard to explain is that ect is usually not administered to anyone who isn t in good physical health and in this case , recipients had the advantage of being in the care of mayo clinic , one of the top health care providers in the world in a survey of british psychiatrists involving ect related deaths that occurred during or within hours of treatment , there were four reported deaths in , patients pippard ellam , that s a rate of one per people times greater than the american psychiatric association claim of the additional six people who died within a few weeks of ect , two were from heart attacks and one from stroke common causes of death from ect with these three deaths included , the rate becomes one death per ect patients in a norwegian survey , out of women in died as a result of ect strensrud , freeman and kendell attempted to survey patients who had received ect in , to determine their attitudes toward ect treatment however , patients were either dead or could not be traced twelve were definitely dead four had killed themselves if we count only the two deaths that occurred during ect , the mortality rate comes to in every patients all of these findings show much higher mortality among ect patients than has been claimed by apa consent forms do not cite data showing the true rate of death to be far greater than the in , claimed by apa therefore , patients who consent to ect are hardly doing so in an informed manner today 's post is adapted from hack your depression full references to the studies mentioned
