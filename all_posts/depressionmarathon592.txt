i had my third ect treatment yesterday unfortunately , i did n't return home afterwards i was feeling so low i was in tears , and i was re hospitalized i think i am now here for at least one week or more the doctor wants to do my remaining ect treatments while i'm an inpatient rather than an outpatient i'm hoping he does n't want to do all ten while i'm here , because that would put me here for another weeks i simply ca n't afford that next weekend that 's my goal i do n't think i 'd be able to stand it much longer than that despite the fact that i'm back inpatient , things are going okay my body is really tired , so i 've not yet had the energy to exercise besides attending the required education groups , i 've spent much of the last couple days sleeping at least i have my computer now , so i can keep this blog updated but i miss puck , and i miss being outside already i think it 's going to be a long week but that 's okay , too the reality was i could n't continue living the way i was , so this is , for now , the place for me to be things can only get better from here
