there has long been a controversy over whether ect causes brain damage at one time , the medical consensus was that electroconvulsive therapy achieves its effects through brain damage , but that opinion has undergone a complete reversal in the last years the official view , today , is that ect causes no brain damage whatsoever , although adverse cognitive effects sometimes lasting years are associated with the procedure the american psychiatric association s sample information sheet representing suggested wording for informing patients abut ect includes the following language during ect , a small amount of electrical current is sent to the brain this current induces a seizure that affects the entire brain , including the parts that control mood , appetite , and sleep ect is believed to correct biochemical abnormalities that underlie severe depressive illness we know that ect works the phrase a small amount of electrical current is misleading , because the amount of current involved typically amps at volts is known to be fatal if applied to other parts of the body likewise , the statement ect is believed to correct biochemical abnormalities is blatantly fraudulent , since there is no consensus view on how ect achieves its effects indeed , the consensus view is that ect s mechanism of action is not understood when consent is granted based on this kind of misinformation , it cannot be considered informed consent also , when consent forms fail to mention that there is no difference in outcome , after one month , in patients who receive sham ect versus real ect except for fewer side effects with sham , patients are seriously misled adverse cognitive effects are well known to be associated with ect , and this is another area in which patients are under informed in spite of repeated claims for years that ect is safe , the first large scale prospective study of cognitive outcomes following ect did not occur until , when outspoken ect advocate harold sackeim , et al for a complete list of references , go here found that autobiographical memory was significantly p worse in patients both immediately after ect and six months later at both time points , the degree of impairment was significantly correlated to the number of shocks , with women and older patients particularly impaired impairment was also greater among those who received bilateral ect rather than unilateral ect , prompting sackeim to conclude there appears to be little justification for the continued first line use of bilateral ect in the treatment of major depression despite this , bilateral ect remains the most common form of ect in use today a study freeman et al , again , see references here produced the longest followup data to date ect patients performed worse than non recipients on ability to recall famous personalities from the s and also on personal memories from early childhood the average time since ect was years most people would consider this permanent memory damage in addition to significant retrograde amnesia , there are reports of ect resulting in anterograde amnesia the inability to retain newly learned information a learning disability the american psychiatric association report cites studies demonstrating anterograde amnesia in the first few weeks after ect , concluding that during this time , returning to work , making important financial or personal decisions , or driving may need to be restricted nevertheless , the apa report states no study has documented anterograde amnesia effects of ect for more than a few weeks , which is blatantly false feliu et al found that anterograde amnesia persists for four weeks two studies porter et al , squire slater , showed that anterograde memory is degraded for at least two months halliday et al demonstrated anterograde memory deficits lasting three months for many years , it has been claimed that ect produces no brain damage and yet , in the s it was commonly accepted that ect owes its effects to brain damage in , walter freeman , in a paper called brain damaging therapeutics , wrote the greater the damage , the more likely the remission of psychotic symptoms maybe it will be shown that a mentally ill patient can think more clearly and more constructively with less brain in actual operation freeman , a review in the lancet alpers , described ect induced hemorrhages and concluded that all parts of the brain are vulnerable the cerebral hemispheres , the cerebellum , third ventricle and hypothalamus in two memory tests used to assess brain damage , goldman et al found that ect patients scored worse than a non ect control group at both and years after ect , which suggests that ect causes irreversible brain damage according to read and bentall , in the s and s autopsies consistently provided evidence of brain damage , including necrosis cell death in a review of the first twenty years of autopsies , allen concluded damage to the brain , sometimes reversible but often irreversible , occurred in the course of electric shock treatments ct scans have demonstrated frontal lobe atrophy among ect patients calloway et al , uk ect review group , one review acknowledged that both anterograde and retrograde memory impairment are common rami gonzalez et al , the same review documented various forms of neurobiological dysfunction underlying the subtypes of ect induced memory dysfunction retrograde amnesia was found not surprisingly to be a consequence of electrochemical dysfunction of the limbic diencephalic subcortical areas involved in information retrieval while in anterograde amnesia , the medial temporal lobe is most affected the medical literature thus strongly suggests that ect causes brain damage , which is the only reasonable way to explain the persistent and often irreversible cognitive deficits that occur in patients who have been repeatedly shocked but again , consent forms leave out this important information , throwing into question the notion that any ect patient has ever truly given informed consent john read and richard bentall , in their review of the literature read bentall , , observed the continued use of ect represents a failure to introduce the ideals of evidence based medicine into psychiatry this failure has occurred not only in the design and execution of research , but also in the translation of research findings into clinical practice their conclusion was that the cost benefit analysis for ect is so poor that its use cannot be scientifically justified on this basis , and because consent forms do not accurately portray the risks of electroconvulsive therapy , continued use of ect in a therapeutic setting can only be considered unethical for a complete list of
