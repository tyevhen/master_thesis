we had a project in the office recently wherein a large amount of web documentation was converted to a single pdf file using the built in web capture capability of acrobat x otherwise known as control shift o , and when we were done , we wanted a page number to appear on each page it turns out , it 's fairly easy to apply page numbers to any pdf file using a bit of javascript here is a script that will add a page number as a read only text field to the upper left corner of every page of a pdf document obviously , you can adjust the script to place the page number in any position you want , if you do n't like the upper left corner the best way to play with this code is to run it in the js console in acrobat pro control j to make the console appear paste the code into the console , select all of it , then type control enter to execute it var inch for var p p this numpages p put a rectangle at inch , inch var arect this getpagebox npage p arect inch from upper left corner of page arect arect inch make it inch wide arect inch arect arect inch and inch high var f this addfield p p , text , p , arect f textsize pt type f textcolor color blue use whatever color you want f strokecolor color white f textfont font helv f value stringp page numbering is zero based f readonly true when you 're done , you 'll have a page number as a read only text field on each page if you like , you can flatten the pdf programmatically using flattenpages in the console afterwards , to convert the text fields to static objects on the pages making them no longer editable as text fields
