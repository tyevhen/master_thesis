this one baffles me a friend pointed out to me that novell , a company with over years of experience in identity and security , a company that in fact specializes in identity management , has been named a bronze sponsor of sys con 's th international cloud expo why is that so hard to believe ? simply because sys con is a company that spoofs the identities of its writers and writes stories that hype supposed takeover targets i know of one case , in particular , where a sys con reporter 's identity is fake that would be the identity of the reporter avatar known as yeshim deniz it turns out yeshim deniz is actually a stock photo called friendly smile however , that does n't keep yeshim from hyping tibco stock in a sys con year end prediction blog the blog which was widely read by amateur investors see , e g , the yahoo stock message boards says tibco will be acquired by ibm shortly sys con reporter yeshim deniz coincidentally , sys con happens to publish an online magazine called now magazine tibco 's marketing vp ram menon is the publisher of now magazine does anyone else smell that odor ? the story about novell becoming a bronze sponsor of cloud expo was written by sys con reporter avatar ? elizabeth white oddly , though , elizabeth white 's head shot is named susan ulitzer headshot bmp when a better reporter than i am gets to the bottom of all this , maybe we 'll get an explanation for some of this chicanery that makes sense right now , it 's making no sense to me what i see is a company that puts fake names and fake photos over reporter bylines , in order to hype things like tibco stock and cloud expo maybe i'm missing something , but it all looks like fraud to me i think that 's a reasonable opinion do n't you ? in the meantime novell , shame on you for sponsoring identity chicanery you really do n't need this right now
