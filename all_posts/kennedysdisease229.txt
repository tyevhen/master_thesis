have you ever felt handicapped ? you know what i mean that sense that someone is looking at you because you are in your wheelchair or scooter , or using your walker there are times i am still a little self conscious about having to use a wheelchair in public yes , i know , i am far safer these days and much more mobile , but sitting in a wheelchair well i received one of the nicest compliments the other day from a neighbor and friend we were talking football our normal friday and saturday morning topic when he mentioned something that meant a lot to me he said , whenever we get together , within a couple of minutes i forget you are in a wheelchair that comment made me feel normal you know , just one of the guys i was ready to stick some chaw in my mouth , grab a beer , and kick a few tires even though i am not usually one to ponder how others view me , i tend to view myself as a person needing a wheelchair to have someone affirm that i and wheelchair are not part of the same perspective when he thinks of me removes this less than feeling i occasionally have of myself when in public i believe some of these feelings come from not being able to stand for long when having a conversation coming from a sales background , making eye contact and standing when being introduced to someone was normal for me today , sitting , while everyone else is standing , is tough on the neck and , in some ways , is a social barrier as in being looked down upon or talked down to i know that might sound crazy , but unfortunately that thought occasionally comes to mind having to drive a wheelchair through a large crowd of mingling people gives me a similar feeling my new chair helps to a degree because i can elevate the seat thirteen inches making me a little more eyelevel my other concern in large crowds is running over someone s foot i realize this is just an insecurity of mine , but the feeling seems real to me at the time and , that is why the comment , i forget you are in a wheelchair meant enough to me to write about it in my blog how about you ? do you occasionally feel handicapped ? does not being able to stand while others around you are all standing frustrate or bother you ?
