this is hard for me to write about sometimes my brain feels other than my own scary , intrusive thoughts crowd in , and squeeze out any rational thoughts which previously occupied the space i do n't like to admit it i do n't like when they come they are another symptom of my illness they are not welcome , yet they are here i ca n't say much else it feels too demeaning to admit i want my brain to be under my control , but it feels out of my control when the thoughts barge in this is hard for me to write about so that 's all i'm going to say
