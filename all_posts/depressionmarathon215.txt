i just returned from grandma 's marathon weekend in duluth , minnesota i have friends and family in that area , which is good , because this year i was a spectator and visitor rather than a participant for the first time in years despite my achilles injury , i decided to go up for marathon weekend i 'd be lying if i said it was n't tough it was tough not to be a runner this year , but on the positive side , i got to spend a lot more time with family and friends than i otherwise would have i even stayed out way past my bedtime , twice ! i lead a pretty sedate life around here , so staying out past my bedtime laughing with friends was really nice i'm glad i went now that i'm home , however , i'm feeling a bit out of sorts i'm a little overwhelmed , a bit lonely , and somewhat anxious i'm tired i 've got a list of chores to accomplish before work tomorrow and i'm at a loss when it comes to exercise that 's probably the biggest problem i have not yet done any aerobic exercise since getting my boot other than a few push ups and sit ups , i have n't had the gumption to do anything the boot , it turns out , is not only a pain in the butt , it 's exhausting ! i'm about inches taller on my right side than my left , and just walking around like that wipes me out work , especially , was exhausting last week by the time i got home all i wanted to do was nap my motivation was lacking then , and it 's not at all improved now , i think i'm really going to have to push myself to do something , anything aerobic , this week if i want to stay well i ca n't continue to be a spectator
