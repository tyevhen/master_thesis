the mda advocacy news sent out the following as the ada turns on july , , the americans with disabilities act ada was signed into law , marking an important step forward for individuals with disabilities and their families the legislation elevated the importance of equal access for children and adults with disabilities and engaged the country in a conversation about the inherent rights every person has , regardless of ability the ada changed the landscape for people with disabilities it is the primary reason we have accessible parking spaces and building entrances and why those of us with limited mobility can navigate school campuses and access and enjoy public libraries , retail stores , movie theaters and doctors' offices as the ada turns , we come together to celebrate the accomplishments of this legislation while maintaining our focus on continued , collective efforts to protect and enhance the rights of our disability community , where there is still much work to be done being an 'old timer' , i find it difficult to believe that it was only years ago that things started to change for those living with a disability i still become frustrated when i do not have access to certain buildings or a handicap bathroom is nothing more than two grab bars attached to a normal toilet yet , i am thankful for all the changes that have been made to allow me access to facilities including designated parking areas probably the biggest change is the mindset of the majority of people thank you ada for more information on the ada , visit http www ada gov
