hi friends ! i was perusing the anthropologie website today during my lunch hour and saw this lovely outfit i thought of how i could pull this off with a kid which most outfits i see would never work although , the necklace would get ripped apart pretty quickly , huh ? since having paige , i 've needed easy to clean garments garments that have no stretchy v neck unless i'm wearing a cami scoop necks are out too i need long shirts delicate fabrics are out accessories ? what are those again ? sigh i have so many beloved articles of clothing sitting in my closet from my office days many things are wool , silk , and cashmere obviously all fit for the dry cleaner i guess it does n't matter since most of the pants do n't even fit my new figure blahhh it 's well worth the price , but i miss my old clothes the casual things i do have well many things have to stand the test of paige she likes to pull down my v necks or scoop necks while i hold her while chris enjoys this , i am modest and do not just the act of holding her pulls the neck down , much less her grabby little hands going exploring plus , now that i have a little more cushioning , i find that my pants do n't cover me as well anymore so i need longer shirts to cover my butt and of course , when she spits up , sneezes all over me , or some other such thing i need to be able to wash and dry the item in a snap you 'd be surprised how hard it is to find things that fit the bill i 've been doing ok so far , thanks to places like t j maxx or shade clothing it 's hard to find whole outfits that are stylish and fit all my criteria i guess i 'll be selling a lot of my old stuff at the yard sale this spring could this be a chance for a fresh start and a new look ? hmmm i 'd better start saving my money ! where do you like to shop for stylish and easy things ? save you might also like before and now the freak out art and mothering linkwithin
