i got it , again , like clockwork the joys of city life yet another jury duty summons my number is and that 's high , really high , but sometimes on mondays they call up to the problem with being a shrink is that there 's the question of what to do ? pray my number wo n't get called , or take the day off ? in my private practice , i could just give people a heads up that i might need to cancel if i get called , but monday mornings , i work in a clinic where people are scheduled months in advance , and short notice is a hassle on everyone involved family members often take off work to bring in patients , or other agencies send people to appointments with case workers last minute doc outs create problems for everyone i used to hate the uncertainty of it all , but i'm trying to grow more flexible as i age , oh so gracefully i used to call and request a specific day , one that would work better with my schedule , and the courts are happy to oblige this they 'd let me pick any day i want , as long as i agreed to take the number no uncertainty here i was going to be called but how do you give up a number like and a high likelihood of getting a pass on an inconvenient day for a number like on another day face it , there 's never a good day to sit with people in a jury room so i gave weeks notice at work and took the day off and the verdict is in number are to report i have a day off ! see you monday please feel free to write in with suggestions about how i should spend my day
