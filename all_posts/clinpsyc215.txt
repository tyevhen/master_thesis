in a recent post , daniel carlat apologized to charles nemeroff for nicknaming him bling bling in a prior post so what ? who cares ? well , i think we need to take a look at what behavior requires an apology and what does not i'm not saying i have the answers , but i think the issue is quite important let 's look at some documented issues regarding nemeroff arise rd nemeroff was an author on a study called arise rd examining the use of risperidone as an antidepressant the study results did not demonstrate that the drug worked , especially after the authors issued a correction indicating that one of the findings in the published version of the study was incorrect oops sorry that we mentioned that the drug worked we screwed up it really did not work arise rd the study results were clearly not reported in full , leaving open the possibility that unfavorable data for risperidone was simply swept under the rug arise rd the study was published in a journal of which nemeroff was the editor strangely , he did not report that he had a financial conflict of interest in the study , though the journal requires such relationships to be disclosed arise rd authorship was switched around , leading one to wonder if the authorship line was an accurate reflection of who contributed significantly to the study or if it included an effort to stamp on the names of several key opinion leaders in order to improve the study 's marketing value , i strongly encourage readers to read the linked posts above in order to plumb the depths to which this study appeared to be flawed but there 's more vns in his role of journal editor , nemeroff again failed to disclose relevant conflicts of interest regarding a study that appeared in his journal and upon which he was an author read more on that tale here and here mifepristone ru nemeroff wrote an article reviewing various treatments one treatment he mentioned was mifepristone corlux ru nemeroff serves in a paid advisory role to corcept , maker of the drug he concluded , based upon incredibly weak evidence , in the review , that mifepristone was very effective in treating psychotic depression lithium patch in the same review article as mentioned above , nemeroff mentioned that the lithium patch improved tolerability and compliance so the patch made patients stick with treatment better and lowered the side effect burden oh , and nemeroff did not cite a single source to back up these claims um , the entire point of a review article is to make claims and back them with sources nemeroff holds the patent for the lithium patch , by the way david healy according to some sources not entirely confirmed , though i believe it , nemeroff was part of the effort to get david healy ousted from his position at the univeristy of toronto it 's a long story , worth reading about here and here as readers of my site know , i have cited healy 's work here many times due to his close knowledge of data regarding psychiatric medications particularly ssri 's he 's a good scientist with , in my mind , a very strong conscience if nemeroff was involved in getting healy 's position rescinded , then i say shame on him cme and dr nemeroff dr nemeroff , like many key opinion leaders , is willing to set his name on journal supplement papers which are then used for continuing medical education daniel carlat has a great post about a recent cme activity , upon which nemeroff was an author , that seemed to magically transform unfounded ideas into science by just adding a sprinkling of money from the sponsor , bristol myers squibb kinda made me think of a chia pet for some reason suh suh suh science ! to the tune of chuh chuh chuh chia ! so looking at the above list of items involving nemeroff , i ask readers is it okay to nickname someone bling bling or to nominate someone for a golden goblet award ? please chime in with a comment to let me know is it acceptable sarcasm or is it character assassination , or something else ? the point i'm not in favor of name calling , nor am i in favor of being a jerk but where does one draw the line ? where is the line drawn between acceptable reporting on controversial and important issues and being a bully ? over at the drug wonks blog , there are several posts that take aim at steve nissen and others , often using a nastier tone than nicknaming people bling bling plenty of mudslinging occurs in blogs and in the old media watch most of the talking heads on so called cable news networks and see what i mean how often , and to what degree , is someone allowed to use sarcasm before it becomes rude and bullying ? part of writing is entertaining one 's audience , and let 's face it sarcasm can be very entertaining how is a blogger to be entertaining , stick to the facts , and bring important information to readers without crossing the line into being offensive ? i do n't know perhaps you do again , leave a comment and see if you can shed light on this issue
