i 've always been hard on myself my best has never been good enough and even when i had done something well , i never let myself revel in it for too long before i move on to what i think should be my next improvement i found myself talking to my counsellor about this and i also wrote about this in a previous post , that i should be over a traumatic experience by now , i should have a paid job by now and the list could go on i'm forever searching for ways to be better and although we should all strive to become better people , i find that it is becoming detrimental that i am never feeling that i am good enough or if i do well and i do n't give myself a chance to celebrate it was suggested that part of the reason for this may be because i do n't like attention drawn to me , thus i tend to move on quickly from achievements it 's hard to dwell too much on what i 've achieved and it 's probably about time that i did i feel that the more pressure we put on ourselves in regards to our lives and mental illnesses , the worse we are going to feel there is no one else out there telling me what i should be doing and what i should overcome because i am on my own journey and i am not competing with others we all have our individual qualities , and what we may think are aspects that we need to improve about ourselves , may be someone else 's goal it 's important to give yourself credit for what you have achieved as mental illness is an extremely hard battle it may take a lot of willpower to take the stress off of yourself and allow yourself to stretch out and accept the strength that you have i know it will for me i have been trying to be easier on myself for many years and although i have improved a bit , it is still really hard for me to let go of that niggling voice that is telling me to do more and to be better but , it is possible to improve and i hope you can join me on this journey let 's try to take some time to reflect on all of things we are proud of and all of things we have achieved you may be surprised at how well you have done amy xx
