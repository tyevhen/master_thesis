i was recently trying to explain to a friend in the u s what 's going on in europe the best analogy i could come up with is a chain gang imagine a chain gang of prisoners who are bound , one to the other , by chains at least four of the prisoners italy , spain , greece , portugal are mordibly obese midgets the chain gang has escaped into the forest and is running away from their oppressors but after running a while , the four weakest members mentioned above are out of breath , and they stop running the fittest members of the chain gang , represented by germany , say to the laggards come on , now let 's keep going we 're making great progress do n't stop now but the laggards are out of breath , sweating heavily , and they say we need to eat something we 're exhausted we ca n't go on without something to eat and the fittest members of the chain gang say nonsense you 're obese you need to get up and start running and the obese ones say but we did n't choose to be obese this is a genetic condition we inherited the 'obese' gene do n't penalize us just because we 're obese and the fittest say we 're not just going to turn over our food to you , just because you 're exhausted and hungry you 're fat you need to go on a starvation diet and you need to exercise so get up and run this seems to me to sum up what 's going on , economically , in europe right now the germans do n't want to just give hard earned wealth to states like greece , spain , portugal , and italy , who are on at least some level plainly undeserving but the chain gang cannot make progress unless the weaklings stand up and move making an obese person go on a starvation diet and sudddenly start exercising is neither humane nor realistic but angela merkel has demonstrated that even after odd years , nothing much has changed in germany she has revealed the quintessential german nature neither humane nor realistic what 's needed now in europe is a solution , for the less well off nations , that is both humane and realistic it 's like a commentator on my favorite tv network cnbc said squabbles of the kind we 're seeing in europe right now used to be resolved at the point of a bayonet they now need to be resolved at the point of a pen and that requires significantly more time and talent
