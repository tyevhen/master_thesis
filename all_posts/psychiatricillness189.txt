speed dating was quite successful for me this time , i did not have any dating matches but got friendship matches i did not actually tick anyone for dating anyway to cut a long story short one of the people i ticked for friendship ticked me for dating i think and we are going out on a proper date tonight we are meeting near here and going for a meal at nandos and then going to the cinema i'm a bit nervous but i feel more confident than usuall because i do n't really care if it goes anywhere or not i went to the drama group again last night , it was nice and i have started to join in singing in the chorus i think i will enjoy it especially as the show gets closer i'm still the quietest person there by a long long way but i am having fun i'm no too interested in the pub afterwards , the people are nice enough but i was just not enjoying it , i think i will just stick to rehearsals in future
