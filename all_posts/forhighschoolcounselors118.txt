my first job do you remember your first job ? many of us either remember our first job fondly or with shear embarrassment my first job was at the age of when i was hired by my dad 's best friend to work in his auto parts store unfortunately , there was little training on how to deal with the types of customers who frequented the business and i was unfamiliar with the unwritten rules of the store one of my most difficult lessons about work was learned from an elderly farmer so one day i am standing at the register watching cnn when i see a big farm truck pull up in front of the store in the truck was an elderly gentleman wearing overalls and a cowboy hat with a big dog in the back at first i paid little attention to the man , but then i heard a loud honk from his truck at first i was startled , but i did n't think much about the sound and went back to the news a few minutes later , there was a loud horn blast again okay , what is going on with this man and the horn ? after another minute , the man honked his horn again and he would not let up on it immediately , i ran to the window and saw the man gesturing for me to come to the truck at this point , i was getting really nervous and wondering if the man was a stalker as i got ready to walk away , he laid on the horn again and aggressively motioned for me to come to him at this point , i was really scared and i shook my head at him that is when he got upset and mouthed an expletive at me oh no you just did n't ! ! taking a lesson from my grandmother about dirty old men , i immediately ran to get my boss to show him the mad farmer outside of his store when my boss came to the window , i knew he would be furious and call the police however , that is not what happened at all ! my boss looked at me and said , how long has he been waiting for someone to come outside ummmm did he just say what i thought he said ? ? ? i stared at the man with my mouth open and a puzzled look on my face again , my boss questioned me about the inconvenienced customer after getting myself together , i explained to him what happened and how i thought the gentleman was a stalker my boss admonished me and told me that it was his expectation that the gentleman receive service at his truck by whomever was at the counter this story describes my first experience with the generational gap in the workplace the generations in the workplace a generation is defined as the events and conditions each of us experience during our formative years which determines who we are and how we see the world what defines a generation ? each of us , the elderly farmer , the business owner , and me , the teenager , had expectations of each other that were not being met due to our cultural lens at that time , i only saw a grumpy , demanding old farmer and a unrealistic boss who i only worked for because i wanted to make extra money in my mind , i was the victim who was being treated unfairly by the establishment however , looking back , the situation was much deeper and complex than i could comprehend today , i see this scenario as a great example of understanding the differences and complexities of generations within our workforce and schools within our organizations , we have four different generations working along side each other most of the time , these workers are able to coexist and work peacefully together
