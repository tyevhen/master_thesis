recently , i had the opportunity to spend several days in close contact with someone with whom i rarely spend time for this person the glass is always half empty you know the type ? regardless of what is going on , this person sees the negative side of it anything legitimately negative is always the result of some conspiracy , and this person is always on the short end of the stick the world , in a nutshell , is against this person what a waste i wish i had the days i spent with that person back that person , unfortunately , was quite vocal in expressing all opinions and displeasure it wore me out ! i could n't handle it i ca n't handle negativity in general i do n't listen to political news or political talk shows because of all the negative speech and name calling i do n't watch reality television i do n't listen to cranky radio personalities i do n't need that negative energy i 'd much rather surround myself with something positive as a result of working the steps of my recovery program , i attempt to maintain a positive attitude i no longer feel the world is out to get me there are no conspiracies i'm not that important i try to see the glass as half full rather than half empty given the opportunity , i look for hope in difficult situations do n't get me wrong i'm not always happy , joyous and free , and i'm no pollyanna but i now realize how much energy negativity saps from me it 's not worth it my energy is too valuable to waste i 'll never get those days spent with vocal negative person back , but they were n't entirely wasted the time spent actually reinforced my desire to stay positive spending that time also reminded me of how i used to be i no longer have to live that way i feel sorry for vocal negative person that person is completely unaware of how much simpler and pleasant life can be i am grateful today to live simply
