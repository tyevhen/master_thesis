things have been a little tough lately while i 've had some good things happening , like the publishing of one of my blog posts on the website , the mighty , i'm still down with my right achilles injury my mood has definitely taken a blow as a result i have not yet been able to run in fact , i have n't trained since injuring it april th i 've crossed the med city marathon , which will be run may th , off my list and i'm not even sure at this point whether i will be able to run my favorite marathon , grandma 's marathon , in mid june i'm so frustrated and disappointed being injured is tough , but feeling low again has been even tougher i'm trying hard not to worry about my mood , and i'm doing everything i can to keep the downward slide to a minimum i'm doing the exercise i'm able to do in an effort to stay in shape and stave off depression i'm throwing myself into my patients at work focusing all my attention on each of them relieves my worries and almost always improves my mood i'm trying to eat well , although this is more difficult for me when my mood is low , but i'm trying i'm also getting the sleep i need while not giving in to the urge to snooze too much or too often it 's taking a concerted effort to keep putting one foot in front of the other , but it 's worth it i do n't want to slide into the abyss getting more information about my injury will certainly help my mood and my anxiety knowing what 's wrong will at least give me some direction i saw my orthopedic doctor last week he took x rays and did an exam he 's worried about a few things he felt and saw , so i'm having an mri on tuesday he 's concerned i have partially torn the achilles tendon hopefully the mri will give us the information we need to proceed mindfully forward until that time , i will do my best to focus forward , attend to my responsibilities , and keep this dip to a situational low so far i think i 've been successful i'm satisfied with that i'm not chipper , but i 've been able to keep the black dog from moving in and i know i will feel better this is a temporary situation , and it will pass it will pass
