ok first of all , i am of the opinion , and correct me if i'm wrong , that women have the tendency to bash themselves a lot and i am a champion at this it has been a very busy weeks and the next two weeks are going to be even more intense i keep trying to tell myself that after we get through this , things will go back to normal bahaha that 's right , because then it will be thanksgiving , nate 's birthday , our anniversary , christmas , and new years oh and nate will start a new school and our daycare situation will completely change yet again yep , that will be much calmer i am feeling very overwhelmed and i just do n't feel like i can give things the attention they deserve here are my curent failings as a mommy i am sitting here blogging when i should be doing my more than words homework that is due tomorrow i went and ran errands without the kids for hours after i worked all day and barely saw them again avoiding doing my homework i served the kids eggs for dinner the slow cooker has only been out once all week paper is taking over my house i mean taking over school papers , mail , research articles , my homework which i am not doing , newspapers , catalogs the house is messy , i ca n't keep up , and i have given up trying i yelled at jack this evening and almost every evening i have no idea how i am going to make it to jack 's emergency dentist appt tomorrow at and back in time to drop him back at school and pick nate up for our class i am sure i will be late and there is nothing i can do about it i know that our family has appointments saturday morning , other than ot , i have no idea what time the others are and have no motivation to find out i have n't called the seed study people back to reschedule our appt was cancelled b c of the hurricane not because i do n't want to but because i have no idea when we will fit this in again i am dreading monday family portraits and then an appt with the boys' autism specialist i 'd rather take jack to the dentist oh wait , doing that tomorrow oh , also instead of doing my homework i colored my hair the gray was so out of hand that i have n't worn my hair down in three weeks i have homework for our marriage counseling that i just remembered crap i have avoided taking the boys for a haircut for months we have portraits on monday when am i going to do it ? ? ? i almost cried when i saw another email from jack 's teacher today stating that his attention is not improving at all , that the school psychologist came and observed him today , and the school board advocate is coming next week i need to grocery shop , do the laundry , mop the floors , forget about the freaking disorganization that needs help i need to go to the ent to try and figure out why i had yet another crippling migraine yesterday yeah , because that 's not at all obvious right ? i have had this referral in hand for over months i need to make another dental appointment for myself more of my punishment for avoiding that for so long i wanted to beat up a five year old boy tonight jack rarely tells me anything about school , but he told me tonight that one of his friends told him he looked like a geek in his wall e costume grrrrrrr i need to make a meal for my friend who had a baby weeks ago and have n't done it yet my husband and i have not been on a date since august i want my mommy or i do now ! all right , is this a list i can tackle ? i think so first and foremost , i need to stop writing this and go do my homework then i am going to bed and tomorrow i will get up , work , go to the appointment , go to class , and fail at a multitude of other things such is life i guess sometimes i wonder if i will ever feel like i have things under control again i am guessing not sorry about the grumbling , but well , that 's just where i am today good night
