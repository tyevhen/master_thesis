often i dread staff development day as it is seems to be the same content wrapped in a new year i have to admit that i sometimes find myself drifting off and my colleagues poking me to wake up however , this year i stayed awake and was actively engaged in the speaker 's presentation do you know your role in child abuse interviewing ? what held my attention the day before fall break ? what kept my attention was a presentation regarding the school counselor 's role in interviewing children in suspected abuse cases maybe it does n't sound that fascinating , but i have found that there is often skewed boundaries in schools when it comes to who should be involved in interviewing the student in addition , i felt the presenter provided clarity in who should interview the student , provided a clear process for interviewing the student , and direction for what to do after the interview if you have found yourself scratching your head in these types of situations , please read on as a mandated reporter , the school counselor normally receives information about potential abuse of a student from a teacher , another student , a family member , or concerned community member in the state of georgia , a mandated reporter has no later than hours to make a report to our department of family and children services dfcs in order to make a report , there must be information provided about the student often , as mandated reporters , we know the law however , many of us are not trained in interviewing thankfully , the georgia center for child advocacy conducted a great training on minimal fact interviewing for school counselors which gave me clarity and direction about my role as an interviewer in potential child abuse cases what is minimal fact interviewing ? minimal fact interviewing is an initial basic fact finding interview that is used by mandated reporters and first responders when abuse has been reported the interview determines if there is enough evidence to make a referral of abuse to state agencies there are five basic pieces of information that you want to know in the interview do n't ask how ! what happened ? where did it occur ? when did it happen ? who was the alleged perpetrator ? are they others who are involved ? detailed fact based questions should not be asked during the minimal fact interview very important do not ask why the abuse happened as it implies the student is somehow to blame types of questions to use in a minimal fact interview free recall open ended questions that allow the student to give information in their own words tell me all about that ? focused recall open ended questions that are focused on particular date or place tell me everything that happened when you get home ? multiple choice the student is given several choices it is important to leave an open ended choice for the student do you live in a house , an apartment , or something else ? questions that you should not used yes or no closed ended questions with only one answer did he touch you ? leading questions that lead a person in a certain direction he touched you , did n't he ? tips for conducting a minimal fact interview conduct the interview in a safe , private place it is important that you train your staff to recognize when you are interviewing a potential abuse victim you may place a special sign on your door that is different from all the signs that you normally post limit the number of participants in the room no more than two keep in mind what you need to ask it is helpful if you have a minimal interviewing handout it is important to build rapport before you start asking personal questions have a conversation and ask non threatening questions building rapport includes learning about the student obtaining important family information asking the student about hobbies , interests , and school sticking to safe subjects some things to avoid in your interview vilifying the offender ! do n't vilify the offender ! avoid saying what he did was terrible and that should have never happened ! avoiding teaching students correct terminology for body parts as the interview answers should be in their own words do not promise anything to the child like i am going to make sure nothing happens to you ! instead , you can say , i want to help you documentation record exactly what you asked and how the student responded avoid using complicated terminology avoid interpretation of the facts record the reactions of the student in the interview avoid interpretation of responses making the report in making the report to the department of family and children services , they want to know what the child said to you in the interview ?
