when we study the pathology of the internal organs , for the spleen , we generally emphasize spleen qi and spleen yang deficiency this is understandable as these two patterns are indeed extremely common by contrast , when it comes to the stomach , we do mention stomach yin deficiency in fact , some people say that this is a well known contradiction the stomach is a yang organ but it suffers from yin deficiency while the spleen is a yin organ but it suffers from yang deficiency all this is true , but in this article , i want to discuss the aetiology , pathology , diagnosis and treatment of spleen yin deficiency historical development although we nowadays emphasize spleen yang deficiency , some of the old classics did often mention spleen yin deficiency for example , the su wen in chapter says that the excessive use of bitter foods or herbs causes spleen qi not to be immersed modern doctors interpret spleen qi not immersed as spleen yin deficiency doctor wang lun ti ming dynasty said that stomach fire may injure spleen yin qin huang shi says in zheng yin mai zhi the spleen may be deficient in yang or yin in spleen yin deficiency , there is deficiency of spleen blood and empty heat arises tang zong hai , author of xue zheng lun bemoaned the fact that , since li dong yuan author of pi wei lun , doctors paid attention to spleen yang but not spleen yin aetiology the aetiology of spleen yin deficiency is clearly dietary it is caused by irregular eating , i e eating in a hurry , eating standing up , eating while working at one s computer , eating late at night , eating while discussing business , eating while in a state of worry , etc however , besides the dietary causes , spleen yin deficiency may also be caused by emotional stress related to worry and pensiveness and by excessive physical work that depletes the spleen clinical manifestations the main clinical manifestations of spleen deficiency are poor appetite , distension after eating , dry stools , dry mouth and throat , dry lips , thin body , dull complexion without lustre , night sweating , palm heat only if there is empty heat , bleeding in small quantity , tongue without coating red if there is empty heat , fine pulse please note that empty heat does derive from yin deficiency but someone may have yin deficiency for years before empty heat develops the tongue is in fact the best clinical sign to distinguish when yin deficiency has given rise to empty heat if the tongue lacks a coating but it is not red , there is yin deficiency without empty heat if the tongue lacks a coating and it is red , then there is yin deficiency and empty heat plates and and fig plate no coating , normal colour plate no coating , red colour fig progression of yin deficiency and development of empty heat the spleen controls yun hua , i e transportation and transformation of food essences yun hua is impaired not only when spleen yang si deficient but also when spleen yin is deficient , hence the lack of appetite the yin deficiency causes the loss of weight and therefore thin body spleen yin includes blood and ying and for this reason spleen yin deficiency may cause bleeding such as in the stools , vomit or under the skin please note the sign of dry lips as this is quite a key sign of spleen yin deficiency chinese journals often include symptoms and signs of empty heat with spleen yin deficiency and they say that this pattern cause the flaring up of the pathological minister fire i tend to disagree with this view in chronic , long standing cases , spleen yin deficiency can indeed give rise to empty heat but , in very many cases , there is just yin deficiency without empty heat see fig and plates and above pathology dr hong guang huai makes an important differentiation between stomach yin and spleen yin deficiency he says that in stomach yin deficiency there is a deficiency of fluids while in spleen yin deficiency there is a deficiency of ying and blood they are both yin deficiency as fluids , ying and blood are all part of yin diagnosis dr mao jiong divides the clinical manifestations of spleen yin deficiency into three groups and this may help the diagnostic process the three groups are digestive symptoms abdominal distension , poor appetite , dry stools yin deficiency symptoms dryness dry mouth and throat , dry lips lack of nourishment signs dull complexion , thin body , dry skin as mentioned above , dry lips is quite a key , distinctive sign of spleen yin deficiency another very distinctive sign are small transversal cracks on the sides of the tongue plates plate spleen yin deficiency cracks plate spleen yin deficiency cracks plate spleen yin deficiency cracks herbal treatment one must nourish yin , strengthen the spleen , nourish ying and lift fluids doctor wang guang jun summarizes the treatment in four words sweet , sour , moisten , lift by sweet he means using herbs and foods with a sweet taste and the main herbs he advocates are huang

means the use of herbs that are rich in fluids such as lian rou lotus fruit by lifting he means the use of herbs that lift qi such as ge gen radix puerariae and sheng ma rhizoma cimicifugae bearing
