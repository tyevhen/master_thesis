most people like to feel a sense of power , a degree of autonomy and an enthusiasm in their work feeling empowered , appreciated , creative , and fairly compensated are all important factors that usually contribute to overall work satisfaction as a psychotherapist in nyc , i hear many stories from clients who are not satisfied with their work they feel unappreciated , stifled , and stuck even though they feel uninspired by their current work , they 're not sure what else they would like to do , and they come to see me to explore and overcome these issues career change do you feel stifled and stuck in your current career ? a desire for career change sometimes , the desire for change might begin with a vague sense that work is not as satisfying as it once was if this feeling continues to grow over time , it can lead to a certain malaise and inertia , especially if you do n't take steps to at least explore other options often , clients will tell me that they were once very happy with their work , but they 're no longer satisfied in many instances , the work is the same , the boss is the same , the colleagues remain the same , but something in these clients has changed exactly what has changed in them is not always clear to them at first but , often , on some level , they have outgrown their job and they want more or something different career change over the span of a life time it 's not unusual these days to change careers several times over the span of a life time someone might start out in one type of career after college , often influenced by family or friends and , as time passes and they develop other interests , they desire something new they might return to college or get a certification at a continuing education program to transition to another type of career often , people in their s and s find that doing the same type of work that they 've done for most of their lives no longer suits them they want to continue to work and feel productive , but not in their current careers they want something new that they can feel enthusiastic about this does n't necessarily mean that they 're going through some sort of mid life crisis , as many people might say it 's just a common occurrence as people change and outgrow their current careers retirement is different nowadays it used to be that most people retired and that was that they stayed home , rested , took it easy , and played with their grandchildren and if that 's what you want , that 's okay but these days , many people , who retire in their s , s or later and who are in good health , do n't usually want to stop working they want to work and feel productive in a career , but not doing the same type of work that they did for most of their lives maybe they stuck with a certain career because it afforded them a certain lifestyle , it paid for the mortgage and their children 's college tuition or for other important reasons but for many people , now that they 've retired from that career , they finally have the opportunity to do what they 've always really wanted to do but could n't do for whatever reasons for instance , i hear many stories about corporate executives who retire and decide to teach , teachers who retire and decide to go into sales , salespeople who retire and decide to start their own business , business owners who retire and decide to indulge their artistic side , and so on if you 're in good health and you no longer have the financial pressures and responsibilities that you once had , why not ? feeling stuck and uninspired in your career ? whatever your current career situation might be , if you 're feel stuck and uninspired in your current work , you owe it to yourself to explore other options networking and talking to other people about their work , especially if their work is different from what you do now , can give you some ideas doing some soul searching about what 's important to you and what you could see yourself doing is also essential start taking steps the important thing is to start taking steps , no matter how small , to get yourself unstuck from your current situation feeling empowered in your career career change getting help for many people , who feel stuck in their careers and feel the need for career change , talking to a licensed mental health professional who has expertise in this area can be helpful in terms of getting unstuck i'm a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr , and somatic experiencing therapist who is a former human resource manager i work with individual adults and couples i have helped many clients to get motivated so they can find fulfilling careers to find out more about me , visit my web site josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist t set up a consultation , call me at photo credit adam foster codefor via photopin cc
