i ve ordered a month s worth of st john s wort i tried taking this once before and it had a strange affect on me rather than taking the edge off of any anxiety and giving me a break from my depression , it made my emotions extremely raw events that would have typically been just a little disappointing were more likely to send me into a flying rage or sobbing it was strange and i quickly quit the stuff but i was at a job that i hated and this situation dominated my thoughts at the time my life is very different now so i m going to give it another try the main reason why is that i really want to find a non prescription solution and st john s wort is universally recognized as one of the best herbal remedies for depression i ve also read that it s good for my social anxiety problem so , despite my past experience , i have high hopes can anyone say placebo effect ? i plan to stick to it for more than just a few days despite how i feel i wonder , though , if that rage and sadness was an expression of how much i hated that job and my boss at the time things that i hadn t really dealt with because the veil of depression goes a long way to numb other sources of pain it should arrive any day
