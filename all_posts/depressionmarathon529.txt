i found out this afternoon why i 've been feeling like crap for days i 've got pneumonia it makes sense i 've had this before i have to admit , when i went for that nice run last thursday only to have my health decline over the next several days , i began to worry that 's exactly what happened the last time i had pneumonia i felt well enough to go for a run but then felt worse afterward oh well it is what it is i have pneumonia actually , it 's almost a relief to have a diagnosable condition now i do n't feel so guilty about stepping out of work early yesterday and today and i 'll certainly give myself more permission to nap as needed from now on of course , i'm hoping to get over this as quickly as possible i worry a little about my mood and i do want to get back to the roads and the gym as soon as i can but for now , i'm going back to bed
