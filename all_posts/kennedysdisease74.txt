yesterday it was degrees with a mph north wind the high was this morning , it is degrees with the high forecast for all this coming week the lows are to be in the mid to high teens with daily highs in the low to mid thirties i thought we moved to the sun belt ? as you have gathered from earlier posts , cold weather no longer agrees with me actually , it is the wind as much as the cold that is a problem gusting north winds makes being outdoors miserable we live on a ridge overlooking a valley that is several miles long running north to south the valley becomes a wind tunnel when the north winds blow often , the gusts will reach mph i blame the yankees no , not the baseball team for these gusts they want to share their misery with all of us who live in the sun belt instead of my five one half hour walks with fred , i have been only taking him out four times a day when it is this cold , however , we are down to two or three walks a day by the time i return from our walks my left thumb no longer works at all and my fingers do not function very well either it is difficult to unhook the top button on your jeans without a working thumb moreover , it is almost impossible to button a shirt or hold a glass of water in my left hand for about an hour after returning from a walk yes , i use hot hands' inserted in my choppers even although they help , they do not do enough good when the temperatures are this cold to make matters worse , my legs do not work very well either after these outings i asked my wife if she wanted to take fred for a walk this morning even though i was only kidding maybe not , she declined some people , including my wife , have commented that i should not take fred out when it is this cold in my opinion , that is not the answer how do i explain to my best friend bff that i think it is too cold to go for a walk ? he knows it is cold , but he likes his walks because his olfactory system starts working overtime the beagle is second only to the bloodhound in its capabilities to follow a scent when the ground is cold , and especially if there is a frost , fred goes crazy if we did not go for walks , i would be depriving him of one of his true joys in life the other is eating this morning , as soon as fred ate , he jumped into the golf cart and was ready to go when i told him we had to wait until it warmed up a little , he jumped down , nudged my legs with his front paws , and then jumped back into the cart talk about putting a guilt trip for me ! yes , i know i was born and raised in minnesota and up there these conditions would be considered spring like and , yes , i use to hunt , camp , ice skate , ski and fish in temperatures far worse than this none of that matters today i am a wimp and i do not like it one bit in keeping with my promise to see the good in all things , i have found something favorable with this situation in about sixty days , the average temperature will be in the 's and 's again i just need to start a short timers calendar and begin crossing off the days before i know it , fred and i will be frolicking in spring like temperatures again until the weather warms up , i will have to put up with these temperatures i am not going to say another word about the cold not complain right , let 's see if i can keep that promise i will sign off for now we will talk again soon it is hard telling how long that will be because my fingers need to thaw out first , the wimp
