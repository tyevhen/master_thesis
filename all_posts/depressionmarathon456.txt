i got a phone call early friday morning it was d he asked if i wanted some company for the weekend of course , i said yes ! what a great surprise ! he 's an accountant , and this is his busiest time of year , so we were n't sure he 'd be able to come here again until after tax day , april th but he had an unexpected lull in his schedule , and he was able to get away i was so happy ! i had absolutely no plans for the weekend , and i had been feeling a bit sorry for myself d 's visit cured my woes he arrived around pm friday night it was so nice to see him ! he got to meet jet for the first time , and jet won him over in no time at all jet really loved d , too all three of us had a great weekend ! yesterday we went to the movie silver linings playbook with my friends , bill and cindy i was interested in seeing it because the main character had bipolar disorder after seeing the film , i understood why it was nominated for several academy awards while it was a somewhat predictable feel good story , the acting was quite good we all enjoyed it very much as usual , it was difficult to say goodbye to d today he had to leave earlier than usual due to the unpredictable stormy weather we were experiencing prior to his departure , we went out for a nice , romantic brunch at one of the finer restaurants in town it was really nice i'm still smiling as a result of my unexpectedly eventful weekend it was so great to spend time with d it 's never enough time , but i do n't worry about that i'm grateful he made time for me , not to mention the hour drive , despite his busy work schedule our relationship is going well slowly but surely we seem to be building something good i'm grateful for that , too
