i had my first night terror not long after the onset of severe depression it was a horrific experience that reminded me of when i had been delirious as a child while running a very high fever the difference here was that it occured as i was falling asleep , and i was not sick a night terror is an extremely unpleasant form of nightmare , differing greatly in intensity night terrors either develop from a nightmare during deep sleep , or trigger while falling asleep from my experiences , night terrors differ from nightmares in two areas firstly , a night terror would continue even after i woke up somehow , although i was completely conscious and able to talk , my subconscious mind continued dreaming , overlaying the horror of the dream upon consciousness , like two overhead transparencies , one laid upon the other , distorting both but the worst aspect of night terrors was the terror aspect itself the night terror would establish a set of rational , logical rules , and would then break them completely , so that would could not be , was so that what could not happen , happened and the rational , logical part of my mind completely rebelled in horror as the rational and logical rules of the dream world were warped and twisted into something impossible , inconceivable that defied all reason i suffered a few night terrors during depression , never knowing what they were as i slowly recovered from depression , their frequency reduced until they ceased almost altogether i did notice that times of extreme stress were a common trigger here is an example of a night terror while still recovering from depression , i had to go to the usa by myself to attend a trade fair i arrived at the hotel late at night , only to find that my friend who was supposed to meet me was not there , and had left no message going to the arranged hotel room , i found that all of my friend 's co workers were asleep there was a makeshift bed was in the middle of the room , so i got in and went to sleep due to that stressful environment , a night terror hit me that night i dreamed that upon checking out of the hotel , i had to pay , instead of my mind completely rebelled at this impossible scenario , and though i tore myself awake , the night terror simply kept on going after i got married , my wife witnessed me having a night terror in the middle of the night , and seeing the dream continue after i woke up , she wondered if it was related to my complex partial epilepsy so the next time i saw my neurologist , i told him about them , fearing i was having seizures again , although on medication but the neurologist just laughed , and said , 'oh , you were having a night terror ' and he proceeded to explain that they were just really bad nightmares , and nothing to worry about at all that knowledge brought relief , and the truth that they were nothing to fear set me free from worrying about them i also found some techniques to deal with them as they often trigger while drifting off to sleep , i learned how to recognise when one was developing , and how to immediately force my dream into an entirely different direction , stopping it becoming a night terror waking myself at that stage was another way of stopping them developing if a night terror triggered during deep sleep , i would wake myself up , and although the night terror continued while i was conscious , i would turn on my bedlamp , stare at it , sit up for a while , and then i would turn the light off and lay back down to sleep even though the night terror was still going , i would press into the lord and take refuge in him , and reassure myself that it was nothing to fear and would stop soon before long , it would stop and i would fall back asleep psalm niv he who dwells in the shelter of the most high will rest in the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord , he is my refuge and my fortress , my god , in whom i trust surely he will save you from the fowler 's snare and from the deadly pestilence he will cover you with his feathers , and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart you will not fear the terror of night , nor the arrow that flies by day , nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness , nor the plague that destroys at midday
