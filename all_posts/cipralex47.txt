had couple of new experiences lately , but this post will focus on the more interesting one it will deal mostly with approach anxiety and social issues here we go you see , couple of days ago i went out with friends to have a drink in a nice local pub , got dressed nice and lately i'm in the mood to get out of the house all the time , or maybe i'm in the mood to no stay in the house all the time anyways we decided to go out to get a drink , so my friend picked me up and we drove the place there was nice dub music and nice atmosphere , the place was n't too crowded maybe it was still early anyways , we were talking and drinking , i talked with the bar tender a bit and with my friends , than the place started to get crowded and this group of two hot girls and this guy came in and sat at the other end of the place then i felt this feeling again , like i usually would , i just wanted to get up and start talking with one of those girls , drank another beer , than in seconds i went over there and started talking to the all group , and while i'm actually doing it , walking up to a group of complete strangers and talking to them i could hear my self saying in my head dude , this is so easy ! it so easy ! they were really nice , we had some chit chat and a smoke , i found out she 's this guy girl friend and the other girl is his sister , so nothing romantic came out of this but , i was so amazed that i did that ok ok so i drank some beers before never the less , i could never do that and never have done that before , because usually i would get panic attack just thinking about doing something like this , later in the same bar i went downstairs to the level below and started making eye contact with this other girl , i felt as if i could act on it and hit on her but something told me to end this night with the success i already had this was amazing i think my friends looked at me with open jaws that was so unlike me but i hope this is just the begriming of the upgraded me released the day after was a bit fuzzy because i drank so much , so i was very tired today i'm good , a bit bored but good i know what you 're wondering what about the blind date well there 's a storm going on lately , we 're waiting for the weather to get better and than we will meet , hopefully in a day or two but worry not , you 'll be the first to know how it went note to self learn to enjoy things , not just do em love you all and take care ! email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
