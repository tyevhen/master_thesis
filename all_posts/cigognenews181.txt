now with the new work on epigenetics we have to ask the question which has the most impact on influence on us , genes or epigenes what happens to the genes when they meet experience ? so maybe it is not either or but both at once that is how does the gene affect experience , epigenetics ? it is obvious that genes affect the brain affect our thinking , reasoning and understanding but the genes and how they behave are dependent on experience the genes interact and affect each other , as well and they mix with epigenes to merge and drive symptoms and behavior the new article on this is reporting a survey of swedish students , over , of them , re family history , sexual abuse , delinquency , quality of rapport with parents and many other factors see http www newsweek com new study identifies genes interact environment increase antisocial behaviour one thing they found , is what we find those females who had an abusive childhood have a high activity variant of the maoa gene that translated into enhanced ant social behavior the maoa gene is a brain enzyme that breaks down certain elements serotonin and releases energy those who carry low serotonin variant and who had bad childhoods were likely to be more aggressive this is the result of the admixture of genetics and epigenetics what the genes do is not cause certain behaviors but form a crucible for living experience to play on them in order to induce behavior if there were a loving environment then those genes will not supply the susceptibility to delinquency so we begin to see how experience interacts with genetics to produce who we are and what symptoms we will suffer it is not that we didn t already know about this , but we now begin to have research evidence to confirm it so is criminal behavior genetic ? yes , in part , and no , in another part if we leave out experience then we only have half the story and if we confine our research to one part we will go off track when we hear that something is genetic we need to hear the whole story in our therapy we get the whole story because we see the whole person reacting and when we extract a load of pain from him or her , we see what is left it gives us a better view of what is genetic and non genetic is homosexuality genetic ? we have successfully treated it , which makes the assumption that it is a disease let me clarify in every neurosis there is a detour or a dysfunction of certain biologic and neurologic elements sometimes it feminizes the man i have cited many animal studies to support this view , and the fact that with no special intent we have altered this tendency in only some patients as the sexual apparatus begins to mature , there can be experience that changes the sexual orientation yes , but my patients say , but i have felt this way all of my life and i say , i agree but the dysfunction may largely predate memory and verbal explanation in other words the changes can begin in the womb and accumulate during the birth process and for a few years afterwards i have no stake in whether it is genetic or not , but experience dictates to me the experiential factors that may play a role , and only in some cases after all , we do not treat every homosexual patient for his or her sexual orientation most do not want to change sexual orientation at all , but simply want to get rid of their depression , anxiety or anger we do not dictate what aspect is to be treated the patient dictates and we follow in the cases of change we never started out to change any orientation it came as a surprise when this happened i asked a female patient what will you do now with your lover ? she said we won t be lovers but we will be close friends , just as we always have i should add that without descending down deep in the brain where the imprinted culprit lives , it is most often impossible to change anyone in any profound way all this is a way of saying chacun sa vie , everyone his own life and chooses how she or he wants to live it i have no grand scheme for anyone , and no special style of life for anyone if they want to start college , that is fine if they don t , that is also fine it is their life and not mine to direct it i never tell them they should get married or divorced when they get themselves back they will decide , usually wisely what a relief for me and my therapists , and what a relief for patient who does not need to follow anyone s dictates not to have to live up to anyone else s values or desires everyone relax !
