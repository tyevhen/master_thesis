when i was in medical school , there were these medications that were used to treat hallucinations and delusions what we psychiatrists call psychosis and sometimes extreme agitation they were the neuroleptics , and they worked medicines like thorazine , and haldol , and mellaril , and navane oh , and like prolixin , too they worked , but they came with a horrible stigma and lousy side effects some people tolerated them with no problems , some people even preferred how they felt when they were on them , but a lot of people found them to be pretty awful some made patients very tired this is why they are also referred to as major tranquilizers others were less sedating , but they made people very stiff a side effect called parkinsonism because they chemically gave people a temporary state similar to parkinsons' disease you can sometimes look at someone and know they are on medication , and this is never good and sometimes they caused a permanent , irreversible movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia okay , so people really do n't like taking these medications , and sometimes they can be fine tuned with other medications to halt the side effects , but they come with a price by the time i was a resident , the new generation of antipsychotics had come along risperdal , zyprexa , geodon , abilify , seroquel , invega , the list marches on these medications also worked and people did n't mind taking them okay , some people did n't mind taking them they are also used for mood stabilization , to calm agitated states , for mania , as augmentation for depression , and sometimes for sleep they are n't addictive , they are n't as stigmatized , and the immediate side effects are n't so troublesome it 's much easier to get patients to consider taking them and my experience is that in the short run , they help a lot of people feel better and function better the down side has been that in some people they cause weight gain , diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia hyperlipidemia we do n't seem to know who will have these problems clearly , not every one does and sometimes people are so sick without them that we 're stuck fixing one disease while contributing to , or causing , another , and that needs treatment , too and did i mention that these medications cost a fortune if that 's not enough , we have to order regular blood tests to monitor for the problems they cause , and patients may need more and expensive medications to treat the conditions the medicines cause so how much does it cost to stay sane ? the state of maryland , apparently , spends million a year for atypical antipsychotics these newer medications for patients with medicaid , and i suppose for uninsured patients in the hospital this does n't count the patients who self pay , or have private insurance , or who get samples from their doctor , or who have medicare so the cost of keeping my state sane is pretty high so far , only one of these medications , risperidone , is available in a generic okay , so i price shopped i called some pharmacies , and here 's the price for pills remember , some people take higher doses i priced middle range doses and some patients take several pills a day drug walgreens cvs sam s club independent risperidone risperdal brand , mg risperidone generic , mg quetiapine seroquel brand , mg quetiapine seroquel brand , mg haloperidol haldol brand , mg aripiprazole abilify brand , mg hmmm , so there 's a pill differential for abilify , depending on where you get it ? oh , and i wondered about the generic risperidone at cvs and at a local independent pharmacy ? i asked the pharmacist to check it twice , and then i called a second mom pop pharmacy , and their price was just under if you pay cash , it 's worth shopping around are these the prices your insurance company pays ? i doubt it they negotiate deals and have formularies i asked how much the state pays for the medications for a patient with medicaid , and none of the pharmacists i asked could tell me one said it was top secret okay one note on haldol , the older generation medication i'm not sure if the price was for generic or name brand , the others were all for the generic
