oh deer er , dear it 's been three weeks since my last blog post i have a good excuse i was having fun rushing mountain water is very cold standing on the top of a mountain as a lightening storm rolls in is rather impressive i enjoyed watching a hawk in flight and waking up in the middle of the night as some type of wildlife rummaged through the campsite i even enjoyed the hailstorm , except for maybe the part about wondering whether the tent would be gone when it was all over i saw loads of deer including the one that rummaged through the campsite , a bear it looked at me and was obviously sniffing for beef jerky fortunately i was n't the one carrying it , lots of cold rushing water and water falls , and even a skunk see reduced picture my favorite find was this very unusual looking mushroom it was huge as well as being a bright yellow orange color after a bit of googling i think i 've got it identified , but if any of you out there really know mushrooms and can tell me for sure i 'd appreciate it i think it 's a jack o'lantern mushroom omphalotus illudens which is known to be toxic somehow it seemed rather fitting that poisonous plants should be part of a forensic psychiatrist 's vacation experience there were no historical prisons in the mountains , so i had to find something forensically relevant
