i love downtown montreal so damn much , especially in the summer i went downtown yesterday with my mom , emi , ty , and nick ty is here visiting again the fringe festival is going on right now , so there was plenty of activity as i think of what to write , the sensory impressions are what come to mind first the smell of cigarettes , weed , and good food the sound of cars , music , laughter and voices the sight of a numerous amount of people dyed bright hair , dreadlocks , bright summer dresses , studded everything , cool piercings we headed down in the afternoon , and as we walked along the streets , the first thing i noticed were the colours the bright purple of someones railings street art splashed on multiple walls , bright colours , faces , abstract scenes i ca n't understand why some people do n't see the value in such art to me it 's a beautiful art form , and the artists who create it are no less talented than their more traditional counterparts ! we passed a small garage sale on our way , and i bought another pin for my purse i 'll have to post a picture of my small but ever growing pin collection sometime soon in the square where the folk music was being played , we hung around briefly cigarette smoke hung in the air , and the twang of bluegrass folk sang in my ears since it was n't really our type of music , we left my mom there to listen while the rest of us threaded our way through the band booths , poster plastered temporary walls , and eclectically dressed people some sounds we did like were the fringe fest cabaret , a motley group of people who wandered through the streets in pirate gypsy esque costumes , playing plaintive gypsy tunes we passed them several times , and always enjoyed their music and the juggler , in ty 's case there is n't any feeling quite like wandering down the street with friends , the sun beating down and warming my back , watching the people that pass , taking in the sights , sounds , smells when we headed back to meet my mom a little while later , we were all slightly hungry , so after applying a few temporary tattoos supplied by one of the shows , we started on the twenty minute walk that would bring us to a cafe that was selling vegan food by donation it was a lovely little fair trade , vegetarian cafe , with friendly people we happily consumed millet pie , ginger cake , and spiked fruit juice with much happiness , at least on my part ! afterwards , we wandered around for a while , ty bought a new hand drum , and we headed home , sweaty , tired , and sore footed the day ended on a worse note than it had started on , but overall , it was still a good day next saturday , we 're going downtown to see the fireworks every year montreal hosts an international fireworks competition , so the shows are truly spectacular , and we 'll be there again at least once more this week for an outdoor concert i love this city i really do and i love long summer days wandering it 's streets , taking in everything , and just enjoying the vibrancy that is all around me i'm biased , of course , but i truly believe that i live near one of the greatest cities there is ! peace , idzie you might also like food love trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! rise against food food food linkwithin
