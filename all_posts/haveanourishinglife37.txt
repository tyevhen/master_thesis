some weight fears are accompanying my daily thoughts am i getting too big ? will i get too big ? have i gained too much weight ? will i gain too much weight ? what if the doctors and nurses tell me i ve gain enough weight already ? unfortunately , i did happen to find out what my current weight is every appointment , i try hard to not look when they weigh me at the doctor s office but when i was leaving , i was handed a paper with all my stats including my weight now i can t get that number out of my head it haunts me my weight gain is nearing the appropriate pregnancy weight gain amount and that truly scares me well , what really scares me is the doctors and the nurses just the thought of possibly being confronted about my weight makes me want to dramatically change my eating habits recently , i ve found myself questioning if i should be eating this or that or if i should be exercising more i ve been getting more and more anxious around food at my last pre natal visit , i measured a little big now , it s impossible for me to get that fact out of my mind i m bigger than i should be my irrational eating disordered brain translates that to mean that i am ugly , undesirable , and inferior random strangers have made stupid comments like you re about ready to pop , huh ? and not much longer now ? and any day now um , no , i still have a ways to go i have three more months , but thanks for making me feel like crap in my head , i want to tell them off , but i smile and nod the charitable thing to do would be to pray for them , father , forgive them for they know not what they do i know people mean well even saying things like you look good ! is intended as a compliment , but i see it as an ultimatum obviously , that person is talking about how i look , but the only thing i hear is that they are noticing how i look now , i feel pressured to always look good some people are under the assumption that first time moms don t get as big i m a tall person , i wasn t ever small to begin with this comparing is another reason to get down on myself slowly , these appearance weight comments along with my fear of doctors telling me not to gain anymore weight are chipping away at my self worth it s getting more and more difficult to fight eating disorder temptations i am trying to embrace the weight gain and realize that it is necessary for the development of my unborn child i want to nourish this child and take care of his or her needs i want to relax and not feel like i have to hold it in or hide it i want to let there be room in my belly for the baby to move around and eventually turn head down but i m fighting an uphill battle and because of my past body image issues , i can be easily shaken in my home , i am safe i can listen to soothing music and engage in relaxing activities i surround myself with body positive phrases and beliefs i don t have internet or tv to infiltrate my positive sanctuary but , when i leave my home , i m susceptible to people making stupid comments or comparing and contrasting i have to witness other people body bash themselves or people they know people talk about weight loss and eating healthy and looking a certain way there are ads and commercials and a bombardment of straight up negativity in the world it makes me want to just stay at home all the time so , if you notice me becoming a hermit , it s because i can t take it anymore until , i have a more stable body image , i cannot live in this culture i know , i know becoming agoraphobic is not a good solution to my problems i just do n't know what to do yet
