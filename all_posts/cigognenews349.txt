i have noted for decades now that there are critical windows when events have their major impact windows that seem to open and close at specific biologic timeframes i have written about love and when it must happen there is a new study just out that speaks more to the notion of the critical window it is found in scientific american oct , the story of a lonely brain read the scientific american article here they start out the article noting that we are social animals , and when we cannot be social early on , we begin to suffer they use brain development as key example , demonstrating the difference between the evolution of our grey matter the thinking brain , and our white matter which lies below and has to do with connections between cells , and is largely subcortical as white matter becomes myelinated it develops into a functioning cell that permits rapid response where impulses travel at optimim speed it is the fatty material that covers the cell that allows it to become functional spreading the message over long distances in the brain for some white matter the myelinization continues on into adulthood and we go on learning and evolving the authors point out that children who grew up in orphanages had deficient myelin sheaths and less white matter , which made learning more difficult if they were soon put into a loving foster home there was no such damage their conclusion was that placement in foster homes when early enough and during a critical period avoided serious brain damage in short , they could catch up neurologically part of what helps produce myelin are the oligodendrocytes isolated , non social mice had stunted oligodendrocytes oligos which were often malformed and had fewer branches and worse , the nerve cells connecting the right and left brains were fewer and thinner in other words , the ability to transmit emotional information from right to left brain is diminished the point of this was that mice that were isolated very early on had the greatest damage those who isolated later on did not have this the damage had to be during the critical window that is when there is the greatest impact on the system rhesus monkeys raised in isolation had smaller sized corpus callosum they also had great learning difficulties all this to say what should be clear by now that there is a critical period when love can have its maximum and longest duration any love outside that period will have much less of an impact this is what they found with myelin sheaths that signal the readiness of a cell to fire if the mice were isolated outside the critical period , there is minimal impact so to sum up mice who were deprived of social contact during a critical window had lifelong damage and learning problems so why do n't they do good at school when they are fifteen ? maybe we should look at much earlier times
