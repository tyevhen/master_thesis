incarceration nations , by baz dreisinger dr dreisinger travels to different prisons around the world , giving day seminars to the prisoners and comparing the pros and cons of each prison system i admit this book was n't quite what i expected i expected it to have more complaints with evidence about the problems of overincarceration although it did contain such comments , that was not the point of the book it was a fascinating description of different prisons throughout the world and what they were doing right and wrong in rehabilitating their inmates she left some prisons feeling uplifted and left others feeling quite depressed i found the book quite interesting even if it was n't quite what i expected
