i'm feeling ambivalent about writing today and that 's probably not the best opening line with which to attract your attention let me explain i'm feeling ambivalent about writing because i do n't feel like i have much to offer about what is currently happening i'm caught wanting to do more than just report what 's happening i feel an obligation , as the writer of this blog , to find or create some meaning out of the recent events and i guess i'm not feeling able to do that on this day so here goes the reporting there have been two deaths in the past few days which have hit close to home last night i attended the service for a local man a political figure who was a member of my church he died suddenly last week while i would n't say he and i were friends , his wife and i are more acquainted , i did enjoy and respect this man he was a talented stained glass artist he was a political activist who stood up for the little man , including those of us with mental illness , and his wacky , dry sense of humor was second to none his presence will be missed in our church and in this community i thought about this man and his family all night and into this morning he and his wife were soul mates , still deeply in love years later so tragic and then i signed into facebook this morning and discovered a pillar of our aa community lost his wife yesterday afternoon this man is beloved in our local aa crowd , and while his wife has been sick , i do n't think her death was necessarily expected similar to the couple from my church , this man and his wife also shared a deep , abiding love and friendship ironically , one day after losing his wife , this man celebrated his th year of sobriety at our aa meeting tonight wow when he accepted his year medallion there was n't a dry eye in the house it was intense i so , so respect this man , too i will be offering condolences at the exact same funeral home again tomorrow night and that 's all i 've got is there a take home message in two close to home deaths , each of which separated one soul mate from the other , from two well respected families within a week ? i do n't know it is what it is life and death i do n't know what else to say
