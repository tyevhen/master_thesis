here 's a cross section from a liver containing black and green bile as you know , the ancients blamed melancholy on an overabundance of one of the four humors , namely black bile i'm sure my liver looks worse home internet service has been cut off for now , so i may be blogging more infrequently if we do get it restored , it will only be dial up , where there is enough time to commit suicide between downloads , and where such waiting may indeed drive one to suicide i woke up today at pm due to a new antipsychotic i initiated zyprexa , though my shrink wanted me to wait a week i couldn t bear to wait i ve been so discouraged i ve begun to think of depression as a condition not an illness at the end of july i will have matched my longest depression of , months that one was cut short by electroconvulsive therapy , thankfully , something unavailable to me now because i make too much for the government to help me but not enough to afford health insurance i should apply for ssi but am told the process is so time consuming that i had thought i would be out of this depression before medicare would pay for ect months later that appears as a very bad idea , but there is also a strong pride within me that would refuse government help as a former taxpayer that is also bad thinking this depression has not been as intense as the depression , mainly because at i have a foundation of knowledge that gives me hope beyond my present symptoms it doesn t make the pain less painful , just less final but the idea that depression could be my life condition does scare me here i would normally begin to weep but the zyprexa has the upper hand also , as those of you know who have followed my journey , i have had brief spells of euthymia during this depression , only to have them crushed in my worst depression there was no relief whatsoever before ben franklin flew a kite from my head imagine that your brain was your liver and you had hepatitis c or say you were a kidney that needed dialysis but couldn t afford it , or a hip joint whose pain no cane could ameliorate but without funds to be replaced these are metaphors to help explain manic depression to those who don t suffer it because the disease involves the brain directly , the ego , the consciousness that says i , the brain , in what normally would not be faulty logic , becomes convinced that it , the brain , is the cause of the disease rather than a victim of the disease imagine if the liver blamed itself for hepatitis when it was really a contaminated needle if the kidney blamed itself when its demise was due to lupus or if the hip named itself the guilty party when every septuagenarian suffers hip degeneration the beauty of hepatitis , nephropathy and degenerative arthritis is that the organs and joints involved do not harbor consciousness , thus can t blame themselves imagine i m such a bad hip i m a complete fuck up why did i let the protective cartilage wear down ? i should have told her to stop jogging in her fifties but would she have listened ? woe is me , i am only pain , pain is all i am if only i could be replaced ! if your brain were in your hip , that s how it would sound this is an oversimplification of a complex disease , yet all metaphorical parallels for other processes suffer some distorting parallax in this case i think the comparison apt on the poetry front , although i have given up writing it , i still have submissions pending one i sent to new zealand magazine by post today i received an acceptance of the poem , strangers per usual i thought it the weakest poem in the lot it was a toss off , something i scribbled down about an experience in a matter of minutes i find that such toss offs fare far better with editors than what i consider my best poems , poems not only inspired but also labored over , with each word and line mouthed out loud and carefully considered this is no criticism of editors or this fine magazine i'm glad to be accepted by anybody , seeing as how i ca n't accept myself what i think my best is not what editors want they want fresh experience transmitted photos of the human condition home movie clips the death of confessional poetry , whose heyday was the s , has been much exaggerated , and with six billion humans , say billion of them literate , our reserve of individual experience is still holding still , experience is not an inexhaustible resource the romantics , like coleridge , shelly and keats , hailed fancy their word for imagination as the basis of poetry thus we have great poems like the rime of the ancient mariner and the eve of saint agnes , both of them imagined romantics thought imagination , or the power of fictional creation , to be the heart of poetry nowadays it is the reverse only real experience , or at best creative non fiction , satisfies editors craving for the real what this means for me is that what i consider my lesser poems , my toss offs , will always be preferred over my better ones i ever return to writing poetry , i must throw away my classical prejudices and write for the moment my essay on inductive and deductive poetry will soon appear in blue fifth review and does a nice job of dissecting these preferences meanwhile , in between crying jags and thoughts of hopelessness , impending impoverishment and the annihilation of the self , i continue to labor over my airport novel i m three quarters of the way through but have come upon a knotty problem the idea and the execution of the supposed climactic ending simply stink there is less tension in the conclusion of the novel than what precedes it , a death knell for any story so i must start nearly from scratch and re think the whole section my self imposed deadline is august , when the writer s conference begins kathleen has offered to read the first three quarters of the book to help me realize an ending i am loathe to inflict such suffering on her but have agreed to do so , as i am neither at my wit s end nor beginning i am without wit and short on fancy kilorats , ce
