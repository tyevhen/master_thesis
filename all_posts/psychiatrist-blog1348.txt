or maybe just this shrink i 've figured out something about myself i'm a voyeur , i love having an outside view into the window of other people 's lives without participating in a way , it 's sort of what being a psychiatrist is about we spend all day listening to the things other people have done , the relationships they 've been part of , the trips they 've taken , the dreams they dream , even the movies they 've seen and the books they 've read i spend far more time listening than doing myself and sometimes i feel i'm the master of the vicarious life oh , not really running a blog , for example , shrink rap , has elements of this we throw out stories , or ideas , and people write in their thoughts in the comment section sometimes they answer each other and sometimes they use the original idea as a springboard to go someplace totally new warning roy forbids this i read the comments , i watch it unfold sometimes something riles me enough to comment , sometimes a comment inspires a new post , sometimes i feel a need to address a comment or say thanks for a compliment mostly i just watch as the next chapter comes in it 's part of why i love reading fat doctor , i like sitting back and reading the next chapter of the very colorful life of some person i 've never met , never will meet , and still feel some connection to last week , i joined my neighborhood 's list serve i'm getting maybe emails a day , from people i know or do n't , on and on about the most random of things our neighborhood has an obama group oops , now we have a mccain group , too sarah palin shoots moose what to do about incessantly barking dogs , someone found a dead pigeon the other day , bonnie needs a new microwave , joan has a large plant to give away , and many people know exactly what you should do with unwanted clothes and if no one wants that old freezer , roberto says to donate it to the goodwill i was n't there for it , but i hear people got really inflamed over issues of deer control i could use a new carpool , and oh , i saw a rat in the alley the other day , but so far , i'm just hanging out watching i'm not sure i was meant to participate
