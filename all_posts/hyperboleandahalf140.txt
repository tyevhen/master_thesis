as promised , i have scrounged through all of my old boxes and found for you a picture of myself with no hair it is at the bottom of the my tweenhood was a haze of baldness and shame post with a short description please notice the way that i am holding my hands it makes the picture that much more ridiculous it is n't the clearest picture in the world , since i do n't have a scanner and had to take a picture of a picture , boyfriend has much steadier hands than i do and he just took a pretty clear one it is the only one i have i was somewhat elusive around cameras during that time of my life anyway , enjoy !
