i'm trying to be more duckish , to let things roll off me and to slow life down , just a little there are so many people with so many problems , and so many bad things going on in the world , it seems i should n't get bent out of shape about things that really do n't matter having said that , i snapped at someone today over one of those little things that just should n't matter getting pre authorization for a medication for a patient first , let me say that some of this is my fault i hate my fax machine and i just have n't bothered to replace it it spams me with roofers and disney world offers , and repeat requests for medication refills when the patient long ago stopped taking the medicine the memory empties if the machine gets turned off or the power blinks , and it often prints the same document repeatedly it prints documents one at a time and i often need to stand over it to get them the day i stood there waiting for it to print out requests from the same pharmacy , for a refill for the same medication , i had a revelation i could become a doctor who wo n't fax i turned off the fax machine and it is no longer a part of my daily life on rare occasions , when there is no option , i turn it on but mostly it 's been a big relief other people do n't return phone calls i do n't fax we can email pdf files , and if i need to get a document to a patient , i take a photo with my phone and text it to them if that does n't work , the phone has a scanner and i can email documents why would i need to stand over a fax machine ? it 's also my fault because i do n't have a secretary to do these things for me , but that would come with it 's own set of things to take care of so today i got a call from a pharmacy i wrote for a high dose of a medication , it needs preauthorization i 'd need to call an number to get that preauthorization they forgot to leave the patient 's insurance number i called back , got the insurance id , then called the insurance company and began the arduous process of voicemail menu hell to get the right authorization form somehow , i was led to a live person , who kindly offered to do the pre authorization over the phone , but then said it could n't be done for this medication it had to be faxed they 'd fax the form , i 'd fill it out and fax it back there were no options i went to the dreaded fax machine , during which time the insurance company put me on hold i waited then i waited for the fax and it did n't come she tried again and it still did n't come i figured my machine just was n't working and i asked if they could email it to me they ca n't why ? it has patient information on it , sending it on email would be a hipaa violation i asked about sending the blank form that i could fill out i now had the insurance id number they do n't do that it 's a hipaa violation to send email , but faxes to a office where who knows who might see it , or wrong numbers might get dialed , or the wrong doctor with the same name could get sent the information with my last name , i get other people 's faxes , happen all the time i asked if the blank form was on a website it was and she gave me the insurance company 's general website i knew from previous experience that i 'd never be able to find it from there and asked for the exact url she could n't give me that and instead offered to give me another phone number where i could call to ask for the url of the form we were at minutes of this in a time where there is no excuse for not being able to easily transmit a form to someone and i snapped at her and hung up i 'd deal with it on monday and then , of course , the form came through the form was already filled out there were check boxes for the indications why one might need a higher dose i check one there was a question about whether a specific other medication had been tried it had been , do i checked yes and i faxed it back two check marks now why could n't they take this information over the phone ? or why could n't the form automatically have been sent to me when the patient handed in the prescription , without the pharmacy intervening to call me to tell me i had to call the insurance company to request the form be faxed to me ? oh , never mind , that would not have worked because my machine was off i suppose it bothers me because it feels like an unnecessary waste of time that is purposely engineered to be that way
