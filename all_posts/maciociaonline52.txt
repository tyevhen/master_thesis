this is the th and last instalment of the discussion on the triple burner relationship between triple burner and pericardium although they are interiorly exteriorly related , the relationship between pericardium and triple burner is somewhat tenuous such a relationship is more applicable to the channels , rather than to the organs themselves the nei jing and nan jing always refer to the zang and fu omitting the pericardium , but also to the channels including the pericardium originally the pericardium was not considered as separate from the heart the two were considered a single organ , which is perfectly logical considering their close anatomical relationship in fact , when the ling shu lists the yuan points of the zang in chapter , it lists daling p as the yuan point of the heart a passage from chapter of the nan jing makes it clear that the pericardium and heart were , in those times , considered as one organ it says the zang are only the fu organs are why is that so ? the fu organs are because of the triple burner it has a name but no form , and its channel pertains to the hand shao yang the triple burner is a fu organ and that is why these are this passage is revealing because of its starting question in fact , the very question the zang organs are , why are there fu organs ? implies that it is taken for granted that the heart and pericardium are part of the same organ and that therefore it is strange that the fu organs are the answer explains that the fu organs are due to the existence of the triple burner however , within the reply , it says that the triple burner has a name but no form thus implying that the triple burner is different from the other regular fu organs and their total makes only by adding the triple burner the passage also makes clear that the triple has a name but no form , i e it is not really an organ like the others but a complex of functions however , it does say that there is a channel associated with it chapter of the nan jing is even more specific about the fact that the triple burner is not actually associated with a zang organ each of the zang organs has a fu one associated with it the triple burner is also a fu organ but it is not associated with any of the zang organs that is why some say that there are only fu organs chapter of the nan jing specifically addresses the conundrum that there are internal organs but channels there are channels but internal organs zang and fu , why ? one channel jing has two separate vessels mai in the arm shao yin heart and heart master xin zhu , pericardium the pericardium has an exterior interior relationship with the triple burner , both have a name but no form you ming er wu xing , and that is why there are channels this passage is extremely revealing because it confirms that heart and pericardium were seen as one , when it says that one channel jing has two separate vessels mai in the arm shao yin heart and heart master xin zhu , pericardium with regard to the question of zang and fu , the author of the nan jing seems to be playing games with the reader because , in chapter , it says that the zang could be considered to be and the fu ! it says there are zang and yet fu , how is that ? one speaks of fu but they are actually although one speaks of zang , there are actually the kidneys are two zang the left is the kidney and the right is the ming men the ming men houses the spirit jing shen in men it stores the jing in women it houses the uterus the qi of the ming men penetrate the kidneys that is why there are zang how come there are fu ? that is because each zang is associated with a fu , the triple burner is a fu but it does not belong to any of the zang that is why there are fu with the development of the channel theory , the triple burner was associated with the pericardium given their corresponding position on the arm and their number totalled , including the triple burner and pericardium channels although the pericardium and triple burner channels are exteriorly interiorly related within the element scheme , this feels like a somewhat forced relationship to make a square shape fit in a round hole , i e the elements into channels in fact , some chinese teachers and doctors go so far as saying that the pericardium and triple burner organs are not interiorly exteriorly related as the other organs are as channels , the pericardium and triple burner channels have a close and symmetrical relationship they occupy symmetrical positions on the arm the triple burner belongs to the shao yang channels which are the hinge between the tai yang and the yang ming channels the pericardium pertains to the jue yin channels which are the hinge between the tai yin and shao yin channels being the hinge implies that these channels can connect the yang and yin channels , i e the triple burner connects the three yang and the pericardium the three yin the pericardium and triple burner channels are symmetrical in so far as the former provides the opening point of the yin wei mai p neiguan and the latter of the yang wei mai t b waiguan the yin wei mai links all the yin channels and the yang wei mai all the yang ones this is another reason why the triple burner and pericardium channels connect the three yang and three yin of the arm respectively the medicine treasure even says that the triple burner is interiorly exteriorly related to the ming men since the ming men is also called the minister fire , this explains the attribution of triple burner to fire and specifically minister fire in the element context the pericardium is obviously closely connected to the heart and naturally belongs to the fire element , hence the connection between pericardium and triple burner within the fire element and their name of minister fire the selected historical theories of chinese medicine clarifies the relationship between the triple burner and pericardium the heart is the emperor who has a minister the triple burner cavities are like a capital which houses both the emperor and the minister the pericardium in the centre of the chest is like a palace that houses only the emperor the palace is inside and is yin , the capital is outside and is yang hence the triple burner is a yang organ and the pericardium a yin organ in exploring the relationship between pericardium and triple burner , there is an interesting symmetry between the location of the back shu point of heart and kidneys shao yin and those of pericardium and triple burner the heart and kidneys communicate with each other and their back shu points are bl and bl respectively the pericardium and triple burner s back shu points are symmetrical in that they are one point above those of the heart and kidneys , i e bl and bl respectively the back shu point of the pericardium is naturally just above that of the heart because of the close anatomical connection between the two organs the back shu point of the triple burner is just above that of the kidneys because of the triple burner being the envoy or ambassador of the yuan qi as it emerges from between the kidneys see previous blog post clinical application there are interesting clinical applications of the triple burner and pericardium channels in the mental emotional sphere first , emotional stress makes the physiological minister fire of the kidneys rise and become pathological when the minister fire is pathological , a person has heat all emotions tend to cause qi stagnation first and stagnant qi easily generates heat that is why , in mental emotional stress , the tip of the tongue reflecting the heart and the shen is red as we have seen above , chapter of the nan jing even says that the ming men same as minister fire is the residence of the spirit jing shen zhu dan xi said not a day goes by in people s lives that the minister fire is not stirred the triple burner and pericardium channels affect the mental emotional state because emotional stress makes the minister fire rise towards these two channels therefore when the minister fire is aroused by emotional problems and it rises towards the pericardium and triple burner channels , points of these channels can be used to clear heat and calm the mind in this context , i use particularly p neiguan to stimulate the movement of the hun when the person is depressed , or p daling to calm the shen when the person is anxious there is another interesting clinical application of the triple burner and pericardium points related to their being hinge channels , i e the triple burner shao yang is the hinge between tai yang and yang ming and the pericardium jue yin is the hinge between tai yin and shao yin being the hinge on a psychological level means that these channels are mediators in the sense that they can affect a person 's capacity to relate to other people and points of these two channels can therefore be used especially for depression for this , i use t b
