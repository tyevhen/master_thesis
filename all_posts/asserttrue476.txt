fathead minnows and contaminated tap water provide clues to the rise in autism now that u s doctors are treating million people a year for depression and writing well over million prescriptions per year for antidepressants , we should n't be surprised to find psychoactive drugs showing up in our drinking water the number of scientific papers on this subject has been increasing steadily since some of the more frequently cited ones are listed further below it 's a fact that no drug is absorbed by the body regardless of which medication you take , a sizable percentage of the drug passes unmodified completely unmetabolized out your urine , and if you drink municipal water , guess what 's in your water even after it 's been purified ? in , the associated press took it upon itself to investigate the situation here 's what they found in watersheds of major cities surveyed by the ap , widely used pharmaceuticals antibiotics , sedatives , ssris , mood stabilizers , hypertension meds , hormones for menopause , otc medications , others were at detectable levels in you might want to consult this article and check the cities listed in the column on the left side of the page to see which pharmaceuticals might be in your city 's water a particularly interesting study that warrants comment is psychoactive pharmaceuticals induce fish gene expression profiles associated with human idiopathic autism , published june , the idea of this study is that since there is a known link between antidepressant consumption during pregnancy and development of asd aka autism spectrum disorders , the authors of the study thought it might be a good idea to see if the bipolar meds most commonly found in drinking water could affect the expression of genes involved in neuorological disorders they prepared dilute solutions of tegretol , effexor , and prozac in concentrations replicating those found in municipal water supplies and exposed fathead minnows to the water for days then they did gene expression analysis of the minnows' brains for multiple classes of genes involved in multiple neurologic disorders yes , fish have some of the same brain genes we do according to the authors of the paper w e examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals fluoxetine , venlafaxine carbamazepine in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations we conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three we used gene class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders only sets associated with idiopathic autism were unambiguously enriched emphasis added we 're not talking about one or two autism genes here we 're talking about hundreds of different genes that are differentially expressed in autism this is actually some of the strongest evidence yet that psychiatric medications are connected with the sharp rise in autism that began in the s prozac was introduced in , and we all know what happened then depression went from a relatively rare condition affecting well under , people in the s to an epidemic disease affecting million americans meanwhile autism took off like a rocket obviously , more work will need to be done to determine the degree to which psych meds are behind the increase in autism until then , you might want to sit back , relax , and have a glass of water it might just soothe your nerves references celiz md , tso j , aga ds pharmaceutical metabolites in the environment analytical challenges and ecological risks environmental toxicology and chemistry doi croen la , grether jk , yoshida ck , odouli r , hendrick v antidepressant use during pregnancy and childhood autism spectrum disorders arch gen psychiatry archgenpsychiatry http www issueslife org pdfs iariskptb pdf july , jjemba pk excretion and ecotoxicity of pharmaceutical and personal care products in the environment ecotoxicology and environmental safety doi j ecoenv madureira tv , barreiro jc , rocha mj , rocha e , cass qb spatiotemporal distribution of pharmaceuticals in the douro river estuary portugal science of the total environment doi j scitotenv mennigen ja , sassine j , trudeau vl , moon tw waterborne fluoxetine disrupts feeding and energy metabolism in the goldfish carassius auratus aquatic toxicology doi j aquatox metcalfe cd , chu sg , judt c , li hx , oakes kd antidepressants and their metabolites in municipal wastewater , and downstream exposure in an urban watershed environmental toxicology and chemistry doi etc santos l , araujo an , fachini a , pena a , delerue matos c ecotoxicological aspects related to the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment journal of hazardous materials doi j jhazmat
