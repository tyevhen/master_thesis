things have been a little tough around here that 's why you have n't heard from me this week i have n't had the gumption to write anything i'm not sure i yet do , but i wanted to check in my mood has been a bit low it 's not significantly low , but it is trending that way that worries me , of course , but i'm trying to stay in the moment and do what i can worrying does n't do me any good i know that employment is still my primary concern unfortunately i have no control over whether there are hours available for me to work it 's stressful , but rather than worry , i'm trying to stay focused on taking care of the things i can control i 've let most of the regional program directors know i'm available to work i 've picked up a couple of hours here and there over the past few days i'm taking whatever shifts come along i'm doing what i can i'm hoping and praying the opportunities to work continue my mood always improves when i can pay my bills i think my mood might also be affected by the approaching anniversary of puck 's death he died two years ago for those of you unfamiliar , puck was my black lab partner for over years he was only a year old when my depression began , so we 'd been through a lifetime together he was my soul mate i 've been thinking about him a lot lately i miss him i actually do n't mind thinking about him i'm far enough removed from his death now that thoughts of him make me smile a tearful smile it 's comforting to remember him and our special bond but i do miss him that 's all i have for now the weather is warming , so i think it 's time to take jet for a walk i do n't feel like going , but i need to move besides , spending time with jet always makes me smile
