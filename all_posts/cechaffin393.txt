performers on the radio is bonnie raitt anything you want , she sings , a cover of one of roy orbison s last great additions to the canon of the lover he died not long thereafter , dressed in black with sunglasses , stiff in life as death but would bonnie or roy ever take it back , trade the crowd s adulation for the nest of home and hearth , routine and routine love ? must performers love bow to the pull of one more sparkling wheel of fans to move ? four walls , a fireplace , it would be dull and what of us , wouldn t we trade it all to be admired on stage , to swoon and howl ? i loved roy orbison and i love bonnie raitt , indeed have followed her since the s when she was n't well known the question i raise here , however , is one that recurs and recurs does everyone want to be a celebrity ? or are there those who prefer to be doctors , lawyers and candlestick makers ? those with little entertainment skills might not lust after the spotlight , but most of the talented people who could fill it will never taste it the media barrage on our psyches only twists the knife of enforced anonymity deeper for the truly talented yet , except for a few lucky breaks and family connections , most successful artists got where they are on sheer grit thousands of auditions , playing the cheap clubs where no one listens to the music , giving poetry readings at open mikes , doing graphic art to support an oil painting habit , hoping one day for a show in a word , i think you have to want it really bad , and sustain a positive attitude on the journey it never ceases to amaze me that robert deniro , robert duvall , and i think dustin hoffman if not pacino shared a cheap apartment in ny coming up , taking jobs as waiters and what not until their big breaks but their breaks only came because they never stopped trying i think like many i play with success i do n't want to get down in the mud and wrestle for it i do n't want to live out of my car and give readings of a self published book from here to oklahoma i work but i do n't work that hard my sister in law shares a horse with jane hirschfield and i 've never taken advantage of that connection that 's just plain stupid or else breeding you do n't inopportune an acquaintance of your sister in law just to get ahead if i were properly ambitious i 'd be begging to meet her i likely do n't have it in me to make it , i e garner a larger audience and standing i think i'm hesitant to pay the social price as in many things , i am divided about this question down to my bones not feeling half bad for a couple of days shhh ! ce
