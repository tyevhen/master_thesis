i have come up with a brilliant way for jack to capitalize on his obsessions ! it came to me this morning while i was trying to work on a case before taking him to the bus stop he was interrupting me approximately every seconds to talk about bf 's , to question whether mine had a yellow or striped bolt , how many blades the propellor might have , or just to repeat long winded parts of you tube videos he has watched on the subject i thought about how much this drives me absolutely bonkers yes i am proud of his , ummm , focus and memorization skills , but he never ever ever stops i have come home from errands to find john looking despondent , nate sucking his thumb and jack saying , daddy bf , can we watch one more messerschmidt video ? ? we do learn to tune him out to a certain extent , but the bugger seems to notice when our answers are too generic and will repeat his questions over and over until we give a meaningful response so i 've got it surely this technique could be put to excellent use in the military with all of the controversy over the methods used to question military prisoners , i have now come up with a completely harmless well , physically torture method that is sure to get some answers just lock them in a room with jack and ask him to talk about bf 's after an hour or so , they will be willing to tell you anything you want to know trust me ! ! ! ! love my boy , but i am so over german airplanes i ca n't even express how much i miss robots and killer whales right now ! ! !
