in all honesty , i'm a true procrastinator at heart i work much better , much more efficiently when i have a clear and looming deadline i'm the type of person that finds setting a timer for thirty minutes helps me to stay more focused on tasks and chores because i push myself to work hard to get as much done as i can in that short period of time it 's the way god wired me , i suppose sometimes it drives brad a little crazy , but i always get things done and get them done well and the looming deadline invigorates me a bit and pushes me to do my best however , this procrastination also carries over into the kitchen and meal making i would get an f in meal planning if i was graded oh gosh and this is the one area where i find my procrastinating spirit to lead to a bit of stress all i can say is thank goodness for the auto defrost option on my microwave ! so one of my goals this coming fall and coming school year is to start meal planning again i have always enjoyed the mental freedom that has come from having a plan when it comes to meals i suppose i just have n't disciplined myself enough to actually make it a habit however , it 's such a wonderful feeling at p m on a weekday to know that dinner is already planned and probably already started or even in the crock pot almost ready to be eaten my kids , at ages and , love to cook and bake it 's something that they 've always seen me do , and i 've let them have reigns in the kitchen since an early age in my mind , it 's one of the most important life skills i can pass on to my kids the skill of feeding oneself and not only feeding oneself , but feeding oneself good , wholesome , home cooked meals my problem as a kitchen procrastinator , though , is that when i 've waited until the last possible minute to start a dinner that i'm not even sure what it 's going to be , i do n't have the patience for the kids in the kitchen with me i want to get in there , have all the room to move around , and crank out whatever i'm making and sometimes i do n't even know what i'm making until it hits the kitchen table and is done but , i'm totally robbing my kids and myself of some special , very productive time together as well as some really awesome learning experiences approaching meal time this way and it 's all because i'm too lazy to do a little planning ahead of time this past saturday , ian and i went to the garden together and picked a bunch of veggies to use to make dinner the kids and i then husked the corn together and spent an hour chopping , mixing , sauteing , and prepping our dinner when we pulled the stuffed green peppers out of the oven two hours later , there was a great satisfaction felt around the table that night we had worked together from start to finish and on top of that , most of the food was from our garden i was reflecting on this later that evening we had so much fun together the kids kept saying how much they loved cooking with me and how they want to do it more often and , i really do swear , that food tasted so much better knowing that we made it together so this is one of my goals this new school year i'm going to work on disciplining myself to meal plan again , and i'm going to work more group cooking sessions into our schedule not only does this enable some really great quality time with my kids , but it 's also equipping them for their future when they leave home
