one of my colleagues , a brilliant neuroscientist has a great deal of information about the brain but not knowledge of it that is , no deep understanding of what it all means schools make this mistake a lot confusing learning and thinking with information they fill us with loads of memory facts about wars and their dates but never any real knowledge like the cause of war , how to avoid them , etc now in neurology , yes , it helps to know about the brain but how does that knowledge help human beings ? that question is not often asked in brain research how can this knowledge help us understand ourselves and how can we devise therapies that will advance the treatment of mental illness my case in point is that there are psychiatrists out there who have an intimate knowledge of the brain but promote therapies that do not emanate from that knowledge as though the knowledge is compartmentalized and does not inform understanding like the intellectual information stands apart from treatment so it is like two worlds apart , the intellectual and the emotional where the right and left brains never get together it is the exact mirror of neurosis the two are barely held together so that information from the left side never makes it over to the right in other words the right side preferences for therapy can exist as if there were no left side knowledge thus one of the most brilliant professionals can teach psychoanalysis that has not a shred of proof and has long been outdated because it is concocted separate from neurologic understanding yet another professional offers booga booga mindfulness therapy without once explaining how this merges with or evolves out of neurologic science the reason ? it doesn t in the same way that psychologists can construct elaborate theories about a therapy contradicting a good deal of brain science as though our psychology does not come out of the brain not identical but close brothers who need each other , the brain and its psychology i have met some of these brain scientists and i marvel how they manage to elude everything they know about the brain to tout certain schools of therapy but i shouldn t be surprised since the therapies they adhere to come out of the feeling side which is twisted and turned by neurosis no they are not misinformed they are compartmentalized so we have a feeling side that drives them to unreality while their left side knows better but if i know i shouldn t smoke and still do what does that mean ? that one side cannot communicate and control the other these doctors are largely repressed and live in their heads emotions take a back seat so these theoretical constructions derive out of a repressed brain or a neglected one feelings being neglected lead to theories sans feelings and without sense and each time they spout non verifiable ideas that contradict what they know just as i know i should not drink i don t but still do because my needs take precedence and because the two brains have not properly met they meet in our primal world and once they do we could not think of concocting a theory that leaves out half the brain a theory not based on facts each professional has an opinion that may not be informed by knowledge , but rather by their history and emotional life , or lack of it don t forget why so many of us went into the psych dodge in the first place to stay in our heads don t let the brain get in the way just build hypotheses out of one s neurosis it is safe and keeps the person in his comfort zone no intellectual is going to posit a feeling therapy when they do not feel even though they think they do yes they think they do but that is a long trip from the right brain where they would know for sure so we have a dilemma psychologists who do not have enough knowledge of the brain to be guided or informed by it , while neurologists who are not acquainted with the right brain to be informed and guided by it
