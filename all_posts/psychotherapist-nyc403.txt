in my prior blog article , you and your spouse disagree about your child 's substance abuse problem part , i gave a composite vignette of a family struggling with an adult child who moved back home and who has a substance abuse problem as often happens , the parents in this family disagree about how to handle their son 's problem the mother wants their son to get help , but the father thinks the son is just going through a phase the problem drives a wedge between them and their son , who moved back home , uses their conflict to his advantage by going to his father whenever he feels the mother is being too hard on him this vignette is a common problem in families and can create increasing conflict and havoc in the household you and your spouse disagree about your adult child 's substance abuse problem of course , every situation is different , so one blog article ca n't address every issue above all , if your family is having a similar problem and you and your spouse just ca n't come to an agreement about how to handle it , you should seek out a licensed mental health professional who has expertise in dealing with substance abuse problems here 's what i would recommend to dan and marie smith from the vignette in the prior blog post you ca n't ignore your child 's problem drinking anymore the best strategy would have been to discuss what to do before matt moved back home it would have given both of you a chance to get your feelings out in the open with each other and , hopefully , come to a compromise , if possible then , you both could have presented your conditions for allowing matt to move back home together with one voice but since matt was allowed to move back home without any conditions or guidelines , at this point , now that it has become obvious that he has a drinking problem , you ca n't ignore it anymore or pretend that it 's just a phase based on the fact that matt lost his job at least in part due to his excessive absenteeism , which could be telltale sign of excessive drinking and that you found lots of empty beer bottles hidden in his closet , you ca n't ignore the problem anymore as his parents , you need to provide a united front to matt when you talk to him about his drinking until now , matt has been allowed to manipulate the situation at home because the two of you ca n't agree on what to do and you 're arguing about it naturally , matt has been turning to his father , dan , who is siding with him to this , i would say , dan , you 're in denial about your son 's problems and , even though i know you love matt and want the best for him , what you 're actually doing is enabling him to drink by minimizing the problem and giving him money which he 's using to buy alcohol to marie , i would say , you picked up pretty quickly that there was something else going on that matt was n't telling you it 's understandable , given your childhood history with a father who was an active alcoholic at the time , that you would be upset to discover that matt is drinking excessively but it 's important to remember , in order to preserve your well being , that although it feels similar to what you experienced as a child , you 're an adult now and you have a greater capacity to cope and a lot more options than when you were a child at some point , after this crisis , it would be helpful for you to work through that earlier trauma in therapy because might be getting triggered in this situation but , for now , it 's important that you listen to each other and come up with a compromise that you can both live with and then present it to matt as a united front it 's important not to be judgmental or harsh when you talk to matt he has a problem and he needs help be empathetic but also clear and firm about your expectations it 's also important for you to be supportive of one another throughout this process setting boundaries and rules for your household your son is an adult who is living in your household and you have the right to set rules if he wants to continue to live there he does n't have to like your rules , but he needs to follow them decide beforehand what the consequences will be if he does n't follow your rules doing an intervention and alcoholics anonymous if talking to matt is n't enough , the family could benefit from doing an intervention in this particular case , there are a couple of routes you could go one possibility is that you could hire a professional to do an intervention with the family , although this tends to be costly and , in most cases , your insurance wo n't pay for it another possibility , in this particular case , involves marie 's father , who is in recovery and has been sober for many years he could talk to matt about his experience of being a person who actively abused alcohol in the past , how he got sober , and what he 's doing to maintain his sobriety marie 's father , who is in recovery and sober for many years , could speak with matt he could also take matt to
