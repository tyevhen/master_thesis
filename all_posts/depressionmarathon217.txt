it 's been awhile since i last checked in i'm sorry about that i simply have nothing new going on in my life i'm in a holding pattern i'm dealing with the usual things i 've been taking care of jet , working to days per week , going to my therapy group and other appointments , exercising as much as i can without stressing my achilles tendon , and waiting and waiting and waiting i'm still waiting for my boot to arrive from europe , that is the boot which will immobilize my right achilles tendon i really wish i had it by now the waiting sucks my mood is okay , but i'm terribly frustrated with the waiting each passing day postpones my healing another hours and every day that goes by is also another day of missed training that 's especially distressing i 've accepted the fact that i'm going to miss the entire summer racing season , but i still want to run the new york city marathon on november st to accomplish that , i need to be training by mid july with this delay in treatment , mid july will soon be a stretch it 's frustrating in order to get to july as well as possible , i'm hoping to find something aerobic i can do once my right ankle is immobilized four weeks without cardio training worries me i'm worried about my mood as well as my physical conditioning i want to keep my brain and my body in the best shape possible , but i'm not sure yet how i will accomplish that i believe my gym has a cardio machine which primarily uses arms that should be interesting if my boot ever arrives , i 'll let you know how it goes
