the test of connection is an equilibrium of the nervous system with vital signs falling below baseline we have done four separate brainwave studies of our patients our beginning patients have greater power hemispheric amplitude on the right side of the brain , but after one year of therapy , there is a shift of power to the left this implies for us a more balanced brain there was a strong correlation between patient s feeling of well being and the shift in the brain we have completed a two year follow up study of fourteen of our patients over time the power of the brain moves not only from right to left but also from back of the brain to the front higher alpha frequencies where there is more control there are higher frequencies in the frontal area , which may mean better integration and control of feelings an anxious patient , not well repressed , may come in with a higher brain voltage of microvolts at cycles per second just before a reliving a primal , the alpha amplitudes can reach double or triple the normal resting rate microvolts this tells us how close to conscious awareness the memory feeling is it gives us a diagnostic tool to measure access in the patient connection means the liberation of the right feeling prefrontal cortex from control by the left the left can now perform its important function of integration instead of suppression and of course , the relaxation of the patient and her sense of ease is another key piece of evidence most important , once there is a lock in of feelings , the insights become a geyser after a feeling , one patient discovered why he could never dine in an indoor restaurant he wanted nothing over his head which turned out in a birth primal to be smashing into the pubic arch he could never have anything above him , even symbolically , like a boss of course , his father was a tyrant he avoided authority like the plague thus , there was the first and second line components of the feeling disconnection often means , i am relaxed and calm , while the right side is abuzz with pain we cannot be healthy and emotionally strong so long as there is disconnection so long as there is a war going on between the two halves of the brain , mental health is not possible neurosis means there is a disconnection it is not possible to get well through more of it , which is what happens in hypnosis and all cognitive therapies , where the left is driven further from its right counterpart connection has neurologic roots the swedish neuroscientist , david ingvar , using a cat scan of the brain , found that a perception of pain involved both sides of the prefrontal area working in tandem when emotional pain is repressed , i would assume the right side is more involved the right amygdala picks up volume there is information that the right amygdala tends to swell when there is feeling thus , disconnected pain is more active on the right side than the left it is as though there is a secret underground in the brain where messages are passed back and forth , but on the side that should be aware there is no recognition of them so the right side tells the left side , sotto voce , look , i can t take any more criticism it means i am not loved and the left side says , ok i ll defend you against having to feel so bad just don t tell me too much anyway , i ll twist the criticism by the other person , and make them wrong and the left side jumps in immediately and automatically as soon as there is a hint of criticism don t worry , my right wing friend , i ll keep those feelings of feeling unloved and criticized under control even though you haven t told me what they are so the left side acts out the feeling the act out is unconscious because the right side feeling is not connected the left is not yet consciously aware because brainstem and limbic structures on the right largely make up the unconscious the task is to bring the right brain into symmetry with the left remember , events are unconscious because early trauma impacts the right brain far more than the left , and that brain loses touch with conscious awareness in order for the feeling to remain in storage the forces of repression must remain intact that takes effort and chemicals such as cortisol , the alerting chemical for imminent danger once memory is stored as an imprint it is always an imminent danger hence nearly all of our starting patients are high in cortisol any time a therapist orders a patient to do this or that , mistakes are being made it is now the therapist s timetable rather than the patient s the minute a patient is done to we are in error feelings will come up in natural order when we let nature guide us , the patient s nature and also our own there are many levels of connection it means the right left brains become coordinated via the corpus callosum and not only from right to left but also from bottom to top this means that the feeling centers are connected to the areas of the neocortex , specifically the prefrontal brain so that feeling is organically joined with knowledge , not by separate processes but as an integrated whole where feeling seeks out and links to understanding on higher levels earlier on , heavy and painful feelings were too much to absorb and integrate so part of it was rerouted and kept apart from knowledge it began an underground life , creating damage the problem is that similar feelings are kindled into similar pain so that the compounding of all of it is too much to connect and integrate it is like a storage locker each new added pain builds until there is no more space for feelings the true meaning of optimum mental health is harmony and balance it is also the meaning of emotional intelligence , which allows our feelings to guide us toward a sane , intelligent life , and not one filled with broken loves , drugs , tobacco , alcohol and esoteric intellectual pursuits harmony and balance enables us to lead not only an intellectual life , but a healthy and intelligent one , as well , one not driven by compulsions and the inability to relax connection will take care of all of that
