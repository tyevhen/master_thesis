in my ongoing pursuit to versify wisdom , here 's new verse it 's fear rabbits do n't take drugs because they live by fear they do n't hide under rugs because their fear is dear for many years they 've known the benefit of nerves just like a driver thrown against his door by curves my doctor says i'm hooked on cigarettes and booze , my brain is overcooked by television shews i suffer from addiction , a manageable disease in his simple depiction it 's like a case of fleas but i know what it is it 's not the wine and beer what else can make you piss ? it 's fear , it 's fear , it 's fear ! all of us have a basic choice whether to be motivated by fear or love , whether to tremble before jehovah or lie in the arms of christ in a position of authority in this world , it is better to be feared than loved otherwise it is much better to be loved than feared the first time one of my daughters said fuck you ! to me i knew they had broken through fear unlike my father , who would have gone ballistic on the point , i became instantly philosophical mainly because i love my daughters so end of today 's lesson , craig erick
