so fat doctor posted about writing her holiday cards i feel like she 's my friend it 's the strangest thing , but i track this person 's life i know when her sister had bladder surgery , when she painted her toenails blue , and how did she lose pounds in one week ? ? ? i wonder what state she lives in not to mention how she works on the same medical unit as her mother son , husband , sister , big dog , little dog , it 's like reality blogger holiday cards growing up , my family never sent them i grew up i think and started sending them , including pics after we had kids i learned to paste in photos , and while i'm not much for newsy letters , i 've moved from our year in review in pictures to a few travel photos and a sentence about each family member some years it 's simply the kids have too many activities to list mostly , i keep it short and sweet , and i do n't mention the more troublesome aspects of life there are always a few if you know me , you hear them , if our relationship is sustained only by the yearly holiday card , i leave out the bad stuff on the receiving end , we 've gotten some really interesting ones last year was the first time we learned someone 's ejection fraction from their holiday newsletter one friend sent a month by month , page , single spaced account of every kiddy performance and academic conference fat doctor and i exchanged e cards off blog i think this is called back door she has a name only a first name ! i was shocked , i 've wondered what state she lives in , how fat she really is , and my husband has wondered if she really exists , but it never occurred to me that she 'd have any name but fat doctor or fd it was like a bubble bursting , and while it 's a nice name , it was a little bit disappointing , like seeing your favorite glamorous movie star without their makeup the newsletter itself was full form fat doctor , i loved it gorgeous , gorgeous little boy he 's made brief appearances on the blog , so an old familiar face and much of the news i knew up there with writing about one 's ejection fraction , fat doctor sends advance directives for both herself and husband he wants his life sustained as long as he can operate the tv remote this reminds me of roy , who once said he wanted to be kept alive as long as he could move a cursor by any means i wonder if roy puts that in his holiday notes ? for the record , and this did not make my holiday card if i am unable to consent , i am never to be put on a salt free , diabetic diet i mean that are you asking , what 's this got to do with psychiatry ? ? we did n't get very many comments on our anti depressants and suicide posts , timely stuff that it is i figured i 'd digress to pleasanter topics for a few moments maybe roy will fill us in on the fda hearings 'tis the season
