i am slowly getting back into the routine of things after my holiday i had a very slow week at work , i just found it really difficult to motivate myself and get back into things i did a sickie on friday as i over slept and felt quite down as i had made a big mistake on thursday and i felt like everyone would be pointing fingers o i went to the orthadontist last wednesday , i will have a brace for between and months i get the bottom fitted the last week of october and the top in the first week of november from what he was saying i think i am going to have to get up minutes earlier just to clean my teeth after months i will also have to have elastics which will need taking out when i eat and changing every day i thought wearing a brace was going to be a little uncomfortable but i did not realise it was going to be quite so time consumming ! i was suppose to go to a drama group last friday but i did not go as i had not been to work i was also hoping to go to the pub today to meet some people from sa uk but that all fell through because of a lack of interest i had my sister and her husband to dinner last tuesday , they brought their old tv over for me o i have set up the surround sound now and it is really good for dvd 's it is a proper size tv , a hundred times better than my old inch portable i was worried about cooking dinner for them as they are both vegetarian and my brother in law is a particulary fussy eater things went well though , i made vegetable lasagne with rocket and parmasan salad followed by home made chocalate mousse they seemed to enjoy it o i have spent over this weekend and that does not include my usuall food shopping and petrol i spent on clothes and shoes in the next sale as well as buying a new mobile phone and sending my sister some flowers to say thanks for the tv the orthodontist will cost me and i spent nearly going to dubai i need to seriously cutback on my spending my instant access savings accunt will be empty by the time i have paid the deposit for my teeth it will not fill up again either as the monthly payments for my teeth will come out of the money i used to save each month i am taking another week off work towards the end of october i am going to go and spend a few days with my nephew as i have never taken him out on his own before he will be three in november and is adorable i will also spend some time with my mum and she will then come back with me for a few days anyway it is pm and i have work tomorrow i was so shattered before i went on holiday , i was not much better last week and took a sickie on friday so i need to have a good productive week this week ! wish me luck ! ! !
