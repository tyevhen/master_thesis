yesterday i was fishing off the rocks in my secret place and caught a black fish with rust colored patches on its flanks and descending to its belly i was happy , of course , as i rarely catch a fish when i got it home and began to clean it , however , i was in for a psychedelic surprise the fish 's liver was bubble gum blue , the kind of blue in a slushy worse , its flesh was the same blue one fish , two fish , red fish , blue fish was it edible ? was it poisonous ? in all my life i had never seen such a thing it was not the color of food but candy blueberry gum as a fish lover i was n't going to let the color defeat my urge to consume the fish so i called my friend ralph , whom i call the fishmeister because he 's a much better fisherman than i and knows a lot about it he told me the fish was a greeling , a member of the ling cod family , whose members also come in a candy apple green so i cooked it and it was delicious as it cooked the blue color transformed to the usual white i think it was a jumblie fish and i should have been in an oceangoing sieve to have caught it on to the men 's circle my experience of psychosis , especially of the religious kind , has made me skeptical of any spiritual experiences nevertheless my psychiatrist recommended this men 's circle and retreat naturally he attends in preparation for the retreat our facilitator is sharing about the jungian archetype of the magician , the trickster , odysseus , loki , coyote , raven you get the picture it 's one of four archetypes for men warrior , lover , king , magician i left the first meeting at halftime , but last night i made it through we were told to close our eyes and imagine our magician and call to him in my mind 's eye i saw a raven in flames that did not burn this is an apt metaphor for my life i have had many close calls with death and other detours , but by luck and wits and the grace of god i have managed to escape from many narrow situations then there 's being a poet , musician and psychiatrist , all categories of the magician thus i can definitely identify with this archetype whether i will levitate in the sweat lodge is another question , though i do hope my belly will hide the size of my member penis comparisons among naked men is unavoidable , the inevitable sideways glance quickly hid , and my increased weight from the medications will , of course , make me smaller appearing thank god at least i have big balls speaking of balls , yes , i have a poem on that , below , though it 's about a special case thine in seussian fish , ce that government hook i know a man whose balls are pink and delicate carnations of irradiation , twin oysters supercharged to never spit a pearl he managed to get out in six while doing seven to ten because nasa sought virile men and wished to know how many licks a man 's jewels could take before the shine came off convicts will volunteer from boredom as much as for freedom if killing time means killing your balls , big fucking deal who wants to be a father anyway ? mine was an asshole
