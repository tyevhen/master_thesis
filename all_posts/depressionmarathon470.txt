as i sit here alone on christmas morning , it is quiet , sunny and cold outside the sky is brilliant blue i am sitting in front of my living room window , the typical spot in which i compose all of my posts and while not a creature is stirring upon my street , i imagine the houses of my neighbors are teaming with excited revelry my house is quiet i am sipping my coffee , listening to npr , and thinking i am trying not to focus on waking up alone i am trying to avoid thinking about puck 's absence , picturing his smiling face and wagging tail instead there have been no tears yet , but i am making a concerted effort not to be sad it 's been a long , long time , at least years , since i awoke in an empty house , alone , on christmas day perhaps i am feeling sorry for myself after all , it looks like there was some revelry here there are still empty gift bags lying on the floor , the remnants of opening gifts two days ago with d , before he returned to his home i do n't know why , but i have n't bothered to pick them up and put them away yet i had a lovely weekend with d we were particularly close he was impressed with how i was handling puck 's death i was happy to have his strong arms wrapped around me we celebrated my birthday with a quiet , happy dinner with best friends , bill and cindy , on saturday night we were the only people in the restaurant , the food was fantastic , and we lingered in conversation for a long , long time i felt surrounded by love earlier in the day , d and i ran miles together , and i ran another sunday evening after he left i set out to run , but i could n't bare to come home , so on running i went yesterday was supposed to be busy , but i only worked hours , as the nursing home was locked down with the flu , and i had the rest of the day to myself after napping for hours , what else was there to do , i donned my running clothes again , and ran a chilly miler as the sun sank that helped i 've taken to leaving the radio or television on while i'm out running or doing errands it makes coming home a bit easier when there is noise in the house college football tempted me to sit in solitude after my run last night , but instead i gathered myself for a christmas eve candlelight service at a local congregation i was concerned about attending alone , but i felt the need to be closer to god , and i went anyway as expected , i cried as we sang silent night with candles aglow , but the tears were brief , and in the end , i felt peace i know puck is up there , at the right hand of god , bouncing and wagging his tail i instructed god to let that tennis ball fly , and in puck , he would never find a finer , more loyal friend i asked god to take care of my boy until we meet again merry christmas , friends though we may never meet , i am humbled by the opportunity to spend this day with each of you thank you for your support as i walk this journey with you by my side , i know i am never truly alone i am grateful for that peace be with you on this special day
