i marked an anniversary a couple of days ago it was january th of my junior year of high school , and i had had enough i had fought a losing battle with depression since the age of my home life was a chaotic mess my father , with whom i lived , had no clue as to my mental state despite many , many signs and a few direct warnings from other adults i was miserable and ready to go on january th i decided it was time it was a few days ahead of plan , a plan i had been working on for at least a month i had finished all of my finals i had played what i knew was my last basketball game i had said goodbye to the couple of people closest to me on january th i tried to end my life fortunately , i did n't succeed i can say fortunately now i do n't recall feeling that way then i do recall , of those around me , most were shocked i had attempted suicide depression was n't recognized as it is now , and i certainly did n't fit any sort of person about to commit suicide profile i was a straight a student , an athlete , and had many friends but i also had severe , debilitating depression and despite communicating my intent more than once to more than one person , people were shocked i hope the awareness is better today i do n't always remember this anniversary it 's not a day i mark on my calendar for some reason , i remembered it this year i reflected on how desperate and alone i felt , how low and pessimistic i had become and perhaps that 's exactly what i need to remember when i reflect on that day when i reflect on surviving a time which felt un survivable , i'm reminded i'm resilient i 've been through the wringer , more than once , and come out the other side and i'm fortunate i do n't feel desperate , alone , or pessimistic today i have depression , and i do n't like it , but i'm okay today i'm living with rather than suffering from depression i'm grateful for that things could be so much worse
