one of the most popular posts on this blog is about post marathon depression i wrote it after i ran grandma 's this year at that time , i sensed the beginning of a post marathon drop in my mood i think i'm smack in the middle of that drop right now scary like i said , post marathon depression is a hot topic here , so i guess i'm not alone in this that helps i am feeling absolutely spent boston 's early field closure does n't help , but it 's more than that i'm definitely feeling out of sorts , direction less , and drained i guess it makes sense i worked very hard for months with one , singular goal to keep me moving now nothing i have n't run a step since the race i have n't swam i have n't biked nothing i 've been battling a migraine for the past two days , which has n't helped i guess i need a goal to get going again i'm formulating one it involves another marathon , but that 's all i'm going to say for now i'm planning to run saturday , maybe even go long sometimes i have to jump all the way in to get going again but i think a new goal is the answer now , if i could just get off the couch !
