i'm home from my weekend away with d we had a really nice time , which made up for the stressful drive there and back my vehicle was acting up a bit , and it made for a tense drive every time i thought i had the problem licked , it would crop up again i guess a trip to the mechanic is now on my to do list anyway , the weekend was really good yesterday we went to the harley davidson museum as a former motorcyclist , i really enjoyed that last night d took me out to a nice italian restaurant in a a very hip section of the city we had a fabulous dinner and then walked the streets and talked i had n't been treated to a romantic dinner in quite a few years , so that was also really nice the physical distance between us was a topic of conversation a couple of times during the weekend we both acknowledged it was difficult we have such a nice time when we 're together , but building the relationship in fits and starts is not ideal unfortunately , that 's the way it is right now fortunately , it is changeable we ended up agreeing it was best to take things as they come , one day at a time after all , fretting about how far apart we live wo n't do either of us , or our relationship , any good my mood remains good i'm sure being doted on over the weekend was helpful puck and i are now settling back into our home and routine he 's already asleep on his bed , and that 's exactly where i'm headed bed sweet dreams
