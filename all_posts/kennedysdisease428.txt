terry waite sent me this link to an article and i found it interesting the nine minute video was quite good in showing tek robotic mobilization device s capabilities the website had this explanation on their home page tek rmd , provides the opportunity of movement for people with paraplegia by enabling them to independently stand up in a completely upright position with correct posture , facilitating their movement and comfortable completion of their daily tasks indoors , such as in the home , office and shopping mall tek rmd is not an alternative to wheelchairs it is a totally new concept , a new platform yes , it was not specifically designed for someone with our needs in mind however , what i liked was the way it allowed a person to easily stand and maneuver around in tight spaces i also thought it is a great way to exercise your quads as well as your arm muscles probably the neatest feature is the ability to use almost any bathroom stall and commode height boy would that be convenient also , the remote control is kind of neat i am not certain how comfortable the device would be , however , and how convenient it would be to transfer to other chairs , bed and a car seat also , how mobile would the device be outside even on something fairly flat and smooth surfaced like pavement or a sidewalk ? the beauty of this device s technology is that it will lead to even greater capabilities for hybrid wheelchairs and other mobility devices i can hardly wait
