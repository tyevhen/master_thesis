nervous people live in either the past or the future when we are in lowered tones , we live in the past , rehashing what was , what could have been when we are in fearful temper , we agonize over the future , over what may transpire i often find myself worrying about what lies ahead i fear a plane crashing , a major change at work , a loss of income , a serious illness all potential future events dr low would remind me that finding peace involves living in the moment , not working up a situation in the preview dr low also emphasizes realism a realist doesn t fret over major life disruptions that realistically have little likelihood or that are unavoidable at any rate for example , a realist acknowledges that , yes , all of us will die someday , but he doesn t spend his life worrying about how that could happen a realist doesn t try to predict the future and finds happiness and inner peace by living in the moment for nervous people , being a realist is challenging but when i stop and simply listen to the wind or my cat breathing i instantly feel relief from being able to relieve myself , even momentarily , of the immense burden of trying to worry about and ultimately trying to control the future being a realist takes practice , and i have a long way to go yet simply acknowledging the value of living in the present certainly reflects more realistic thinking
