wait and see doc injected my iliopsoas tendon , which is the tendon that attaches the hip flexing muscles to the bone in other words , when you flex your hip i e lift your knee toward the ceiling or kick a ball , the iliopsoas tendon shortens we decided to inject the tendon to rule out something simple , like tendinitis , before we look for the more serious recurring labral tear the injection was quite uncomfortable i 'll spare you too many details , but suffice it to say it takes a fair amount of needle pressure to break through the anterior hip and into the meat of the tendon the injection contains a steroid plus a novacaine like med to desensitize the injected area the fun part sarcastic was that my quads went numb , too , as the femoral nerve runs just below the tendon , so i silly walked for a few hours now it is wait and see time if my pain decreases after this injection , it may mean this is only tendinitis ! if the pain stays the same or worsens , well that means i failed the test , and it is likely a labral tear i am going back in two weeks i can begin running again in days to test it out doc was a bit vague about the options available if my labrum is re torn he mentioned surgery , but that was before i reminded him i had already had two previous procedures he had apparently forgotten the first one he did n't mention surgery after that , but i think he went into the wait and see what happens after the injection mode so , i 'll wait and see , too and pray
