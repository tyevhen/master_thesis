it 's getting dark so early now i was bemoaning the loss of summer for a little while , but really , i love the transitions of the year ! they remind me how much i love this life , and no matter how down i feel , i will be uplifted by the warm leaves and cool days of autumn , the muffled snowfalls and cool light of winter , the trickling water and new shoots of spring , the long lazy days and soft nights of summer the world truly is a beautiful place our primary heat source in the winter is our wood stove , so each fall we get a nice big load of wood face cords for those who care to know such things p , which sits in a steadily shrinking pile in the driveway as we stack it on the side of the house this is what the pile looked like on september th and , well , today , we finally finished stacking it ! to give you a good idea of size , my mom is ' , and that wood pile is in two layers , as you can see from the first pic of the pile that 's a lot of wood ! ! a lot of wood that will keep us toasty warm this coming winter in other news , i really want to write something more in depth and substantial than the stuff i 've been posting recently , but today when i tried , i failed so i'm just going to have to wait a bit until inspiration hits me ! peace , idzie
