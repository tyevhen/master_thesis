there has been an apotheosis of the thinking cortex in most current psychotherapies the idea is when you change your ideas and beliefs thefeelings will follow suit it is not the case quite the contrary the limbic system , particularly the amygdala has many more neural pathways , hence more influence , to the neocortex than the reverse ideas and beliefs are weak arms to battle feelings remember our feelings are important survival mechanisms and should be permanently strong they should not be easily turned off in by ideas in psychotherapy we need to pay closer attention to the structure and function of our brains so that we don t concoct sham theories insights are not the powerful weapon we once thought they were in fact , the major part of the twentieth century psychotherapy relied on insights as the principal focus feelings were too often neglected again thinking that ideas could control and change feelings what we need is a proper balance between thinking and feelings we cannot have runaway feelings or cemented in ideas that refract feelings when a psychotherapy has ideas as its principle mode of operation there is bound to be an imbalance animals can feel without attached ideas but in humans , feelings have an ideational , comprehension counterpart that helps integrate the feeling but we should not confuse ideas about feelings with the feelings themselves a therapist who tries to correct a patient s feelings is dissuading a biologic feeling memory neurotic ideas are deviated based on historic feelings of the person they are in line with feelings only an outsider can diagnose them as deviated or neurotic he can do this because he cannot easily see buried feelings that drive the beliefs when the therapist and patient see and understand the feelings , the ideas will no longer be considered aberrant but those feelings drove deviated ideas for survival it is not whimsy or caprice that one chooses ideas in fact , ideas are chosen by the feeling , not the reverse i hate women , is one idea that a person can have due to a harridan mother who smothered her child he hates his mother and then generalizes to all women he is generalizing early experience and feelings with his mother hating women is our carte d entr e , allowing us to probe deeper once we lock into the patient s hate and then allow the patient freedom to express and feel it , he will automatically be taken back to origins of the feeling and there lies integration and resolution comprehension is the last stage in the experience of a feeling when a patient begins to resolve a long standing feeling imprint she has been liberated when we rely on the therapists comprehension of what the patient may be feeling , all is lost if the therapist talks more than the patient all is really lost there is no hope of a cure if the patient is feeling , she has greater involvement of more brain systems than with insights or ideas it is deeper and more profound for that we need a therapist who has access to her deep unconscious for therapists who spend years perfecting the intellectual side of psychology to the detriment of feeling , it is a daunting task in our psychotherapy we help the patient to take the general and reduce it to the specific hate women , hate mother , from this we can produce general laws that apply to a broad band of individuals , hence helping those others to feel , integrate and resolve all patients need to experience a feeling and integrate it most all of us have the same brain system there is no other way to produce a cure for neurosis no shortcut to health but to state that we must understand the role of ideas and feelings in our ancient history and in the history of the evolution of the brain and when a patient abreacts and does not feel completely we can be sure there will be no progress we have a very large feeling brain system we cannot ignore it in a psychotherapy and help the patient to get better i should add that the only time an insight can help is when the patient does not have sufficient access to his comprehending brain and needs help that is not often some people really do need to enlarge their thinking capacity to help control metastized feelings i am thinking of habitual impulsive laden behavior in any case , feelings generate brain states , not the opposite , at least not in the way i am discussing it if we want to expand consciousness we all must feel what lies in the subconscious when we become conscious of the unconscious we are on the road to health i did not say aware , because awareness without feeling is just another belief system awareness is simply gobbled up by the top level cortex and lies impotent in the brain you know you re acting impulsively all of the time ? i know , but now what ? as i note elsewhere , when the patient is locked into a feeling , history will present itself when she is engulfed by rage we know that the origin is first line where rage began its life when the vehicle of feeling begets anger we know that we may be dealing with events later in childhood when the patient is triggered by mild fear in a session into terror we know it is first line in origin when her feelings lead to fear we know there is a limbic feeling origin , and it is there that we must focus we cannot skip evolutionary steps and help the patient we cannot ignore the deep feeling because it is there and needs to be experienced , but in a correct biologic timetable if she is locked into anger and then rage in a session we need to take the feeling with the least valence to work on it is that lesser powerful feeling that has the best chance of resolution and integration taking a feeling rage out of evolutionary order in a session usually results in overload and lack of integration ours is not a theory of random psychological states but of a hierarchy of integrateable feelings rage and terror tells us where to focus a patient it unerringly turns us to the page we must address and to the era where it all began
