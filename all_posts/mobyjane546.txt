hello ms curtiss i wanted to thank you for the inspirational web page which i came across on the internet one evening as someone who experiences fairly regular visits from the black dog , i am intrigued by your approach and i wondered if you could tell me whether over time , by using these techniques , the number of episodes will diminish ? of course i hope so , but i prefer to have a straight answer from a fellow sufferer very best wishes g g dear g g i'm not sure that the frequency , how often the depression is triggered off , has changed however , saying that , the severity of those triggerings has changed immensely and because the severity of the triggering of depression is often so slight , the frequency is almost a moot point sometimes i just get that little downer warning that suddenly washes over me i used to fear this downdraft so much because i knew it would be followed shortly by a painful and maybe long term incident these little bummer warnings i now quickly dispense with in a few seconds , so the depression never gets a chance to even begin using the analogy of fire , it used to be that i would fear a little flame of depression because i knew the big blaze had announced that it was on the way , and i would shortly be undone and lost now , immediately when the heaviness appears , i do a small exercise , it 's almost second nature with me now to sing a little song , or go over a little nursery rhyme like hey , diddle , diddle , or turn immediately to some chore and start thinking about what i am doing , and turn completely away from what i am feeling because i do this so automatically now , it 's almost like i put out that little flame of depression with my thumb and forefinger take that , you little snit sometimes when i wake in the morning i get hit with the full boat load at once i used to just give up to the despair , turn over , put the covers over my head , and get ready to begin my suffering for the next week but now , although the pain is sometimes considerable omg this is horrible ! ! , i do some dumb little exercises , and keep turning away from my feelings to mind exercises , or more objective thoughts these full onslought episodes are excruciating , but they last just a few minutes maybe once or twice a year i may not be full throttle blissful for an hour or so , i may be kind of sober , quiet , kind of treading water feeling wise , but by afternoon i notice i am my own exhuberant self again and off and on , even in the treading water period , that new neural pattern i have built that always triggers off when the depression triggers off keeps reminding me this is just a little chemistry here , this is not reality , i need to do my exercises , that 's all , okay , you 're okay , just get busy and do n't worry depression just is n't the big deal it used to be it is never in my way of doing anything i want to do except feel blissful and even i ca n't feel blissful all the time , i'm only human like everybody else except for my work helping other people i probably would n't think about depression very much at all another thing that i have given some thought to lately is this people who carry around a lot of repressed fear and most people do if they have n't done anything proactive to address it set themselves up for an anxious kind of life , as well as anxious kinds of relationships this is because fear is so painful that we want to avoid it and the way we avoid it is to blame therefore , you are not afraid , the other person is an asshole , or stupid , or not good enough for you , or not respecting you , or not giving you your full measure of regard in some way , or in some way not doing the relationship right getting in touch with repressed fear is covered in chapter ten of my book depression is a choice , but there is a lot of info on that on the website if you do n't have the book you can ask me questions anytime a b curtiss ms curtiss many thanks for this you really understand the problem and nobody else i have ever talked to has been able to relate to how i feel i have started doing some of the exercises and they really do work so i am adding them to my repertoire i am glad that i am not the only person to experience transient episodes which doctors just do n't understand you either are or are not depressed and if you are , you have to take medication sometimes weeks go by and i feel great and then oh dear it is back again and i can feel utterly pole axed in a matter of days and back to square one however , i have hope now , that i will be able to deal with these episodes better and better and as i no longer take medication and am out of the medical 'loop' and have been for years i feel a greater sense of agency i really appreciate what you do and the fact that you took time out to reply it means a lot to me because i respect your opinion good luck with all that you do g g dear g g i ll be glad to answer any questions as you advance a b curtiss
