in these divisive times , it 's more important than ever to maintain civility during family holiday gatherings how can you keep your temper , hold your tongue and keep a festive holiday event from becoming a disaster ? it can help to cultivate a habit of civility and to take a page from the step programs , saying just for today , i will refuse take the bait this is a huge help when your conservative uncle george , a die hard trump supporter , or your equally fervent aunt judy , who vows to support bernie ever , pounces on you with a confrontation about your own beliefs , affiliations or voting record you might say i just want to enjoy you today without our differing views getting in the way so what about and bring up a favorite sports team or ask about their children 's or grandchildren 's latest achievements or inquire about their health or even ask about their travels or what you know is a favorite hobby anything to avoid the conversational flashpoint that can derail a family holiday celebration into a scream fest deflect conflict with humor if your smug , know it all older brother descends on you with his reasons why trump is doing a great job or reasons why he 's an absolute disaster , cut off the confrontation with a little self deprecating humor look , you know i m a wild eyed fanatic don t get me started ! let 's give everyone here a break mom and aunt sally have gone to a lot of trouble to make this wonderful dinner i don t want to spoil it so let 's discuss all this at another time and in another place ! stifle the urge to set someone straight do n't tell a family member who is a total hypochondriac that he or she is healthy or venture the thought that a tortured youth really had a delightful upbringing just listen hear them out until you find an escape without feeling the urge to poke holes in their reality the same is true of family stories each person may have his or her own version of the same event do n't jump in with no ! it was n't that way ! listen and then offer your own memories in a non threatening way what i remember most about that day is and perhaps observe that what makes family stories so fun or interesting is that all members bring different perspectives and memories to the tales take the high road if met with hostility and continuing attempts to get to you , do n't react in the expected way instead of meeting hostility automatically with anger , think for a moment , reflecting on the unhappiness of this person or other painful feelings behind the stinging words , and say you may be right or i 'll have to think about that or i think we 'll just have to agree to disagree on this one this unexpected reaction can take the wind out of the confrontational relative 's sails without a major blowup keep confrontations gentle and , if possible , private if someone says something so offensive , you ca n't let it pass , take the person aside to talk it over instead of escalating the conflict in front of everyone and , as you consider countering these offensive comments , ask yourself if these are alcohol fueled and if the offender could even hear and understand another point of view right now if you ca n't avoid disagreeing in front of everyone e g at the dinner table say i see things differently but do n't attack the other simply state your feelings as well as your desire to have the pleasure of all being together take center stage another course of action is to avoid holiday celebrations where others are guaranteed to be take your pick boring , offensive , obnoxious , controlling or otherwise challenging to your peace of mind however , in avoiding the problematic , you may also miss seeing some people you truly enjoy remember that you do n't need to win to have a good time you do n't have to match another 's hostility to get him or her to back down you do n't have to agree with a person on one topic or most topics to love him or her a lot keep in mind that holiday gatherings are usually a mixed bag of fun , tedium , old memories both joyous and fraught , new memories of the bad and the beautiful moments some of these you simply , just for today , endure and move on other moments can bring pleasure and happiness for years to come
