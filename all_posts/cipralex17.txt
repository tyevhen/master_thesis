dear friends , i hope all is well with you or at least keeps on getting better , i know it s been a while since my last post , so i m going to address many issues in this one its day with cipralex , i ve recently decreased the amount from mg to mg , i m going to try this for a week or so and see how it effects me before i ll make more decision about that so far the only different i felt is related to my sex drive which jumped up the minute i ve decreased the dosage so , what i ve been up to ? trip to italy i ll soon be traveling to italy for couple of weeks , the one thing that bothers me about that is that i need to take the cipralex pills with me , the trip is with a lot friends , but none of them know about me taking cipralex , and i prefer none of them will so i m a bit concerned about taking the pills onboard the airplane , what if they will be examined ? or what if they will start asking me questions about it ? i m probably worrying too much about that , but if you got some insight about that i ll be happy to hear it i know that there are probably millions of medications people are taking abroad from country to country with them , maybe i m just exaggerating with this but i ll try to get some information about that and i ll update you on that too besides that it s also important to notice that i don t feel nervous or worried at all , i had no panic attack or anxiety attacks for many days any ways nothing that is related to this planned trip , it s something too , because usually when there s something social planned ahead i would think and worry about it too much , seems like i don t worry about things until they actually happen and then it s too late to worry anyways don t know if i mentioned this to you guys but i m getting married soon , the wedding is set on july , me getting married , can you comprehend that ? i couldn t even get out of the house to the supermarket , i couldn t even talk to strangers , even a dinner i was invited by friends or family used to be a nightmare filled with anxiety and fear and now i m getting married how the heck did that happen ? i bet it got something to do with cipralex a wedding event is stressful enough as it is but to be depressed , with anxiety and panic attack and get married is almost impossible but now i m getting married , i m amazed at myself that i managed to get to that point in my life , and to be honest i don t think i d get there without the help of cipralex i honestly don t worry about the actual event my new way of looking at it is that it s my party anyways so why should i worry ? i should just have fun i know you know what i m talking about , getting married , with all this buying clothes , and rings , and renting a place for the event , and designer and dj s and food and drinks and talking to so many suppliers and you know what i mean , there s no way i could deal with all that days ago just no way at all i rather be dead than to deal with all of that not to mention the actual ceremony lately my rented apartment is always filled with friends and friends of friends , most of them i know through my soon to be wife girlfriend i love it and it doesn t move me at all that people i don t know jump to visit i have much more to tell you friends , but not much time right now , but i do want to answer your questions and comments , i ll do that on a separate post thank you all and have wonderful life email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
