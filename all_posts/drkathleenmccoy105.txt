a year ago , in june , we got a notice that friends for life , a rescue organization in nearby gilbert , az had an orphaned flame point siamese kitten they called him prince charming we named him hamish and he won our hearts and the hearts of our three other cats immediately now as he grows into a sweet and affectionate young adult , we have to admit his first caregivers had it right he really is charming ! bob and baby hamish chilling out with sweet pea and hammie and now bob has plenty of company , no matter what he 's doing reading , practicing tai chi , napping , meditating or watching t v sports reading with hammie tai chi with sweet pea and maggie napping with hammie meditation with hammie bob and gus watching t v sports together and , in all the years he has nurtured our feline companions , bob has discovered that they give at least as much love and caring as they get when he suffers from his epilepsy related depressions , night terrors and nightmares , gus appears immediately lying on bob 's chest purring to calm him , lying across his legs to keep him still and , lately , he has been inspiring the other cats to help bob as well gus comforting bob and inspiring sweet pea and maggie to join them saying yes ! to love , to connections and to caring , whether it 's for a lonely young person needing someone to notice , spend time with and encourage him or for an abandoned animal in need of a home , can bring incredible richness and joy to one 's life through giving , one receives so many blessings happy father 's day to a singular big brother and catman who has earned the enduring love of a very special young man and of several generations of wonderful rescue cats !
