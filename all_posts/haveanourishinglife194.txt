photo published on web here am i addicted to sugar ? some of my favorite sugary foods are chocolate chip cookies , hot chocolate , chocolate anything , banana pancakes , frosted flakes , and baily 's irish coffee creamer the non alcoholic kind a popular diet fad going on these days is the sugar detox the multi billion dollar diet industry is saying that if you crave sugary foods and eat them every day , you are addicted to sugar so let 's stop and think about this do i eat some of my favorite sugary foods every day ? most likely then , am i addicted ? no , technically not do i sometimes want ice cream , cookies , or sweets ? yes am i addicted ? still no i want to bring up a discussion on a linguistics error that i know is causing a lot of problems people frequently use the word addicted to talk about eating sugar in this way if you ate spoonfuls of sugar for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , and you could n't stop yourself , then , yes , i recommend that you get some help please read before continuing on there many different types of eating disorders that are very real disorders if you struggle with any kind of disordered eating , it is very important to get professional help if you want to read more about binge eating disorder or any other type of eating disorder , stop by the blog weightless and read about it here are you really worried about being addicted to sugar ? eating a dessert after dinner , a cookie for a snack , or pop tarts for breakfast is not this terrible thing that we have made it out to be i do n't know all the facts about the human body and sugar i do know , however , that , in the medical field , we have not figured out all the science yet i also know that every one is different certain foods effect certain people and not others i publicly admit that i am not upset about being addicted to sugar by society s standards this is my perspective i am not upset that i am addicted to breathing or eating either it 's the word addicted that gets people s feathers ruffled it is the word addicted that has the negative connotation it s a similar language problem that occurs with the word love i love my husband , craig i love pepperoni pizza in those two sentences , i used the same verb and yet i meant them to have completely different meanings what if i told you that i am addicted to sleeping my comment comes across as if i am doing something bad yet , getting enough sleep each night is an important part of staying healthy i don t think we have mastered the difference in the word addicted as we have done with the word love if i say that i am addicted to sugar , you 'll think that sugar is a bad thing and must , therefore , be avoided at all costs you might think that i am trying to give it up if i talk about sugar in that way you have to admit that you cannot compare the repercussions of being addicted to sugar to being addicted to crack cocaine or any other hard drug yet , we still talk about food as being capable of ensnaring us in the clutches of addiction so often i have heard people talk about their sugar addictions when they talk about it , they act as ashamed as someone who is trying to quit smoking how did food end up being as difficult to quit as nicotine ? let me remind you that a cookie is still food it may contain sugar and other substances that have been labeled dangerous and avoid but it is still food if cookies were the only food left in the world , most would survive just fine unless you have a legit allergy , of course no starving child in africa would turn down a cookie because it has too many carbs or too much refined sugar it is completely irrational to talk about food as being addictive of course food is addicting we need to eat in order to live ! if we talk about food as being addictive , yes , even sugar we start to believe that it is bad but food is not bad we throw around the term addicted carelessly we have to be careful when and how we use that word our children are going to grow up very confused about the differences of being addicted to sugar and being addicted to crack cocaine i am getting too fired up do you want to hear a funny story ? sure you do ! so , i am addicted to calendula again , throwing around the word addicted very loosely if you ve never heard of calendula , it is a natural ointment with similar qualities like vaseline i use it like chap stick i have a small container of the miracle stuff in my pocket or purse at all times my grandma introduced it to me in the second grade if you saw my school picture from that year you d know why and i have been using it ever since my husband and i joke about my obsession and call calendula my crack all in good fun before we go somewhere , i am often quoted saying , i just have to get my crack and i will be ready to go i don t remember how it started but it stuck i am caught without my crack on rare occasions one of those times happened to occur last summer on very short notice , i was admitted to the behavioral health hospital for clinical depression i didn t have time to prepare an overnight bag or anything among other more important items , i left my calendula at home my husband was able to bring me some things the next day he asked if i needed him to bring me my crack i looked around to make sure no one heard , since i was in a mental hospital after all i told him , you might not want to say that around here we had a good laugh about it it was a much needed comic relief at the time again proving my point , laughter is such a powerful medicine lesson learned be careful how you throw around the word crack i mean be careful how you throw around the word addicted more important are our actions than words , so be careful how you relate to food always remember that there are real addictions out there remember that food is not inherently bad food is not the enemy it s okay to eat sugary foods sometimes just remember to thank god for his gift and ask him to bless your food before you eat it
