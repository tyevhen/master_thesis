what a difference a few days make first of all , i'm feeling better the post marathon dip seems to have been thwarted i began feeling better yesterday , and so far today all is well i 've been busy and productive today i ran a race this morning , mowed my yard , went grocery shopping , and took puck for a long walk it 's been a gorgeous , good day yesterday i worked my last day at my current job it was a busy day full of paperwork , but my co workers surprised me with a cake , a thank you card , and a gift card for the local coffee shop i was n't expecting all of that it was very kind of them to do regardless , i am happy to be out of there i'm looking forward to working in a more positive , supportive environment i hope as i said , this morning i ran a race it was a difficult , hilly , mile trail race i was shooting to finish in minutes instead i finished in ! and despite the difficult terrain , i felt great the whole way ! it was nothing like my experience in the marathon just days ago i even ran up all the hills , and i hate hills ! it sure was nice to cross the finish line feeling fast and strong i'm running my next marathon in just two weeks it 's one of my favorites , grandma 's marathon in duluth , minnesota i hope i feel then as well as i felt today the race today certainly helped my confidence if the weather cooperates , i feel more hopeful that this next marathon experience will be better ! tomorrow i work at my occasional weekend physical therapy position i then have two days off to prepare for my new position i start next wednesday i'm anxious , scared , expectant and hopeful that 's a lot to manage , but i'm going to do my best over the next few days the textbooks are out now i just have to open them ! wish me luck
