roy poses , as usual , has a great take on a story that you just could not have made up , even if you tried your hardest deborah powell , the dean of the university of minnesota medical school , has taken a board of directors position for pepsiamericas , which is interesting considering that pepsi consumption promotes both tooth rot and obesity do n't get me wrong , there is such a thing as responsible pepsi consumption , but should a med school dean be in the position of helping to maximize pepsi sales ? perhaps she can also be on the board of philip morris or coors ? read the whole story , then roll your eyes and or bang your head , as you deem appropriate
