within the past couple weeks , i 've had annual employment reviews with my supervisors at each of my two regular jobs i do n't know anyone who quivers with excitement at annual review time , and i am no different but i do like one thing which both current employers do as part of the review process they both require feedback from coworkers the yearly feedback from my colleagues then becomes a permanent part of my employee file i like that there was a time i would n't have liked that piece of the process i was n't a very good coworker then , and i really did n't care what my colleagues thought i cared only about me that was before i got sober things have changed in the last years while it is still a bit daunting to find out what others are thinking , i now appreciate the feedback i want to know if i'm living up to the expectations of those around me if i'm not , i want to know what i can do better it 's as simple as that here 's the amazing part as i 've become more open and responsive to feedback , my coworkers' feedback has been nothing but complimentary , generous and kind in my most recent review , just a couple days ago , words such as cheerful , smiling , willing , team , and pleasure were used that is a miracle of sobriety there was a time when i never would have been described as always cheerful or always smiling life was too serious for that besides , work was a necessary evil , not something to be enjoyed being described as a pleasure to work with made me smile with gratitude what a nice thing to say but perhaps the words of which i was most satisfied were willing and team , as in , etta is a team player who is always willing to take on extra assignments , go wherever we need her , or help coworkers so we all get out of work together and on time that , my friends , is a miraculous statement eight years ago i was not a team player , nor was i willing to do more than required , unless of course , doing so directly and positively affected me i am not that person anymore i know that yet i am still surprised and satisfied to see those miraculous statements i ca n't tell you how different those reviews would have been prior to my sobriety really , i ca n't say it loud enough or with enough impact to help you understand i am a different human being today i am a different human being today , and i owe it all to living life on life 's terms , doing the next right thing , trusting in a power greater than myself , and working the program of recovery in my everyday life what a gift ! i am grateful to be sober today , but more than that , i am grateful sobriety gave me the tools to live a life worth living , and also that i 've been willing to use those tools to become a worthwhile , productive human being yes , i am proud of that it is a magnificent gift
