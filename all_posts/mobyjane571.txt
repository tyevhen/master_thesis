hello this is my first blog so i 'll tell you something about myself and my ideas of getting started in a for menew technology that is a little scary what to name my blog was , of course , my first task then , how to let you know what is the purpose of my blog and some hint of what i'm about so the first two posts are kind of a hesitant introduction to me and my work but you 'll get the idea , i think , of who i am first of all , i have beat depression i did beat depression i do beat depression every day of my life showing others how to beat depression is my mission in life which is why i wrote my two depression books , depression is a choice and brainswitch out of depression some say , quite wrongly , that i can beat depression only because i'm a board certified cognitive behavioral therapist being a therapist does n't mean you can automatically beat depression therapists , psychiatrists and psychologists suffer as much or more depression than their patients the only thing that beats depression is knowledge of how your brain works and practice in managing it know how your brain works , understand how you get from one thought to another neurologically speaking and practice the exercises that let you walk away from the agony going on in the emotional part of your brain the subcortex , while you are actively living in the thinking part of your brain the neocortex it is not an easy thing to do at first , but anybody can learn how to do it , if they want to i'm not here to tell you depression is all in your head if you are suffering from depression you know where it is it has taken over your whole self , your whole world , in fact i think i can help you extricate your self from your depression divide and conquer they always say and help you move into a different world more to your liking so bear with me , as blogging is not like giving seminars , or counseling , or anything else that i am used to i am a beginner at blogging so i will call myself a beginner and begin to hesitantly move into a world totally unfamiliar to me and get my sea legs so to speak before i start getting serious about my mission showing you how to beat depression so to begin my blogging experience this is my second post to my first blog do people have more than one blog ? i did n't have the slightest idea what to name my blog that would describe what i was about , or should i not even try to describe what i'm about and just get down to it so the name was my first task , and a daunting one however , i am nothing if not tenacious , and i'm also a risk taker , so here goes risk taker means i am a person who swims every day in my unheated pool which i also clean so that makes me a pool cleaner as well as a risk taker which can get down to degrees it is always terrifying to jump in during the months of nov through feb but i risk it i am convinced that my twenty two minute , lap swim a lap is back and forth , followed by a hot bath which i draw ten minutes before my swim with no cold water added and then doing minutes of yoga has cured my knees of years of arthritis and my back of years of lower back pain i thought i would name my blog something exciting and earth shattering and impress all my nearest and dearest but all those names were taken already so then i thought i would name it after a character in my favorite book , the count of monte cristo , edmund dantes , but he 's not a she did n't feel right so on to my second favorite book , moby dick also a he then the old neurons started to crank up , the brain works by learned association , right ? dick and jane moby jane eureka ! i know it ca n't be that good a name because it had n't been taken yet but i love the name because it 's mine in addition to being a psychotherapist , and a beginner blogger , i am a wife , mother , grandmother , cat lover , big dog lover , an author of books my board certification in cognitive behavioral therapy was issued by the national board of cognitive behavioral therapists i'm also a licensed psychotherapist marriage family therapist in the state of california , a certified hypnotist , a certified massage technician , and i also have a current card that says diplomate of the board psychotherapy although i worked for , qualified for , and feel i deserve this title , i'm still not sure what diplomate means also i never knew how to pronounce it was it diplomatt or diplomate and , since i did n't know how to pronounce it , i never got the chance to brag about it to anybody in person , so i am taking the opportunity of bragging about it here i was one of those who went into the psychology field to help myself after i was diagnosed more than years ago along with my father and brother with manic depression they call it bipolar now but i'm no longer bipolar , or manic depressive , and i am horrified at the pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists i went to them for years and they could n't tell me how to stop the pain except to take pills who are forcing their drugs and learned helplessness on younger and younger people and more and more research is emerging that says a full of people are not helped by taking anti depressants and some of the research that says anti depressants are helpful is necessarily all on the up and up for instance , a while ago an article came out saying anti depressants were okay for teenagers after there had been a flurry of suicides oh , really ? if you investigated the source of the article , it was the nih , national institute of health okay , that seems credible , until you check deeper and find the study was funded at nih by the johnson family wonderful of the johnson family to contribute to society , right ? that 's the pharmaceutical company johnson johnson this milllion dollar contribution will come back to the johnson family fold in terms of the greater amount of pills they can now peddle thanks to the article you can already see i'm on a mission to get people out of depression without years of therapy and drugs by learning how their brain works so they can control where their brain takes them instead of just riding along , willy nilly , wherever the old habitual neural patterns want to take them
