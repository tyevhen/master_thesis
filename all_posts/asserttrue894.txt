i keep having to re teach myself this , so i might as well post it where i can always find it ! let 'd' be any arbitrary dom node to serialize the node and its descendants via javascript var serializer new xmlserializer var str serializer serializetostring d having a top level xmlserializer object in mozilla is so nice so , so nice but sadly , the output from the serializetostring method is not the kind of xml i 'd like to see element names come out all caps whether or not that 's what you want and it 's never what i want it also converts the greater than and less than symbols inside scripts to their entity equivalents , even if you enclose your scripts in cdata sections to me , entity substitution inside a cdata section makes no sense whatsoever still , it 's handy to be able to serialize a dom tree even if the tags come out all caps
