to give a little insight into the greed of our friends in the pharmaceutical industry , consider that it is generally legal for drug manufacturers to pay generic drug manufacturers to not manufacture generic copies of their medications , even as patents set to expire from the latest new england journal of medicine in august , pharmacies began selling a cheaper , generic version of the blockbuster antiplatelet agent plavix clopidogrel this was good news for patients with cardiac disease or stroke who cannot afford to buy the medication at more than a day but to bristol myers squibb and sanofi aventis , who produce and market the drug , it was a financial disaster plavix is the world 's second best selling drug million americans use it on a daily basis and with sales of more than billion last year , it accounts for about percent of bristol myers 's total earnings in an effort to keep the generic version off the market , bristol myers and sanofi had agreed to pay its canadian manufacturer , apotex , million not to release it until if this agreement fell through because it was deemed unapprovable by government authorities , bristol myers sanofi would pay a break up fee of at least million and they would n't take legal action in advance to stop apotex from releasing the generic if part of this payoff was late , apotex would claim interest at a rate of , per day , chief executive officer ceo barry sherman informed a bristol myers executive by e mail after the companies' pay off settlement was rejected by government reviewers in the case of plavix , after the authorities rejected the initial settlement between apotex and bristol myers sanofi , the companies reached a second settlement , but by the end of july , it , too , had unravelled in the wake of revelations that the department of justice was launching a criminal investigation of the deal a week later , apotex began flooding the market with generic clopidogrel , and within days , more than of plavix prescriptions were being filled with the generic , priced up to lower than the brand name product on august , bristol myers and sanofi won an injunction preventing further sales , but by then , apotex had shipped quantities that industry analysts expected to last until the case offers a rare glimpse of the high stakes arrangements through which pharmaceutical companies delay sales of generics and keep drug prices high all under the watchful eyes of the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice though the cash payments at the heart of this deal are shocking , such reverse payments from a brand name drug producer to a generics company are not illegal what 's unusual about the case is n't the millions promised to apotex , it 's that the settlement fell apart and generic clopidogrel was released for sale in recent years , such settlements have generally stuck , despite federal authorities' efforts to undo them , and generics have been kept off the market the article goes on to describe that these arrangements are relatively common and end up costing consumers a fortune for much more on this topic , interested readers can do a quick search on pharmagossip there are dozens of relevant posts
