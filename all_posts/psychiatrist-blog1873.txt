as i 've mentioned , i have coffee every morning with a judge in hair curlers while our dogs romp the judge walked in and announced , i saw so so at the mall last night holding hands with a woman funny , but so so had the very same , very unique name as my husband huh ? i replied i saw so so at the mall last night holding hands with a woman pause only when i got closer , i realized it was n't so so , but it was a guy who looked just like him oh good , breaking up my marriage was n't on my todo list for today , and i just would n't have had time if my husband is in love with anyone other than me and the entire ravens football team none of whom would pass in drag , i missed it i guess he has a look a like out there with a girl friend anyway , the judge continued , i realized i did n't know if you wanted me to tell you if i found out your husband was having an affair he 's not going to have an affair , i said he told me years ago that he was going to get a nice car instead of having an affair , for his midlife crisis it 's always a surprise , she said you can put it on the blog there are now several people in my life who tell me i should put it on the blog what 's this got to do with psychiatry ? it is a psychiatry blog , afterall , though clinkshrink would have you compare treating patients to dishing up bic macs how does she see that many patients ? and can it really be psychiatry ? i think she must walk through the bunkers or whatever they 're called shaking haldol sprinkles out on everyone sure , it 's a psychologically loaded issue i did n't know , maybe ignorance is bliss coffeefriend and dog , prize walked in and she was clear , she wants to know if her husband is found cheating so so came home from a long day at the office judge wants to know if you want her to tell you if she finds out i'm cheating on you , i said yes , he said okay , everyone , no affairs , the spies are out there
