chapter of the ling shu entitled ben shen is quoted very frequently , especially its famous opening sentence i would like to comment briefly on that sentence and propose a different translation of it the opening sentence of chapter of the ling shu is fan ci zhi fa , xian bi ben yu shen and the words mean literally every needling s method first must be rooted in shen this sentence is usually translated as all treatment must be based on the spirit the implication of this sentence is that all treatment must be based on the spirit of the patient , whatever interpretation we give to the word spirit i propose an alternative translation with two important differences firstly , the text uses the word ci which means to needle , not to treat if the text had meant to use the term to treat , it would have used the word zhi which does occur a lot in both the su wen and the ling shu thus , the first difference is that the first half of the sentence is when needling rather than when treating this is an extremely important difference the second difference is that the shen referred to here may be interpreted as the shen of the practitioner , not of the patient therefore , the whole sentence would mean when needling , one must first concentrate one s mind shen if that shen is the shen of the practitioner , then mind would be a better translation here there are other passages in the nei jing that would support this view for example , chapter of the ling shu uses the word shen to mean the doctor s skill in palpation and needling it says when pressing on a channel the doctor is capable of understanding the disease this is called shen this different interpretation of the opening sentence of chapter of the ling shu is consistent with two factors firstly , the ling shu is very much an acupuncture text and therefore the reference to concentrating when needling makes sense secondly , the advice to concentrate and focus when needling is also found in many places in the nei jing indeed , the word shen is even used occasionally to mean needling sensation chapter of the su wen says in autumn needle the skin and the space between skin and muscles stop when the needling sensation shen arrives there are many passages in both the ling shu and su wen that stress the importance of concentrating one s mind when needling indeed , chapter of the su wen contains a sentence that is almost exactly the same as the opening sentence of the famous chapter of the ling shu in fact , chapter of the su wen contains this sentence fan ci zhi zhen , bi xian zhi shen i would translate this so for reliable needling , one must first control one s mind shen note the rhyming of zhen with shen the english translation of the su wen by li zhao guo simply translates this sentence as the key point for acupuncture is to pay full attention this interpretation is corroborated by the other paragraphs in that chapter which give advice as to how to practise needling in fact , it says that the acupuncturist should not be distracted by people around or by any noise unschuld , in his new translation of the su wen , translates this sentence as for all piercing to be reliable , one must first regulate the spirit this translation would contradict mine but a footnote in the same book reports the interpretation of wang bing the editor of the nei jing one must concentrate one s mind and be calm without motion this is the central point of piercing the central point that stems from an analysis of the famous opening sentence of chapter of the ling shu is how to translate the word shen in my opinion , the word shen can have many different meanings and only one of them is spirit another translation of shen is that of mind which , in my opinion is appropriate in many contexts i have mentioned above two possible meanings of shen in the nei jing , one being the skill of the acupuncturist , the other being the needling sensation in other passages , shen is closely identified with the vital essences of the body this makes sense given the close integration of body and mind or spirit in chinese medicine for example , chapter of the su wen says blood and qi are the shen of a person chapter of the ling shu says shen is the refined qi of water and grains chapter of the ling shu says shen is the upright qi zheng qi the next step of this investigation would be to define the nature of shen mind or spirit in chinese medicine and how that relates to the ancient greek or christian concepts of spirit but this would require a very long enquiry that is beyond the scope of this
