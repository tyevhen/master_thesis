i am depressed as heck right because few months ago i started having eczema breakouts on my hands this was weird because i didn t even know what eczema was and the doctor prescribed a medicine i am applying as much as i can and it s helping a lot but for past month or so i had small red bumps on my back and also my arms which were extremely itchy and i thought it was from bed bugs or something so i took an appointment and the doctor confirmed that it was infact actually eczema breakouts now the reason why set up an appointment was because there was some rash on my face and it also caused some discoloration the doctor took at look at it said it s a fungus and prescribed a pill for me to take twice a day for days and told me that the discoloration won t go away for about few months now i am freaking out i just turned few months ago and never had any skin problems like this that happened all of a sudden should i be worried i know eczema can happen to anyone and has many causes for it and also that the fungus on face can also happen to anyone at anytime but still i am freaking out i come from an abusive house and i ran away years ago for a better life so i don t have anyone to talk to pretty much i can t talk to my mother because she s a manipulator i don t know what to do how should i take this easy and just relax and think about this for a moment i had some goals written down on a paper that i wanted to finish today , but couldn t because of the thoughts in my mind i don t know how i can feel better i notice that once every week i go into the stress thoughts where my mind cannot function anymore i feel like i am writing too much how can i feel better about my situation or condition ? answer are you recently living with any animals ? living in a damp house ? changed your soap powder or shampoo ? it could even be something new or not so new to your diet eczema is a condition you have to treat of the time by yourself , skin doctors can check you over , make sure your applying the correct creams properly , give you medicine and send you for skin and food tests but all in all its you who has to do the most investigating i recommend piriton for the itching or an antihistamine and aveeno lotion
