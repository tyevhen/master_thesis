recent findings in virology have forced biologists to consider many notions that just a few years ago would have seemed heretical and or science fiction like for example , there is now serious discussion of the possibility that cellular life descended from viruses the virus world theory see also this paper a growing but still minority viewpoint is that viruses should be considered symbionts rather than simply parasites see the review by villereal some have dared to propose that the eukaryotic cell nucleus actually stemmed from a virus others have speculated the reverse that the large dna viruses are actually escaped , spore like nucei meanwhile , some say that during an earlier rna world , viruses became the original inventors of dna there 's no question that large viruses of the ncdlv class have nucleus like properties within a short time of infection , these viruses set up a complex structure inside the cell known as the virus factory , and the factory looks a lot like a cell nucleus the authors of a recent paper on mimivirus the famously huge virus that infects freshwater amoeba admitted that in previous work , they did , in fact , mistake the virus factory for the nucleus see photo which is the nucleus and which is the virus factory ? in this photo , vp is a virus particle of the enormous mimivirus developing inside acanthamoeba a smaller virus factory s is just beginning to form on the left macroscopic aspects aside , the large nucleocytoplasmic viruses some of which infect animals and marine life , not just amoeba bring with them many genes for enzymes that are normally found in a cell nucleus i'm not talking about genes for dna polymerases , topoisomerases , etc , but genes that act on small molecules in a previous post , i mentioned the example of pbcv a virus that infects the alga chlorella having its own gene for aspartate transcarbamylase atcase , which is an enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in pyrimidine synthesis this enzyme common to most living things is predominantly found in the cell nucleus of higher organisms there are other examples many ncldv group viruses have a gene for deoxy utp pyrophosphatase , an enzyme that breaks the high energy phosphates off dutp so that uracil is n't accidentally incorporated into dna one can imagine that after a virus invades a cell and unleashes its nucleases on the cell 's own rna , many ribonucleotides breakdown products of rna will be liberated and many of these will then be reduced to deoxy nucleotides by ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase in preparation for viral dna synthesis as it happens , dutp is quite easily incorporated into dna and is promiscuous in its watson crick pairing with other nucleobases the resulting malformed dna can trigger apoptosis in some cells the virus takes no chances it brings its own dutpase to make sure uracil never gets into its dna by mistake some viruses bring their own gene for thymidylate synthase , to bring about the conversion of dump to dtmp in other words , methylation of uracil , in its deoxy ribonucleoside monophosphate form , to give thymidine monophosphate some also have a gene for thymidylate kinase , which converts dtmp often just called tmp to dtdp or tdp yet another small molecule enzyme encoded by large dna viruses is ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase rdpr this enzyme is fundamental to the whole dna synthesis enterprise its job is to convert ordinary ribonucleotides to the deoxy form that dna needs without this enzyme , you can make rna but not dna so it 's typically found in the cell nucleus in higher organisms it turns out , a gene for rdpr is contained in a great many viral genomes when i did a blast search of the protein sequence for chlorella virus ribonucleoside reductase against the uniprot database of virus sequences , the search came back with hits , spanning viruses belonging not only to the ncdlv class pox , mimivirus , phycodnaviruses , etc but also the herpesviridae , plus many bacteriophage groups as well in terms of the sheer variety of virus groups involved , it 's hard to think of another small molecule processing enzyme that spans as many viral taxa we 're talking about everything from relatively small bacteriophages to mimivirus , and lots in between the reductase gene is so widespread , it made me wonder what its phylogenetic distribution might look like in other words are viral rdprs related to each other ? are they related to the host 's own rdpr ? does the enzyme 's evolution follow the viral path , or the host path ? just for fun , i obtained a number of ribonucleoside reductase small subunit protein sequences for viruses , plants , animals , bacteria , fungi , and various eukaryotic parasites using the tools at uniprot org , then fed the results to the tree maker at http www phylogeny fr what i got was the following maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree see this paper for details on the tree algorithm also , be sure to check out this nifty paper to learn more about how to read this sort of tree for convenience , names of viruses are depicted in blue notice how , except for the vaccinia variola group , which is deeply nested , most of the viral nodes are ancestral to most of the higher organism nodes you have to go through many levels of viral ancestors to get from the original , universal ancestor presuming there was one to the reductase gene of the pig , say from this diagram , it would appear that the pox family reductase gene is derived , in some way , from a highly evolved host but that 's the exception , not the rule all of the other viral genes are outgroups and or , more usually , ancestors of one another mimivirus is fairly high up the chain and shows relatedness to two very common freshwater and soil bacteria pseudomonas and burkholderia it would be fun to go back and remake the tree , adding more organisms if you end up trying this , let me know the results for now , i'm comfortable concluding that except for pox family viruses , the ribonucleoside reductase produced by major dna viruses and phages are not derived from current day hosts a parsimonious but not necessarily correct ! explanation is that the phage reductases are ancestral to host orthologs but it is also possible that the phage reductases derive from very ancient hosts not depicted in the tree , with current day hosts appearing to derive from phage genes when in fact the similarity is to a long ago host ortholog in any case , the tree shows that organismal rdprs tend to be related to organismal rdprs and viral versions are related to viral versions what we do n't see anywhere is a viral sub tree growing out of a host sub tree as would be the case if the viral enzymes simply derived from modern host enzymes the uniprot identifiers of the protein sequences used in this study are given below in case you want to try to replicate these results or perhaps extend them to retrieve the protein sequences in question , go to http www uniprot org and click the retrieve tab , then copy and paste the following sequences one to a line exactly as shown o p mih eerr qgzq qms p mia wtwg qty qhmu tmt bwovnad bert fii fl urfh qkln iluy brbh qlsd sgd win qdfs ahfy gxp sb
