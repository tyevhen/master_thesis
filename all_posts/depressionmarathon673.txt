i had my ninth ect treatment this morning it went fine , but i 've been really wiped out since then i spent a lot of the day sleeping and lounging for whatever reason , this treatment seems to have really sapped my energy i saw my inpatient ect psychiatrist different than my usual psychiatrist this morning before treatment we discussed doing an entire course of treatments , which means total i'm taking this friday off , so i 'll likely be done with treatments next week or early the following week i'm feeling better , and i'm encouraged by that but i ca n't wait to be done with ect because i am not allowed to drive for the entire course of treatment asking for and arranging rides everywhere is really tough for me living in two houses at my friends most of the time and occasionally at my own house is also quickly getting old i love my friends i love their home and appreciate their generosity , but i just want to get back to my life this illness steals so much , big stuff like my soul and little stuff like my daily routine i want to go back to where i was in early february before this episode began i want my life back i want my life back , yet i'm terrified of taking it back too soon i do n't want to fail i want to get my life back and keep it so i'm worried about returning home while simultaneously craving time alone in my house returning to work frightens me , yet i miss my patients and the structure my job provides i want to run errands and be responsible for myself again , although i feel slightly overwhelmed by the prospect eventually , i need to take back what depression stole from me it 's knowing the correct timing which may be tricky hopefully , the time for action will become clear as i move back into my life the good news is i'm at a point where i can even consider such action the ect has helped i am feeling better and that , i think , is the best news of all
