yesterday was sunday i try to follow the mantra , lots of god , lots of family , and lots of rest , a quote that i stole from this great book about the vocation of motherhood called , a mother 's rule of life how to bring order to your home and peace to your soul by holly pierlot anyway , both boys took an awesomely epic nap at the same time this never happens i caught a quick nap myself and then just kind of chilled out doing i ca n't remember what as the minutes went by , i got more and more anxious i started pacing what the heck was going on ? my heart rate skyrocketed , and i started breathing heavily i felt like i was going to have a panic attack i did n't know what was wrong there was no logical explanation i thought i 'd be refreshed , but instead , i felt awful the trouble was that , usually , i have a plan and when i do n't have a plan , i feel shoulds and oughts and should haves yesterday , i unexpectedly had hours of free time as this rare opportunity grew , i felt more and more guilty that i had n't used my time wisely or what i thought was wisely all the things i could have done piled up inside my head until i was about to explode as much as i try to make sunday god 's day , i could n't just let go and be content doing nothing , resting as god did on the last day of the week there is so much i feel like i have to do there is so much i 'd like to do but all those things on my lists , yes lists , are not top priority i have not fully embraced my vocation as a mother i still try to fit in all this other stuff to make myself happy so that i can just get through my primary job , being a mom god called me to this vocation of motherhood because , in his great wisdom , he knows it 's my path to heaven and ultimate happiness i may think i have the best plan , but god 's plan is infinitely greater i 'll try to let go of my rules and start following god 's rule for my life
