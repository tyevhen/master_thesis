as i was leaving prison today i noticed a man standing on the corner he was wearing nice pants and a dress shirt he had a knapsack thrown over one shoulder and was wearing sunglasses while talking on a cell phone i did n't think anything of it until he looked over and saw me and yelled , doc ! hey doc ! remember me ? you helped me , you really did i 'd hug you but i know that would n't be appropriate frankly , i did n't recognize him at first i knew who he was after he called my name , but just to see him standing there , well , the context was quite different and he looked very very different from his appearance in prison anyway , he was doing great he had a place to live , a job , was going to aa regularly , staying clean he was waiting for his ride to pick him up for aa his phone rang and he picked it up it 's my ride , he said he told his ride hey , guess what ? i'm standing here with the doc who saved my life ! his ride pulled up , and the driver immediately started waving and hollering at me too my patient said , you remember him ? you saved his life too i had seen the driver maybe twice , just a few days after he had been arrested i remembered him , remembered that he had never been in trouble before , was facing serious charges and was pretty upset then the driver quoted to me , word for word , something i had said to him four years before that had helped him get through incarceration as they were driving off they pointed to me and said , you keep doing what you 're doing you keep helping people i do n't have any trouble admitting that i choked up a bit and by the time i got back to my car i was in tears you see , today was my last day as a fulltime prison doc after about fifteen years i 've decided that for my own sanity i 'd need to cut back to part time and go back to doing another job i 've always enjoyed doing more about that later this was quite the experience to have as i'm going , literally , out the door it 's the experience i 'll remember the next time i hear someone knocking docs who do med checks instead of psychotherapy , or saying that prison does n't help anybody it 's good to remember that sometimes there are happy endings
