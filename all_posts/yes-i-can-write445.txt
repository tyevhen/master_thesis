inspired by jake and anne o 's library program , and jake 's desire to write and illustrate a childrens book , my mother took out a small stack of childrens books from our library a while back they then sat forgotten for a couple of weeks on our shelves until they were returned today well , most of them were returned i found a couple that had been stashed away in a different location , picked one up , and opened the cover i do n't think i stopped smiling throughout the book it was beautiful , bright , and marvelous so i started thinking why is there this stigma , this expectation that only children or those with young children should read childrens books ? a beatifully illustrated childrens book is no less valid an art form than anything that hangs on a gallery wall ! and what was that marvelous book you ask , that book that makes me now want to raid the childrens section of my local library ? it 's called the umbrella and it 's by a favorite author of ours from when i was young , jan brett apperently this one was published after i was older , since i 've never heard of it before , and we always checked out new jan brett books when i was young ! so here 's a little suggestion from me to you , a challenge if you like if you or your children have already outgrown childrens books , and if you 're reading this you certainly have outgrown them yourself , even if your kids have n't , or at least by society 's standards you have forget about that go to your library , look on the shelves and find yourself a beautiful childrens book to love and enjoy ! oh , and if you 're interested in seeeing their gorgeous photo 's , or hearing a bit about their unschooling life , check out anne and jake 's blog here http anneojakeo blogspot com peace idzie you might also like review of a rule is to break a child 's guide to anarchy ways to help someone love reading how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! ways to help someone hate reading linkwithin
