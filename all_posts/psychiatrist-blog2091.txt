if you ever get a chance to visit vancouver , i encourage anyone with an interest in forensics to visit the vancouver police museum they 've got a great array of exhibits historical information about the vancouver police , recreations of various crime scenes including the axe used by a sixteen year old to kill his parents back in the 's , and a forensic medical display not for children one of my favorite displays was the collection of contraband confiscated from arrestees several times my first thought was how the heck would they hide something like that ? and would n't it hurt ? ? of note , one picture i saw there was of the top police sharpshooters on the police force back in the 's or 's the top five shooters were all women ironically , regulations then did not allow female officers to carry guns in the field
