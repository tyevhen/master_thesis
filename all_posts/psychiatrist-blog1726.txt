i read today of a study in hamsters showing that a low dose of viagra sildenafil helps to reduce the effects of jet lag but only when traveling eastward ! that is called a phase advance , when the new time is earlier than your body 's clock no , they did n't put the hamsters on hooters airlines they just woke them up early the team observed how easily the hamsters adjusted by noting how soon the nocturnal animals began running on their exercise wheels when the lights went out they found that sildenafil boosted the ability of hamsters to recover to per cent quicker than untreated animals sunlight is thought to be a key influence on the body clock by its involvement in a neurochemical pathway in which cgmp is involved , and in this way the drug is thought to make the brain more sensitive to the effects of light , dr golombek said however , the drug only worked when applied before an advance in the light dark cycle , equivalent to an eastbound flight encouragingly , viagra worked at doses low enough not to trigger erections , though dr golombek stressed that human tests would be needed to confirm that this was also true for people how did they measure hamster hard ons , i wonder the scientists believe that frequent fliers and shift workers may well benefit from moderate doses of sildenafil , with passengers probably taking it during flights shift work and chronic jet lag reduce mental acuity and increase the risk of a number of medical problems , dr golombek said a potential jet lag treatment for advancing cycles could also be important for the safety of counter clockwise rotating shift work and the potential long term health consequences for airline crews regularly crossing time zones so now there may be a whole 'nother mile high club just for jet lagged shift workers traveling eastward maybe one would use depo provera for westward jet lag , huh ? makes me think of the b 's song , lava my body 's burnin' like a lava from a mauna loa my heart 's crackin' like a krakatoa krakatoa , east of java , molten bodies , fiery lava fire , fire , burnin' bright turn on your love lava turn on your lava light fire , oh volcano , over you do n't let your lava love turn to stone keep it burnin' keep it burnin' here at home
