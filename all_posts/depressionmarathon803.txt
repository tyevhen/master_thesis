we arrived in colorado yesterday afternoon after about hours on the road it was an uneventful drive , and we took our time doing it as the sun comes up this morning , i am looking out over snow capped peaks and purple mountains majesty what makes them appear purple , i wonder ? actually , this morning , very early , a whole lower range appeared orange it was strange and incredible it certainly is beautiful out here puck is loving the freedom of roaming the rocks , prairies and meadows he 's on a leash or tie out at all times at home , so being free to roam is quite new to him he 's growing so old so fast these days , it 's nice for me to see him gallivanting around his ball days have been over since his second acl repair two years ago , and i think his running days are coming to an end , too he injured his right wrist one month ago , and it has n't been the same since i'm so grateful bill and cindy allowed him to come we 've got no plans for the day i really like that probably , we 'll get in some fishing i'm going to try to go for a short run we 're at feet , so minutes up here can feel like miles i'm going to set my sights on minutes and allow myself the freedom to be satisfied with that if i do a little bit every day i 'll be happy that 's all for now i 'll post pics as i take them have a restful day !
