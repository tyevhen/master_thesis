seven days in a row now since i began keeping track with my piggy bank find just over a week ago , i have not gone for one run without at least pennies magically appearing at my feet i was getting a little concerned tonight , as i was penniless with only a few blocks to go , and darkness was closing in fast but just as i began thinking tonight may end the streak , a dirty silver nickel winked from the gravel beneath my feet i giggled as i stooped to scoop it up thanks , god still not sure what the message is , but i am sure having fun with this added dimension to my runs
