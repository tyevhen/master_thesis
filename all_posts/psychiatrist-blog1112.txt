psychiatrist and former podcast guest dr mark komrad asks as chairman of ethics at sheppard pratt i have been approached with a question that seems to stand at the border between ethics and practice guidelines the question is what is the maximum number of patients that a psychiatrist can should see in an hour to be safe and effective ? in other words , the concern is about certain psychiatrists who are starting to see , , even as many as patients in an hour these would average to min per patient if no breaks this is an entirely new level of caseload that is emerging , and the question came to me at what point does it start to become unethical or bad practice i find this difficult to answer , but thought it a good question to submit for discussion on this list afterall , if memory servies , i read somewhere that the typical primary care doc is gives each patient an average of minutes is it possible to do psychiatry with that kind of average time per encounter ? your thoughts ?
