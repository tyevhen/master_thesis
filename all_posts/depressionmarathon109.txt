two weeks from today i will hopefully be waking up stiff , sore and smiling in a hotel room in new york city a shiny new finisher 's medal will be on the bedside table if i do n't wear it to bed , that is i do n't usually think about the day after finishing a marathon because the marathon guarantees nothing , especially a finish but this has been a four year odyssey of hurricanes , hospitals , and injury , each of which prevented me from getting to the starting line in new york city if i make it to the starting line this year i ca n't imagine anything keeping me from crossing the finish line hopefully the fourth time will be the charm and two weeks from today will be a very happy day my training should have me prepared to get to that finish line i completed my last long run yesterday jet and i ran good , sunny miles i felt great it was a nice confidence building run , which is just what i needed out of my final long run now it 's time to taper and my taper has officially begun i'm taking today off the rest of the week i will be running about fewer miles than usual i generally enjoy the first week of my taper , but by next week , when i 'll be running even less , i 'll be itching to move more than i should instead i 'll have to trust in my training and relax easier said than done once i board my plane to new york city my focus will be on staying present and having fun i doubt i 'll ever run the new york city marathon again , so i want to make sure i take it all in i plan to enjoy the marathon i'm not going to race it it 's too crowded for that anyway instead i'm going to try to keep my head up and enjoy the show of course , i 'll enjoy it more if i run well , but like i said , i'm really going to try to keep my focus on the whole experience i plan to romp around and experience new york , too since i 'll be alone in the city , i can do whatever i want without concern for someone else i guess that 's one advantage of going alone besides the museum , i have n't decided what i'm going to do in the days following the marathon yet i 've already been to most of the tourist places , so i 'd really like to get off the beaten path if that 's possible in new york city i'm open to suggestions ! i'm doing well my mouth is healing my achilles is holding up work is going smoothly life is good right now i'm trying to relax and enjoy that , too
