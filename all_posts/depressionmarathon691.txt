you 're doing the right things that 's what they all keep telling me my friends , my therapist , and my social worker you 're doing everything you can do you 're doing it you 're moving forward you 're putting one foot in front of the other you are doing the right things that 's what they 're saying that 's apparently what i'm doing , but it 's not working if i'm doing everything right , why do n't i feel any better ? that 's the million dollar question , is n't it ? if i'm doing everything right if i'm doing what i can to keep moving forward , despite how desperate i feel , why is n't it helping ? why ca n't i fix this dive into the abyss ? this free fall it 's like packing the parachute perfectly , deploying it expertly , and still splatting to the ground ! where 's the reward ? and if there 's no reward , why continue ? how much longer can i , or will i , keep moving forward if moving takes me nowhere ? it 's another million dollar question i'm tired today i'm tired of fighting i'm tired of putting one foot in front of the other yet going no place i'm tired of doing the right things without positive results it 's demoralizing it 's hard it makes me feel desperate it 's depression , and today i'm tired of struggling with it
