grief gambling is a compulsive and addictive form of gambling it usually occurs among people , especially the elderly , who have had a lot of losses and who have n't learned healthy ways of dealing with their grief rather than dealing with their feelings about their losses , people who engage in grief gambling use it as an escape to avoid emotions that are uncomfortable for them generally speaking , they do n't go through the usual mourning process because they avoid feelings that are uncomfortable for them grief gambling can occur at any age , but it often occurs among the elderly because they 've sustained the losses of so many people in their lives unlike excessive drinking or drug abuse , where there are usually signs of impairment , grief gambling is easier to hide people who engage in grief gambling can sit in front of their computers and gamble away thousands of dollars or , as in the case of ms o'connor , more than a billion dollars , in less time than most people would imagine they can maintain their secret life of gambling for a while until , inevitably , they must face the consequences of their losses because these games are always stacked in favor of the house and the odds are against the person gambling overcoming grief gambling compassion instead of criticism for people who have problems with addictive behavior while it 's true that people who engage in irresponsible or illegal activities must face the consequences of their behavior , i believe that , rather than judging people who are caught in the grip of addictive behavior , we need to have compassion for them while it might be hard to understand how someone could get him or herself into a predicament where s he gamble away a child 's college fund or the family 's life savings , it 's important to not to be judgmental what are the consequences of grief gambling ?
