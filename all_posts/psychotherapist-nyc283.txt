we often get disappointed when we have expectations from our loved ones , especially around the holidays , about what we want and they might not want more often than not , if we try to impose our expectations on our loved ones , it 's a recipe for disappointment and resentment sometimes , we need to temper our expectations to be more flexible , recognizing that we ca n't change other people to make them do what we want them to do holiday time can you and your loved ones balance your expectations ? new york times modern love article a holiday built on presence , not presents an article by carolyn s briggs in yesterday 's new york times' modern love column caught my attention called a holiday built on presence , not presents a link to this article is provided at the end of this blog post she describes how she was disappointed last year when her adult children had a very different view of the christmas holiday than she did whereas she wanted a more traditional christmas holiday , her children felt it was more of a consumerist sham of a holiday ms briggs says she had hoped that they would all fill their christmas stockings with messages of love and appreciation for each other , but her children were n't interested in this , which was very disappointing to her ms briggs also discusses how she was disappointed when she was younger during the time when her parents were divorcing she says that she and her brother pooled their money and bought and decorated their own tree because there was no tree that year in hindsight , she says she does n't want to guilt her children into doing what they do n't want to do on christmas she has changed her expectations of what christmas will be like with her family this year it 's not unusual for adults to want to make up for what they did n't get as children there 's something very sad about two children having to provide their own christmas tree because the adults are preoccupied with their own problems yet , we ca n't expect that , as adults , we 'll always be able to make up for what we did n't get as children , especially when the experience involves other people , who might not want to go along with it now as i read ms briggs' article , i could n't help thinking about when i was a young adult and i had similar ideas to her children coming from a very traditional family , when i was in my late teens and early s , i rebelled against these traditions and also felt that christmas was all about consumerism but , as i was reading this article , i realized that my feelings have changed since then and i can now appreciate the holiday spirit i'm not cynical about the holidays , the way i used to be when i was a young adult my feeling is that , regardless of the consumerism , we can make the holiday whatever we want it to be we 're not at the mercy of consumerism reading this article , i looked back on myself as a young adult and thought about the times that i must have disappointed my family when i did n't want to go along with tradition as i read the article , i could see both sides ms briggs' disappointment last year and her children 's resistance as a therapist , i know that late teens and early s is an important time for young adults to develop their own ideas and become separate individuals from their families seeing it from that vantage point , one could see why they would n't acquiesce to her wishes and yet , as someone who is a middle aged woman now , i could n't help wishing that ms briggs' adult children had cooperated a little more not because they believed in these christmas traditions , but because they knew how important it was to her is there a way to balance our own and our loved ones' expectations ? could there have been some compromise ? i do n't know reasonable people could disagree this is n't a black and white issue but maybe the view that there might have been a compromise comes with age and life experience i could n't have taken this view when i was younger when you 're a young adult , you 're struggling to establish your own autonomy , which sometimes means having different feelings and opinions from your family when you 're older and you 're on your own , you have less to prove , and i think you can afford emotionally to be more generous in the end , i think ms briggs came to the right conclusion that even if your family does n't experience the holiday in the same way that you would like as a parent , the most important thing is that you 're together wishing everyone a happy and healthy holiday i am a nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consulaiton , call me at a holiday built on presence , not presents by carolyn s briggs ny times modern love
