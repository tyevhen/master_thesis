i 've been looking all over the place for use cases and user stories that illustrate the key requirements for cmis content management interoperability services , soon to be an oasis blessed standard api for content management system interoperability as far as i can tell , cmis is being developed without a proper set of real world use cases i prefer user narratives over use cases because the latter often is nothing more than a phrase or two , whereas a narrative is just what it sounds like a sentence by sentence explanation of a chain of events a user narrative captures intent , actors , actions , results , consequences i'm finding none of that in cmis , except for four rather trivial use case descriptions in http xml coverpages org cmis v appendices pdf i gather from reading some of the technical committee 's minutes that people have taken develop use cases as action items that 's good going ahead with a spec without first understanding the use cases leads to things like the cmis policy object , which i mentioned once before as something that should be and i think will be dropped from cmis policy should be dropped for two reasons one is that it slows things down if you want to get a standard out fast , do n't make it bigger than it needs to be second , it 's not at all clear what policy means various people have said it is basically access control , whereas at least one cmis expert has said that the policy object can support retention policies those are two quite different things in any case , cmis policy belongs in its own separate standards effort if indeed it has any need to exist and for that , we need user narratives it 's out of band here , imho it 's not core i'm sure people involved with cmis are very busy drawing up scenarios and user stories , and we 'll hear more about it very shortly personally , i 'd like to see some detailed scenarios around the manipulation of compound documents i have some concerns there , but that discussion will have to wait for another time it 's exciting to watch cmis come together , in any case a year from now , we may be seeing some very interesting content management and search mashups i wish i knew what they 're going to look like it does set the imagination spinning , though no question about that
