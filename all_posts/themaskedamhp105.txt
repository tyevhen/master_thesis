it 's not compulsory for amhp 's to wear this t shirt well i m glad you asked me that amhp is an acronym of approved mental health professional is that it ? do you want more ? well , yes sighs ok , here goes the mental health act amended the mental health act one of the amendments was to create the approved mental health professional the amhp has a very important role to play in the functioning of the mental health act hang on a minute the mental health act what s that exactly ? sighs even more deeply ok the mental health act lays down the legal framework in which people can be compulsorily admitted and detained in psychiatric hospitals it covers ordinary members of the public who might become mentally disordered , as well as mentally disordered offenders people who have committed criminal offences and who have gone to court , but who may need assessment or treatment for mental disorder except for people who are dealt with through the courts , the involvement of an amhp is necessary in order to make decisions about whether or not someone needs to be admitted to hospital for assessment or treatment so why do you need an amhp then ? i was coming to that an amhp helps to provide a remedy to excessive medicalisation of the process of assessing and treating people with mental disorder doctors can make recommendations that someone should be detained in hospital , but it is up to the amhp to make the final decision it is also the responsibility of the amhp to ensure that the law is being applied correctly so what is an amhp then ? an amhp can be a social worker , a psychiatric nurse , an occupational therapist or a clinical psychologist a doctor cannot be an amhp before the act , only social workers could do the job then , they were called asw s tell me more about what an amhp actually does with pleasure the amhp role is a complex one it is also unique among the tasks of social workers and other mental health professionals in that the amhp is acting as an autonomous professional rather than an agent of their employees , whether is be a local authority or an nhs trust an amhp cannot be told by a manager to go out and section someone all they can be asked to do is to conduct an assessment under the mha and reach their own conclusion based on all the evidence amhp s have had to undergo extensive specialist training , and therefore have an in depth knowledge of law and have the responsibility for upholding the law when conducting assessments under the mha they can use that knowledge to ensure that the rights of those being assessed are protected , and can provide a counter to the medical model of mental health , introducing a more rounded social perspective to the process they need to use their knowledge not just of mental health legislation but also the human rights act and other legislation , such as the mental capacity act this can give them the confidence to disagree with the doctors , and to seek out and suggest alternatives to hospital admission the amhp will draw on all the information available on that individual , not just the medical and clinical factors this includes their individual social and cultural circumstances , the possible risks and protective factors , as well as their knowledge of mental illness and the legal process , in order to try and reach a just and equitable conclusion which will balance the rights of the patient with their possible need for protection and treatment shall i tell you about the powers and duties of the amhp ?
