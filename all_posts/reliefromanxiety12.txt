if you 've been reading for a long time you 'll know that my biggest anxiety trigger is having a job , mainly because of the fear of failure and things not being in my control but even though this is the case , after graduation i knew i needed to get at least a part time job whilst i figure out my next step i took each hurdle step by step from applying , to organising interviews , to having interviews and finally the job itself , knowing that whatever i wanted to do after each step was on my own terms i could either continue or not after getting a degree , you 'd like to think that getting a job would be made slightly easier , especially a low skilled part time job , but that is not the case ! i applied for around jobs and got only three interviews of only one was successful it 's disheartening , but i was proud of my achievement and one which i knew one day would take me places other than a stock filling job and i held this close to me to make sure i was n't knocked down by the experience i surprised myself more than anything going to interviews provided me with some much needed experience and confidence tasks that challenge you usually always show you that you are stronger than you think and can handle what comes your way eventually i landed myself a part time job , which i was really nervous of on the first day and when all my prior anxiety symptoms related to school came about but , i still forged ahead and the past is history ! i 've learnt that you 're not expected to know everything on the first day and it 's okay to get things wrong and if you do get things wrong , then nothing happens ! everyone is human and no one is perfect and guess what ? you can handle it so , over the next few months i hope to stick at the job i'm in , even if it is somewhat tedious in order to make the next step to my dream career it 's mind over matter amy xx
