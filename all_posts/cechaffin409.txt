a question of faith six gold candlesticks and a central cross grace the altar but i cannot embrace the vacuum of our lord s missing face , the cinnamon fire that turns our gold to dross where is he ? he was never at a loss for words before , except during his passion jesus is , quite simply , out of fashion his guidance might as well be a coin toss when i was younger i gave my heart to him , eager to serve and suffer , eager to please in the vacuum where he doesn t dwell i sought him with all my being , with life and limb now church just makes me cry , i m never at ease if i lost what i never had , am i in hell ? if i began to talk about the grief that the christian faith produces in me , i would have to write a book , not a blog i was converted at and had a wild ride through cults , an undiagnosed manic depressive who got so spiritual that christ had to tell me when to brush my teeth and my manias have always taken a christian bent to sit in church , as i did today , and feel like an utter outcast from god sure , the people are nice but it 's as if nothing is there for me but grief i cry for my mistaken faith i cry for my inability to feel anything towards god or the faith i cry for betting my life on christ and having my life blow up in my face i think my sin is presumption , the expectation that something good should have happened within or without me because of my devotion then i think it might be grief for an earlier time when i could feel devotion , feel something behind the hymns and worship this is a troublesome area for me , but i dared going to church today despite my illness i do n't know if the tears were a good or bad thing probably good , since i knew , vaguely , what i was crying about i was crying about my extreme disappointment with god , as if someone shot my father god is inscrutable to me christ i ca n't relate to i believe in the holy spirit but would never say he 's working in my life religion continues to be toxic to me , though i wish with all my heart it would offer the comfort it seems to offer others at kilorats , ce
