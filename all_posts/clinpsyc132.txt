as noted on the scientific misconduct blog and pharmagossip , there is an online test available the political compass that claims to measure one 's political leanings if one is inclined to think that one 's political views might influence a person 's writing , then my potential bias is revealed in the graph below i encourage everyone who blogs about pharma , mental health , or related topics to take the test and post the results on your blog if you 're not a blogger , it is still an interesting test that is probably worth your time disclaimer i ca n't attest to the validity of this test it is not intended to diagnose , treat , cure , or prevent any disease
