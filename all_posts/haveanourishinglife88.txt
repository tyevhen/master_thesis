there are times when i feel like i conquered the impossible and beat my eating disorder and then there are times when i feel like the e d will be a part of my life forever a few weeks ago , i ate a gynormous wedding style supper at a fund raising event no qualms , no fears , no counting , and no regretting after i was hungry , the food was delicious , and so i ate it was a wonderful gift i felt so normal , like that was what the eating experience was all about i didn t even think about all these things until later because , in the moment , i was thinking about the event last year , i wouldn t have even remembered what the speakers said because my mind would have been too distracted with trying not to eat that much , or with counting calories , or with thinking about making up for all the bad food i consumed yet , just last week , i had such a difficult time getting myself to eat i wanted to go back to my old habits the temptation to skip meals was not just in the back of my mind , but making itself known loud and clear i felt powerless over the eating disorder like i had never learned anything at all maybe i am afraid of the upcoming holidays maybe it s the same old fear of gaining weight or maybe it s something else i haven t recognized yet why is eating , something so basic , so necessary and fundamental to human life , such a struggle ? i wish i could just let it go forever and never have to deal with this eating disorder again other than my mental problems , my life is very good i have an amazing husband , a wonderful house , good friends and family , and lots of other beautiful gifts if i didn t struggle with an eating disorder , depression , and anxiety , then i probably wouldn t have much suffering in my daily life i don t have to cut trees down to keep my house warm i don t have to sew my own clothes and , ironically , i don t have to hunt and kill my own food i ve been given bountiful gifts from god the truth is , all these good things from god are blessings , yes , and very good indeed however , my comfortable life doesn t necessarily keep me close to god or help my relationship with jesus the thing that unites one most closely to god is uniting one s sufferings to jesus sufferings on the cross one cannot know god unless one has truly suffered because , it is through pain that we realize we need god when things are going well , i often forget about god but when i am in pain , i think about god all the time if i didn t suffer from an eating disorder , would i think i didn t need god ? would i still turn to him and beg him for help ? probably not suffering reminds us that we need god every day without him , we would not be here and without him , we cannot make it to heaven this is why many saints would embrace their earthly crosses , their own pains and sufferings because they knew it was the path to god suffering is the most difficult blessing to understand your rod and your staff are a strange mercy in a world where i m not yet home audrey assad song , lead me on so , going forward , i will remind myself of the why maybe god is allowing me to struggle with this eating disorder , because he knows that through my suffering , i will ask for help realizing my complete dependency on him in every moment and in everything i do then , practically speaking , i will take my own advice i will continue to give myself permission to eat i will go through the motions even if i don t feel like it meaning , i will eat three meals a day even when i am tempted not to i have come a long way and i don t want to go back to the way i was before if you are struggling with something , whatever it is , think about all the good that has come from it maybe your suffering has helped you become a better person maybe it is helping you become closer to god we might not be able to see the forest through the trees yet , god never lets us suffer for no reason most of the time , we don t know the reason why but , it is still comforting to know that there is a purpose even if just for the fact that pain and suffering will get you to pray more remember , after the cross is the resurrection
