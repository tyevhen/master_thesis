trial by fog enclosed inside the intimacy of mist our visibility s but fifty feet beyond this bubble we do not exist the road is perilous it turns and twists as if its narrowing shoulders have to meet enclosed inside the intimacy of mist i want to scream , i want to raise my fist and curse the small circumference of our light beyond this bubble we do not exist this driving makes me itch i should desist we have to trust the way like idiot sheep enclosed inside the intimacy of mist back home we make a fire , share a kiss the fog s outside , a monster with no teeth beyond this bubble we do not exist head on your lap , relieved , i feel blessed the breathing of your belly makes me complete enclosed inside the intimacy of mist beyond this bubble we do not exist i have refrained from the political arena thus far in my blog , although being an american i feel myself as qualified as anyone else to comment the parallels to vietnam are not funny that war was winnable then we could contain communism through a corrupt state then it was peace with honor , which meant massive withdrawal and a tacit admission that we had our butts kicked the throes of policy makers at present are legion and unnecessary anyone with a wit of sense can see nothing will improve the situation and that our leaving may be more helpful than our staying , since one infidel enemy will be removed from the conflict but to stay to train iraqi troops , many of whom no doubt belong to death squads , is a lame excuse in supporting a government that cannot stand on its own , just like vietnam who cares about destabilizing the region ? it 's already destabilized and whatever our support does , it only prolongs the inevitable to have bush running around with a divine light in his eyes , telling us this is the war on terror we 're going to win , makes him certifiable , truly he 's a man who believes in his own neocon vision more than reality it 's downright embarrassing europe is right to snicker what a tar baby we have embraced , what a quagmire of mismanagement and fatal underestimation i thought we were going into iraq to search for wmds turns out we invaded to occupy , a notoriously bad idea in a post colonial world the iraq study group did n't go far enough , but no matter looks like bush is n't going to listen to them anyway he must listen to the secret voice of god , like pat robertson how else could he be so sure of himself ? all for today , ce
