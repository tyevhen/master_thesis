anyone suffering with anxiety , depression and any other related illness will ask the question 'why do i have this ? ' i 've asked this question about anxiety many times my therapists have tended to say that we must n't look at the past , but the present however , the main point that has been repeated to me , is that you may never know i can understand that this is n't the answer we were all hoping for , but it 's a very complex matter some people can identify a time in their life which sparked off their problems , such as a parents divorce or a loss of a job however , for many people they will never be a hundred percent sure , or just have no clue what 's always been told to me , is it tends to be a range of the things that build up until we go 'bang' which in this case would be the anxiety i 've always been told that there is no point dwelling on the past , as we must focus on the present to solve the current situation it would be true to say that you could sit with a councillor and trawl through the past to find when it all happened , and perhaps find a trigger however , this would be a hard task for some amy x
