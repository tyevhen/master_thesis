although it is am now as i write this , yestermorn 's insomnia was worse i retired to bed at am and lay there awake and unsleepy the cpap mask hugged my face with its life giving embrace a dark blindfold was tied around my head to thwart the sun 's purpose the sounds of brown noise ebbed in the background , while my headphones were sounding the lilting oddness of binaural beats yet , sleep still eluded me after twenty minutes of lying there trying to think of sleepy thoughts , i suddenly realized how to fix my easy reader manuscript adhd had struck off came the blindfold , and up came the iphone held over my head in the air as i lay on my back , my thumbs pounded away at my new idea just as my triceps and shoulders began to burn with the strain , i typed my last word the manuscript was finished i had taken the agent 's critique to heart and worked on improving my story with luck the revisions would hold up to scrutiny when i awoke i was so satisfied , i finally fell asleep adhd sudden offbeat thoughts had come to my rescue and now i am finally sleepy again adieu you might also like splintered books project update distracted ! how adhd almost kicked my novel 's butt stupid adhd impulses i kind of like in which douglas experiences adhd 's up and down sides linkwithin
