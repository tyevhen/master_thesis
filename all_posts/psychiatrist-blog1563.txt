i told you how roy dropped by for an unexpected visit in the comment section of that post , talk started about how a psychiatrist 's office is set up i was thinking , in response to the notes , no no no , i did n't think about it that hard , you all are reading meaning into places where there is no meaning ! the lack of a clock is n't purposeful , there is no desk because i did n't need one , not because of any great thought about barriers though i would never practice psychotherapy across a desk , i do sometimes think it would make life easier when i eat soup for lunch finally , there were some comments about feng shui so let me tell you about my office , there are some things i thought about long and hard i moved from a group setting when things got very crowded and i did n't want the process to be prolonged i also hate traffic and long commutes , like to be able to go home during down times , so i looked close to home and for something that would take forever to move into i 'll spare you all the details , but i moved into an office that was already occupied by a psychiatrist , and had been occupied by a psychiatrist before that , so nothing in the layout was designed by me the furniture was what i could get fastest so what was in stock at a local furniture store , a couch and chair from ikea that took weeks rather than months in a regular furniture store and some odds and ends from a consignment shop , shelves and a file cabinet from staples the waiting room is small i hate fluorescent lighting for psychotherapy , so there are lamps , chairs , a coffee table with magazines spread out , a replica of an old radio which i set to npr or something soft , another end table there is a folding chair in case someone brings two people with them but no one has ever unfolded it it 's a subdued , but slightly claustrophobic room it used to be totally stark without the lamps and the end table a pretty piece from pier one with musical notes on it until i wandered into the office of the guy across the hall and saw his rugs and antiques and that inspired the pier one visit there are some pictures on the wall , and a patient gave me a cute book of animal photos called the blue day book which sits on one of the tables the magazines are mostly baltimore magazine and a few random things sometimes i bring in the new york times magazine or book review , there is a copy of feng shui yes , i'm not kidding the radio adds to the soundproofing the waiting room has a door and is connected to the office by a short dark hallway there are double doors to the main office this is weird and roy commented on it you open a door and there is a door i was told it is for soundproofing it works the main office is bigger than i need there is a couch for the patients to sit on , a chair for me i bought them together and made sure they were the same height , this was important to me farther away , there 's a desk chair on wheels gives someone the option of sitting farther away , of not sitting on the couch , of rolling around a little there 's an area rug , ' by ' maybe , between them , no coffee table i have a small wooden end table with drawers with an ornamental vase and fake flowery things the real plants i tried all died , pens and a prescription pad a long sofa table holds a lamp and some decorative thingys i think it was from hold everything or pottery barn a large file cabinet sits next to the couch in a corner it 's draped with a piece of fabric to make it look less like cold steel metal a plant sits on top there are some plants on the two windowsills and by the windows the ceiling does this weird uppy thing i keep the blinds are kept mostly drawn , the walls and carpet are light , the office is a bit under furnished and a friend described it as cavernous it 's also gotten a lot of compliments there is a table next to the couch that holds a tissue box a large double bookshelf holds mostly magazines , some books , random objects , and one shelf essentially serves as a desk an ottoman sits next to my chair to collect stuff mail , forms , a clipboard , whatever , and it has a lid that opens to throw clutter in aside from the pile next to the chair and some mess on the desk shelf , there is no clutter , i'm a pretty neat person a closet with double doors holds a dorm sized fridge , microwave shelf with samples , paper goods , supplies , motrin for the occasional headache , a hammer , screwdriver , light bulbs the walls hold some random pictures and the obligate diplomas and when i first started , i asked a talented , creative , decorator friend to come help me with colors she pulled the place apart and put it back together in its current state the carpet got lighter and the walls got darker my friend is a feng shui expert , so the place has been infused a little , though no running water , no hanging crystals a water thing would nice a little about my office decorating consultant shelly daly a stone
