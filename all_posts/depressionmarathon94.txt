i 've got a bit of a conundrum i'm feeling really lazy and unmotivated to do anything except work and run and if i did n't have to work , that list might be reduced to just running my motivation for everything else , the basics of everyday life like errands , chores , eating , and socializing , has completely vanished at least i'm running , i guess when i returned from little rock the week before christmas i was n't motivated to do anything i chalked it up to fatigue from the combination of running a marathon and hours of driving in dicey weather of course i returned to work right away , but it took almost one week to get back to running since christmas i 've been running well and working when scheduled , but otherwise nothing when i'm not working or running , i'm quite sedentary i do n't want to do anything in fact , i barely want to move it 's a little weird my mood seems good work is fun and fulfilling and i'm pleased with my running , both the miles i'm accumulating and the pace at which i'm running them maybe when the college football bowl season comes to an end , and i have less reason to sit on my butt in front of the television every single day , my motivation to take care of myself and my house will return i do n't know i guess i 'll find out soon enough it would be nice to get my motivation for day to day life back as it is , i'm forcing myself to do the bare minimum to get from one day to the next i'm eating a lot of take out , cereal and pb j that 's made it easier to keep up with the few dishes i 've dirtied i finally did my laundry because i ran out of work clothes but my floors , bathroom , and empty cabinets definitely need attention i keep telling myself i need to vacuum , clean , and go shopping , but i do n't i nap , watch tv , or go to bed instead i guess i'm tired ? or lazy ? or is this a sign my mood is about to take a dip ? like i said , it 's weird i have enough energy at work i have enough motivation and energy to run , even on a really cold day like today , but i just ca n't seem to care about anything else i'm a little concerned , but i'm more perplexed and annoyed than anything else i guess i should stop trying to figure it out it will pass , just as everything does i have to remember that until it does , well , perhaps i 'll take a nap
