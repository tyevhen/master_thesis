i will get back to ocd in the mean time a new paper came out called nutrient based therapies for bipolar disorder , a systemic review and this paper is not written by some press agent working out of the basement of a supplement company it 's the massachusetts general hospital bipolar research clinic i 've been in meetings with some of these folks and heard them speak psychiatry in boston and the east coast is such a funny mix of psychoanalysts and rigidly conservative psychopharmacologists apparently on the west coast things are a little different , with more acceptance of polypharmacy and supplements but from the center of the most conservative bastion of psychiatry from the s s and some of the busiest depression and bipolar pharmaceutical clinical researchers on the planet comes some really cool work with supplements and alternative treatments i'm a big fan of neirenberg and fava over at mgh and their work with alternative therapies they have open minds and scientific eyes tame impala feels like we only go backwards let 's get to it bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose and more difficult to treat i try not to judge too much when someone comes to my office with a bipolar ii diagnosis on the newest , most expensive antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer when they really have depression plus adhd and or anxiety symptoms and or a history of being traumatized all the diagnoses in the dsm are from the symptom level up , not from the brain pathology down , so things are messy but despite all that there are plenty of honest to goodness bipolar folk who benefit from mood stabilizers but of appropriately treated folks continue to experience subthreshold symptoms , and side effects continue to be a major problem omega fatty acid supplementation may be useful not only for brain health but for physical health of course i personally prefer limiting the omega consumption and eating a nominal amount of cold water oily fish weekly practical aside here one trick is to make tuna salad with cans of light tuna , one can of sardines , celery , pickles , carrot , onion , spices , and your own olive oil mayonnaise i use the olive oil recipe from well fed which is still my favorite paleo cookbook , though eat like a dinosaur is great for kid friendly meals and primal blueprint quick and easy meals is also a staple individuals with bipolar disorder are more likely to be obese , less likely to cook their own meals , and more likely to eat sugary foods and , according to a recent paper looking at the nutrient intake of people with bipolar disorder , they tend to consume food with lower levels of thiamin , riboflavin , folate , phosphorous , zinc , vitamin b , and vitamin b compared to the population norms omega fatty acids work by increasing membrane fluidity and normalizing signal transduction , reducing inflammation , and activate nuclear receptor effects in bipolar disorder , the first studies were done by andy stoll of high doses around g , and over a period of months , there was significantly less depression and higher levels of global functioning epa dha has the most data , and the amount used in various studies vary a great deal ala flax oil was not found to be useful , nor was dha alone mania does n't seem to be affected , only depression and general functioning symptoms , and the effect sizes are not strong enough and the intervention not studied enough to take in lieu of regular pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder however , as an adjunct , the risks may be very low compared to possible benefits inositol has also been studied several times but all small sample sizes in bipolar depression see my earlier post for the mechanism again , as an adjunct , it seems to have some promise for depression , but we need larger sample sizes choline might be helpful by improving and increasing the efficiency of brain energetics the brain is hungry for atp the energy currency of the cells , and in many neuropsychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder , energetics seem to be impaired , possibly by inflammation and oxidative damage choline is the main reason along with all those delectable b vitamins and general yummyness that i think advice to toss out the egg yolks is idiocy all the randomized controlled studies of choline supplementation in bipolar disorder are small , and of complicated patients for example , rapid cycling bipolar and cocaine dependence one small open label trial by stoll did demonstrate some benefit for mood magnesium deficiency , as i 've discussed in the past , is quite common in the general population signs of deficiency include irritability , fatigue , insomnia , loss of appetite , mental confusion , and a vulnerability to stress magnesium also has some effects on neurotransmission that are similar to mood stabilizers lithium , valproate , and lamotrigine there are some small studies of manic patients doing much better with adjunctive magnesium added one was oral magnesium oxide , the other injected magnesium in severely manic patients there is only onse study of magnesium as a monotherapy , and meq daily did reduce mania in rapid cycling patients chromium i have n't written anything on chromium yet should get on that seems to improve insulin sensitivty in the hypothalamus and affects the monoamine neurotransmitter systems enhanced hypothalamic function may increase the release of serotonin , norepinephrine , and melatonin there are a few studies showing efficacy in unipolar depression , but not atypical depression , and in the one study of bipolar disorder , there were lots of drop outs folic acid has been studied only once in bipolar disorder , in conjunction with valproate which interferes with folate metabolism it seemed to be helpful , particularly for cognitive symptoms there are more positive studies in unipolar depression , and there 's no reason to think it would n't be helfpul in bipolar depression though there are reasons to think folic acid might be an inferior supplement to l methylfolate , they have not had head to head studies in depression as far as i know rapid tryptophan depletion will decrease serotonin levels in the brain it can be achieved fairly readily using a tryptophan depleted drink see this post for more details in canada , it is actually approved as adjunctive therapy to lithium in acute mania , and another study of manic patients showed it might be helpful , but of patients could n't tolerate the drink l tryptophan itself also looked like a promising antimanic agent in a small study of patients grams daily , looks like , for two weeks however , after it was banned by the fda in , further studies have been lacking in general , nutritional supplementation to current therapies may work synergistically with the therapies such as folate and valproate , and for many therapies excepting perhaps chromium and rapid tryptophan depletion , the side effects and risks seem lower compared to the conventional therapies or combining conventional therapies , which is often done with resistant cases now more larger studies of some of these combination effects would be great to help us clinicians in the field have a larger tool kit from which to work in addition , the nutritional therapies have n't been tested with consistent dosing or in consistent populations to really give us a sense of optimal amounts or usage their potential coud be fantastic
