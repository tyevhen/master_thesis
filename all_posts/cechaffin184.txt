i 've been a bad , bad blogger as i have not blogged in nearly two weeks ah , the suspense ! has he retrogressed into depression , are his joints regenerating , can he play an acoustic guitar yet ? are there new publications , new formulations ? what happened to his theory of the mind ? yes , i had a meltdown after briefly visiting the scene of the crime , my sister 's house where i underwent electroshock as an outpatient and worsened with each seizure plus invega i came to tears about it friday , indeed dipped into the bone closet for a spell , but my loving wife and neurochemical manipulation promise better , though i must stay on an increased dose of abilify for now my joints hurt mucho but i am curiously glad to be alive , presently in that transition phase where sleeping with my head to the side is nearly possible for half an hour before pain intervenes it is hard for me to play the acoustic guitar , my left ring and pinkie fingers are numb and the dorsal extensors of my left forearm are weak as well july was the accident date it will likely take a year or more for the central neuronal axons to regenerate , and physical therapy cannot increase the rate of nerve growth patience , in other words there are new publications , but for now a new poem abduction a tongue of lacy foam nudges the stranded bull kelp upshore caramel bulbs float , pulling brown snakes behind like heavy hoses , brittle when snapped , coiled in medusa mounds the color of molasses , pods softly popping under heels sea glass sparkles beside abalone fragments , prisms of pink and the mussel 's sky blue and limpet rings the tide rises , kelp edges up onto fine dry sand where strands desiccate to bitter black far west a storm died , power done and undone , telegraphing a swell stone holds were ruptured , water trees uprooted , some with young bulbs thin as the human amnion so i was ripped from my moorings , sea story over , sunk down like dough in a doctor 's palms , seal heavy in the white glare , tucked in a bassinet and spirited away from mother sea , her bells and voices , the kelp towers my theory of the mind foundered upon the shoals of will will is the simplest aspect of being and yet the most inscrutable i cannot move my arm unless my arm consents to move the body is more a democracy than we think and initiating action , and what goes into the timing of that , are hard to separate out am i willing my fingers to type ? only in a general way rather i am filling white space with narration and my fingers are obedient servants , like workers in a hive having incorporated mitochondria and other organisms into our being , it might be instructive to think of ourselves as a metaorganisms , a colony of ants , for instance , with the ego for queen and the link between mental control and physical action is interdependent i will a muscle to flex , it flexes unless emotion or danger forbids should i punch back if punched ? and what are the consequences ? or do i reflexively punch back without a thought , like a spring mechanism ? or does the latter only occur when the challenger seems weaker ? if i'm cold , do i actually will myself to bundle up or do i grab an extra blanket without thinking ? existence occurs by bodily participation , be it only the sensors on alert imagine living without moving to move is to live , if it is only movement of the mind , a concerto of neurotransmitters chattering i 've weakly answered my opening questions if i had anything to say to you it would be to bet your life on love , practice love in all you do , aspire to act lovingly even when you feel antipathetical toward compassion the discipline will fill the empty times , the reward is greater than you imagine fragile , near two kilorats , ce
