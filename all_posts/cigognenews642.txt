the brain 's evolution and therapy do you ever wonder why it is that we fall asleep in reverse order of evolution ? and why we come out of it in correct order in means , first of all , that we are prisoners of the brain s evolution and when we start to become consciously aware we move to the highest level of the brain we come out of antiquity into modern life as though we have gone through the centuries or the millennia in proper order each day in order to achieve consciousness we do the same thing in primal therapy and in doing so we must strictly obey evolutionary edicts we can no more change that order than do so in our sleep and when we trump that order in sleep , psychosis lurks if we do not have enough dream second line limbic consciousness sleep we suffer and we develop physical and mental symptoms now what is crucial here is if we trump that order in primal therapy we suffer from those very same symptoms that is why re birthing is so dangerous it trumps evolution that is why cognitive therapy cannot work it trumps the feeling areas of the brain and ignores evolution as with dream sleep , primal therapy enters the deep unconscious , slowly in ordered progression down on that deep level lies so many of our remote and life and death pains it shows itself in our nightmares which are associated with terrible terror anxiety states , and it is demonstrated in deep primals where heavy pains reside until we have access to those imprints we can never know about life endangering memories , nor include them in a therapeutic process what this tells us is that we are evolutionary beings who biologically must adhere to the history of mankind there is an order to the universe of which we are part i cannot stress this enough we do not take patients into birth traumas in the first weeks of therapy anymore than in dream sleep we go directly into deep sleep evolution is an ordered affair we must not superimpose our ideas , our theory or our techniques on patients the rule is that it is not up to us to decide for the patient , as for example , that she needs dream analysis , or neuro feedback or rebirthing it is always the patient and her readiness that dictates our approach each new brain level in evolution helps out with survival , otherwise it would not be there the brainstem and early limbic system have everything to do with survival breathing , blood pressure , heart rate and body temperature evolution continues with its survival strategies finishing up with the neocortex what this structure can do is detect enemies not only without but within our feelings and when it does it helps us survive by disconnecting us from the source of the pain a self we will never meet again until we have access to deep brain structures that may be never and that may kill us prematurely as we travel through evolutionary time to the neocortex each adds its physiologic contribution the reason that ideas cannot trump feelings is that feelings are integral to survival they are a survival system the neo cortex is also very important to survival but in a different way when we are in a coma without any neo cortex really working our survival functions heart rate , blood pressure , etc , are still operational animals survive very well without a complex neo cortex they won t survive if the brainstem is damaged we have to breathe no matter what each lower level of brain function is designed to keep us alive we can use lower levels to modify higher ones but it does not work in reverse imagine if the higher level neocortex could permanently modify brainstem functions ? we survive because it cannot thus feelings can certainly sway ideas but ideas can only suppress feelings , not eradicate them we see in our therapy how physiology and limbic feelings directly affect ideas and beliefs a very rapid heart rate can push someone to go and do , yet no matter how hard we try we often cannot permanently alter the heart rate , especially the rate that is accompanied by anxiety that is why we cannot will a slower heart rate over time ideas are hundreds of millions years away from physiological and emotional functions we know that the amygdala is pretty well mature at the time of birth so that we can code and register inchoate feelings but the hippocampus is not yet fully developed for several years so that precision regarding the time and place and scene or origin is beyond its capacity so we can dredge up feeling on the experiential level but not on the verbal one so for those who claim to practice rebirthing we have to ask if there are any words to go along with the event if there are , it is not a true event we cannot overlook brain evolution in our therapy and perform what amounts to magic
