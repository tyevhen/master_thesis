let us not forget this when 'i raise my arm' , my arm goes up and the problem arises what is left over if i subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that i raise my arm ? so one might say voluntary movement is marked by the absence of surprise and now i do not mean you to ask but why is n't one surprised here ? ludwig wittgenstein , philosophical investigations in these later paragraphs of part i of the investigations wittgenstein explores the idea that what may be 'left over' when i subtract arm rising from arm raising are a set of kinesthetic sensations that are equivalent to an act of willing there is no evidence that he intends to take his own question seriously to suppose so would miss the entire ironic tone of the entire investigations , any more than he wishes to take the answer seriously for what he appears to wish to reach is a point where the question 'how do i know that i raised my arm ? ' when i raised it has no traction for him where its own roots in an estranged conception of the human subject can be exposed , and the question laid to rest i do not say see , my arm is going up ! when i raise it the person who has such a relationship with their body has clearly become alienated from it they , perhaps , have become an interiorised will er of exteriorised actions no longer identical with their own living bodies , they become the intender of their bodies' movements and the perceiver of the consequences of these movements we might imagine that arm rising is a constituent ingredient of arm raising that we could add some other ingredient to arm rising to arrive at arm raising that we normally have some awareness of this ingredient when we engage in arm raising , and this is why we are n't surprised when our arms rise when we raise them but are surprised when they rise when we do n't raise them but would n't this be misguided ? might instead it not be the case that there is no reason why we are not normally surprised when , raising our arms , our arms rise we might say we are not surprised just because we are raising our arms which is of course not to answer the question but just to re state one part of it although it is nevertheless i am suggesting the only answer that could be given the notion that knowledge amounts to an identity relation between a subject and an object sometimes surfaces in the history of philosophy it never appears terribly plausible when stated quite so baldly but the present case provides us with the kind of example that might have inspired its original formulation when i am raising my arm , my knowledge that i am raising my arm is nothing other than my raising my arm i do not know it on the basis of anything the 'how' question 'how do you know ? gains no traction my knowledge and my arm raising are of a piece with one another there is then no need for the assigning of epistemic intermediaries sensations , conative introspection , etc to fulfil this mythical function for us there is no need to posit some supposedly self evident but actually redundant immediate experience of self agency no need to posit some 'ipseity' by means of which our consciousness supposedly knows itself we are not surprised because no malfunction has occurred arm raising is happening as it should when it happens thus i the knower am of a piece with i the bodily agent in exceptional cases the two may come apart sometimes i may be surprised by my body 's movements , in which case i am not their agent although we might need to do some fancy conceptual footwork to accommodate john hyman 's nice example of from memory a violinist being surprised when they pull off a particularly difficult performance without hiccup on the whole , i am not and why should i be since my knowledge and my action , my anticipation and my intention , are of a piece with one another alienated from our own lived bodies , the question 'how do i act ? ' naturally provokes an answer of 'by trying , causing , ' , and the question 'how do i know i act ? ' also provokes an 'by inward mental or somatic perception' leave behind this alienated conception of the self , and we can leave behind the questions , the answers , and the very idea of an 'experience of agency' postscript someone might ask why i am blathering on about this in a blog about the philosophy of psychopathology the reason is simple it is tempting , when confronted with cases of , say , 'made action' passivity experiences of the body in schizophrenia , to imagine that here we have a case of self consciousness gone awry as if there is some normal psychological mechanism which affords us access to our own bodily intentions , and on the basis of which we can reliably anticipate our own actions whatever the strengths of such an account like chris frith 's at a purely subpersonal level using notions like 'intention' in 'motor intention' in a metaphorical sense in neuropsychological discussion , there are , i believe , no such merits to be gleaned at the personal level by demonstrating alleged philosophical ingenuity and developing an 'account' of 'agential self consciousness' which posits a inner act of self consciousness which allegedly makes possible our normal self anticipation , the philosopher appears to be in a position of ingeniously explaining 'what goes wrong' in the psychopathological case schizophrenic passivity experiences get explained in terms of a lack of the phenomenal experience of 'ipseity' or what have you the costs of this the falsification of the grammar and phenomenology of everyday intentional action , and the making too much sense of the necessarily bizarre phenomenon of passivity experiences themselves , simply go un noticed
