i got a note today from someone at nursingschools net informing me that they featured my blog in an article about depression blogs it 's always surprising when my little blog gets recognized like this , and i am very honored i appreciate nursingschools net support , and i am glad they are doing their part in getting the word out about this illness in other news i ran a race last night it was a k cross country race at a nearby golf course i thought long and hard about running it because i really do n't care for it this race hurts there is a very vertical hill about yards into the race , which is where the pain begins there are or short , steep hills and or long , gradual hills interspersed throughout the course , so the hurting does n't end until the finish it 's a bit brutal knowing that i was n't in the best shape , and keeping in mind the difficulty of the course , i decided i would n't race all out it did n't matter it still hurt and i think i ended up going as fast as i could anyway i was disappointed with my time , which averaged just over minutes per mile , but i should n't have been i knew i was n't in racing shape i should have just patted myself on the back for getting out there at all but alas , my perfectionism struck again ! perfectionism is a dangerous trait for someone with depression sometimes , i think , perfectionism has kept me in my low spots longer , because i expected so much from myself even though i felt like crap ! i 've worked hard to keep those perfectionistic thoughts at bay when i 've felt low , and i think i 've been fairly successful i 've learned to allow myself space and accept where i'm at where my depression is concerned if only i could allow myself space and accept where i'm at where my running is concerned ! like i said in my last post , i'm a work in progress tomorrow during my long run , perhaps i 'll keep henry van dyke 's words in mind use what talents you possess the woods would be very silent if no birds sang except those that sang best carry on , my friends !
