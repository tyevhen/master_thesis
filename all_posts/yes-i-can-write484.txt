shopping briefly once again today i got an absolutely awesome purple glittery shirt ! wow , that made me sound really girly i just love glittery things though , and purple ! anyway , shopping is fun but i 've decided except for a couple of things i actually need not to buy cloths for a while , since cloths are hard on the environment as well synthetic fabrics are made from oil , and cotton is sprayed with a lot of pesticides and crap nasty stuff in other news , i chatted with some people online , thought about life and where i want to go in it , chattered enthusiastically with my dad or should i say at him ! i had a lot of news to fill him in on , since he 's been away for a whole week ! i feel like i could have done more , so i'm a bit dissatisfied , but i still really enjoyed chattering i tend to be considered quiet , but that 's only in certain circumstances mostly , i'm not ! also of note , today marks the one week anniversary of this blog yay ! i actually managed to write every day ! i plan to keep that up so , off to bed , since i'm still rather tired today i 'll recover from my late nights eventually i'm sure listening to today something by communic do n't remember what it was called reading a book on urban legends ca n't go see what it 's called because i have a cat on my lap oh well you might also like a perfectly lovely day waaaay too much cleaning ! debating and discussing green anarchy linkwithin
