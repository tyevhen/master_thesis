i 've not got much to report today i'm feeling a little better everyday my knee is coming along the swelling is significantly less i'm able to put some weight on it , and i'm working on flexing it a little further everyday i'm pleased with the progress the main issue i'm having is boredom ! there is only so much one can do in one 's own house when one only has the use of one leg ! i'm spending most of my time sitting on my butt watching tv , reading , and snoozing for a little wrinkle , i add ice to my knee i get up and amble around , but i have a little house that distraction does n't take very long the days are getting really long i'm bored things are getting taken care of around here i'm not supposed to drive yet , but i went out to a board meeting the other night i had to get out of the house ! a friend picked me up for an aa meeting this morning that was nice aa'ers are good people one friend has been taking puck for walks she even took him for a run today that made him happy and tired him out ! another friend offered her sons to mow my lawn and rake my leaves if they agree , that would be a big relief ! so i 've really got nothing to complain about i'm grateful to be surrounded by such caring people things are going well despite my lack of patience i'm anxious to exercise again , and i may try lifting some light weights tomorrow other than that , i 'll be here sitting it 's all part of the process to get me running again that 's the goal waiting on the other side of the boredom with patience , i 'll get there
