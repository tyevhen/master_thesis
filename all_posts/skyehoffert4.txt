i usually post way more snippets when i'm doing a contest i have found myself strapped for time , but since i did n't have a post planned and i am working on the final chapter i thought it would be fun to comb through the document for my favorite bits i snapped up , thick strands of black hair plastered to my face i peeled them away and flipped around on the taut cords that formed the net the speaker was standing in the shadows i recognized his cocky stance and my initial panic quelled it was just chayse snow it was an odd thing to say , but he was an odd boy he dressed like a vagabond , even though his mother owned the circus clunky black boots , paired with an oversized and ratty , fur lined coat a full collar cut around his sharp features he smiled crookedly , a cheshire cat smile that combined with his mess of tawny locks and flashing green eyes made him look almost vicious in the torchlight snow i glared at him , he knew he was playing with fire , but he was a boy who didn t seem to burn snow mother was beautiful , even i couldn t dispute it high , sharp cheekbones paired with vibrant , glowing skin she only looked to be in her mid thirties which was a far cry from her true age the price of it was more than i could stomach it made her beauty grotesque , dead even chayse her frosty eyes were clear as she took in her flawless complexion with a critical eye she picked her way through her assortment of beauty products and jewelry the silver canisters caught the light , shimmering amongst the crystal perfume bottles i always wanted to take a couple of the more valuable items to a local pawnshop i would probably get a nice sum chayse she smiled and turned to me one cannot trust a charmer like you not to lie i raised you to be far too good at it i smirked stretching out on the soft cushions never i wondered if she could see the deception in my eyes i wondered if she hated me , like i hated her chayse i shook out my hair and dried the ends with the towel , as i set about removing the half washed off makeup the water was actually helpful for that there was a boudoir for this task , so in the dim light with a dirty mirror , i rubbed at the pools of black under my eyes so there is a girl , underneath all that a voice spoke from behind me it was unmistakably male snow i made a sad face that wasn t all that hard to express at that moment the crowd laughed , enjoying the clumsy clown getting its comeuppance i stalked off stage , miserable and dripping snow he seemed unbothered , fortunately for you , i know the owner i m sure she wouldn t mind me taking a look around he looked completely out of place in our dingy surroundings an immaculately tailored suit , complete with shined shoes , he made an impression the look on his face showed that he was well aware of it snow chayse , old boy the cultured tone was mocking he seemed to wear the word haughty his suit was perfectly cut and probably made of silk woven by fae weavers he held a lit cigarette in his hand , and it was the only thing that seemed uncouth about him he took a quick drag and seemed to take in my rumpled appearance chayse i pulled off my leather gloves with my teeth , and placed them in the ridiculous top hat the costume was a glitzy atrocity that mother had made she had chosen red , circus colors , the color of blood i hated it in all its garish glory i shed it at the first opportunity mother liked her things to be presentable and shiny i made a point to be anything else chayse it looked magical it was magic and i was tired of it the cheap glamour to cover the broken bodies and blood spilled to create it mother cocking her head in a laugh , gold lips parted over too white of teeth her eyes lined to look like a cheetah s , her gold painted lids a sharp contrast to the black she looked fierce and ready to devour chayse so those were a bit random , and the fonts are all different it 's a mess , but so is my mental state also published this post early sorry about that
