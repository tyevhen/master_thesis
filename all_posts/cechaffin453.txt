a sonnet for poets the voice i seek to voice is only sand look now the devil wears a tricorn hat napoleon on amphetamines remand this suspect to that prison , this or that merlin made an elephant of a toad bless the small finches ! all the tan oaks are dropping acorns on the asphalt road no dog no cat the poets get the jokes oh , a blue martini wonderfully stirred when then ile fit you a cranberry cape cod the glass is sweating so the ice is blurred i believe in the devil but not in god the couplet should make something of all this dunk your head in a vat of hippo piss my mood seems to be improving , so i let today s sonnet disassociate in the post modern tradition and i want to say this , and mark my words it is easier to write obscurely in a dissociative , post modern fashion than in a traditional fashion narrative is hard work so is unity when these are removed , a sonnet can be composed much more quickly , while a free verse poem finds its own propulsion and the only readers that remain for this fiasco are poets and aficionados the state of poetry today robert pinsky tried to ameliorate this cultural trend by making a record of americans favorite poems i do not believe charles olson or paul celan were represented william carlos williams averred that the waste land ruined poetry because it came too early for proper literary development in other words , it was inevitable but it came prematurely it was a futuristic anachronism for the state of poetry at that time in my essays on eliot , available at the melic review , i repeatedly make the point that there has been nothing really new in poetry since the waste land , which contains everything from lower class chatter to nonsense sounds and a sort of false erudition this doesn t mean there have not been great stylists since , like thomas or larkin or roethke or strand , only that there were no rules left to break thus i am free to write a sonnet today whose puzzle for the reader is the reader s puzzle and not mine it is not my job as a post modern poet to make sense , only to make a few connections between images and emotions if this is how you like your poetry , fine i just want to emphasize that much of what parades as new and original may in part be a blind for pure laziness , an unwillingness to learn form and clarity before galumphing about in the disorganized cupboard of the poet s mind at kilorats but feeling fragile , ce
