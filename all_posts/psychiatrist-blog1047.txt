when i was in medical school i was fascinated by neuroanatomy and neuroscience i enjoyed reading popular science books like broca 's brain and the three pound universe i liked reading about the classic clinical cases studies that taught us a lot about how the brain works cases like phineas gage , the nineteenth century railroad foreman whose brain injury revealed the purpose of frontal lobes , or the case of h m , the man whose temporal lobectomy taught us about the how memory works patient h m had parts of both his temporal lobes removed in order to treat a seizure disorder after the surgery he was unable to form new memories at all , and he became one of the most studied subjects in the field of neuropsychology from h m we learned that there are two types of memory , declarative and procedural memory declarative memory is the what we use when we learned facts procedural memory is what we use when we learn how to do things , like brush our teeth or ride a bike h m 's temporal lobectomy destroyed his declarative memory , but his procedural memory was left intact i'm bringing this up now because of an article in wednesday 's new york times , dissection begins on famous brain patient h m , whose name we now know is henry molaison , died last year and donated his brain to a neuroscience project at m i t they are in the process of sectioning his brain to learn more about what went wrong with it there is even a web site , the brain observatory , where you can watch the sectioning as it happens i read the story and checked out the sectioning web site , but my reactions are mixed as a psychiatrist it 's fascinating to see that we can study a lesion from an individual patient all the way down to the microscopic level , but as a human being it leaves me feeling rather sad for this guy it was noble of him to donate his brain , and years of his life , to science but on the other hand i ca n't help wondering if he ever just wished people would leave him alone
