my mind is blank from crying crying empties the mind and exhausts the body it is a blessing under normal circumstances but in my case more of a reflexive seizure i cried through most of my appointment with my shrink today i think i conveyed the sense of utter hopelessness i experience i have withdrawn from my pain medication and am not drinking , the former at my suggestion and the latter at his insistence whether his insistence is enough for my resistance is another matter i fear not drinking how else can i numb my mind at night in order to watch basketball on television , literally the only time in my day when i feel almost neutral ? in my present state it is hard to stay on one task for any amount of time i try to read but find myself reading the same paragraph over and over i am blank the pressure will heat up again , however , after my brain begins to castigate me for all my failures and derelictions until a lump rises in my throat and the faucets come on again i did manage to throw out the christmas tree last night being just a local redwood sapling it was rather sparse , but it never shed a single needle while it was up i threw it out from the deck out back , and we stepson derek and daughter sarah put our hands on it to transfer the past year 's sins onto its innocent bark as a convenient scapegoat afterwords i launched it like a spear out into the woods where it will feed the nitrogen cycle i ran across a curious article today in which it was shown that men who cease religious activities are actually at lower risk for anxiety and depression , while women who cease religious activities are more likely to suffer from them they think it might have to do with different social networking styles i thought it funny in light of my discussion with friend eric about christianity and my depression religion is toxic for me in this state , something he has difficulty understanding wait that little possessive adjective my is part of my problem i want this to be your depression , too ! i should not hog all its glory for myself you , too , can help carry the burden so if any of you wish to undertake this , please write me and i 'll instruct you in the fine art of breakdowns chemistry aside , there are some ways to achieve depression without being born into the disease , but it takes a big commitment when you get as bad as i am now , the main survival tool is to accept your depression like a winter tree , think of yourself as dormant , not dead oh , you feel dead , you feel worse than dead it 's a living hell no one has described it better than jesus , who said of hell there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , except that he left out the anxiety part simply put , the emotion of despair includes sadness , fear and anger , the anger usually self directed in psychiatric terms this constitutes dysphoria what surprises me about this depression has been its gradations at times i can laugh , at other times not twice i had temporary responses to medications in the past when the worm turned it was sudden and for a long time i can remember distinctly noticing the beauty of a fern while hiking during another depression , and afterwards realizing that in that moment of aesthetic appreciation i had flipped out of my depression nothing had been beautiful up to that moment for the longest time suddenly i was well this is why i do n't get psychotherapy it just makes the disease worse , since the complaints i bring to the therapist are mainly biological in nature i wrote a poem about this once , below glass giraffe when my soul was sanded so raw the capillaries could n't even seep , i questioned the value of pain you must experience your feelings of abandonment until you are comfortable with them , you said when my suicidal doppelganger turned me inside out , pulling my anus through my mouth , you said , now that you are stripped of defenses you have a better chance of changing them when i called you up one weekend to say i was terrified of inanimate objects like doorknobs and tea kettles , you said , stay with it globalized fear indicates a necessary therapeutic regression finally the antidepressants kicked in and i felt like myself when i left you gave me another card since therapy was unfinished and i might be back on your couch or another s i gazed at your office figurines , crystal leopards and pewter trolls , porcelain ballerinas and kachina dolls , and imagined the souls of all your patients trapped inside them those , who like me , sought relief through words when only medicines would do i could have been the glass giraffe kilorats , ce
