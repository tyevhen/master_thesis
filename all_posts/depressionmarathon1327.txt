that title is deceiving brain drain but it sounded better than absolute , unmitigated , complete , whole body drain yup , been playing with my thesaurus again one frustrating consequence of this illness is that difficult situations , like the one i described on , often have lasting effects despite my mood going into these interactions , idiots talking down to me , making degrading assumptions about me , and taking advantage of their positions of power often knock me down for days that 's clearly happened this time despite being prepared for aloofness from mr jeff , rehab services pro , based purely on his aloof , almost annoyed tone on my voicemail , i still could n't handle his negativity now i'm a pretty tough , educated , stand up for myself person , yet this jerk had me reduced to frustrated , angry tears midway through our appointment ladies , do n't you hate it when that happens ? ! ! god , i hate that ! as the tears were surprisingly rising from within , my brain was screaming , no ! ! i cried afterward , too , hard at first i could n't understand why i was unable to stop crying but it soon made sense it makes even more sense today , days later i was humiliated prior to my appointment with mr jeff , i had put hours of thought , time and research into how to create a productive work life and get off disability this guy 's job is to assist people in this quest yet , he was condescending and purposefully unhelpful from the get go he was also literally stunned when i announced my intent to get off disability as part of my plan stunned oh , you want to get off disability , he asked ? at that point it was my turn to be stunned i thought that was the point ! this was moments before the tsunami of tears yes , i said emphatically this is not fun for me ! 'this' meaning living on disability despite my protestations , mr jeff remained dubious and continued bricking the walls in my path sadly , it was only after i began crying that mr jeff seemed to realize that i was n't just another statistic he softened and actually made an appointment for me to follow up with another agency but he thought i was crying because , as he said to me , i'm sorry if you do n't like what i have to say if i could have , i would have screamed through the tears i did n't care if he said no to my plan i cared that from his voicemail up to that moment he had clearly conveyed no , as in , i have no time for this i have no interest in this i have no belief in you , your illness , your story , or your needs and i have no desire to challenge my preconceived notions by listening to you that 's why i was crying , mr jeff i do n't mind being told no i mind being treated as if i am lazy , inferior , or at fault because of my diagnosis perhaps , mr jeff , you would feel more satisfied working with the innocent victims of real illnesses instead of making people like me the victims of your unprofessionalism
