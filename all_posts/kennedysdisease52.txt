and the use of social support systems to help you with that process the dictionary defines cope as to come to terms with living with kennedy 's disease or coping with kennedy 's disease means the same in my opinion i received an email a copy of it is shown below the other day from amy kaczmarek , a genetic counseling student at arcadia university she asked me to complete an online survey to help her better understand , the benefits of social support systems , and , how we cope with kennedy 's disease i am not one that likes surveys it seems that every week i am asked to take a survey , but i thought i would give it a shot to help amy out it did not take very long perhaps minutes i wrote amy afterwards and asked for a summary of her findings it might help me better understand how i can support others as they learn to live with kennedy 's disease it also might be an interesting topic for a future blog post for these reasons , i would encourage you to consider taking the survey it is totally confidential no personal information is asked regarding the survey questions , several of them were thought provoking even though the survey did not ask , i found myself asking where i am today in accepting and coping with kennedy 's disease as compared to ten , twenty , or thirty years ago my answers would have been substantially different twenty plus years ago they would have also been different before i joined the kennedy 's disease association kda in the mid s age the maturing process and the kda have both been instrumental in my growth acceptance and understanding of my condition knowing that i was not alone in this world there were others out there in the same boat was reassuring early on when i was first learning how to live with this condition the twice a month chat rooms with others that shared my dna defect were in many ways comforting i cannot really explain why that is , but for some reason it was important at the time attending chats where neurologists and researchers brought forward their message of hope was also critical to me in closing , i am including amy 's request for support in her genetics research project hi , my name is amy kaczmarek i am a genetic counseling student at arcadia university i am requesting that men with kennedy 's disease voluntarily participate in a research project i am investigating the use of various social support systems and ways of coping by men with kennedy 's disease as my master 's degree thesis project participation would involve completing an online survey that takes approximately twenty minutes participants must be age or over , have a diagnosis of kennedy 's disease , reside in the united states , and have internet access consent to participate in the survey will be done online prior to beginning the survey if you know of other men with kennedy 's disease who may be interested in participating in this research study , please feel free to forward my information and or the survey link to them if you need additional information please contact me akaczmarek arcadia edu mailto akaczmarek arcadia edu if i am unable to answer your questions , you may also contact my faculty advisor kathryn spitzer kim , m s , c g c spitzerk arcadia edu mailto spitzerk arcadia edu or phone below is the link to the survey http www surveymonkey com s aspx ? sm iyyrzdupedpjmyxcy bipa d d https camelot arcadia edu exchweb bin redir asp ? url http www surveymonkey com s aspx ? sm iyyrzdupedpjmyxcy bipa d d thank you for your time , amy kaczmarek
