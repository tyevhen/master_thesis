this is a bit of a follow up to my previous post , debating and discussing many people feel that , because of my age , mainly , my radical ideas will likely change after all , all anarchists are young , right ? ? snorts i find this view rather offensive , but i'm not going to go into it now many changes happen over time , and i ca n't know what i 'll look like or think like or who i 'll be in the future but i can know that some things are far more integral and essential to me , and have , since i was much younger , been essential to my being , and those things i think are far less likely to change than anything else i have a few unshakable values , things that can t be affected by others opinions , by arguments , by new findings things that aren t up for questioning in my mind , and that i don t think can be objectively proved things that are rooted firmly in the core of my being , and which without their existence , i would be an entirely different person one is the absolute belief that all life has inherent value , not just human life , and that the status of person does not belong solely to humans or even solely to other animals this is what everything else i believe in , support , and live is based on that the earth is alive , that all it s inhabitants are people , and that the earth should be respected and revered secondly , i believe humans to be capable of living as free beings and to deserve the right to live as such i do not believe that humans need to be controlled by others i believe each human has the inherent ability to lead their own lives and make their own decisions all my other opinions and views are just window dressings , really they have changed , will quite likely change , and are in a perpetual state of changing , as i think on things and talk to people and read new books and have new experiences all my other views are simply those that , with my current experience , most closely line up with my core values and those core values , well , i m pretty damn sure those are here to stay peace , idzie you might also like green anarchy a very little bit about animism unschooling and anarchy anti civilization , and what that means linkwithin
