you know the scene there were eye appointments after school i had to leave my internship early and i met the boys there that works out great as fish drove them there i walked in and teddy was being checked on one of those machines he saw me and said hi mom how was your day ? this is the same teddy who at home has been brutal as of late toward me in his words the optical lady said awwww that is so sweet i do n't think any of my kids have ever asked me that ? first of all i felt bad for her that her kids have never asked second , for my kids with rad kids it is the first words out of their mouths every day it is what i ask them and i think they honestly do n't know what else to say it has become habit here is where the story changes in the past i 'd feel a little twang inside as i thought about the way i am treated at home and yet i 'd smile and say thanks teddy would usually smile a sweet eddie haskal smile that said i am so sweet are n't i ? yesterday was different he looked at me and i saw sadness that said no i am not really too nice to mom when no one is looking that was important ! that was caring that was real emotion that was another baby step toward healing have a healing weekend !
