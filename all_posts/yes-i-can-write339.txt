on july th , exactly one year ago , i wrote the very first post on this blog so , to tie in with blogger 's challenge to tell them how blogging has changed your life in one way or another , that 's just what i'm going to do ! when i first started this blog , it was going to be a chronicle of my unschooling life , showing , daily , how i was learning as an unschooler this was as much to prove to myself that i was actually learning as it was to show anyone else what unschooling looked like ! no one , except for my mom , even read it and it was started at a time in my life when i was really uncertain that winter and spring before the beginning of this blog was really tough for me i was frequently depressed , and in the spring i lost a very close friendship that had meant a lot to me added onto that was the fact my father felt i was n't learning anything at all my mother was pretty sure i was learning , but was plagued nonetheless by doubts and worries , as is everyone at times , and i really was n't so sure i was learning , either i mean , unschooling is pretty out there learning in freedom , learning what you want and need , when you want and need it , learning through life for some reason , most people find the idea unthinkable so i was very unsure , very insecure , but determined to prove to myself , and the world , that unschooling can , and does , work in practice , and that i really was n't going to fail at life if i did n't go to school of course , seeing as unschooling really is learning , and as i read the teenage liberation handbook , mentioning that frequently in my early blog posts , i started to relax about unschooling a bit , and start realizing that by scrutinizing each day for whatever learning was gleaned from it , i was kind of missing the point so the posts stopped coming every single day , and started focusing less on the details of each day , and more on my thoughts and feelings also , in my earlier writings , i was just starting to research and learn about anarcho primitivism it was a fascinating journey for me , learning , thinking , discovering i had always been semi interested in , but disgusted by , politics , and no political party ever really felt right to me but as i learned about anarcho rimitivism , as i read a ton online , and a bit later read a ton by derrick jensen , it all just felt right to me scary , as it was the most radical philosophy i 'd ever discovered , but right on a fundamental level like deep down , i 'd already known and believed all of it , i 'd just needed someone to point it out to me , to point me in the right direction and the rest is history as i thought , discussed , and wrote on this blog , my opinions moved from strong interest and curiosity , to tentative agreement , to absolute agreement i had found my own worldview , the educational philosophy i knew was right , and even the vague direction i wanted to take in my life through it all , i blogged i worked things out in writing , expressed my thoughts , my insecurities , my opinions , my beliefs and gradually , i also developed a readership at the start of my blog , no one really read it but as i continued writing , a few people started following this blog , and as soon as i knew there were actually people reading it , i had a real incentive to keep writing ! so i did , and as my opinions solidified and my writing grew stronger , more people started following , until now , there are nearly people officially following this blog , with more , although i have no clue how many more , reading regularly , or following through a program that does n't show up in my little followers box ! and really , the value of all you people who visit my little corner of the internet can not be overrated if , as i tentatively started to write about ever more radical and unknown opinions people had reacted negatively , i'm not sure i would have continued but having the support of people online who actually agreed with what i had to say was wonderful ! knowing that , even if everyone i talked to in person , aside from my mom and sister , thought i was insane , at least there were people in other places who felt the same way i did , saw things from the same angle , or at the very least supported my right to hold those opinions that made , and makes , such a difference to me this past year has been one of great growth and change for me , and this blog has been there every step of the way , reflecting what 's been going on in my head and in my life it still seems slightly strange to me that people actually want to read what i write , and that many unschooling parents are more likely to say to my mom oh , you 're idzie 's mom ! than for things to be the other way around ! p i'm still growing and changing , as humans constantly do , and still feeling insecurities and worries everyone lately seems to be either very impressed with me , or very unimpressed seeing as i'm neither in school nor working , and to many people those both assign value to a person i'm not sure which i struggle with more ! i feel my life is n't very impressive i want to be able to tell people that i'm a member of a permaculture co op that teaches people how to grow their own food , or that i'm working with a center that helps teenagers liberate themselves from school , or something similarly impressive my life is a continuous process , and i want things to change in certain ways , but am not quite sure how to do so , and even more then that , i'm afraid to do so ! but as i continue to change , this blog will continue to reflect those changes it 's therapy for me , and support at times , simply writing things down and then letting my words loose in the world wide web for all to read so to sum up this very long post , i simply want to say happy birthday , i'm unschooled yes , i can write ! and thank you so much to everyone who has read , does read , or will soon start reading my blog i'm sorry if i sound soppy in this post , but i really do mean everything i say ! i love you guys , and you make all the difference to me ! peace , idzie you might also like unschooling and freedom debate reasons i'm glad i grew up unschooling continuing debate unschooling linkwithin
