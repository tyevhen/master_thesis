i'm just back from what very likely may be my last elliptigo ride of this year i hope not , but it 's that time of year here the cold weather swooped in , and we had our first taste of snow on friday it 's been cold and windy and gray since then , including today , but i just had to get outside for some good , old fashioned , lung searing exercise anyway so i did it was degrees , gray and windy when i set out dressed in multiple layers , including a hat , mittens and neck gaiter , i did okay , except for my toes should have thought more about my toes one layer of wool socks and airy running shoes just did n't do the trick after an hour and forty minutes , miles , i could n't feel my toes they were red and icy oops i recovered just fine , but if i do get to ride again , i 'll remember my toes that 's about the biggest drama i 've had recently , my icy toes , and i hope it stays that way i'm still feeling well i must look and sound well , too , as i keep getting unsolicited , excited comments from friends and acquaintances you look great ! you sound great ! you must be feeling well ! as i 've mentioned here in the past , i think i need a video of myself when i'm in the midst of a depression relapse clearly , there is a huge difference in how i present myself it would be interesting to see i have a fairly busy week ahead i 'll be working of the next days i 'll need to work hard to get my exercise in , get to at least one meeting , and maybe even socialize a bit busy is okay i just need to be hyper vigilant about keeping my life in balance , which is ultra important if i want to keep those unsolicited comments coming my way carry on , my friends
