i wonder if i got hit by a mack truck in my sleep it sure feels like it actually , it started yesterday my whole body aches and my muscles feel totally spent even my brain hurts ! i think wednesday was just a little too busy , and things really have n't let up since on wednesday , besides my regular two a day workouts , i also had golf lessons and a softball game worse yet , the softball game started at pm ! i'm usually sound asleep by then ! it did n't help matters that we lost our game something to one that was frustrating perhaps i need to find a more competitive team but i digress where was i ? oh yes , wednesday wednesday was a very long day yesterday was n't much better i did the start of care patient i wrote about in the previous post the whole process is supposed to take around hours it took me hours to finish it ! i spent two hours with the patient and four hours reviewing history and documenting i was so overwhelmed when i got back to the office i almost started crying when someone asked me how it went that startled me i know i'm frazzled if routine questions bring me to near tears i was tired and sore when i got home , and for the first time since january except in the case of illness i skipped a workout i was supposed to ride my bike for minutes , but i just could n't do it i figured i 'd better listen to my body , even though that was hard to do after all , i was n't happy with what my bod was saying i did get the strength workout done before work yesterday , so i did n't miss everything i contemplated adding the minutes onto today 's schedule , but it 's been a long , long day again , and i'm still tired and sore i dragged myself out of bed this morning , went to the pool , and swam yards that 's a long way when you 're tired i have to ride and run tomorrow , so it does n't make sense to add another bike ride into tonight 's schedule i'm trying to be okay with letting it go undone how am i doing so far ? i really hope my bones are n't so weary in the morning there 's much more going on , but i'm tired of looking at a computer i 've been using one all day , so i'm going to sign off for now i'm sorry for the brevity hopefully life will slow down soon then i can give you , and me , more time the man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win roger bannister
