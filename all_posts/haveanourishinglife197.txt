if you knew you wouldn t fail ? fear of failure holds us back from doing many things throughout the duration of our lives if the feeling of fear was not attached to failure , would our actions look different ? what would you do if you knew , for a fact , and believed it with your whole heart , that you wouldn t fail ? how would your life look ? take a few moments and look deep into your soul realize those things that you would love to do but are too afraid to make the first move write down a few things that come to mind are you doing these things already or are you too afraid to fulfill your desires ? this exercise will show you , whether or not , you are running your life , or fear is running your life my list below is what i would do if i knew , for certain , that i would succeed i would have a portrait business and sell hand drawn or hand painted portraits i would teach summer art classes out of my garage to kids of all ages i would paint murals for other people 's homes after reflecting a great deal on my fearless goals , as you can see , i came to the conclusion that i want art in my life this makes complete sense to me because i have always been an artist at heart i have loved every facet of the fine arts since i was very young i ve wanted to be an artist my whole life but because i am also a perfectionist , unfortunately , the fear of failure is holding me back from doing what i truly love to do i know when i made my first decision out of fear it happened when i decided to go to college to study math instead of going to a school to studying art i was afraid of being dependant on someone else i was afraid of not being able to support myself i was told that i would have a tumultuous future had i went into the art field so i choose the route of becoming a math teacher instead i barely lasted two years as a math major i am not blaming anyone else for my decisions i was young and na ve and that s okay everything that has happened in the past has made me who i am today i have few regrets but will i learn from my mistakes ? with the knowledge i have gained , i am going to try and take baby steps to move toward my goals this task will be extremely difficult i am in the terrible habit of letting fear rule my life it is going to take a long time to break that habit , so i must be patient with myself it may even take a lifetime , but it will be worth it what would you do if you knew you wouldn t fail ?
