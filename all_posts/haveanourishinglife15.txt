i 've been thinking a lot about sugar recently sweet biscuits ! you too ? ! i just went to the dentist da , da , da , duuuuum the ominous beethoven chords i have several cavities , all on the left side of my mouth the dentist said it was most likely from the gummy prenatal vitamins i took last year hmmm well , that 's a bummer sometimes you feel like you just can win , ya know ? you think you 're doing something right also , my older son has been having chronic diarrhea that comes and goes for , i do n't know , forever we recently figured out that it is likely from a fructose malabsorption issue meaning , it is not good for him to eat too many high fructose fruits or food with high fructose corn syrup we 're talking about blowing through boxes of diapers i 've never heard of someone not tolerating fruit before , but a low fructose diet is helping him tremendously it is most likely something he will grow out of , hopefully or , at least , he should be able to handle more fruits in the future weird , huh ? there are so many opinions about sugar so many say ! why do n't i add another ? ooooook some people think it 's a slow acting poison some people think sugar is addictive some people think that sugar tricks our brains into thinking we are n't full when we are i'm not going to scientifically study sugar and it 's effects so i guess i 'll never really know the answer to the ever popular question , is sugar bad or not ? there 's fructose , glucose , sucrose , lactose , and maybe more , i do n't know but if you were to say that all sugar is bad and you should not eat it , i'm not sure what else you 'd have left to eat ! so , i ca n't answer the blanket sweep of a question , but what i do think is that i can answer the question of is sugar bad for me ? for me not you not you not you either i can only answer the question of whether or not sugar is bad for me honestly , and maybe a priest can correct me here , sugar is not inherently evil in and of itself sugar is neither good nor bad , morally speaking it 's neutral ! yup , that 's right eating sugar does not make you a bad person go back and read that again you are not a bad person if you eat sugar ! there is no such thing as sinfully delicious chocolate , decadently indulgent cookies , wickedly naughty ice cream , or whatever all those things , chocolate , ice cream , cookies , or other sweets are morally neutral eating them does not make you a bad person similar to alcohol , also something that is neither morally good nor bad however , ahem , however , how one uses it determines the morality it 's about what you do with it personally , i cannot handle drinking alcohol it was a long road to get to where i am today , and i'm not about to throw it all away so i can have a glass a wine by the grace of god , i realize i am limited , and humbled , by the unfortunate fact that i do not know when enough is enough for whatever reason , and it 's not just because i have n't tried hard enough , i cannot moderately drink alcohol the best way to approach my situation is to end my relationship with alcohol completely no more drinking no more getting drunk no more addiction no more sin it 's so not that easy , i know i used to feel the same way about sugar , once upon a time like a decade ago or longer i do not feel the same way about sugar now i feel like i am capable of eating sugar in moderation i actually feel like i can eat anything in moderation again by the glorious grace of god ever since i found healing from my eating disorder , i am freed from any sugar binging episodes or temptations i am actually listening to my body and my hunger cues i actually pay attention to things that give me an upset stomach or headache i pay attention to food that i like and make me feel good i do n't like to drink pop because it makes me too bloated and gassy but i 'll still have one every now and then but i'm not like drinking it by the case just because i am over my eating disorder myth buster gazillion i love sea salted carmel truffles i get them every now and then and it makes me happy again , not eating them by the case treating my eating disorder inadvertently treated my sugar addiction i thought i was addicted to sugar i felt like i had absolutely no control when it came to eating and that is absolutely terrifying especially , because of , influenced by , etc , all those dang grocery store checkout aisle magazines we must control our bodies if not , we are likely to end up fat , loveless , jobless , joyless , and oh yeah , did i mention fat ? with alcohol , you can give it up and never go back , if you so choose but if you are struggling with an eating disorder , especially binge eating disorder , you ca n't really give up eating then it would be called anorexia which happens more often than you might think and you are still in a mess so , i think just my opinion it is very possible that some people think they are addicted to sugar or ca n't eat it in moderation , but , in reality , they are struggling with a binge eating disorder the withdraw symptoms of a sugar addiction do n't hold a candle to the withdraw symptoms of an alcohol or drug addiction talking about your past present reoccurring sugar addiction at a party is really pretty rude , considering someone else there probably is personally affected by drug abuse or alcoholism i will not down play a perceived sugar addiction the effects of an eating disorder are very awful it consumes your life it can cause depression and suicide so , yeah , misdiagnosing an eating disorder and calling it a sugar addiction is dangerous some people are lactose intolerant and it makes sense to give up dairy or take those cool little expensive pills my poor son wo n't be able to have too much fructose for a while , but he needs to so he can grow and not be in intestinal pain all the time some people ca n't drink sugary drinks like pop or gatorade because they want to protect their teeth from further decay but most of the time , these people are totally ok with it and do not battle themselves with their decision i think whether or not to eat sugar is personal question i do not think it should be banned in our country i do not think the government should get involved i do not think schools should brainwash children with lists of which foods are bad or good and i do not think that people should plaster their anti sugar agenda all over everywhere eating disorder treatment is the better option i think we could save more lives and give people better lives by facing the eating disorder epidemic in our country
