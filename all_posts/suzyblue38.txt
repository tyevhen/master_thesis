since i had some extra time this morning , i decided to spend a bit longer on my makeup and try something more fun this tuesday ! i rarely venture out and use colour on my eyes , i always always end up just doing different variations of browns , creams and golds , so using pinks and purples today was a big step ! i think it turned out pretty nicely , its fun , but still subtle enough to wear everyday , perhaps i 'll try being braver and add a splash more of colour to my makeup routine ! let me know what you think ? eyes mac in the gallery limited edition eyeshadow palette urban decay naked mac vanilla maybelline gel eyeliner rimmel eyebrow pencil lips maybelline babylips pink punch face ysl touche clat foundation collection lasting perfection concealer nars laguna bronzer nars orgasm blush related posts my evening skincare routine suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration
