i took mg of aripiprarzole last night with mg of quetiapine it took me a few hours to get off to sleep and i had dry eyes and itchy legs and could not lie still for a while i think i will take the next dose tomorrow morning as i do not need to go out tomorrow and if it is going to make me restless i guess it is better to take it while i want to be up and about instead of when i want to sleep i'm not giving up yet ! i only slept for just over hours and i stirred in the night o when i sleep so soundly on quetiapine i do not always feel rested as the night goes past in the blink of an eye i went out again last night with the local film club i enjoyed it very much and i am making lots of new friends ! i am out again tonight too but i have to do some laundry and house work first the following website for anyone who wants further details about aripiprazole or any other drug , this site is from the european medicines agency which regulates drugs in europe , similar to the fda in the us there is a summary for the public in languages as well as more in depth scientific information european medicines agency aripiprazole abilify
