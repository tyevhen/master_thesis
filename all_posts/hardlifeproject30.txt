well , i 've finally taken the plunge and gotten a blog which is ironic considering i'm a web developer by trade and have built blogs for other people , but never for myself i took the easy way out and went with blogger rather than setting up a custom wordpress site , which sounded too much like work i just want to write stuff , you know ? i 've been thinking seriously of getting a blog for the last several months the thing that finally pushed me over the edge was finding out that my friend sallymandy was writing a cool blog on a variety of interesting subjects i 've known sally for over years , but had no idea she was a blogger until a couple of months ago thanks facebook seeing her write from her heart finally made me feel like i have something to say too , although i do n't know what it is or how it 's going to come out i feel i have a lot to say about recovery , suffering , childhood , and family of origin issues , along with sexuality and emotional and spiritual growth sally , you were the impetus for all this , so thanks !
