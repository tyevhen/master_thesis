it 's sunday , and two weeks from today i will be sitting here recounting the details of the wonderful , hopefully , fast , hopefully , marathon i ran that morning two weeks from today is the twin cities marathon i ran miles at marathon pace yesterday , and i felt pretty good , especially considering i had a very busy week i spent my time running , especially when i was feeling good , visualizing marathon day hopefully , those visualizations will help when marathon day is actually upon me i'm really looking forward to this race i'm trying not to let the negative , worry thoughts slip in it 's a bit dangerous to get too excited about a marathon , as it 's such a long race , anything can happen but i feel like i 've trained really hard , and i 've definitely put in the work to set myself up for a good day that 's all i could do the outcome is yet unknown we 'll see what happens only two weeks to wait
