it 's been one week since i stepped out of the inpatient mental health unit after my most recent day stay it was the end of my fifth admission since september th , so far it does n't look like i 'll be going back anytime soon of course , as soon as i typed that sentence , my heart skipped a beat obviously recent history is not on my side , but so far i'm doing okay i 've been keeping busy with exercise , running , aa meetings , errands and chores i'm taking my meds and keeping all of my appointments i 've also continued to stay overnight with my friend wendy as needed , which has been most nights and like i said , so far it 's been enough i 've maintained my mood , my energy level has been okay , and my thoughts have not been distressing busy has been good for me in other news , it 's the holidays , which i know can be very difficult for many with mental illness i was a little worried myself , but i finalized some plans tonight so i 'll be around others for at least a part of christmas eve and christmas day i did n't want to be alone usually i'm okay being alone , but i did n't want to push my luck right now on top of christmas , i also had a birthday a few days ago , and my sobriety anniversary is between christmas and new year 's day it 's a busy time with a lot of loaded holidays for me , but i'm still going i think i'm still going because i'm endeavoring to take only one moment at a time i'm doing my best to take the next right action when i'm tired , i nap when i'm hungry , i eat , and i'm trying to eat well when i'm lonely , i search out someone with whom to connect and when my mood or emotions feel iffy , i talk to someone i'm trying to stay focused on the things i can control and not worry about everything else it 's been hard not to get frightened when i 've felt sad , for example , but by acknowledging the sadness and the fright , i 've been able to keep moving forward i hope you are all able to keep moving forward through these next few days , too i wish you all the peace , serenity , and happiness we each deserve during these holidays and into the new year merry christmas and happy new year , everyone !
