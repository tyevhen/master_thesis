i am going to explain what happens when someone snaps and kills specifically , regarding scott dekraai who killed eight people recently in seal beach california he says now , some three weeks later , that i know what i did so how is that possible to know what you are doing and still do it ? the catch is he didnt know what he was doing when he did it , only later is that possible to know one minute and not know the other minute ? absolutely let s talk about the crackup but before i do that let me offer a little reminder there are three levels of brain function the top level is the thinking , comprehending one externally oriented lower down is the feeling brain that adds emotion to the mix , and still deeper there is the instinctive reptile brain that processes the same instincts as the reptile it adds urgency and power to emotions and to beliefs all three have separate functions and yet are interrelated and they communicated with each other by chemical means and also by electrical frequencies and when something happens in the present it resonates with similar feelings from the past and they join forces when defenses are weak , something in the present can trigger off allied sensations and feelings and then we get a powerhouse response all three levels are involved in a conjoined reaction normally , there is a good defense apparatus so that the resonance does not reach too far deep down , thus limited the force of the reaction here is how resonance works in the domain of anger something in the present makes me very angry my wife is divorcing me and trying to keep the kids my money is running out and she still wants more she refuses to see or talk to me she turns the family against me i have been let go at my job due to injuries and i have no prospects for a new job all looks bleak and i have no alternative all these are assaults on my defenses and they weaken so much that it all crumbles and there is no barrier holding back deeper pain the problem is on the feeling level there are powerful emotions , but as it resonates still deeper anger turns to rage and fury human emotion because murderous feelings as the deepest animal level has access to the higher level that is , in my lingo , the third line gives way to the first line reptilian brain where killer feelings reside and for that moment the third line inhibitory brain is ousted by the first line instinctive brain and there is murder the deepest brain level becomes the highest one temporarily there is nothing left of the top level of the brain whose main function it is to inhibit but that can only last minutes once the rage is expressed the pain level diminishes and some of the third line thinking , reflective brain returns to function and scott can now say , i know what i did and he knows now but at the moment of crisis he did not know what he was doing his rage machine took over and he became the reptile spewing out fury indiscriminately after all , it is the top level that discriminates it was usurped for that moment , the critical moment when he murdered eight people i have seen this rage over and over again when very disturbed patients begin to relive on the emotional , feeling level and suddenly are impacted by the lower levels they begin to pound the mattress and the padded walls with an enormous fury that can go on for thirty minutes to one hour in therapy they can direct the rage , connect with it and not be overwhelmed by it not so , on the street i have filmed this rage , and those interested will see it when we release the film the patient seems to be out of control because he is in the grip of powerful deep forces but it is a controlled situation and is not acted out it is becomes acted out when the person has no idea that there are feelings deep in the unconscious , is helpless before them and has no idea about how to control them his unconscious has taken over and he kills and we can say of these people who are sometimes out of control that they may be pre psychotic all that really means is that their defenses against the deepest level of the brain are very weak due to the constant onslaught of pain early on in their life and what do so called anti psychotic pills do ? they dampen the lowest brain levels from responding they help hold back the first line they do this by souping up the top level so that it is more active and effective and at the same time there are inhibitory medications in it that block the lower level pain thus , we get a more active cortex and a less active brainstem and limbic feeling brain and in this medication there are chemicals that we should produce ourselves , such as serotonin but we don t because very early trauma has exhausted supplies , and we cannot make enough to blanket the pain so when our inner pharmacy cannot do the job we need help from the external one we can call it anti psychotic medicine but all it is doing is making up for what we can no longer manufacture ourselves poor scott had so many current assaults coupled with a lifetime of them that he could no longer inhibit nor defend his defense system was not up to the job now when it is far too late he probably has a somewhat weak defense system that can inhibit that won t do his victims any good the lesson we can take from this is that when deprivation and severe trauma exists while we are being carried , the first line defenses are already in a weakened state as a kid he may have had uncontrolled temper tantrums which evolved into murder was he responsible ? yes and no but we can go a long way to avoid murderous rage by making sure there is as little trauma as possible when we live in the womb no drinking and drug taking by the mother no fights with her husband no crazy diets while carrying it is easy for me to say i am only the messenger it is up to all of you to listen to the message
