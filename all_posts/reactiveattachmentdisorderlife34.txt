do n't forget your purpose was to drain the swamp my clinical assessment professor used this as an illustration last night and of course , my mind went straight to rad it is easy to get caught up in the lying , stealing , urination , food hoarding , etc while we cannot ignore those issues , they are not the main thing the main thing is lack of attachment so we need to really focus on empathy , gentle touch , loving words and looks , sweet foods fed from our hands we have to stop worrying so much about the alligators and drain that swamp ! ! ! ! i am talking to myself here friends ! i hope it encourages you as well
