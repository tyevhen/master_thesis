i received the following comment on the blog more verbal abuse friday , july , it is never acceptable to take verbal abuse some that is gets angered on occassion is normal , those who are doing it for control it is not just like any type of harrassment you ask them to stop speaking to you or whatever is less threatening the the abuser all that will happen by allowing this behavior is your self esteen will be destroyed the only thing you can control is your reactions to that person my response it is true that the only thing you can control is your reaction to another person , not the other person s behavior so it really is not possible to allow or not allow someone else s behavior the only thing you can allow or not allow is your own behavior except , of course , in the case of children you are raising that being said , a lot of emotional release goes on in a relationship that is not necessarily specifically directed at the other person it is not helpful to think of oneself as the target of someone s anger because then you get angry and upset there is no specific right thing to do in the case of another person acting out if you can keep from getting so emotionally involved yourself , you can better deal with what is happening if you can avoid taking it personally or otherwise putting your own intentions on what the other person is doing if you can say to yourself what can i do to take care of myself in this adverse situation then your behavior will be appropriate and less harm will be done to each other and the relationship just because you don t retaliate does not mean that you are taking verbal abuse you can ignore it , absent yourself from the scene gracefully and quickly , but asking the other person to stop speaking to you is trying to control their behavior it is an old clich but still a true one that the way to meet a behavior is with a behavior a b curtiss
