remember that cold i had last week ? well , it took a vicious turn for the worse on sunday , and yesterday i was officially diagnosed with pneumonia i 've had pneumonia before , so by monday , when i could barely walk from one end of my house to the other , i figured i had it again i 've been in bed for most of the past three days thank god there are lots of football games on right now ! at least i have something to look at when i'm not asleep ! being this ill is difficult i can take care of myself for the most part , but taking care of puck is more difficult poor puck until last night , he 'd been inside for days more than once he stood by my bed and stared at me , as if to say , why are you in bed again ? even when up , i did n't have the energy to play with him so i had to ask for help yesterday something i do n't care to do ! my friend shelli came over and walked him for me he was so excited ! after just minutes outside with her , he was content the rest of the evening i felt better , too being this ill is also tough on my mental health being inside alone is tough even though i tend toward the isolative , i typically do get out right now i'm staring at several more days of isolation i'm hoping to get out to an aa meeting by saturday and if the antibiotics work , i should have enough energy to go back to work next week unfortunately , i do n't know when i 'll feel up to exercising again with every passing moment , i feel my fitness going down the tubes all of my hard work over the past months will soon disappear i 'll have to start over at zero that really sucks i 'll have to fight the fuck its to get back out there as soon as i can otherwise this period of inactivity will last well beyond my illness that would only compound my frustration and make starting over even more difficult , so please root for me to get going as soon as possible ! well , that 's all i 've got for now it 's time to get back in bed typing is surprisingly exhausting ! have a great day , everyone !
