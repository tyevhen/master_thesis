the corinthian written by georgette heyer read by georgina sutton the ridiculously wealthy sir richard wyndham has just been bullied by his family into proposing to a cold hearted mercenary woman whom he does not love they day before his proposal , he goes on a drunken walk through the night time city , and a boy climbs out of a window into his arms but the boy turns out to be penelope creed , a young heiress who is likewise being pressured by her family to marry someone she does n't love penelope is about to set out on a journey , and wyndham feels obligated to escort her the corinthian is a fantastic adventure for both the characters and the reader this is only my second georgette heyer book , but it 'll probably end up to be my favorite the characters made lovably silly choices all the way through the book , with humorous outcomes the book remains light hearted while sticking to a believable story line i ca n't wait to read another heyer book in fact i almost went ahead and picked up another right away i 'll definitely read another within the next few months
