it 's been so long since i blogged readership has fallen off the cliff , as there is no continuing story , though i do get some hits from random net searches about certain subjects discussed here so how am i doing ? close to kilorats , or on a scale of to , i am hovering around i'm presently alone as my wife is in ny visiting her ailing mother i do n't know what to do with myself i try aa for positive brainwashing and then despair of any miracle sometimes i do treat myself with drink , which helps numb the pain temporarily i am psychotically depressed my fantasies of suicide are sometimes so intrusive i can think of little else i have no sense of self as i write this it 's as if my self has abandoned myself does this make any sense ? luckily my dog is with me i would trade places with him in a heartbeat oh to be an american pet ! what will become of what 's left of me ? saw my shrink today , he added another med to the new one i'm taking safris i have no hope or faith in meds strangely last saturday i had a brief respite from my state after rapping with two men after an aa meeting for two hours we discussed depression , essentially , and i became so involved in the discussion that it lifted me up and i was able to go home and do some things around the house , even wrote a poem and mastered dylan 's tangled up in blue the next morning , however , the transient return to myself slipped away and now i am worse off for having tasted that again , i fear i may be complicit in my own destruction for lack of willpower strange , when younger i had a great deal of it , but now i find myself regressed to an infantilized oral state , like a suckling infant , willing to put anything in my mouth for comfort i gluttonized yesterday on quesadillas and frozen meals to the point of pain just wanted to put something in my mouth to fill the emptiness , i suppose my daughters call out of concern , one nearly daily i chat with kathleen at night by computer she is deaf , you know i have n't written anything here in ages i do n't know what to do with or about myself in writing it appears i might exist when i stop typing it 's as if i do n't in a way i may be beyond suicidal it 's as if the soul has died within my body and i walk around like a zombie i have been pithed like a frog and no craigness remains that i can tell strangely i had a poem accepted for publication by qarrtsiluni which i must have submitted one day while feeling a mite better and did i mention my cervical stenosis acting up ? no longer is it just my pinkies going numb , all my fingers go numb and wake me if i sleep with my neck in the wrong position sometimes it is difficult to type this is indeed scary so forgetful i ca n't remember the books i read even movies i 've watched then it comes back to me somewhere in the re run that something is familiar and i stop or go on self pity ? i suppose i have some but not too much i do n't think i'm the only one with such a devastating depression , nor the last one , nor is my suffering completely unique , although it feels so other people in aa try to assure me that they 've been through what i'm going through but i do n't believe it , in general , at least not for two years like this and remember that the days in those years are interminable , so the whole thing seems an infinite nightmare i stay alive for my loved ones this much i do i do n't want to cause them pain but i can also see a point beyond that , where i do n't care anymore sometimes i fear i 've reached it then i remind myself i ca n't do that then the fantasies return with vengeance then i remind myself then they return a terrible cycle no exit would i rather be dead ? oh yes but a friend said to me , you ca n't be sure it would be any better on the other side now that 's a terrible thought to be as sick as i am now if my existence continued , that 's horrible i prefer to believe in some kind of redemption , some kind of heaven where i could be miraculously cured , resurrected from the dung heap of my own dark delusions i really have nothing to say i ought to be institutionalized but that 's not easy anymore except for the criminally insane hospitalization did n't help me last time as my shrink opines , the only reason for that is to protect me from myself but i have not attempted suicide despite my soul wrenching major depressions of six months or more everyone has suggestions , suggestions i lack the will to follow i need to go to some kind of regimented health farm where i might work in the fields or laundry or have my body regimented in some way until my mind returns sadly i know of no such thing there are only these day rehab units at great expense , focusing on addiction more than depression how i ramble on i sincerely hope no one reads this i feel incapable of anything think i 'll go have a cigarette i do n't enjoy and below , an attempt at a poem kilorats , craig erick this is my last poem before i die i set the font for this but it reverts to one i don t want i prefer palatino linotype isn t that pitiful ? i have a fillet knife i know to cut the radial artery lengthwise for a sure death i m a doctor , after all fuck you once i was a golden boy , the globe at my feet i knew the vibrations of hummingbirds and the secret enigma of snails i knew a lot why five line stanzas ? why me ? i go to aa for three days then drink drink makes me better , drink makes me worse my daughter pleads with me not to do it my wife says she ll come home early from new york i promise my daughter i tell my wife to stay and keep her itinerary this is confessional poetry at its worst , no more than journalling i have betrayed poetry this is not a poem you wide eyed innocents who have yet to pay charon for a boat ride you are but shades , shades , shades the gloom of your conviviality screams like a rodent in the night poor owl , he s not to blame nor is the night the night is always there to camouflage our pain did you know aphids are born pregnant ? we are all pregnant with abortions
