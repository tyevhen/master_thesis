because i spend several hours a week in front of the pc and my fingers do not always type what i meant for them to type , i have been looking at speech recognition software this finger control problem happens most often during the winter months , but it can happen at any time i am not a hunt n peck typist yes , i do occasionally sneak a peek , but most of the time i just type away without thinking about it one habit i have never broken , unfortunately , is that i correct on the fly in other words , i stop and correct mistakes that i see while typing occasionally , this habit causes me to lose my train of thought bummer ! i tried speech recognition software a few years ago i went the cheap route , however , and it did not work i kept on hearing about a software program that was quite good , but did not want to come up with the bucks to try it just in case it did not work i uninstalled the cheap program and forgot about it i heard that vista had a decent speech recognition program and that windows software is far superior i am not ready upgrade to windows yet because xp pro still works fine for me late last fall , i read this blog post about speech recognition software and watched the video i was once again interested i have gone back to the blogs a couple of times to read the comments posted some of these were quite interesting and helpful i am still concerned about my pronunciations and nasally voice i never thought i had one until i listened to myself on a recorder will the software recognize my speech peculiarities enough to make it worthwhile not have to spend hours editing ? i understand that training the software is important to make it more accurate if i could get to accuracy , it would be better than typing and could be a whole lot faster one of the points made in the video is that you need a high quality headset and sound pod to achieve the greatest accuracy when i add the price of these two items to the software 's price , i once again hesitated is that procrastination or just being cheap if it would work , it would be worth it i am just concerned that i would not like the results and would not use it have any of you had any experience with speech recognition software ? i would be interested in your thoughts
