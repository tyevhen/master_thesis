are we there yet ? how many times did i ask my folks that question on our trips to south dakota back in the s ? sitting quietly in the backseat of a hot car no air conditioning during the summer while on a six hour trip wasn t much fun for me when i was young now i know it must have been far worse for my parents somehow , we always made it there and i never died along the way no matter how hot it was or how frustrated my parents became patience has never been a virtue or a well honed skill of mine even though i am substantially better today , there are still times i catch myself saying , you ve got to be kidding me or come on ! when it comes to clinical trials and research updates , i am no better i can rationalize why research and trials take so long to accomplish , but it doesn t help this anxiety i feel sometimes at years old , i feel like i am running out of time i live with the hope that someday , sooner rather than later patience ? , those of us living with kennedy s disease will receive news that there is a treatment available a good friend , john coakley , who many of you know , is in a rehabilitation center recovering from a stroke by itself , a stroke is difficult to recover from when you have spinal bulbar muscular atrophy , the recovery process becomes an even greater challenge fortunately , john is strong willed and he has a positive attitude now , every time i find my patience is wearing a little thin , i redirect my attention to john and say a prayer for him
