the dictionary defines giving up as a verbal act of admitting defeat or the act of forsaking giving in , on the other hand , is defined as consenting reluctantly or yielding to an outside pressure , wish or opinion for a long time i viewed giving in to this disease as being defeated by it because i am a very competitive person , i will not give up on anything without a fight often this perspective on life resulted in me falling some of these falls resulted in me breaking a bone or causing some other injury when i look back over the last ten years , most of my injuries were preventable if i had accepted the possibility of an injury at the time , i would have acted more responsibly and possibly never have fallen ever since i broke the tibia and fibula , however , i have been far more accepting of the notion that it is better to error on the side of being safe yes , i am less mobile today , but , on the other hand , i have not had a fall or injury in over thirty two months my name is bruce and i am a recovering chronic faller acceptance for me has not come easy fortunately , my wife the smarter one in our family is a motivating factor in this evolving process her training method the carrot or the stick moving to a class wheelchair , using a lift chair , shower stool , and commode seat lift are four recent examples of me considering safety first i believe these are all moves in the right direction i have not given up i have just accepted more of my limitations with this acceptance , i am safer and happier acceptance does not help the frustration that i still feel as the disease progresses it just means smarter decisions are being made that make my life easier and removes some of the stress from my wife please feel free to comment by taking a moment to share your thoughts you add much to these articles the articles then become more than just something i said or believe in addition , by adding a comment , you might just be helping the next reader by sharing your opinion , experience , or a helpful tip you can comment by clicking on comments below or by sending me an email i look forward to hearing from you
