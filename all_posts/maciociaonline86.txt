the meaning of the name of the point sp gong sun is the subject of much discussion i have never been convinced by the translation of gong sun as grandfather grandson or rather grandchild besides being the luo point of the spleen , sp is also the master point of the chong mai although the translation of gong sun as grandfather grandchild is possible , i think there is at least another possible explanation gong may also mean general and sun may also mean second growth , i e the second growth of a plant after pruning later in the season like a rose for example thus , gong sun may be translated as general second growth what is this second growth ? in my opinion , it is the image of the smaller branches stemming from a central stem this is the image of the main channels the main stem and of the luo channels which branch out from the main channels this image is consistent with the point sp for two reasons first , because it is a luo point secondly because the chong mai controls all luo channels there is another connection between the second growth and this point 's name the term sun is also the term used in the nei jing to indicate the minute luo channels , i e the small luo channels that stem from the luo channels themselves thus , while the luo channels branch off from the main channels , the sun luo branch off from the luo channels themselves and they are smaller thus , gong sun may be translated as general sun channels this translation also makes sense because the chong mai controls all sun luo channels too sun finally , there is another possible and easy translation gong sun was also the family name of the yellow emperor and we can therefore interpret this point 's name as a reference to the yellow emperor this translation would also make sense because the chong mai is the emperor of the extraordinary vessels , because it is the centre of the energetic vortex created by them in old times , the extraordinary vessels were compared to members of a family and the chong mai was the father , i e the most important member in a traditional , confucian view of the family
