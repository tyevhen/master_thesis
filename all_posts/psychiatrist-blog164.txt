this one could n't go unnoticed if you 're a long time shrink rap reader , you know we enjoy emotional support animals ducks in particular so i must send you over to the new yorker to read pets allowed by patricia marx marx starts by letting us know how she likes her animals medium rare she talks about emotional support animals versus service animals and what about the rights of those without a disability , citing a plane that had to make an emergency landing on a cross country flight when an emotional support dog repeatedly relieved himself in the aisle and people were getting sick like a scare for ebola virus , this required a hazmat team so marx on a journalism endeavor that i would have loved to have done she goes around town new york city to be precise with different emotional support animals she starts at the frick collection with a turtle , and later in the day gets the critter a manicure in anticipation of its attendance at a bar mitzvah really , is that necessary ? i'm guessing the turtle did n't get to pick out the color marx then takes a snake around town let me quote here s what happened at the chanel boutique hello i m looking for a pocketbook that will match my snake , i said to a salesman maybe something in reptile i shuffled augustus from one hand to the other as though he were a slinky i m sorry , ma am , i have a thing against snakes , so let me get someone else to assist you , he said , as if he were telling the host at a dinner party , no dessert for me , thank you a colleague appeared wow , he said , leading me to a display case we do have snakeskin bags back here is he nice ? does he bite ? the salesman handed me a smart , yellow python bag marked , i think this would work the best it s one of our classics i think yellow red makes the snake look too dull marx proceeded to take a pound turkey named henry on a bus ride and out to lunch at a deli , then there was the very cute alpaca pictured above who accompanied her to cvs , and then on a train ride from hudson to niagra falls where they went to an art exhibit finally , marx flew to boston with a one year old pig named daphne , where they went to the four seasons for tea all i could think was that i want a job where i could be paid to drink tea with a pet pig and write about it
