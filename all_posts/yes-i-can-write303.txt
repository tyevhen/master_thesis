lately , it seems that many people have been surprised when i say i'm shy because i'm always very open honest , people seem to think that that somehow cannot go along with introversion ! and that assumption that i'm not shy , because of my openness , is not a good thing , since my shy behavior is then interpreted as me being aloof , distant , bored , or not liking the person in question , none of which are true ! because i 've recently discovered that multiple people have mis judged me in this way , i 've been thinking about it a lot it bothers me , since i'm a very social person in many ways , and really do love people in general , so i want to come across as friendly , not bored ! sometimes my natural shyness annoys the f k out of me i 've also been thinking of how my honesty openness relates to my shy side , and i 've realized that it 's kind of my attempt to balance things out since people ca n't usually figure me out simply be meeting or talking to me , and can often get the wrong impression of me , i'm very , very truthful when i talk or write about myself i explain why i am the way i am , why i behave in certain ways , how i really feel , in the hopes that i can be understood better by the way , having recently taken the myers briggs type indicator personality thingy thanks to michael for the link ! , and having come up with infj , i blame everything on my rather unusual personality type hope you guys do n't mind my mini rant explanation this rather pointless post p peace , idzie you might also like not back to school camp making transitions and following passions the year against the current talk from the toronto unschooling linkwithin
