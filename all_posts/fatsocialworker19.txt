hey ! all you fat friendly , size diversity supporting , amazing social workers ! get at me i want to create a collective i'm not sure what it 's going to look like yet , but i think it 's needed there are reasons i fell in love with social work its dedication to social justice , teaching about privilege , eradicating and confronting all the isms in the world that most people would rather sweep under the rug there 's just one ism social work has avoided sizeism fortunately , social work is a profession where i think the people in power are willing to listen but first , we need something to say and we need people to say it if you are interested in organizing with me , email me at fatsocialworker at gmail dot com why ca n't social work schools teach about size ? why ca n't we talk about health at every size as being the ethical way to approach working with all clients ? nasw has begun to speak on obesity issues they recognize the multifaceted nature of obesity why not recognize the ethical way of viewing obesity , the one that honors self determination ?
