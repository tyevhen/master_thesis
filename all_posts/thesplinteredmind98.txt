fast food originally uploaded by darkstream considering what i 've been through this summer something i hope to write about this week , and how hard i 've been pushing myself to finish a certain web project , i'm not really surprised that i was up the other night walking around trying to find something interesting to photograph i took this particular series of photographs right after i went out for a bike ride somehow the irony that the empty fast food patio meant i should be in bed , too , escaped me most people need a break when they work hard they 'll get up , stretch their back , and maybe go for a walk to change the scenery i'm no different than any one of them it 's just that my walks are at am that 's probably not a good walking about the town time it 's probably even worse to race along at that time on a bike i do n't worry about those things , though , when i get bored in the middle of the night it 's one of the few adhd impulses i do n't bother suppressing the night is so quiet that my mind feels clear from the lack of commotion i do some of my best thinking then but worry not the break worked i survived and came back refreshed to work some more soon the web project will be finished and i 'll right my sleep schedule then i wo n't have an excuse to be up so late anymore what adhd impulses do you encourage that you probably should n't ? you might also like in which douglas experiences adhd 's up and down sides splintered books project update spitting in the eye of morpheus distracted ! how adhd almost kicked my novel 's butt linkwithin
