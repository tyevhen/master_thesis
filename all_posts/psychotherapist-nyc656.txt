one of the most difficult and heart breaking situations for a couple to deal with is infidelity relationships coping with infidelity deciding whether to stay or leave the relationship after you discover that your partner has been unfaithful is a hard decision to make it 's a very individual decision for some people , finding out about a partner 's infidelity , no matter what the reasons or circumstances , is beyond what they can ever tolerate or accept there is no question in their minds that they are leaving but for others , although they are very hurt , they decide to try to work it out after the initial shock , they might feel that they 've invested too much in the relationship to end it it might surprise you that many couples are able to reconcile after infidelity and that their relationships are actually stronger as a result this is not an endorsement for staying or leaving it 's simply an observation see my article relationships should you stay or should you go ? what are the various types of infidelity ? infidelity can involve a one time sexual encounter with someone outside the relationship it can be a longstanding affair it can also be a series of encounters with many different people this is often , although not always , the case with people who have a sexual addiction it can be encounters in person or encounters online in chat rooms or on various internet and social media sites infidelity is not always sexual sometimes infidelity involves getting one 's primary emotional needs met by someone else or it can be both when the affair is strictly emotional , it can be more difficult to resolve sometimes because your partner might not see it as infidelity however , if it 's taking away from the primary relationship , it 's a problem both men and women cheat on their spouses and partners infidelity occurs in heterosexual and gay relationships see my article sexual addiction on social media infidelity on social media sites why do people cheat ? the reasons that people give for cheating are numerous and complex often , the reason that people give is that they 're unhappy in their relationship they might feel that their partner is not paying enough attention to them , and they do n't know how to express it without acting out they might be angry and use infidelity to retaliate against the partner for other people , they might have grown up in a household where infidelity was tolerated , so it 's become commonplace in their minds in other instances , people have a hard time making a commitment to one person , so they use another relationship to defuse the intensity of the primary relationship in other instances , people do n't know how to end their primary relationship so they enter into another relationship unconsciously hoping that they 'll be found out and this will end the relationship there can be so many other reasons what are the factors that contribute to a couple surviving infidelity one important factor is the quality of the relationship and how stable it was before the infidelity all other things being equal , the more stable it was , the more likely it is that the problem can be worked out if both people are willing to work it out it is essential that the partner who is cheating end the other relationship before anything can be worked out in the primary relationship one of the most important factors is whether trust can be regained sometimes , even when both people are willing to work out the relationship , it does n't work out because the partner who was cheated on just cannot learn to trust the cheating partner again without trust , most relationships do n't survive what to do ? what should you do if you find out your partner has been cheating ? no one can tell you what to do well meaning friends and relatives might try to give you advise , whether to stay or go , but it 's your decision anyway , this is between you and your partner and it 's not for others to decide in most cases , it 's better not to make any immediate decisions while you 're still in shock you need time and space to carefully consider your options if infidelity has been an ongoing problem with your partner throughout your relationship , you might feel differently than if there was one encounter much will depend on whether you feel you can trust your partner again regaining trust if you and your partner decide to try to work it out , know that it will probably take a while for some people , months or years to regain trust , if it can be regained at all you must insist that your partner give up the other relationships if your partner wo n't agree to this , he or she is not ready to honor the commitment to your relationship and you must face this see my article regaining trust after the affair what if you both decide to try to salvage your relationship , but you 're having problems getting past the hurt and anger ?
