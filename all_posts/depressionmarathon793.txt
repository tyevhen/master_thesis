i do n't know about you , but sometimes being busy helps me distract from my current mood woes i guess i'm getting better because i had enough energy to be busy at work today my co worker is on vacation this week , so i 've got double the patient load whew i was worried about how things would go , as my energy has been severely lacking , but i was able to put it together today i saw all my patients , got all my paperwork done , and finished in a reasonable time i ended up in bed when i got home even though i really wanted to stay up and slept for hours but i guess i needed that i think i'm doing a little better again today i'm less overwhelmed , frustrated , and irritable obviously my energy is a bit better , and i'm functioning more efficiently , too my dishes are actually washed ! i hope this trend continues the darkness was so , so dark this time here 's hoping for more light inaction breeds doubt and fear action breeds confidence and courage if you want to conquer fear , do not sit home and think about it go out and get busy dale carnegie
