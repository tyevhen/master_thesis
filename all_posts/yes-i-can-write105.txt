virtually every time unschooling is covered in the media such as the newest segment on msnbc 's today show people , either in the segment itself or in the comments , refer to unschooling as an educational method where kids teach themselves and that 's always struck me as being way off the mark unschooling is n't about unschoolers teaching themselves it 's about unschoolers choosing how and what and with whom they want to learn the world is big , and we 're constantly learning sometimes the learning happens when you 're alone , sometimes with just one other person , sometimes in a large group these are just a few ways that unschoolers can and do find knowledge and learning the internet and books here is a way that could be considered teaching yourself looking up things you 're interested in on the net , reading books on the subject yet even that is n't necessarily an all by yourself thing sometimes someone will read something out loud to me that they think i might be interested in i regularly share article links and in turn have people send me links i interact with people and learn from them on the internet quite often i visit the library or a second hand bookstore with family and friends , and we share the interesting books we find classes and lessons i know , shocking , is n't it ? but unschoolers do actually take classes sometimes ! my sister takes ninjitsu and has music lessons i 've gone to various classes in the past many unschoolers do , because sometimes , they 're just the best or easiest , most interesting or fun way to learn something new , improve a skill you already have , or just enjoy learning along with a bunch of other people ! workshops i could have included workshops with classes , i suppose , but i wanted to put this separately because i feel like most of the time , workshops have a different feel from classes they 're more horizontal , rooted in the community , have less of a here is an expert teaching us stuff and more of a here is a member of the community sharing knowledge feel in case you could n't guess , workshops are one of my favourite ways to learn with others , share knowledge , have great discussions , and meet new people mentors my sister 's ninjitsu instructor and drum teacher are both most definitely mentors they 're people she 's friends with , people she respects , and people she learns a lot from and as in all healthy relationships , no matter the type , i imagine they learn from her , as well mentors can be found through formal things like classes , as well as informally , through your community or extended social network but no matter how you find them , people who are passionate and knowledgeable about something be they accredited teachers or not , and are happy to share that knowledge and experience with others , can be a really wonderful way to learn talking to people everyone has skills and knowledge and things to share if you simply talk to people friends , family , acquaintances , strangers you learn a lot about a lot of different things the whole damn world i think that when people are first learning about unschooling , it can be helpful to point out specific ways to find knowledge and gain skills , but when it really comes down to it , learning is everywhere whether walking in the woods , reading a book on architecture , going to spanish class , talking to a friend , or contemplating clouds , learning is happening and i think that 's one of the biggest paradigm shifts people make as they move towards unschooling seeing that learning happens everywhere , all the time , not just between certain times in the day , or when engaging in certain activities occasionally really , it does n't happen often , i 've heard people say that they think that children are fine growing up with only their family unit around them that all that kids need is a stable , loving family , and i definitely disagree with that while i think family is can be extremely important , humans are social animals , and i believe having a wider community is also extremely important and i also want to acknowledge that for some people children and adults who do not have any family , or whose family is not loving or supportive , people from their community are the most important people in their life so i think that by looking at unschooling as something done by a child , alone , that 's really inaccurate , and misses out on what i think can be one of the best things about unschooling the fact you 're living in the actual world , interacting with lots of different people , learning and discovering within your family , and within your community so , sometimes unschoolers learn on their own sometimes they do n't some unschoolers spend more time learning with others , some unschoolers spend more time learning alone but overall ? unschooling definitely is n't about only ever teaching yourself ! you might also like favorite unschooling posts on this blog of blame unschooling ! misconceptions about unschooling the cons of unschooling linkwithin
