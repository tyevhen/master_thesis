an alert reader passed along a job advertisement that blew my mind it 's a fairly standard job description for a faculty position in psychology at brigham young university at the end of the ad is the equal opportunity statement , which reads as follows brigham young university is an equal opportunity employer sponsored by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and requires observance of church standards preference is given to members of the sponsoring church so does this mean that whether you are a white mormon or a black mormon , you have equal opportunity , but if you 're not mormon , you 're screwed ? this does not sound very equal opportunity to me am i missing something ?
