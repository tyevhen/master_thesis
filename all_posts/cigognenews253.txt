let s go over this again so we can make sure that reliving is important in the therapy for all kinds of neuroses neurosis means that there is an early traumatic input that alters function and behavior not one or the other but both that is , there is pain and denial of need that overwhelms normal functioning and causes a diversion we are no longer normal things go wrong neurologically , biochemically and behaviorally and of course to cure we need to normalize the whole system , not just behavior or biochemistry that in a tiny nutshell is the story of neurosis we are no longer ourselves we are re routed in function to get back to ourselves we have to re establish function in every aspect not just behavior and when we are diverted and rerouted , there are marks that leave their traces epigenetic marks for example , if we are loved and hugged and touched a lot there are changes in the brain where methylation patterns are changed the function of the gene is changed and how we then behave is diverted the brain has borrowed part of the methyl group and produced alterations in how genes are expressed or repressed shut down or opened up and this changes us in profound ways our personality becomes different we can be more open or closed off more depressed or anxious depending on what genes do what but it is not genetic it is epigenetic , how life impacts us how experienced changes us it is not just in the genes it is in experience don t go looking at the genes alone it is not there they are the result of experience now those marks or traces are embedded and can follow us throughout life they form the substrate on how further experience impacts us so with lots of love we have a different system than a deficit amount of love and a different brain and a different focus and attention span all this right after birth and it can spell a chronically aggressive or passive baby and child the difference between a heavily allergic child who spends her life in emergency rooms , and a normal child above all , it sets the stage for a child who does well in school and another who fails you mean all this from events in life before birth ? exactly love means altering those immune cells and making them stronger no love means the opposite ok so now we have those marks , methylation which foretells of a life to come and how it will be lived how do we change all that ? we need to revisit those early experiences , those without words , go back and redo them change history and their traces we need to undo the damage and that means slowly demethylizing one experience at a time or one experience over many times we need to find how the system was detoured and put it back on track , literally this happened because pain installed itself and forced change a mother who was on coffee or who was constantly on tranquilizers changes the baby s system he cannot slow down because the anxious carrying mother has caused a more speedy system in her offspring and this can be measured the amount of methylation can be observed and changed that is meaningful progress it informs us about altering neuroses and when allergies disappear we have supporting data and when sexual deviation goes away we have even more key data and above all , when the telomeres lengthen and we live longer that is critical information neurosis , in short , is a global affair , not just one behavior or one symptom but isn t this what medicine today is about ? lowering blood pressure , giving allergy medication restructuring behavior it is called whack a mole every time a symptom shows up just whack it back and don t ask where it all came from ? it is obviously a brain disease experience takes a back seat as we slither down into the depths and minutia of the brain seeking answers that do not exist there and never will but we are the dealers in experience because we have seen what experience does to us , especially very early pre verbal experience if one sees one primal one knows for all time how crucial experience is in the scheme of things it is rarely a brain disease that is concocted by those who fiddle around in neurons and synapses and do not see the brain reacting to experience if we leave out experience we are bereft of what can give us answers we see only the end result and miss half of the puzzle it is like looking at diabetics and never know what they eat if we leave out the first three years in an orphanage can you wonder that we can never know what the matter is thinking it is a brain disease is the result of another more serious disease solipsism
