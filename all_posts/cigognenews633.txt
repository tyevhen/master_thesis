when will the madness stop ? above all , the madness in the name of science and medicine in the n y times today nov is a story about places like harvard , of all things , doing surgery for obsessive disorders , depression and other psychological maladies here is what they do in cases of obsessive rituals and thoughts which have been intractable to psychotherapy , they have decided to cut out those pesky afflictions with brain surgery , cutting out pieces of the emotional brain to ease the problem this surgery , they warn , is only for those obdurate psychological problems that do not respond to any sort of psychotherapy it involves drilling four holes in the brain and inserting wires deep down from there the procedures differ but in one key surgery , cingulotomy , they pinpoint the anterior cingulate for partial destruction the rationale they want to destroy some of the brain tissue that forwards emotional messages to the thinking brain , the prefrontal cortex from the feeling areas such as the cingulate the claim is that this area is overly active in cases such as obsession in inputting emotional messages to the thinking , intellectual centers there are variations to this theme but in nearly all cases the attempt is to suppress emotional pain from its apprehension higher up the claim is that standard therapy cannot touch the problems such as deep depression this is brain surgery , remember the result , according to the surgeons , is about sixty percent satisfactory , although we do not know the long term consequences of brain surgery there is one follow up study which indicated that these patients seem apathetic and lose some self control for years afterward it is no wonder since we have cut out the person s passion but what if we could do exactly what the surgery does ? what if we could avoid a very serious surgery ? i believe we can because primal is the only therapy to be able to go deep in the brain purely by psychological means because other conventional therapies do not have this possibility in their theories or in their therapy , they think that the only other solution is surgery and of course deep depression sometimes is being helped by this surgery deep depression means just that origins deep in the brain so again , a therapy that probes the depths , the antipodes of conscious awareness should work as well or better than to have one s brain cut into i have not kept our therapy a secret but it is up to those who do this surgery to investigate what is out there before burning out brain tissue what is sad is that this kind of way out procedure can have positive stories on it in the new york times and many other respected journals , while a far out psychotherapy such as ours , cannot get a line printed in any newspapers it is not safe but here is a surgery that is decidedly dangerous and obtains cache in our country so someone who compulsively washes her hands needs brain surgery ? this , it seems , is recommended because , i think , the pain imprinted down low was too much for the usual tranquilizers so , ergo , we cut out the relay mechanism that sends terrible emotions to the understanding cortex so , no relay , no pain and no symptoms if anything about this procedure is enlightening is that we see how compulsions and obsessive develop out of pain surging up from lower brain centers , and how ordinarily , the gating system keeps symptoms from showing the pain is still doing its damage , however only we are no longer aware of it certainly , the surgeons did not cut out the origin , the emotional imprint , they cut out the circuit that forwards the message to our awareness that imprint is all over the brain and body so a piece is cut out and the imprint is still there doing its continual damage it will certainly find other outlets what we will do then ? cut out more ? the imprint is the conductor it won t help to kill the violinist in this highly respected scientific atmosphere the most outrageous modes of therapy are taking place
