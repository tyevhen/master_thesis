photo by thiru murugan one of my favorite positive affirmations that i remind myself of daily is there s no need to push yourself you can take as small a step forward as you choose when i first started using positive affirmations , i liked this one because it calmed me down , and made me feel safe at the time i started using it , i was aggressively trying to gain weight by taking weight gaining supplements , counting my calories , and force feeding myself when i wasn t hungry i wrote a post called , my healthy my happy where i decided that i was putting too much pressure on myself which was causing more anxiety that s when i posted a picture of a footprint in the sand on my cubicle wall right next to my monitor at work that represented the positive affirmation above it s something that no one else would know its meaning except for me , and i can remind myself often that i don t have to push myself the underlying fear of trusting this affirmation is that i would never make any progress i do want to gain weight , but i also want to be as anxiety free as possible so i decided to work first on my anxiety and then when i get to a better place i could refocus on my weight around this same time , i was around pounds that was after i had gained almost lbs i went on vacation to hawaii where i had major panic attacks daily because i was off of my medication because i didn t wait long enough for it to work before i decided it was useless , bad decision and i didn t have enough clonozepam with me because i thought i would be fine another painful but important lesson i learned when i got home from vacation i was down to around lbs i had lost all my progress of weight that i had gained it was a horrible setback for me i felt like i would never recover and i would never be able to gain the weight back that was back in april i am pleased to say that i now weigh again and i haven t been trying to gain weight at all i have been really good at listening to my body , eating when i am hungry , and stopping when i am full it s very cool because before it was really hard work to gain the weight this time i haven t focused on it at all , rather i have been focusing on my anxiety instead so i wanted to let others know that positive affirmations really do work they don t hold you back from progress , but they can help you achieve success for more information on positive affirmations , you should check out some of my other posts on the topic i hope everyone has a panic free thanksgiving tomorrow thanks for all of your support and well wishes if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like the weight of the matter positive affirmation flip book theres no need to push myself my healthy , my happy linkwithin
