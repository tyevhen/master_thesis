well , my local office of american homepatient came through for me it 's a little complicated , but the end result is that i no longer have an outstanding bill from them , and i get to keep my c pap machine i have to thank carol at my local office for her compassion and hard work to say i'm relieved is an understatement yet it is a cautious relief , as i have reason not to totally trust this fix as long as i am doing business with ahp , i think i will be wary i do n't like that but i think i should stick with my local office after they worked so hard on my behalf this whole situation was quite a test of my sanity i ca n't stand these out of my control situations so this was good albeit painful , anxiety laden , sanity busting , practice for me one of the lessons of living , which i learned in aa , is taking action after clearing my head here , i used my last post to craft an intelligent , succinct letter to ahp , which i delivered to my local office monday morning that gave me a sense of control i did n't have previous to taking the action another life lesson via aa is accepting things i cannot change it took me several days , and taking the action of writing certainly helped , but i was coming to some acceptance i had gotten to the point where i had done what i could do i knew things might not come out as i wished , but i also knew there was nothing more on which i should waste my energy the only sanity saving thing to do was accept the bill and work out a payment plan i would n't have liked that , but acceptance does not require agreement strangely , acceptance , even without agreement , also gave me back some control the last life lesson on which i relied was treating others as i would like to be treated myself so even though i was mad as hell and felt totally justified in my rage , i made sure i kept my tone even and my language clean in each of my dealings with ahp personnel i had to remember that my local office was doing the best they could with the situation again , whether i liked what they were doing or not , or whether it was on my time schedule or not ! that was n't always easy , but i did my best in the end , i felt my behavior was appropriate , and i can hold my head high i'm really hoping i do n't have to deal with this again i'm really praying god does n't have any more practice for me in the near future this was incredibly stressful i 'd like to put it behind me for good
