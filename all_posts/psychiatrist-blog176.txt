one of the concerns i have about funneling our resources into programs for involuntary treatment is that i believe it 's difficult for those who want help to get it some assume that those who do n't recognize their need for help are society 's sickest patients , and that resources should go to them first so i want to hear your stories of looking for a psychiatrist so let me ask you , how hard is to find a psychiatrist here in the united states ? if you found one easily say a morning 's worth of phone calls and appointment within a reasonable time just say easy and please tell me what part of the country you live in and if you live in an urban suburban rural area if you had a longer story , i 'd love to hear that as well , with the same demographics thanks so much !
