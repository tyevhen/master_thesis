ask me to stand in front of a room full of people and tell my story of living with depression , and i can comfortably go into great detail i 've done it bunches of times ask me to speak about alcoholism , however , and i'm scared to death tonight , consider me scared to death i 've been asked to speak to my large home aa group in three weeks i may spend the next three weeks in a mild panic you see , my story is quite boring i drank to numb my depression thankfully , in my short history of problem drinking , i drank alone fortunately , i did n't do anything outrageous , commit any crimes , or end up in the gutter those things happen , and they make for good comeback stories when people get sober i guess i have a comeback story , but there just is n't a lot to it there 's not a lot to say i drank to numb depression soon , i got to a point where i could n't stop drinking it was my comfort , my courage , my connection , and most importantly my medication i drank alone and watched re runs i drank alone and painted my living room i drank alone and watched sports i drank alone and ran the next morning it was pathetic , really but there 's not much more to it than that so i'm scared to death the prospect of standing in front of a large room full of people i admire and respect to tell such a boring tale well , let the panic begin
