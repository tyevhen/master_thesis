back when i was still editor of the melic review i frowned on prose poems and relegated them to flash fiction the thing below started off as a poem but fell more naturally into prose , i thought it approaches the density of a poem without incurring a poem 's difficulties comments welcome this is fresh off the griddle , btw , always a mistake to expose so early , or so i tell students sensing trees a redwood s autumn is not as dramatic as that of a deciduous if you prefer color to sound which brings to mind the old question of whether it s better to be deaf or blind blind is the answer a wise man gave me does that mean communication is more vital than safety ? the redwoods ply the edge of an expanding continent like an icebreaker when wind strikes their spent fronds fall like missiles pelleting the roof , each a lost church whose needles are pews dead fronds lace my deck like fish skeletons gone rust , rigid millipedes whose legs are needles though acidic and hard to mulch , the needles are members in good standing and never desert the frond remember the blind vs deaf question ? would you rather hear or see the redwoods ? easy one what about your mother ? rodent neutral , ce
