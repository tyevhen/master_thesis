let me reiterate the feeling is experienced the rape victim invariably creates the same bound hands together during a primal , her father held her hands as he took her from behind , and she now sees what it made her do she was hostile to men and became a lesbian this is from an actual case that we have filmed she only felt safe with women these are the insights that tumble out after a feeling if she cannot have the insights , then perhaps there was not yet a connected feeling perhaps more was dredged up that has yet to be felt and connected in other words , if there are no insights we are bereft of understanding the act outs it is as if to say there were no consequences from a disastrous feeling and as i noted elsewhere , the earlier and feeling the greater the chance of a serious affliction later on the valence or force of the imprint never lessens the left side just covers it up better so we see here how the obsession with the gas jet and the turn to lesbianism may have the same roots it is behavior in an unconscious attempt to control a past harmful and traumatic feeling so in a way , neurosis is the current way we control the past the only problem is that in the present it remains out of context it was appropriate to be afraid of father in the past but not normal now to be afraid of authority figures it is logical but not normal so why are there attention deficits ? because the right which is charged with sustained attention is so loaded with pain that it off loads some of its burden to the left now all kinds of inputs are coming in to disturb concentration and focus the right cannot do its job remember that the very early trauma is lodged in the right and takes up space there , and above all , it constantly agitates because pain is driving it incessantly it needs to connect with the left , and the neo cortex but the gates stop it connection means the end of it as an agitating force it means rest and relaxation it means integration no longer alien feelings but those who have found a home so long as they are alien the system treats it as a foreign force and considers it as an invading stranger when the feelings come too close to conscious awareness the system goes into alarm mode the white cells treat the feeling as alien and dangerous and the blood pressure and heart rate mount the happens to almost every patient when they come close to deeply lodged feelings the left sounds the alarm when feelings come close and the system goes into alarm panic mode mobilizes to keep it all away , while gating swings into action it stimulates evasive action , avoiding anything that will evoke feelings those who had a harridan for a mother will avoid aggressive women in their lives most of us avoid whatever might set off alien feelings and so in a way we are programmed those who had a tyrannical father may become obsequious in the face of male authority in order to stave off anger the latent fear is already so high that the person cannot take any more we can tell ourselves the right self , not to be afraid but it is a weak force against a lifetime of terror in the same way we can tell our selves not to eat chocolate when the imprint of starvation in the womb hidden on the right is importuning the left is no match for the imprints on the right they are always packing more power than the left , as they should it is our emotional self so we have an emotional self , an intellectual self and finally , a real self united it is that real self that can control things such as overeating or premature ejaculation why overeating ? because there is a history underlying it he is eating out of his history he is not only hungry now but back then starving in the womb he is trying to get fulfilled back then , as well the same as trying to get love now to make up for no love as a child fulfillment is sine qua non it cannot be forgotten so one is always looking for fulfillment in one way or the other it is the left that takes need from the right and tries to find ways to get fulfillment , and it is always symbolic because the left side is basically the symbolic side it wants more and more money because he cannot feel any fulfillment the left brain sees the steak and the right brain rushes in with its history of starvation or deprivation to make the person eat for both times that is over eating the intellectual self has no emotional wallop by itself that is why it is so weak in the face of powerful feelings so there is sexual stimulation with the resulting premature ejaculation because the early pain is so heavy and the controlling left brain so weak
