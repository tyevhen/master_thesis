there 's an article on the front page of the new york times today titled mental health issues put , on new york 's no gun list anemone harticollis was able to get data that i was unable to obtain when i wrote about this for clinical psychiatry news last november it does n't sound like she got that information easily harticollis writes the way the law has played out , local officials said , frontline mental health workers feel compelled to routinely report mentally ill patients brought to an emergency room by the police or ambulances county health officials are then supposed to vet each case before it is sent to albany but so many names are funneled to county health authorities through the system about per week statewide that they have become , in effect , clerical workers , rubber stamping the decisions , they said from when the reporting requirement took effect on march , until oct , , reports have been made on people who have been flagged as potentially dangerous among these , , all but a few hundred cases were passed to albany by county officials , according to the data obtained by the times she further notes despite the breadth of the law , significant loopholes remain outside of new york city , permits are not required to buy long guns , so nothing would stop someone in the database from buying a shotgun , for example , after being released from a hospital also , it is unclear exactly how the process for confiscating someone s guns is enforced and law enforcement officials may not even be aware of all of the guns someone owns of the , people who 've been reported to the database , only had gun permits i'm going to point out a few things while the database does not prevent the ownership of long guns , it also does nothing to address the gun ownership and access in family and friends none of this relates to illegal guns we do n't have data to confirm if taking these guns or preventing certain people from purchasing guns has resulted in lower homicide or suicide rates
