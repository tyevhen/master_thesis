hi everyone not a lot is happening with me thanks once again for the kind words that you send me i'm just dropping in to share a website that was emailed to me rather than give you my take i 'll be lazy and just paste the email i work for a website called counselling directory www counselling directory org uk which is an online web directory listing counsellors and psychotherapists all over the uk each counsellor has a profile stating what areas they specialise in , a bit about their background , and their qualifications all the counsellors registered with us will have a relevant qualification and insurance cover or proof of registration with a professional body , so we are assured of their professionalism the site also has a wealth of information about various types of mental health illness , as well as a blog about the latest health news the search facility on the site means you simply type in your postcode or town and the site produces a list of all the counsellors in that area , allowing the individual to browse through them and select and contact one that would be exactly suited to their needs the site is free to use we developed the website when a friend was going through a difficult time , and did n't know where to find help close by the site has been running for four years now , and we 're always looking to try and get our name seen by as many people as possible , as we know from feedback that we provide a valuable and much needed service we 've recently been featured in an article on the times website , we have a high google ranking , and have had lots of positive feedback from site users and counsellors alike
