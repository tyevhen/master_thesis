i have been sitting on this for over a week now , i knew that i needed to write this , not only to keep friends , family , and other followers in the loop , but also to process all that has been going on for my own sake in a year of many changes for the boys , these past months have led to quite possibly the biggest and most traumatic change for our family in a long time my husband and i have been to multiple iep meetings again this fall , and through many discussions between us , with educators , therapists , administrators , and advocates and we finally came to a decision jack is moving to a new school in january , another mainstream elementary school , where they can better accommodate him i have had soooo many people ask why this can t be done at his home school , where he has been since kindergarten there is no easy answer there is no real answer jack has had significant special education services in school since about midway through kindergarten but to be honest , it has never been enough he was diagnosed with asperger s at age at that point he was provided with minimal special education services in his regular preschool he probably should have gone to the same early childhood intervention program that nathan went to it probably would have benefitted him greatly but , for lack of a better explanation , he could talk his way around it he sounds and really is so smart when he opens his mouth , he knows so many facts he has always been able to talk well since he was mos when they have autism , adhd , and anxiety , the ability to speak is such a blessing for a child as it relates to being able to communicate what they need , and such an obstacle when trying to get this child what he deserves this is coming from a mom who has one child with speech and one who struggles tremendously with verbal communication speech almost automatically lumps a child into the category of high functioning and sometimes that just isn t the case ! do i think jack is high functioning ? maybe i honestly don t know what i think at this point , and i don t know which behaviors are autism , which are adhd , etc the comingling diagnoses complicate the situation all the more what i do know is that this little boy has had significant challenges since birth , with self regulation particularly there was never any self soothing , or entertaining himself , constant attention has always been required and as exhausting as that is for us as his parents and for his educators as well , i can only imagine how exhausting it must be for him he went through public pre k , with again , minimal special education services he arrived in kindergarten with an hour of special education services a week a titch of ot no speech it makes me shudder even now to think about how much more he deserved and required back then we hired an advocate to come with us to his kindergarten iep meeting , and he ended up with an aide full time , including the walk to and from the bus , and lunch , recess etc he needed that much guidance , which to me and his father was a duh kind of moment but it took a lot of fighting to get these initial services for him we have slowly added speech services for actual conversation , more pull out services , and assistive technology to his iep before school work became multi step and required more attention , he could compensate for his challenges to a certain extent we are way past that point and for the past years we have watched him struggle , particularly with math here is a hint of how smart he is though through all of his attention issues , his obsessions with other things , obstacles in other areas he has been able to maintain grade level performance in reading and spelling i would estimate that he is able to maintain probably of the amount of attention that the other kids have this makes me proud , and it makes me sad , because i can only begin to imagine what he could do if we could get his full attention for a little more of his day that being said , we have tried adhd medications he has had significant issues with all of them he is in therapy for his anxiety , aba for his behavior and focus , and we have tried a multitude of other medications for anxiety , etc we can t seem to get him there add in a school that is highly ranked academically and known in special education circles as not being friendly to kids with special needs , and it s a recipe for disaster now i need to say one thing the actual special educators who have worked with jack at least since first grade ? they are nothing short of amazing people , amazing teachers people who will go above and beyond to give your kid what they need , even when they are not allotted the time and resources to do so we have not felt the support of the administration when it comes to keeping our son at his home school i know of multiple kids in other local schools with more involved iep s who remain in their home schools despite the fact that there is no dedicated pull out classroom available to them children who are fully out of the classroom for language arts and math , who are not potty trained and remain in their home schools yet , we are told that because jack requires pull out for math and language arts and require is a strong word in language arts , let s just say he makes the majority of his progress in this setting his school cannot accommodate him because they do not have full pull out capability when i was first told this , i wanted to fight , i wanted to scream and tell them my son deserved to stay because he does then i thought about jack really thought about what he needed his behavior has been worsening at home , he fights homework even more than he used to , his anxiety across all settings is much worse all of these things are symptoms of a larger problem i know he feels the pressure of not being able to keep up , of not being fully accepted as he is i know that because he is unusually self aware , he knows he is not the same as the other kids in school and it is bothering him a lot there were two choices for us as his parents we could fight , go to mediation , force the school to comply , keep jack there , and watch him continue with the same struggles because let s face it , no matter how hard these teachers work to give him what he needs , their other responsibilities will not be lightened or we could change something we choose to change something we chose to send him to a school with a formal pull out classroom , partly for this feature to be honest , there were several other deciding factors the school is much smaller , the faculty has the reputation of being special needs friendly and that is the real reason we agreed parenting is hard other parents may have come to a different decision but we have come to understand that fighting the good fight is not always what is best for our son while we want him to have what he deserves aka to be able to stay in his home school , we also have enough perspective to grasp that maybe he deserves even more than that we have seen what a school that functions with a greater degree of acceptance can accomplish just by watching nate this past year in his autism classroom and to be clear it goes both ways not only is nate greeted with more acceptance by the faculty and staff , but the other kids in the school are taught to accept children with differences at a much different level than where jack has been going to school the atmosphere is completely transformed i have known this was coming for a long time a loooong time we have two neighbors who have children with special needs when i told them years ago that i was sending jack to our home school , the response i received was ominous at best good luck ouch both of these other children ended up in different placements the parents wanted them out of the home school by the time they went and now i get it please keep our sweet boy in your thoughts this is such an enormous transition for him and our whole family and from his perspective it has all happened so quickly we didn t tell him about it until a definite plan was in place , and unfortunately that was just a week ago , and then his last day at his current school was last wednesday yes , the day before christmas eve , i know after christmas break he goes to his new school he will miss his friends , his teachers , and the aides who spent countless hours with him every single day i know he will form new bonds , i just wish he didn t have to
