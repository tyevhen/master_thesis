happy halloween everyone ! please do n't dress up as a psychiatric patient , it 's not funny , and depicting people with illnesses in harsh ways is harsh and insensitive , promoting stigma and fear in addition to halloween and yes there will be candy at my house tonight tomorrow , november st , is the official publication date of our new book , committed the battle over involuntary psychiatric care the printer got a little excited and released the books to amazon and maybe some libraries a bit early , but our hard working publicist , gene taft , at the johns hopkins university press has been trying to keep things under wrap and he 's done a fine job as the publication date has approached , there have been some reviews , and i 'd like to list them in one place dr damon tweedy wrote a wonderful review in last sunday 's washington post the heated battle over when to commit a patient involuntarily to psychiatric care dr rebeccah twersky kengmana wrote another terrific review in clinical psychiatry news called committed takes a non patronizing approach to involuntary care blogger kazen in japan writes for always doing because thinking about reading is n't enough i do hope you 'll read the always doing review because it really captured what i wanted the reader to get from the book feel free to also purchase the book and one of our colleagues , whom i believe wishes to remain nameless , wrote the nicest review on a facebook page , so i'm stealing it hear , namelessly i just finished this book , written by two people i am proud to call friends and colleagues , and one which highlights and tells the story of many of my other friends and colleagues , on all sides of the issue that the book covers it is a marvel of balance and completeness , and of shared ideas and vigorous debate regarding differences in opinion in a world that seems to be becoming increasingly polarized , this book is an object lesson in how to discuss contentious issues while still getting along none of us has a monopoly on the truth because in the area of involuntary treatment , there is no single , unitary truth i recall struggling as a psychiatry resident with issues of autonomy versus my rudimentary ideas about what would be best for a patient i recall losing sleep for patients i let go , and also , differently , and over a much , much longer term , for patients i may have wrongly retained this book forces the reader to confront issues related to self direction , to the adverse impact of mental illness on decision making , to the battles being fought over where the line is that should legally permit the involuntary treatment of a person who does not want it buy it , and read it you will learn much , and perhaps , just perhaps , get a sense of where the other side is coming from updating on a wonderful review on pete earley 's blog while books of this nature often are text book boring , committed is not one reviewer credited the care and consideration that went into the book for its readability i 'll add more as reviews come in , and on thursday i'm going to write a bit about the process that went into writing this book in a post for the johns hopkins university press blog , which i 'll post over here as well before i even do that , i do need to thank so many of our readers , both here and at clinical psychiatry news , who first made us aware of what a troublesome and complicated issue forced care is , and who opened themselves us to telling us their stories and sharing such painful parts of their lives with us you know who you are , and thank you so much if you were an integral part to the book , a copy was sent to you with the pre release batch weeks ago so if you 're interested , amazon is happy to sell a good quality , hard copy of of our book , representing many years of work by two psychiatrists for the low price of , or on kindle more soon , i'm just sharing my excitement more fun than thinking about anthony weiner 's laptop and the upcoming election
