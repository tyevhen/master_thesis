i want to talk about some specific words and usage issues that cause trouble for a great many native speakers of english who should know better call these pet peeves , if you must i do n't like to think of them as pets , though savage beasts all ironic means that the outcome of something had a distinct quality of unexpectedness to it but i like to think it means something more to me it implies that there are or were two possible outcomes or interpretations of something , one that 's expected but turns out to be wrong , and one that 's not expected but actually true contrast this with the word paradoxical , which to me implies two outcomes that seem to be at odds with one another yet are both demonstrably true use paradoxical when there are two true yet seemingly incompatible outcomes ironic is less concrete a word and not as widely understood as paradoxical poignant means keenly distressing to the senses and or arousing deep and often somber emotions it does n't mean bittersweet it can be an outcome of a bittersweet situation , but by itself it does not mean bittersweet decimate means to reduce by one tenth never use it to mean destroy completely decimation was in roman times the practice of killing one out of every ten mutineers or sometimes one in ten prisoners of war , as a means of demoralizing the nine out of ten survivors the preferred meaning of decimate remains reduction by ten percent you can use it to mean reduce significantly , but never use it to mean total eradication irregardless is always incorrect use regardless unless you want to appear careless or stupid do n't say which when you mean that example the subject which interests me most is philosophy use that , not which , in such a sentence there 's a difference between the crane that was the cause of the accident was demolished and the crane , which was the cause of the accident , was demolished which should be reserved for clauses set off by commas for god 's sake learn the difference between it 's a contraction and its possessive the reason people get this mixed up is that the rule for making something possessive , in english , is to add apostrophe s to the end of whatever it is so it 's natural to think that if you add apostrophe s to it , you get a possessive form not true , though the possessive form of it is its learn to use nor as the negative form of or in particular , do n't use or in connection with neither do n't do using ai n't is neither correct or necessary the word neither here demands that you use nor try not to use almost always or almost never it 's semantically akin to saying almost infinite the words always , never , and infinite are absolute and binary something is infinite , or it 's not something either occurs always , or it does n't almost and always are two different concepts do n't say infer when you mean imply bemused has nothing whatsoever to do with amusement read that again it has everything to do with bewilderment or befuddlement peruse means to read carefully , not to skim lightly or read haphazardly who versus whom my advice ? do n't worry about whom versus who unless you 're writing for an audience that cares about such things it 's not always better to use whom properly using it properly can mark you as a self righteous pedant ! it all depends on the audience my rule is to always use who unless you 're convinced the reader will object to its improper use and you might have noticed , i do n't much care about splitting infinives most readers wo n't care you 're writing for most readers , by the way and not your high school english teacher , are n't you ? and finally literally refers to something that actually happened or is happening in reality it represents the concrete reality of something , not anything metaphoric there 's nothing speculative nor merely descriptive about a thing that 's literal he literally went insane means the person actually became clinically schizophrenic per dsm iv tr , he literally went ballistic means the person had enough momentum to follow a ballastic trajectory through space he literally melted down means the person became hot enough to exceed the melting point of his constituent materials do n't say literally unless you really mean it
