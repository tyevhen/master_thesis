my doctor and i decided that it was time to start tapering off of my prescription anti depressant drugs in the beginning , i thought i would have to take the pills forever but in most cases , people struggling with depression only have to take the meds for a year or two click here to read my myth busting post about anti depressants since i began taking the anti depressants , i have stopped a lot of bad habits and developed good habits healthy coping skills to deal with my anxiety and depression i am ready to see if i can stay that way without the drugs i am still going to monitor my symptoms and take care of myself by going to counseling , eating nourishing foods , exercising to enhance my life , and other self help practices i don t want to make the same mistakes and end up in the hospital again my new treatment plan includes eat regular meals eat nourishing foods that i like and that make me feel good moderate exercise days a week for minutes if i can frequent activities and hobbies that i enjoy and things that give me a sense of purpose try to get eight hours of sleep a night limited caffeine limited stressful activities and commitments absolutely no alcohol these changes are not major for me i am already doing everything i listed above , and i have been for some time now all those things are ways that i take better care of myself from experience , i know that those things help me feel better and keep the depression symptoms from coming back the only major change coming up is that i am not popping the little green and off white pill at eight o clock every morning any more without the medication , i don t think that i could have made all those healthy changes but now it is time to see if i can still take care of myself while i am off the drugs should i not be able to function without the drugs and my symptoms return , then i will have to get back on the meds and that is ok i am going to rely on the things i have learned , my husband , my support system , and my counselor to help me monitor my progress and determine whether or not i am on the right path if my symptoms return , then i will cross that bridge when it s time how i was taking care of myself several years ago eating sporadically or only when i had to meaning to keep myself from passing out eating low calorie , fat free foods only excessive work outs for hours a day abuse of diuretics long hours at a high stress job sacrificing sleep so i could exercise before work cups of coffee a day i don t want to go back to the way i was should any of these bad habits return , i am going to see my doctor again i know that those unhealthy habits will only lead me to depression , despair , and suicidal tendencies all things considered , i am optimistic i think everything will turn out fine i know that i am the same person now and i ll be the same person when i am off the meds however , i am also not na ve it is not all of a sudden going to be hearts , stars , and butterflies i know that there will still be times of stress , suffering , and bad days and that is ok so , if you notice my writing starting to take a downhill plunge , don t be afraid to speak up just kidding most likely , if i start to relapse , i will stop writing altogether when i came home from the hospital last summer , i was advised to put together some information for easy access because i always go above and beyond , i created a pamphlet that anyone in the tri county area could use for a format click here to take a look i advise anyone struggling with depression and anxiety to make a similar document feel free to copy my format , if you like i had mine taped to our refrigerator for months now it is taped to the inside of the desk cupboard forever there if i need it i hope this is helpful information i don t want anyone to have to go through what i went through but unfortunately or fortunately , it does take hitting rock bottom before a change can occur remember , god can bring a greater good out of every bad situation he will never abandon you no matter how alone you feel
