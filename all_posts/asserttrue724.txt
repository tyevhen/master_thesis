back in april , you may recall , i ran a quick performance test on the home pages of various wcm and ecm software vendors using the popular yslow tool i blogged the results and compiled the test data into a page pdf a comparison of home page loadability scores for major wcm and ecm vendors that can be downloaded free here i checked the download page 's stats today and was surprised to find that the report has been seen by visitors since i posted it on april i do n't know how many downloads it has had , but it does n't really matter since the download page has a pdf viewer built in , and you can just peruse the document online for such an obscure , technical , narrowly conceived document , i think views is pretty remarkable i had expected about views corresponding to the number of vendors tested what will be interesting is to run the same battery of tests again in a month or two , to see who has tried to restructure their pages to improve their yslow rankings note to self run yslow on all the big wcm ecm vendor web sites again soon and this time , add a few more vendors
