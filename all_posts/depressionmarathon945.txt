it 's hard to believe it is the end of september already i 've been so focused on training , i 've hardly noticed the start of fall that is until today when the temperature dropped into the 's with a brisk wind ! i ran a brisk workout of x meters with meter recovery it went well actually , i felt fairly comfortable , which is always nice during a speed workout puck ran my warm up and cool down with me , and we both enjoyed a long nap after we got home i'm looking forward to this weekend it is twin cities marathon weekend and many friends are running i hope they have better weather this year than we did last year since i'm scheduled to run miles , i 'd love to run it along the marathon course , but i do n't think i can figure out the logistics of getting back to my car once i finish it 's so much easier to do the long runs with company oh well , it will be fun and motivating to watch all of the local runners cross the finish line i'm feeling a little off today think i may be coming down with something my stomach is n't quite right , and i'm a little achey hence the extra long nap my knee was sore during the slow sections of my run today , but oddly felt fine during the speed work i think it is slowly getting better , but i do n't think i 'll be playing much more golf this year my mood has seemed a bit lower , too , but that may be the result of worrying about my knee i hope so nevertheless , i 'll be paying close attention to how i'm feeling over the next few days here 's to everything getting back on the right path
