we 're getting ready for the release of our new book , committed the battle over involuntary psychiatric care on november , great reading for after the election , if i do say so myself and i found this to be very relevant my friend , blogger buddy , and mental health advocate pete earley went to india recently for a few days that sounds tiring but pete is full of energy and so what 's not to like about a few days on the other side of the world ? he 's been blogging about mental health in india , and the first of his part series is called patient rights is a new concept in india , i learned pete talks first about how little psychiatric care there is in india , psychiatrists for billion people it 's an unthinkably low number , and there are roughly the same number of total beds there as the public system has in our country what a disaster and patient rights ? unheard of it 's a different culture , one in which patients do n't question doctors , but also one in which the mentally ill are chained , abused , or left to starve on the streets ah , tragically we do that part here , too pete was the keynote speaker at a conference on rights of homeless persons with mental health issues in his post , pete talks about his own experiences with his son and involuntary care and his belief that this is a band aid , not a solution , and that it helps to come to view the world of the patient through his eyes for a longer term solution so it wo n't surprise you if i mention that pete wrote the foreword for our book his few pages are an amazing piece of writing , and they draw you in and round out the book because he really does a wonderful job of capturing the desperation of a family member watching helplessly as his beloved son became so desperately ill i wanted to tell you share our excitement over the upcoming release of committed , and i also wanted to send you over to pete earley 's blog to read his stories about india and of course patients should have rights , what kind of nonsense is my title ?
