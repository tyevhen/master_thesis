today , unusually for him , our dog scout scooted out the front door while i was n't looking and went for a long romp before i whistled him home he did n't come quite home he was cowering in the driveway , knowing he 'd been bad he 'd been out playing with other dogs , so i assume , and would n't come right to me i had to pick him up and then enforce solitary confinement in the bathroom for a spell he knew he was guilty ! but he is not troubled by it animals do n't feel guilt , they only know certain behaviors issue in certain outcomes lacking self consciousness , they are in no danger of becoming presbyterians guilt why i ca n't attend church in a depressed state one only hears of one 's shortcomings , not the grace of god just as in reading the bible , all the condemnatory verses echo in your head and none of the saving verses obtain for me religion was all or nothing either we attained the ideal of christ or we failed lukewarm rehearsals and socialization in a religious pattern i could never accept at face value , the role of religion in general society i wanted new testament purity , something i sought early on in my faith , attending any number of sects striving for the same thing alas , these sects were built on personality cults and forms of brainwashing to attain a false purity , but they helped fill in an identity for me anything 's better than a vacuum including a broom for sweeping linoleum see ? i refuse to lose my sense of humor i'm a refusenik also a beat up on myselfnik my therapist keeps me in the woodshed with cbt cognitive behavioral therapy , telling me not to wallow in depression but climb out through positive thinking she 's never been depressed as i have , but she makes a good point if one ca n't control one 's feelings , the best approach is to control one 's thoughts , however difficult nevertheless and i have polled those bipolars close to me about this , for the sufferer it seems the feelings always precede the thoughts , one reason for medication working when talk wo n't but my medications are barely doing the job , despite my shrink 's best efforts and the huge expense did you know that the new atypical antipsychotic , abilify , costs for thirty tablets in the usa ? i order tablets from canada for for a net savings of about but the drug companies want to outlaw even this loophole greedy sobs and obamacare , dispensing with the cherry picking of insuring only those without preconditions , wo n't be on board until , and i'm sure the insurance companies will raise everyone 's premiums to compensate trying to get private insurance for my mate has been a nightmare , especially in my condition i finally settled on something called cia ! i had to cancel two other policies that i 'd patched together to resemble something like major medical insurance for her and over the phone , all the companies badmouthed each other beware of patriot health care for one they 're useless and nbla wo n't refund your joining fee and premium for one month when you try to cancel , both entities send you to salesmen who try to talk you out of it , and in my condition it was hard to stand firm against their wiles , but i did predators capitalism is predatory , but at least it offers choices i have a choice to go camping with my daughter and a friend tomorrow down in santa cruz and i think i shall try to do it , although the first image in my mind were the high cliffs of highway where i could conveniently drive off i wo n't fall for it , but recall in annie hall where woody allen is being driven to the airport by christopher walken , who says sometimes i get the uncontrollable urge to cross the middle line and head on another car however neurotically , woody clings to life , so the look on his face was priceless they made it to the airport but i'm acquainted with such fantasies when i drive , though god knows i would n't act on it , since it would harm others why a cliff is more inviting but i wo n't do it my daughter wants me around to walk her down the aisle some day , and there are others who want me to stick around my therapist encourages me to stop all like thinking so i will at this moment yesterday was n't a bad day i did four loads of wash , did a large amount of grocery shopping , washed the car and cooked dinner today i look back in amazement two steps forward and three steps back whoops ? three steps forward and clunk , down the basement stairs one step forward and vapor lock one step backwards and off the dock tickety tock , tickety tock there 's a crack in the engine block quaker state will sludge your engine , avoid it pennzoil rules ! or castrol castrolization gomer pyle saying shazzam ! i dream of jeanie heironymo 's mad againe when then ile fit you these fragments i have shored against my ruins shantih shantih shantih over and out of it , ce
