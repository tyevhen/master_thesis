the reivers , by william faulkner narrated by john h mayer in this pulitzer prize winning novel , year old lucas priest is talked into stealing his grandpa 's car by his family friend boon hogganbeck one of the priest family retainers manages to sneak into the car and comes along for the ride the trio make their way to memphis , where boon has a girl he 'd like to court along the way , they lose the car , gain a racehorse , and generally get in trouble this is supposed to be one of faulkner 's more light hearted and easy to read books , and i agree with that assessment despite its serious topic , it has a subtle humor throughout the plot tends to be pretty loose and easy to follow the characters are strong and endearing overall , i found the book quite enjoyable and am pleased that i chose this faulkner book to read , rather that one of his heavier books i do want to read his heavier books , but sometimes it 's nice just to read something light hearted by one of the best american authors
