i 've been having a tough time writing lately i do n't feel i have anything interesting or valuable to say right now i'm just feeling a bit blah training again after my dnf did not finish at the twin cities marathon i'm tentatively planning to run another marathon november nd , but not feeling nearly as confident of meeting my goal , which is qualifying for the boston marathon i did have a good miler on saturday , but still i'm hoping i can improve my confidence over the next few weeks , otherwise i am doomed i think not finishing has effected me more than i thought it was going to i'm having a dnf hangover i wrote the above paragraph a few nights ago , but i never got around to posting it i guess that fact only reinforces what i wrote there are some big changes going on in my life right now nothing i am prepared to write about yet , but suffice it to say the impending changes are likely draining my energy stores i'm also worried about the pain in my right leg i 've got some pretty severe shin splints going on trying to decide if i can baby it along , yet maintain enough fitness to run a quality marathon in weeks , or if i should take a break now , let it heal hopefully , and shoot for a marathon in december it 's a tough decision if i stop training , i fear losing the fitness i have built up over the past few months that 's an awful lot of work for nothing ! however , continuing to run through the pain has consequences , too the pain forces me to alter my stride and hinders my running efficiency , which means more energy expenditure and a slower pace as a result , i may not be able to run a qualifying pace for miles typical worries of the long distance runner now that i 've written down all of those worry thoughts , i guess it 's no surprise that i 've been really wiped out for the past couple days after working just four hours today , i collapsed in bed for two hours i had a ten miler on my running schedule yesterday , but i was unable to do it secondary to fatigue and leg pain so i rested yesterday and moved the ten miler to today i was n't hopeful about accomplishing the distance today either after collecting myself from bed this afternoon , i set out during mile one , i stopped or times to readjust my shin wrap and contemplated quitting in the second mile , i was certain i would turn around any minute with the leg pain and fatigue , my body felt totally discombobulated ! i was n't sure what was going on down there ! whose legs were those flailing about ? at mile , i was able to let puck off leash i always enjoy watching him romp around he 's so damn happy ! before i knew it , i had settled into a comfortable pace , and it was fast ! even though i was still having some pain with each step , my body at least felt like my own i was able to maintain my pace for the rest of the run by the time i got home , i felt great i chuckled as i entered my house this sport is a constant surprise in the span of miles , i went from lethargy , pain , and frustration to energy , less pain , and freedom getting those miles done makes me feel a lot better about hitting the pool , rather than the road , tomorrow hmmm it appears i 've made a decision , for today anyway , to continue training
