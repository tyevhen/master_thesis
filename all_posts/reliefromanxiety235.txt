it has been one year to this day that i had my first ever panic attack not something to celebrate , but rather a time of reflection since that day , i have had a rollercoaster of events there have been many improvements in this year in regards to anxiety , but there have also been things i 've needed to work on this time last year , i had no clue that i was going to travel down the path that i am now on little did i know that my anxiety was going to get worse and that i would have to start from the very beginning however , if i look at january when i had my breakdown and could n't leave the house to now , it shows an improvement i am gradually getting on public transport , gradually improving my attendance at school , i can leave the house , talk on the phone , ask for things more often , buy things and i'm gradually ending my second break from driving lessons and are soon going to pick them up again i 've also completed my as levels and managed to overcome a german speaking exam and first aid course along the way ! these are only some of my achievements this year , i hope to continue to improve recovery is a very hard journey you can be very confident one minute and not the next however , i'm working really hard towards full recovery i know it is gcse results day today and i hope that you all got what you deserved and wanted remember grades are n't everything and 'work hard , play hard !
