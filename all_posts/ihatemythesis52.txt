the highlight of my day my roommate 's girlfriend is from a foreign country she brought some exotic sheep cheese from her homeland i tried a slice it was a little weird now there is a strange taste left in my mouth that is the best thing that has happened to me all day am i depressed ? or is my thesis depressing me ? i think i am depressed this whole delay in graduation is really bringing me down i could barely gather the energy to type in the tags for this post it just seemed like too much effort , but in the end i pulled through and even created a new tag if only i could do the same for my thesis
