hvar is by far the most breathtaking place i have ever had the pleasure of visiting , and was well worth the car , plane , bus and boat journeys it took to get there ! the island itself is an idyllic sleepy town , with restaurants and bars overlooking the harbour , which is filled with everything from small fishing boats to large lavish yachts when you explore the island further , you are met with beautiful beaches complete with crystal clear , aqua blue water this place truly is europe 's hidden gem , an oasis of calm and serenity juxtaposed with it 's lively , yet high class nightlife following a fatiguing day of traveling , girls hauled massive suitcases off a boat and down a rickety ramp , marking the beginning of what was set to be a remarkable week of sun , sea and memories that will last a life time most days were spent relaxing by our villa 's pool or down at the beach , whilst enjoying delicious home cooked thanks to lauren and megan lunches and dinners out on our terrace when we did venture out to eat , we mainly headed down to the harbour , where we could take in the beautiful sights whilst enjoying the local delicacies that the island had to offer a definite highlight of the trip was visiting hula hula beach club during the day , you can relax on sunbeds that overlook the island 's crystal waters whilst sipping on cocktails or devouring the delicious food from in house restaurant bubba gump however , the fun truly begins at pm , when a dj emerges and the after beach party begins the girls and i spent all evening drinking , dancing and watching the sunset a night that was so special , it will stay with me forever other highlights of the trip included my brief attempt at paddle boarding i lasted minutes ! , hiking up to the top of the island to take in the breathtaking views from hvar 's fortress , and wandering around the town 's market stalls and boutiques before we knew it , our week of bliss had come to an end , and it was time to make the long trek back to scotland our trip is one in which i 'll never forget i'm so lucky i got to share it with of my very best friends hvar , you were a dream until next time s b x related posts i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner s
