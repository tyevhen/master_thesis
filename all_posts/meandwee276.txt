hi friends ! several months ago , my parents unearthed my old lunchbox from when i was in kindergarten e t ! i can see my wisdom of personalizing it with stickers to spell my name and embellish the front with a heart and some antennae thingies on et 's head i was so excited to see this old thing ! it 's been sitting around on a shelf for a while now and i decided to store paige 's play clay tools in it it 's got a simple latch that she can do herself and i like that i can see my old friend and keep him useful again ! for tools paige is favoring some plastic straws sturdy like sticks to poke , poke , poke the play doh she also likes chopsticks and this little rotary wheel thingie that makes nice lines i found in the basement cache of tools there 's also a cheesy plastic rolling pin that she uses the end to poke the doh and also a little plastic garlic press that makes hair i prompt her to pull , pull , pull ! when i squeeze the hair out and finally is a little dull plastic knife for cutting and making lines and poking she never used to be very engaged with this , but today she took this out twice the first time she played for over a half hour , and the second time was a good minutes i only had to remind her once that the activity stays on the table and when we were done she was happy to put away all the tools back in the box and latch it shut i 'll enjoy her penchant for cleaning up while it lasts over the past few days i 've noticed a love for fine motor games take her over she 's obsessed with all her puzzles and has speedily put them all together and she 's now onto all her other toys that have little bits and bobs to stack , sort , peg , build , etc she gets so focused and intent on doing them all over and over all stuff to keep her little fingers busy and flying i want to encourage her , but at the same time she is lost in her own little world not good when she still does n't have much going on for language but , we 're working on sneaking in chances for building speech into her little games i 'll fit it in however i can ! ! see you in this space soon ! save
