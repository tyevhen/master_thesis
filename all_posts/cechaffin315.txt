this blog began with adventures in mexico , segued to adventures in manic depression , and has since oscillated between literature , especially poetry , and my mood disorder when my mood disorder raises its protean head , my interest in other things is effectively eclipsed , as i have no interest in them nor passion for them this does not mean i quit acting , as in the long string of formal poetry i composed last winter as a mental exercise while depressed i know most of those poems are forgettable , a few worth keeping , but it 's the work that matters since hearing back from mellen press that they are willing to look at my ms on eliot , i have been laboring daily to bring it to a higher level today i finished the revision of the first chapter , eliot the early poems , and am mentally exhausted next i take on the revision of the waste land , no small task monday , when i lapsed back into depression , i began the process of re reading the ms , but because i was depressed i thought it was irremediable after my proper dose of medication monday and tuesday , i had hope on tuesday my editor , kathleen , had meanwhile weighed in with , you 're wrong it 's good what , you do n't trust your editor anymore ? there 's a reality check , but in depression you ca n't accept the judgment of others , especially when it 's in your favor still , yesterday the tome looked more promising today i am thinking less of the book , but my mood is also more tenuous i have also been avoiding the gym for a week , a lapse in discipline my routine presently consists of two cookies for breakfast , two or three hours work on the ms , a sandwich , physical activity in the form of gardening or housework , and then the blessed return of kathleen from work , after which the schedule is open sometimes i cook dinner i went to my men 's group for the first time in over a month last night i was the only member we did n't have time to hear from personally i thought it was probably for the best as my summary of the recent past and my current mood would have gone on longer than i wished still , it seemed no one noticed that i did not have a chance to speak about myself small wonder given man 's self centeredness in revising the first chapter of my eliot book i trimmed almost words , always a good sign , and did some fact checking as well as running down sources for certain quotes when i do so on google , i am overwhelmed by the wealth of opinion and documentation on eliot , and fear , as an amateur , i am in no way qualified to write about him still , i think many of my insights are new , and therein lies the value of the piece but it also makes it a bit of a liability for an academic press , especially since i purposely avoid footnotes for the sake of readability what matters is that i have work to do i do identify with eliot 's early alienation from reality , both social and physical i was very slow to mature to semi adulthood , lost in my own head just like j alfred prufrock kenyon , btw , is doing much better , perhaps because i found a steel reinforced splint for his left front lower leg two months ago he would not come up the stairs now he goes up and down them three times a day amazing how his condition has improved it may also be in part due to his daily dose of previcox , a cyto oxidase ii inhibitor like celebrex , which helps peripheral , especially arthritic , pain try it on your old dog and see what you think i mentioned the formal poems i wrote during the winter of my depression here 's one i revised before i became an ex poet anxiety you feel it in your stomach when you wake , almost like hunger but not quite the same , as if you re being hurried by a flame forward and forward and forward until you break or want to break anxiety won t allow a total breakdown , it would lose its grip on your dry tongue and almost trembling lip it lets you live in any time but now time future runs ahead , you eat its dust time past is pure regret , paralysis and your hard labor of self analysis will never birth in you a basic trust you wonder if as an infant it was better not if your mother raised you by the letter i am beset by fears , by fears of poverty and old age , feelings of inadequacy that i have no more savings and no longer own a house , guilt about not having a regular job and all the rest of my shortcomings when my chemicals improve my fears will improve , not that that constitutes an excuse to ignore the reality of their challenge challenge what a better term than fear ! fools will always be in the care of god , though i have not as yet needed to depend on the kindness of strangers my sister in law has forwarded a small selection of my poems to jane hirschfield , whose horse she also rides i expect at best a polite response to my imposition , the certain death knell for my former hope of being a poet at kilorats , ce
