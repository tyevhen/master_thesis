dear curtiss thanks so much for the comments i feel frustrated sometimes because , every time , i have to work for my depression to disappear my question is is this type of depression going to end completely one day ? r dear r as you use brainswitching , the nature of your struggle with depression will change since you ve spent a lot of time being depressed , those neural patterns are strong in your brain they are never going to go away the depressive neural patterns are forever in the memory banks of your brain and they can be triggered off by any number of things that s the bad news the good news , though , is that you know how to get out of depression whenever it s triggered off medication won t ever get rid of depression for good either , so you have two options you can be on medication , and not like the side effects , and become more and more afraid of depression and get weaker and weaker in your control over depression because you re developing no coping skills or you can get rid of depression whenever it shows up by using mind exercises it s your choice there s no way to get rid of depression for good but when you re actively engaged in controlling it , and getting rid of it when it comes , you get better at it you also become less afraid that depression has the power to take you over i m at that point i no longer have any fear of depression it s still plenty painful when it hits me i sometimes even say to myself , omg , this is terrible no wonder people kill themselves but then that other neural pattern that i have built over the years the one that says you better do a mind exercise right now reminds me to get busy with an exercise and i do and then depression is gone until the next time your depression will change over the years like mine did i have learned to get out of depression so easily that the fact that it shows up a couple of time a week isn t significant in my life my depression gets triggered off and at the same time the neural pattern that i have built over the years gets triggered off , the one reminding me to do an exercise i do the depression goes away in a few minutes and do n't forget everybody gets depressed it s just that some people have learned from childhood to distract their minds from downer , negative , fearful and depressive thoughts it s so second nature and automatic to them to do it that they don t notice the depression because it never advances beyond the very beginning stages my husband used to say that he was never depressed and that i just saw myself as a tragic person but after he attended one of my seminars , he changed his mind after that lecture he said to me that although he had always thought of himself as someone who was never depressed , when he heard me talking about the brainswitching exercises , he remembered something from the time he was a very little boy , he explained , whenever he had felt sad , had that painful misery that he guessed people meant when they said depression , he would imagine some football or basketball play in which he carried the ball he would concentrate on that until the painful feelings went away he s like other people i ve met who say they are never depressed but they all will admit to all kinds of interesting distractions , if they really give it some thought , that they learned from childhood to rid themselves of misery and painful anxiety your depression will never disappear but your relationship to it will change as you get better and better at getting rid of it whenever it hits a b curtiss
