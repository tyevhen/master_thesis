is overwhelming or brings up unresolved issues from the past fictionalized vignette about preparing emotionally for a major change tom tom and his wife , helen , had been talking about retirement for several years when they first started talking about it five years before , it seemed like it was a long way off but now that they were a year away from retirement , it suddenly seemed to loom large for tom they had already decided that they would remain in new york city because they loved the city , especially the cultural events they also had most of their family and friends in new york , so they did n't want to leave helen decided that she would get more involved in a charity where she already volunteered after retirement , she could spend more time doing what she loved preparing emotionally for major changes in your life but tom was n't sure what he wanted to do he knew that he would enjoy the first few weeks of being able to relax , but he also knew that he would get bored after a while if he just hung around the apartment he had already gone to his financial advisor , so he was clear on what their financial situation would be he had also looked into their health benefits plan and social security benefits , so that was taken care of already he just was n't sure what he wanted to do with his time , and the more he thought about it , the more worried he got his other worry was that he associated retirement with death because his father died shortly after he retired even though he was in good health and younger than his father when he retired , tom still could n't get this fear out of his mind he talked to his friends and family members , who were either retired or close to retirement after talking to them , he felt better for a short time , but then his fear would creep up on him again and cause him to lose sleep in the past , tom had a good experience with psychotherapy , so he decided to return to his former therapist to deal with his anxiety and indecision as soon as he sat in his therapist 's office , he remembered how comforted he felt in the past during their prior sessions , so he was glad that he returned to her rather than seeking out another therapist but he wondered if she would be able to help him with his current fear as they talked about how he associated retirement with death , tom remembered how worn out and tired his father was by the time he retired working a physically taxing job , his father looked at least years older than his actual age the job had taken a toll on his health and he died less than a year later , which was devastating for tom when he was last in therapy , tom came for overcome a specific phobia he had about flying , so he had never talked much about his relationship with his father during his prior therapy sessions as he talked about his father 's physically demanding job and his subsequent death soon after retirement , tom broke down in tears unexpectedly he was upset about the loss and the fact that his father did n't get a chance to enjoy his retirement then , he verbalized a thought that he had never been consciously aware of before if his father did n't get to enjoy his retirement , why should he deserve to enjoy his upcoming retirement ? the overwhelming feelings of guilt and sadness surprised tom now , he was beginning to understand why he was having difficulty planning what he might want to do with his free time not only was he afraid of death , which was related to his father 's death , but he also did n't feel that he deserved to enjoy his retirement because of his father 's experience tom thought he had grieved the loss of his father a long time ago , but he felt the loss again as if it happened yesterday he had taken care of the practical aspects of his retirement , but he could n't overcome the feeling that he was undeserving and he only realized that he felt this way once he began talking to his therapist tom 's therapist helped him to understand that major life changes could bring up issues from the past she also explained that tom was experiencing his grief for his father on another level where tom had an unconscious identification with his father see my article an unconscious identification with a loved one can create an obstacle to change over time , tom expressed how he wished he could have done something to spare his father from death until now , tom had blocked out these feelings about his father 's death now , he realized that these feelings that he blocked out for so long were coming up and creating obstacles for him tom also felt guilty that his father worked so hard to put him through college , and maybe if he did n't work so hard , he might have lived longer but he also knew that his father was so proud when tom graduated college , especially since tom 's father never had an opportunity to go to college tom 's therapist encouraged tom to keep a journal between psychotherapy sessions to capture any thoughts , feelings or dreams that might come up see my article the benefits of journal writing between therapy sessions he found writing in the journal especially useful because it deepened his understanding of his problems , and he was able to bring in his journal to the next session to talk to his therapist during his therapy sessions , tom realized that he was only remembering the hard times that his father had and not the good time that he had with tom and tom 's mother when he realized that he was mostly focused on his father 's hardships to the exclusion of the happy times , tom decided to write about his father 's life so , between sessions he wrote short stories about his father , and he shared his writing with his therapist during each session as tom wrote about his father , he realized that his father had many happy times in his life he also felt closer to his father than he had felt in a long time as he worked through the loss of his father on this deeper level , tom began to feel lighter he no longer felt afraid of dying after he retired because he was able to separate his upcoming experience from his father 's preparing emotionally for major changes in your life tom allowed himself to start thinking about what he would want to do after he retired he knew that he did n't want to spend his time playing golf or going to the casino , as some of his friends did he wanted something much more meaningful as he was considering the possibilities , he received a notice in the mail that the local elementary school was looking for volunteers for their reading program and a light went off in his head he loved little children and he loved reading , so this would be perfect for him as tom talked about volunteering for the reading program in his therapy session , he felt a new sense of energy and enthusiasm he also realized that he no longer felt guilty about his father in fact , he knew his father would be proud of him for working with children conclusion whenever you 're facing a major change in your life , there are usually practical considerations to address but there also emotional issues to address as well no matter what type of change you 're planning for , the practical considerations might be straightforward or , at least , there might be logical steps to follow but preparing emotionally can be more challenging ,
