confidence and self esteem , those two so closely tied together things , are tricky sometimes i really think i have this confidence thing down in a workshop , i speak enthusiastically to and with the large group , everyone 's eyes upon me , with not even a twinge of fear i go up to individuals afterward to tell them how much i liked that comment about sustainability they made , or simply to introduce myself with a smile and a firm handshake i say yes without pause when asked to speak somewhere , and think cheerfully of how much fun it 'll be this confidence leads into self esteem wow , people like hearing what i have to say , like meeting me , like me i have some awesome friends that 's cool i'm proud of what i 've done and do i like who i am i like me , too ! hell , i love me ! ! but then i 'll say or type something seemingly inconsequential without putting much thought into it or , even worse , think long and hard , then realize only just after i 've opened my mouth or hit the send key how stupid whatever i said just sounded to me then comes the twisty feeling in my gut how could i have said something so stupid ? ? then , like the opening of a dam , usually kept tightly closed off in some part of my mind , comes the rush of all , , other things i 've ever said or done that have made me wince brought on waves of shame and regret , or even just mild twinges of it every single thing this tends to happen especially when around certain people , people i think are especially cool , or especially cute , or especially smart , that i seem to be unable to say or do anything cool or intelligent when around them or in communication with them it only takes one event , or one slightly low mood and a surfacing memory , to make me spiral down this path of self hatred of course , in an hour or two , i 'll likely get a nice email , or have a friend say something , that gets me all happy and confident and self loving once again i feel like this is probably a fairly normal occurrence for a lot of people but really ? it sucks it feels really strange to be posting this , actually i 've come to feel obligated to write a certain type of post on this blog posts that are of a higher quality with more constructive content but i'm trying to keep in mind what i want this blog to be , and that 's to be a place i can freely express myself online that expression often is about unschooling , and often is in a more article like format but when what 's on my mind is something far more i do n't know , personal , i guess , i want to feel that that 's okay too which is why i'm posting this , despite reservations ! that is all peace , idzie you might also like against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! life happening the frustration of being that unschooled person linkwithin
