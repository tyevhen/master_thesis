but occasionally even that is challenged my optimism was tested this spring for those who are followers of this blog , you know i don t normally like to write about these things yet , these last few months have been another learning experience that needs to be shared as i mentioned , in mid february my neck muscles gave out and with it there was a lot of discomfort in the months following , i learned a lot about this new nuisance around the same time , i hyper extended my elbows while performing my long exercise program i have done it in the past , so i had already modified my exercise routine to minimize the possibility of it happening again i was wrong in early march my leg strength went way south on me i was experiencing days where transferring was very difficult to almost impossible to accomplish and i didn t feel safe standing about now , i am becoming worried my usual overly positive attitude was being tested within a few days of the leg strength issues appearing , i aggravated my lower back i am assuming it is because i struggled so much trying to transfer and stand before i could ask , what next , my hands went from weak to clubs i couldn t hold onto anything i used two hands to shave and brush my teeth and found even that difficult in late april , i woke up to the coup de gras my upper body muscles also went south my arms gave out on me while trying to perform my standing exercises i went down , but fortunately , i wasn t injured i had to reduce my long exercise program from minutes to less than minutes and even found that difficult i found myself learning new ways to use leverage in my daily routines it was frustrating along with all of this happening , the discomfort i hate to say the words aches and pain had increased the cracks in my optimism were now a breach i don t ever remember being tested on all fronts at one time then , just when i began to wonder if things could get worse , i woke up to a new day this slide is over ! may my leg strength started to recover first and , within days , i was back to my full leg exercise program without any difficulties this change alone turned my waning optimism around with the improved leg strength , my back problems diminished and are now totally gone within days my neck muscles showed improvement the aching also dissipated it is not back to what it was in january , but it is something i can more comfortably live with then my upper body strength improved it also feels like they are close to pre slide levels once again hand strength has improved , but along with my neck , they have seen the least improvement it has been almost two weeks since the slide ended and some of the strength returned i feel like a new man i am also so thankful for the end of the slide and the partial return of my muscles i have mentioned the blessing of having kennedy s disease over so many other conditions because of the slow progression this 'february through may' challenge was my most difficult one yet during the downhill race , i was finding it difficult to imagine living with kennedy s disease every day in the condition i was in this spring yes , there is still hope !
