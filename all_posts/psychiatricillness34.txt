i am meeting someone this afternoon to discuss the possibility of a new job i am so fed up and really need the change my job has changed so much now that i no longer enjoy it i want something new and exciting in the hope i will once again feel some motivation for life i keep wondering , what if what if i took that other job , what if i did not have recurring depression , what if i was not so socially anxious , what if i had a different up bringing something has to change soon i have been thinking about death quite a lot recently i keep watching other people with families i go home each night and sit and watch tv or play computer games this is not the life i want but i know no way out it is not i do not want to live , it is more i do not want to live this life i have tried making certain changes but so far nothing has helped i am so very lonely i am not going to kill myself , i could not do that , i just wish i had a button to press which would totally obliterate my life just make it so i was never born , then no one could miss me and no one would hurt it would not start a cluster of suicides or have an adverse impact on those staying behind i am crossing my fingers about this job i am going to see about this afternoon it is closer to home so would cut two hours off my working day each day ! ! at the moment i have a very long commute if i get the job , maybe i could start at the gym again , loose some weight i have put nearly a stone on this year maybe then my energy will return ? ? i am very tired all the time , i feel misserable and blue the slightest thing makes me feel anxious and stressed i have felt like this for so long now , i need to feel 'normal' for a little while everthing feels so stressful i just need a break i am going back to see the psychiatrist in two weeks i never seem to be out of his office at the moment i just want to feel better hey , i have two job interviews lined up , i feel a bit better already i really need tochange my job , i think that is my problem at the moment !
