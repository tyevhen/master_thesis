i wrote this short piece while i was in a high school english class about playing the piano i still find that what i have written can be true it is so good to have a way to express feelings , if not through words , then for me it is through the intensity that can come through music notes on the piano here i am , as a young girl , at the piano with mom the piano in my room is an old and beautiful instrument all through the many hours of the day it has been a place for expression where anger and sadness and happiness and pain have pressed heavily and softly against the keys , where the notes have grown loud in the air , quieted , and then grown again for no two successive days are the songs precisely the same not only do the notes get loud and get quiet in their expressive ways , but the tempo of the song is never the same it quickens and slows as the happiness comes and goes , as the mind of the dedicated , hard working pianist tires under its load of thoughts , or as the pages in the piano book indicate the speed in accordance with meaning and loudness today a little more feeling may be in the music , tomorrow a little less always the music from the piano remains a helpful and enjoyable comfort i am still enjoying the piano today in this grown up life i hope that you are able to find a way for yourself that lets your expression of what is inside you come out in a freeing and heartfelt way , even when you are still unable to speak what is there cindy
