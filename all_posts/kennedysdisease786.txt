admit that you ca n't handle everything yourself be prepared with a mental list of ways that others could help you for example , someone could take the person you care for on a minute walk a couple of times a week your neighbor could pick up a few things for you at the grocery store a relative could fill out some insurance papers when you break down the jobs into very simple tasks , it is easier
