i got the most ridiculous comment in my my middle finger post the other day here on this blog lovely anonymous added these helpful words yet you refused to breast feed ? go figure talk about having nothing to do with what i 'd said but , i 'd like to take a minute to add people like you to my fuck you list i can do that , since this is my blog let me be clear i love breastfeeders well , not literally all i guess i love many of my friends and family who breastfed and i love the ones that did n't or could n't this post is not about the benefits of either decision this post is about crappy and jerky people who assume the wrong things and then try to put you down for your own supposed personal choices anyway to anonymous and all who say shitty things like that you know nothing about my health or my medical history you have no idea to say i refused to breastfeed when you do n't know even half the story is uneducated at best what is worse is that you try and hurt me and insinuate something about my character screw you and the next time you want to say words like that to someone about breastfeeding please think about this perhaps they 've had a mastectomy and could n't ? perhaps they are battling cancer and could n't ? perhaps they had a horrible accident and could n't ? perhaps they simply were n't producing milk ? perhaps it 's none of your fucking business ! ! ! save you might also like mother 's day and the birth why i do n't breastfeed antepartum depression linkwithin
