wandering visitor has done a really great job with this week 's grand rounds , with the theme of 'what inspires you' , which in turn inspired us to write fuel for our fire and , now i know that those rainblow splashes you see , when the sun is high in the sky , are called circumhorizon arcs now , i want to know the name of the other ones that occur around an hour or so before sundown or after sunup , where you see two horizontal blips of color , one on the left and one on the right my recollection is that these occur when the sun is at an angle of degrees , but i do n't know the name or the physics behind it
