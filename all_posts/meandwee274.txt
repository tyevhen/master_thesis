dear little p , months old ! you are turning into a little lady there 's just no denying it that you are losing your baby chub as you grow and stretch and turn into a little girl i 'd be lying if i said it was n't hard for me to see you leaving your babyhood behind it has gone much too quickly we tried so hard to bring you into the world and then your babyhood came and went in such a flash i feel like babyhood needs to last just a little bit longer ! but , i guess it would never seem like enough i can never hold you or snuggle you enough such is the plight of being your mama especially because now you are n't too keen on being snuggled unless it 's on your terms this past month you have made some great strides in your speech development as well as with your focus and attention you seem to be doing better every day you discovered an obsession with puzzles and fine motor tasks i 've watched you put puzzles together and then immediately dump them out over and over and over again i 've been giving you more difficult challenges but you seem to solve them so quickly ! it 's hard for me to keep up with this flurry of connections you are making i love watching you concentrate and the way you say ray ! ! ! hooray when you finish a task you 've taken a shine to working with play doh and playing with your shape stacking puzzles it 's different because you used to be so into running around , moving and getting into things now i can usually find you sitting over a little project all within a week or two 's time watching you grow is just amazing ! the best part about all of these changes , by far , has to be that you are bonding with me more you come to me and engage with me much more than you used to it warms my heart to feel this connection with you i 've waited so long for you cuddle my legs , you look at me with a smile and joy in your eyes that makes me melt you ask for me and look for me and always want me to play with you you are my sunshine and my heart the joy and love i feel for you is everlasting please know that everything i do is for you and what is best for you in mind being your mama is a job i take very seriously and put a lot of conscious thought into because i love you more than the world i see a beautiful and perfect soul in your smile and for that i am forever lucky and grateful i love you always and forever , mama save
