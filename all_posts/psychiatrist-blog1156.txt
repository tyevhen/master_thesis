you may not smile in arkansas , indiana , nevada , or virginia at least , not if you are getting your driver 's license photo taken apparently , they use photo detection software to compare faces for identity fraud purposes and smiling thwarts the computer is it even legal or constitutional to require drivers to not smile ? can they frown ? stick out their tongues ? look cross eyed ? interesting face research where you can combine faces and a blog on pics of faces in places and make your own flash face like mr potato head i supposed dmv would prefer folks who are depressed when they get their photo taken , to keep the computers happy one man 's downer is another machine 's prozac just bizarre
