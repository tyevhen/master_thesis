i'm packed and ready to go to dallas tomorrow i 've decided not to bring my computer with me , so it may be a few days before my next update i'm looking forward to getting into dallas , settling into the hotel , shopping at the expo , picking up my number , and then finding a good place to eat eating quality carbohydrates and resting will be my focus for the next couple of days i'm anxious to get to the starting line as usual with the marathon , it 's difficult to know what type of performance to expect i think i'm still in fairly good shape , so i'm hoping for the best i'm flying back home after the marathon sunday evening , and i 'll be back at work monday morning i 'll post all about it as soon as i have the chance until then
