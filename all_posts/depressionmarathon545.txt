one of the tenets of my program of recovery is , do not make decisions based on fear my friends have been reminding me of this lately well , as i wrote here a few days ago , i am fearful i am in the middle of salary negotiations for a job i'm not certain i want because i am afraid i no longer possess the skills necessary to perform it well yet i know i ca n't stay at my current job , as the environment there is just too negative and unsupportive so i'm stuck , and i need to make a decision if i decide not to take the new position , i would definitely be going against the basic tenet my decision not to take the job would be totally based on fear the major reason not to take the new position is because i am afraid i ca n't do it other than that , it 's really a no brainer my fears , in reality , are likely unfounded i know eventually my discomfort would abate , my fear would subside , and i would settle into my new role so what am i afraid of ? well , i 've discovered i'm actually afraid of being afraid ! i do n't like to be uncomfortable i do n't like to feel afraid i 'd like to avoid both discomfort and fear at all costs so i'm actually afraid of feeling uncomfortable and afraid ! new jobs are always scary and uncomfortable and i do have some legitimate concerns about my forgotten skills but if i'm really honest , i am most afraid of , and i most want to avoid being scared unfortunately , or perhaps fortunately because it forces me to face my fear , staying at my current job is also quite uncomfortable it is uncomfortable for very different reasons , but it 's uncomfortable nonetheless yet choosing to stay in my current situation would be easier , and in a way more comfortable , than leaving for this new position weird ! it 's confusing it 's sticky it all makes this a very difficult decision to make no wonder i feel stuck ! stuck or not , i'm leaning strongly toward leaving if we can work out the salary details , which i could have accomplished tonight had i called the regional manager back , i think i will take the new position in a way , i feel like i need to take it in order to challenge myself , in order to work through this fear in doing so , i have to remember another crucial component of my program , faith i can only make my best decision , and i must leave the rest to god it will work out as it should i must , regardless of the decision i make , have faith in that
