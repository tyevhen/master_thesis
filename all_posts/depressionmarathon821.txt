it was one of those degree , afternoon thunderstorm kind of days when i set out to explore a new bike trail east of rochester in fact , on my way to the trail there was about a ten minute downpour two minutes later , as i was unloading my bike from the back of my car , the sun was shining again i rode miles north under sunny , puffy clouded skies the bike trail was very nice it travelled through the countryside there were wide open sections with cows , pasture , and open fields there were a few tree lined sections , lots of bridges , and nary a building in site lovely until i turned around , that is as i faced south for the first time , ominous black , thick clouds greeted me apparently , they had been following me well , i thought , i only needed the rain to hold off for minutes and i 'd be back at my car i started back at a brisk pace after about minutes i was feeling pretty lucky it was really dark , and the wind was stiff in my face , but it had yet to rain unfortunately , my luck ran out within the minute big rain drops no problem , i thought then big wind , but i was still on my way so i 'd get a little wet ha ! i crouched low in my triathlon tuck , as the wind started sweeping me from the side the rain was hard and heavy , and i was getting just a touch nervous but i was n't about to stop i had nowhere else to go ! suddenly , the rain was blowing in sheets across the path the wind was so loud i could barely hear myself breathe oh well , i thought , at least i'm getting closer to my car at about that moment , i looked up from my tuck the trees in front of me were horizontal parallel to the ground in the now fierce wind okay , that alarmed me just a bit i rode harder at least it 's not hailing , i thought no sooner had that thought crossed my mind when , thwack ! ! something stung me hard in the back what the ? then , rat a tat tat i just had to laugh hail i kept going thank god i had a helmet on my head ! but the hail got heavier , and harder , and bigger at mph , hail kind of hurts ! about that time , i went across a road which intersected the path as i crossed the open road , my breath was sucked right out of my chest it was n't until later that i remembered people in tornadoes describing just such a phenomenon all i knew is that i could n't breathe for a couple seconds the wind picked up so fast it sounded like a train roaring down on me branches and hail were raining down upon me finally , i had to stop i was at mile of my mile ride fortunately , i had just entered a shallow valley lined with trees i hugged up against a muddy hill for just a few minutes i did n't want to stay there long i figured the safest thing for me to do was to get my soaked , welted body to my car as quickly as i could so as soon as the hail let up , i was on my bike again two minutes later , i was off more wind , hail , and raining branches as i crouched in some brush , i again chuckled to myself how did i get myself into this ? it was so pathetic , it was kind of funny the weather briefly let up again , and i began the final push to my car i had to dismount two more times , as trees yes , trees had fallen across the path ! i began to wonder if i had just ridden through a tornado finally , my car appeared ahead it began hailing again as i disassembled my bike , so i could fit it into my tiny car , i cursed myself for not yet purchasing a bike rack then , comically , i had to struggle against the wind to keep my hatchback open long enough to shove my bike inside hail , rain , wind it was unbelievable finally , i got my bike in my car but wait , this is the really comical part in the time it took me to close my hatchback , walk around and get into my car , everything stopped as i shut the driver 's side door , the rain , the hail , and even the wind stopped i sat there in my now silent car , and i laughed there i was , a battered , drowned rat , and the sun was peeking over my shoulder i drove home with my sunglasses on and my window open it was sunny the rest of the day
