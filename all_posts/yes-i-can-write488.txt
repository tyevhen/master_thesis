today , after bouncing around pointlessly and burning off a bit of energy i took out the pencils and paper and drew ! i'm actually rather proud of my pon and zi drawing i will never be a great artist , but this turned out pretty much the way i wanted it to , so it 's all good i also drew a tree nymph , but since i'm considerably less proud of that particular drawing i wo n't post it here ! i decided my computer desk area could be spiced up a bit , so i started a collage on the wall my crap heap of a desk and some brand new decoration on the wall ! i will continue to add my various art and written work until i run out of space i did a few domestic chores after surprisingly little nagging from my mom , then took a nice walk with friends to the dock and back that 's become a bit of a nightly ritual actually oh , and at some point in the day i started the illustrated a brief history of time by stephen hawking when i first heard of this book , i got a mental image of some page complicated scientific thing 'brief' i 've found is often a misleading word , but it sounded interesting so i checked it out turns out it 's under pages , has lots of pretty pictures , and is written in a very easy to understand manner , even for those like me who are n't all that strong in the maths and sciences department ! my day does n't sound all that special from reading this , but i really enjoyed myself today ! i have n't drawn anything in so long , and i just had an awesome sense of wellbeing throughuot the day good lazy summer times listening to today ready to fall by rise against , drones by rise against , pain by three days grace reading the illustrated a brief history of time
