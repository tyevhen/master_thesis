hi friends ! i 've held out long enough and am ready to show you the full photos of paige 's new playroom ! as i 'd mentioned in the past , we took the front room of our house that we used as an office and turned it into a play space it simply was n't being utilized as much as it could have been anymore as an office now we are in here most of the day every day and we love it ! it 's cheerful , energetic , and we feel happy here in the photos you can see my little corner where i do my computer stuff , can do my own artwork , and store my own books and things my inspiration board is there too paige can play all she wants and i can be in there too i hope you like it ! i plan to make changes in the coming future to make room for paige 's play kitchen and a dress up spot , but i wanted to show where we are at for now i hope all is well with you as we are finishing up some nasty colds over here it seems like we 've been endlessly sick ! is it spring yet ? haha save
