i apologize for the delay in posting here , but i 've been away in the middle of last week , many of my treatment team members were unanimously in favor of re hospitalization in order to keep me safe while we continue adjusting my medications fortunately , i was planning a trip to duluth to see my parents and friends for the weekend , and when i met with my therapist on thursday , she agreed the trip north would likely be very beneficial in fact she thought it would be a much needed band aid for my mood , and so i went i just returned home from days in duluth , minnesota , which sits on the tip of the biggest of all the great lakes , lake superior a few minutes around lake superior and serenity washes over me it 's one of my favorite places on the planet i grew up around duluth and lake superior , so i have a lot of good memories of the area it 's familiar it 's beautiful and i have good friends and family who still live there i really should visit more often as it turned out , my therapist was right on this trip was a band aid for me i spent my days with good friends , family , and or jet i was rarely alone it was sunny and gorgeous everyday the sun was healing i could feel it warm me , and center me , from the inside out i spent as much time as possible outside and within site of the lake , including a mile hike with jet which included a lot of lake superior beach the weekend was definitely a healing reprieve from the suffering of the past several weeks i'm now back home and a little anxious i'm going to work hard to keep the band aid effect going i'm hoping the traction gained over the weekend will jump start my motivation and energy , decrease my fatigue , and keep my mood elevated i'm grateful for my healing reprieve , and i'm praying it continues
