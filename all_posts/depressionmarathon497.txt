it 's nice to know training hard pays off after training hard for months for today 's twin cities marathon , i was really worried i was going to bonk but that did n't happen instead i ran a very steady , consistently paced , and fairly fast ! i believe that is the fourth fastest of my marathons and i felt good ! i felt strong ! and i'm really , really pleased with the result i actually held myself back for much of the first miles i did n't want to make my usual mistake of going out too fast and paying dearly for that later in the race i consistently right around or under my planned pace around mile i began to feel some fatigue , so i started a mantra of rest until mile over and over again i kept my pace consistent and focused on relaxing and then when i got to miles , i extended my mantra rest until twenty there are some fairly good climbs between miles and , so at miles , i extended it once again i relaxed i ran steady i felt good i knew i could give more , but it was n't until mile that i let it go i knew by mile that , unless something dramatic happened , i was going to qualify for boston i knew i was going to finish under my goal i knew i was running well i wonder now if i waited too long i do think i could have run even faster , as i was n't totally spent at the finish , but i'm glad i ran a smart race i'm glad i finished in a time of which i can be proud and i'm so glad i trained hard the reward is certainly sweet
