i hope in this piece to save you all a lot of angst and danger so many of you get involved with a certain kind of person and then are surprised when a little while later he turns out to be a stalker , someone who won t let go , someone who lives only for the day when you come back to him , someone who calls incessantly , and finally someone who makes threats and becomes dangerous let s see how he got into this mess and how you got into it too this is now a scenario among dozens of possibilities , so i will recount only one the young boy grew up with no love in his house his father was cold and distant and is mother slightly warm but he had to struggle for her love then one day when he was six she ran off with someone else and he was left with his severe father it could have been that she was only having an affair or was killed in an auto accident you name the permutations the point is that his lifeline and only chance for some love was gone , suddenly without warning he was truly along , left with this pain and urgent need that lay there as a permanent strata , une couche in french now he meets a young na ve girl and dates her and finally marries her he is wonderful for the first few weeks and the the couche sets in and gets triggered off because in marriage unconsciously she becomes momma this happens so often , where the girlfriend becomes mother as soon as she puts on the ring , and everything changes so what does he do ? he becomes possessive of mother don t leave me , and he is controlling , where were you ? who did you see ? what did you say ? and on and on this never gets better , only worse , because the pain need is imprinted and won t just go away this got so bad with one of the stars whom i treated that when they went to parties he watched his wife constantly and would not allow her to raise her head to look at anyone the submissive girl , who grew up submissive to a controlling father , did not see anything wrong with this it was just her life she just went on living as she always had , giving in to controlling people so she lived their lives not hers she paid the price for this because she imagined there was a chance for love but one day she meets someone and tries to leave he says to her , no one leaves me and lives to tell about it he becomes suspicious , paranoid and he will make sure she cannot get away she is terrified because he can be violent , the violence he felt when his mother left he will follow his wife in a continuing effort for control he will sneak into her house and listen to her phone messages he is completely wound up in this because when mother left that was his last chance at life , and that feeling is still inside of him he can kill because life alone has no more meaning for him it means his life is over , there is nothing to live for that is the pull of love and why love can turn to hatred so easily first love and then the rejection and what stops love is his desperate need for it and his overbearing control to make sure he is loved this produces the opposite no love she needs freedom and he cannot let her have it because to him it means rejection he will first plead to ask her to come back but when rejection is certain there is danger and it needs to be reported i had one man i treated who was clearly paranoid and thought his wife was cheating on him she wasn t but did want to get away too frightened to try i called the police because he was an immediate danger they told me they do not act on maybe only acts so he went home and pumped five bullets into her and she lived , and he was put away , finally the paranoid is unchangeable and intractable in his beliefs because of the imprinted feeling down below that keeps him in its grip as long as the imprint remains his ideas remain fixed , and they worsen so when you get involved with a controlling partner who wants to know incessantly where you went and what you did stay away it will become dangerous
