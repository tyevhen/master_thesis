in some parts of the world they use natural remedies to cure you for many things you heal fast these things are not available in the us they are all man made why ? answer you have a mistaken assumption , to some extent a lot of natural remedies are available in the usa , but you pretty much have to look for them to see them many family physicians are not trained in alternative medical care and due to some ignorant practices among americans from years ago , they may tend to lump all alternative medicine together with skepticism , thinking it s all old wives tales however , to the desparate , those seeking or those with some openness to new things , many people are reexamining alternative treatments for themselves there are too many people having too many good results to ignore it all however , people are also having to figure out the difference between what s useful what s bogus , too the fake useless stuff makes it harder for people to believe that any of it is of any use , i think personally , when i got into poor health many years ago and realized it , i didn t have money for doctors nor did i trust them after seeing what happened with some close relatives in various matters so , i prayed , trusted god , relearned how to eat properly and also learned about nutrients , herbal healing and sports supplements i ve had great results along the way also , when reading about what nutrients chemicals are found in various herbs , it makes sense why some are effective in certain ways , scientifically question time for the health industry to change and accept a more hollistic approach to health ? i m tired of doctors prescribing medicine for everything a little headache take these pills stomach ache take this medicine heck , i had a serios mysteerious ache in the stomach , and it was so bad i was in terrible pain for months they gave me medicine and i didn t even take it , i used herbals and was patient and positive and i healed doctors don t prescribe any natural remedies except for the well known orange juice for colds they need to appraoch all illnesses with natural cures for example , if you say you re depressed , they immediately suggest medication why ? why not suggest meditation and mental exercises answer unfortunately , doctors are taught how to fix things , take symptoms away they aren t very good in telling their patients how to prevent getting that way in the first place and most people want a quick fix anyway , they don t want to be told they have to change their lifestyle i work for a chiropractor , in a rehab type office people come in with injuries and most want pain killers , they don t want to come in for therapy , they don t want to hear it will take time for their injuries to heal pain is the way your body says hey ! something is wrong here ! ! too many patients come in and see the md , get something meant to help them to manage the pain , then they don t come back for their physical therapy , when the pain meds run out , they come back and say now i hurt worse people just don t get it , just because the pain is gone , it doesn t mean the injury is gone plus the pharmaceutical companies push the doctors to use their drugs , they run commercials so people will go to the doctor and ask for their drugs people need to take responsibility for their health , stop relying on info they get from tv commercials question apple cider vinegar drinking ideas ? what can i do to make it taste better ? please no negative comments try to give me more then one idea please ! thanks ! by the way im not old enough to drink alchol and yes i plan on sipping drinking it or what ever action word u want to use it is good to drink ive read many articles on it heres one for centuries people have been using natural apple cider vinegar as both a food and a medicine for themselves and for their pets since bc , hippocrates , the father of modern medicine , and others , have used vinegar and vinegar mixed with honey , as an energizing tonic and a healing elixir more recently , the health benefits of apple cider vinegar have been promoted by many well known authors such as dr jarvis , paul c bragg and patricia bragg d c jarvis , a vermont country doctor , noted that apple cider vinegar was a respected home remedy used by many vermonters to successfully treat a number of common ailments and nagging aches and pains he was so impressed that he went on to write a book on his observations and experimentations with home remedies , especially apple cider vinegar , and its beneficial effects on both people and farm animals first let me say that apple cider vinegar is a completely natural product , resulting from the fermentation of apple juice to hard apple cider followed by a second fermentation to apple cider vinegar this natural product retains all the nutritional goodness of the apples from which it was made plus it is fortified with the extra acids and enzymes produced during the two fermentation steps it s the sum of all these ingredients that give apple cider vinegar its amazing health benefits a compilation of many time honored home remedies used for a wide range of health problems is included in the natural healing home remedies section apple cider vinegar benefits include many external uses as well it can be used to sooth sunburns and insect bites , to make your hair shine , and to treat dandruff just to mention a few click on the hair care or home remedies section for more details on these and many more uses apple cider vinegar fits in well with today s trend towards eating natural healthy whole foods , and away from the overconsumption of highly processed convenience foods , which are depleted of much of their original nutrients answer i ve seen many small hand held magazines as you check out in a grocery store small booklet type sources i mix a little olive oil with the vinegar and drink it olive oil is also good for pain a nice small drink of zesty italian dressing is just as beneficial
