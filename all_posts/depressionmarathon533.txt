have you ever felt like a fraud ? have you ever felt like you 're fooling everyone around you into believing you really know what you 're doing when you 're certain you do n't ? it 's not a comfortable feeling do you know what i'm talking about ? i'm feeling like a fraud at my new job it 's not a new feeling i 've had it before , but it 's been awhile i hate feeling like a fraud it means i'm scared , self conscious , and insecure those are not enjoyable feelings either i feel like i'm fooling my boss , colleagues and patients tricking them into believing i'm a good physical therapist and i'm just waiting for all of them to figure me out worrying about when they 're going to discover my ignorance puts me on pins and needles as a result of my self imposed anxiety , i can barely think i really feel dumb somewhere in the back of my mind i know i'm not dumb , and sometimes i even think of myself as a decent physical therapist but those thoughts are few and far between mostly i feel like a complete fraud from experience , i know this feeling will likely pass yes , i 've been here before i'm uncomfortable and anxious i'm dreading returning to work tomorrow yesterday i could barely breathe it 's going to take too long , i believe , but i think the feeling will eventually pass i 've talked to my sponsor , joan , and my friend , cindy both suggested i pray pray to do the best job i am able and leave the rest to god phew ! that requires a fair amount of faith but i'm at a loss , so i guess that 's what i'm going to do tonight , tomorrow i'm going to pray i hope they are right i want to be relieved of feeling like a fraud
