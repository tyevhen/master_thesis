after a comment by a friend , a friend who ran a personal best at her last marathon despite being ill , my intent to begin grandmas marathon yesterday on personal record pace despite battling a nasty virus was set so that 's what i did despite waking up with a sore throat , body aches , and congestion , i began yesterday 's race on pace to run a , or minutes seconds per mile for miles it was a perfect day to run fast it was degrees and cloudy with dense fog at the start the conditions remained the same , with the addition of a cool tailwind , throughout the entire race i ran as close to my intended pace as i could for as long as i could that was the plan , and i stuck to it mentally , it was difficult i kept waiting for the inevitable fatigue i knew running a pr would be difficult even on a perfect day , and here i was attempting it despite my less than perfect physical condition i did n't know when the proverbial wall would hit , but i expected to smack into it at any time i ran the best i could in the meantime surprisingly , the halfway mark came and went , and i was still running close to my intended pace i had lost a few seconds here and there , but for every mile i ran over pace , i seemed to run one under pace as well my elapsed time at miles was within seconds of my target time , and i could see the pace group running just ahead you might think i 'd have been overjoyed at that point , but i knew there were still miles left to run , and the fatigue had been settling into my legs for several miles already nonetheless , i continued as best i could i glanced at my pace every mile , but it was more or less just to note it , rather than to adjust it up or down one foot in front of the other became my mantra , and clicking off one mile at a time was my focus i had let go of achieving my goal , but i had n't let go of finishing as fast as i could as i became more fatigued , i focused on my secondary goal of running every step of this race i 've run grandmas at least times , and i had never before finished it without walking at least part of the course unfortunately , my secondary goal fell away , too i gave in and walked through a water stop at mile i slowed in order to completely take in my fluids that probably cost me seconds , but it allowed me to run , without walking , up the infamous lemon drop hill at mile , the steepest hill on the course i walked again just before mile in order to consume a couple of strawberries and an orange slice , serious carbs for my seriously depleted body , which likely took another seconds from my overall time but again , i think i needed the boost to keep me moving forward the last to miles were almost entirely mental i did n't want to give up i knew i was doing well i knew i was running a great pace considering the circumstances i knew i had run faster , longer than i had thought possible just hours before i kept focusing on running to the next mile marker i planned a short walk break at mile , an incentive to keep me running i had long since stopped looking at my watch mile approached , and i could see an official race clock beside the course the official time clicked over to as i passed i realized i had minutes to complete the last miles and still run under ! it took me at least one minute to cross the starting line , so i knew my net time was even less than at that point i was shocked , and the planned walk break went right out the window ! that last mile , during which i thought , perhaps out loud , i'm never going for a marathon pr again , sucked ! but i ran it as hard as i could i'm sure i did n't look pretty i certainly did n't feel pretty , or efficient , or fast i came around the final corner , miles from the line , and saw the finish line clock clicking toward i sprinted well , i thought i was sprinting i gave everything i could as i stepped across the final timing mat , i stopped my watch it said i remember thinking , again perhaps out loud , damn ! i so wanted that i had the nerve to be disappointed , just for a minute , at coming so close i gathered my things , refueled , and made my way to the changing tent i had just run a pr i could n't believe it , yet i was still a little disappointed i admit it in the changing tent , i dug my cell phone out of my bag and turned it on it buzzed with several messages , but it was a message from my friend , t , which washed all the disappointment away she congratulated me on accomplishing my goal i had gotten my after all my official time , she reported , was i did it ! i'm proud of myself and i ca n't believe it by mile , i had given up the goal though i knew i was running better than i expected , i thought the building fatigue would soon slow me i thought maybe i could hold it under if i was lucky , and i was okay with that i ended up recouping more than one minute in those last miles i was n't expecting that i'm glad i persevered it turns out it was a great day to run , despite being sick i'm grateful to god for my ability and for the opportunity to run as i wish i'm happy my preparation paid off , and despite swearing off another attempt at a marathon pr , i wonder what could i have done had i not been sick ? i'm still sick , so i guess that 's a question for another time right now , i'm going to bask in the glow as i head back to bed
