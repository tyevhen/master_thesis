on the last day of my th year , december , , i ran the bridges marathon in little rock , arkansas it was my gift to myself , and it proved to be a tough gift it was degrees yes , degrees fahrenheit when i left home in minnesota on thursday it was f it was only in the 's in little rock on friday , but it was degrees with about humidity on saturday ! go figure despite the heat , i actually had a decent race i ran seconds slower than i did in new york weeks ago , but in new york i ran the second half of the race minutes faster than the first half in little rock , i ran the second half minutes slower the last miles were my slowest miles of the day it was a true test of perseverance i refused to walk , but i could not lift my feet any higher or will my legs to go any faster i was proud to finish without giving in to my fatigue and walking it was my little victory i actually had another bigger , unexpected victory shortly after crossing the finish line my was good enough for first in my old age division i received a very nice , dimensional plaque for my efforts it was n't a big race there were about runners , i believe i finished th overall and th among women overall it was a good day i arrived home from little rock yesterday , my th birthday i ca n't believe i'm years old ! if you 've been paying attention to the weather , you know my corner of the world has been extremely cold i think it was degrees , that 's without wind chill , on saturday night it was below when i got home yesterday afternoon and i came home to two more unexpected surprises despite arranging for a friend to clear my driveway while i was gone , it was packed with inches of new snow my friend chose not to clear the snow secondary to the dangerously cold conditions okay unfortunately , it was so cold my snowblower would n't start ! i stayed out long enough to shovel the sidewalks and stairs , but the driveway went undone frustrating , but not that big a deal , really later last night i had a much bigger , stressful surprise when i attempted to take a shower i discovered one of my water lines had frozen while i was gone instant stress ! i worked feverishly for almost hours trying to get the line to thaw , all the while hoping it had n't split and would n't burst , but nothing worked finally i gave up and went to bed i was exhausted i said a prayer , turned my heat way up , and left the faucet in my bathroom open overnight at am , the water began to flow happy birthday to me i was n't looking forward to paying a plumber to thaw my water line , especially if i was going to have to have my snowblower repaired , too and did i mention my root canal will be completed tomorrow ? as generous as the endodontist has been thus far , i will need to pay her a chunk of cash , too financial stress not my favorite thing thankfully , i was able to start my snowblower tonight after warming it with a space heater for an hour so two potentially expensive , stressful situations were resolved without too much pain i'm thankful for that i was feeling a little snake bitten last night now i just have to get through my root canal hopefully it will be smooth sailing after that
