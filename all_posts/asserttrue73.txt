i ca n't help but share a few final thoughts on the greek tragedy forgive me if my thoughts wander occasionally there has been talk by germany , slovakia , and finland of somehow forcing the greeks to exit the euro , even though there is no legal mechanism for forcing any country to exit the greeks have said repeatedly that they will not be exit a number of lessons should by now be apparent in any contest between democracy and the neoliberal banking elite , the bankers win that 's the bottom line , for all of us sch uble has been plotting grexit for at least years which means he knows the greek debt can never be repaid , since repayment in worthless drachmas , post grexit , would never be feasible germans are not known for their haircuts they will not agree to one now the rich do not let humanitarian concerns interfere with business in this case , the eu is more than happy to lay off an entire country if microsoft or ibm or name any other large corporation were in charge of greece , it would act exactly as germany is acting to see how well philanthropy works in the u s , drive to the middle of any large city and notice the number of homeless people wandering about if the super rich were job creators , there would not be homeless people all over america we 'd be awash in jobs if america is a land of opportunity , why do million people more than in any other country choose the opportunity of being in prison ? maybe there 's not enough real opportunity countries with real opportunity have fewer than normal people in prison , not more greece was allowed into the country club the eurozone by mistake the eurozone is a country club only well to do members are welcome you must wear a tie and jacket to dinner little known fact the modern neck tie is a croatian invention , symbolizing the noose of the indentured by crushing greece , germany hopes to send a message to lesser countries which is to say , all other countries that non aryan ways will not be tolerated spain , italy , portugal , and ireland you may pack your bags now be sure they fit in the overhead compartment russia could very well help greece , but it knows the rule wait until after the bankruptcy to buy what you want at pennies on the dollar when federal spending is of gdp as it is in most european countries , austerity does n't work it undercuts gdp directly by a lot imf 's own experience with multipliers shows that in some countries , cutting in government spending results in loss from the economy austerity did nothing good for greece in the future , ethnic cleansing will be conducted by purely economic means the future begins today have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ? tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more documented , with links to sources and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend retweet this post ! many thanks to the great folks who retweeted me yesterday have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
