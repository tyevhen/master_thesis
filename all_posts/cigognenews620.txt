we may often wonder how do we know what level of consciousness the patient is on during a session ? what kind of access to lower levels does she have ? we do know that as we descend down the chain of pain with patients to levels of consciousness that are very early and remote the vital signs deviate from normal more and more so when a patient is feeling depressed and helpless in the present and her vital signs drop to bp , and body temperature we can begin to understand that through resonance the current feeling has dredged up possible gestational trauma that accounts for the excessive readings this is because the closer we get to gestational life the more life and death events we are dealing with and that in turn radically alters vital signs often , we cannot account for a serious drug addiction in a patient who seemed to be loved by parents throughout his childhood yet when we look at the gestational period and birth event we have a different view of how traumatized the patient was and is if we ignore this period we will remain at a loss to explain symptoms and , above all , to treat them successfully checking vital signs gives us more information as to where the patient is in terms of levels of consciousness or unconsciousness if she feels in the present , someone took advantage of her and didn t let her into a class , her vitals are not going to be as extreme as when she dredges up very early first line events if , during the session , she has deeper access we will see a serious change in vital sign readings it is one control we have of connection and integration for if the vitals do not come down after the session it means either there is much more of the this feeling still left to feel , or the therapist made a mistake and did not help the patient to integrate we have measured vital signs for many years and have found that if the vitals descend in sporadic fashion after a session it usually means a lack of connection , and hence , abreaction the discharge of a feeling without proper connection it means a lack of cohesion in the patient s brain which can lead to an abreactive style that keeps the person sick and neurotic the readings we get tell us unmistakeably what kind of trauma the patient underwent and when if she is depressed and a depressive , chances are the mother might have taken painkillers or tranquilizers during the time she was carrying and at birth there was a possibility that she was heavily anesthetized so that the baby was totally drugged and unable to struggle to get out she was stuck in the trough where the birth process had begun but for a number of reasons the baby could not complete the birth cycle she was stuck in the helpless hopeless feeling vital signs toward the low end she has been born with a passive , energy conserving mode so as not to use up too much oxygen and that is reflected in the vital signs , which are characteristically on the low side if the baby could struggle and get out she will more likely be in the sympathetic nervous system , aggressive and go getting again , her vital signs will be on the high side , and when she descends down the chain of pain in a session they will rise dramatically as she approaches reliving birth and the trauma where struggle meant life in the parasympath mode struggle could have meant death this becomes an imprinted prototype and governs our lives forevermore if the carrying mother is addicted to cokes or coffee then chances are the newborn will tend to be hyperactive and , moreover , if she is the anxious , can t sit still kind of person there is a good chance that her baby will tend to be that way , as well she will be the kind of person who is not daunted by a project no matter how tough but she will not recognize obstacles that one must be aware of to react realistically we can t win
