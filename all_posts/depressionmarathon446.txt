i just returned home from milwaukee it was a short visit , as usual , to see d we had a very nice time even though he had to work a bit yesterday , we got to spend some quality time together i went for a mile run , a mile walk with jet , and took a much needed nap while d worked he came home in time for us to spend the afternoon together at a nice bookstore last night , we went out for an italian dinner with d 's year old son we finished up the evening with a delicious decaf caramel latte at the local , trendy coffee shop i have to say , it was the best caramel latte i have ever had ! it was fitting , comfortable end , to a busy but comfortable day this was jet 's first visit to d 's home he was quite playful and rambunctious , which does n't bother me in the least in my own home , but i found myself worried when he was racing around d 's house you see , d was not a dog person at all prior to meeting me in fact , puck was the first , and only dog ever allowed in his home his family was stunned when they found out he allowed it ! of course , i told him on day one that we were a package deal jet is now the second dog d 's allowed to cross the threshold fortunately , i think i worried needlessly d enjoyed playing with him , even if jet did n't yet have the best manners together , d and i took jet for a slow run walk this morning prior to going on our own mile run it was foggy and raining , but it was nice to run together , nonetheless after he made me some delicious pancakes , we both lingered , unwilling to separate me to go home , d to go back to work but the weather was a bit threatening , and i had no desire to get caught up in an ice storm , so i eventually left i'm now safely at home jet is racing around tossing and chasing his bone , as i sit here with heavy eyelids i sure wish d and i did n't live so far apart our visits are short , it 's always difficult to leave , and i'm usually exhausted when i return home regardless , i'm grateful for d and for our growing relationship it 's really nice to have someone special in my life
