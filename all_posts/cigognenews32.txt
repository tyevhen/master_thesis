i write this is as an academic hall of fame in psychology and with years of psychology training and years of training in psychiatric social work plus an extra year of post graduate internship in psychiatric social work so i have an idea of what is involved the whole training system needs to be junked and brought up to date with modern science right now , it is not a science that can make people well it is a lot of tinkering , much of which i did in my earlier years on staff at hospitals and clinics now the powers that be are making it impossible to master any kind of science they believe by adding more years of classes , and internships , and lectures , it will somehow build into a cure i believe it will not , and just be busy work to make it look like a science , which it isn t the requirements for a license now are prohibitive and ineffective it makes students jump through hoops , which are simple impediments to learning the most advanced of my trainees were the ph d candidates all of whom failed training because they were so intellectual and had their feelings ground out of them they could not sense when to make a move with a patient and how to do it it became mental illness for them with feelings left behind they learned to treat patients with insights and rationales with no understanding of brain science worse , with no idea about the role of feelings in neocortex function , which in therapy is crucial making it difficult is not the same as making it understandable and treatable and piling on more ethics courses will not help normal therapists are ethical , by definition the failures were the ones who were unethical , trying sometimes to be the patient s friend and pal , instead of his doctor so what do we need ? a feeling therapist , first and foremost then a minimum of brain science , then some biochemistry to see how neurosis works in the body but the tool is the therapist and he has to be sensitive to the patient s feelings and needs and his deep lying imprints i have confirmed that over fifty years of training to see who can treat and who cannot it is never the people in their head who can help and cure it is those who are connected to their feeling centers just the opposite of today s training in psychiatry and psychology i am poster boy what i learned almost never helped me do therapy and certain never helped me understand what a cure involved it never help me get to my feelings they were mostly afterthoughts for years now , it is still about insights and reasons and explanations so what is wrong with that ? an outside doctor can never tell what is inside a patient because he learns from his system , above all as feelings come up , he is informed what forces he has been hiding and what has driven him all these years no foreign expert can do that because the expert and the only expert is the patient for the patient , it is a crime to rob him of his epiphanies , his sole discoveries and his new ability and power to change himself he knows what upcoming feelings can be approached , and what feelings must lie quiescent for the moment he knows what feelings can be overloading and produce the deadly abreaction and if an outsider pushes him , what he gets too often is abreaction because an outsider cannot know when the patient is ready for the descent into the lower depths of the brain and that is what we don t need , well trained intellectuals who cannot sense what the patient can take and cannot take if we can off our narcissism for a minute and make psychotherapy patient centered and not doctor centered , where he is not the owner of the domain of the cognoscenti but also a learner of the human condition , then we see no need for the phalanx of specialists who know everything about this symptom or that , but nothing about the internal life of the patient we then have a cabal of those who ignore deep history of the patient , deep history of his very early key life and the history , not of his intellectual development but that of his emotions we need to study the whole human , not in the booga booga holistic therapy sense , but of the dynamic interactions of all of his systems , not the least of which is his brain i think that is what training and supervision in the primal world is all about , and after many decades we do get neurochemical change we do get cure , as i define it as in behavior and in medical normalization that is a lot but i cannot deny the results we get , and today they are awesome remember , a tough school does not necessarily mean a good school it is just tough a school for masochists where upon graduation they hand you your diploma wrapped in a sculpture of your neo cortex , with testicles hanging and with a note good luck
