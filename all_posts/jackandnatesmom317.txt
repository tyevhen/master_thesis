probably everyone but me who knew that there were so many great autism resources available ? i had pretty much ignored twitter in general until a friend of mine mentioned it in reference to something completely different last week that little reminder made me go explore and turns out that it seems to be the epicenter of the autism world i feel like i am getting a live news feed of the latest news and interventions , not to mention a wealth of stories and support from other autism parents in just these few days , i have been amazed look at this story , written by jim over on http blogginglily blogspot com http www childswork com blog married with children special children i feel like i am reading my life something i would have loved to explain on my own i just do n't yet have the words i am not yet to the point that he is where i think that marriage with special needs kids is no harder than marriage with typical kids , just different right now it 's still much harder to me but i see the evolution a year ago it seemed impossible and now , i do see my husband and myself as down in the trenches together having john at an assessment offers such a huge degree of comfort , and a year ago it would have stressed me out we do give each other breaks , we do have different strengths when it comes to the boys i am able to respect this much more already this article gives me something to aim for and i do believe we will get to this point in many many ways , we are already there so thank you twitter , and thank you jim for the inspiration ! ! ! !
