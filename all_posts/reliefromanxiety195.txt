everyone says time is the biggest healer , and in some ways they 're right you can go through therapy and take medication , and even though this may speed the process up , it will still take time for you to improve unfortunately , mental illness is n't a quick fix and throughout everything i 've learnt that time is a great support for me , councelling has been a process of going to the doctors every week and for medication , it took at least four weeks until it began to work cbt also takes a lot of practice too i guess the message is , not to feel disheartened if at first you do n't get the results you want it takes a lot of strength to battle and try to overcome your mental illness and remember that that is an accomplishment in itself in regards to time being a great healer you 'd be surprised at how life can change within a matter of seconds , weeks or months for example , within a few months of cbt and without any medication i managed to catch public transport for this to happen , i needed time it 's been a few years now that i 've been living with this condition and looking back to the first few weeks of severity , time has helped me immensely the aid of therapy and medication has helped a lot too , but at the end it all comes down to time it 's amazing how much i 've accomplished and how i 've improved over these last few months and years one day you may feel the ability to tackle an anxiety provoking task , and that day will come the day will come when it 'll 'click' and you 'll find the strength to attempt it as time passes , your body is working and you 'll discover strengths that you may not have found before small improvements will build up to big accomplishments over the months ahead keep going and remember time will pass , you can improve and persevere ! best wishes , amy xx
