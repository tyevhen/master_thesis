knowing when to stay and try to work things out versus when to end a relationship can be challenging , especially when there have been longstanding problems often , people feel they 've invested so much in the relationship that they want to do everything they can before giving up but , for many of these relationships , both people feel they 've exhausted their internal resources and they do n't know what to do to make things better they might flounder for months or years in an emotional stalemate relationships when to stay and when to go staying for the sake of the children ? many people decide that even though the relationship no longer works for either of them , they will stay together for the sake of the children this rarely works i 've had many adults clients tell me in their psychotherapy sessions that they wish their parents had divorced rather than staying together for the sake of the family usually , they say that they and their siblings sensed that something was wrong between their parents , even though the parents thought they were hiding it well this creates a great deal of tension in the household with the parents attempting to keep their problems a secret and the children feeling confused about what they 're sensing relationships when to go and when to leave staying together for the children ? wanting to escape when things get tough there are those people who tend to want to escape from relationships when things get rough often , they have n't learned the necessary skills to stick with it and work through normal , everyday problems most of the time , these people did n't grow up in families where they saw good communication and problem solving modeled so they 're at loss about what to do relationships when to stay and when to leave escaping when things get tough staying because you 're afraid of being alone other people are on the other end of the spectrum they do n't know when the relationship has run its course they keep trying to salvage the relationship , even when nothing works any more in some cases , they fear being alone in other cases , they do n't want to feel they 've failed in their relationship there can be so many reasons when to stay and when to go staying because you 're afraid of being alone doing some soul searching knowing when to stay or when to go can be daunting it can take a lot of soul searching on your part as well as open and honest communication between you and your partner when to stay and when to go doing some soul searching needless to say , if you 're going to try to work things out , both people must be willing to make the effort getting help when you and your partner are n't sure if the relationship can be salvaged , you could benefit from seeing a couples counselor an experienced couples counselor , who is objective , can help you and your partner sort through the current emotional stalemate to either work things out or end the relationship in an amicable way i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist who sees individuals and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
