lately i 've been reading jaron lanier 's brave new manifesto , you are not a gadget i admire it greatly it takes courage , after all , to stand up in public and say web is dehumanizing it 's a book that goes against the populist information wants to be free grain of the supposedly open world of the web and asks difficult questions , like where all the great new online music has gone will there ever be another beatles ? and what we 're all supposed to do for a living after information is free and google is the only commercially viable aggregator left standing you know it 's going to be an interesting book when you encounter , on the first page of chapter one something started to go wrong with the digital revolution around the turn of the twenty first century the world wide web was flooded by a torrent of petty designs sometimes called web this ideology promotes radical freedom on the surface of the web , but that freedom , ironically , is more for machines than for people nevertheless , it is sometimes referred to as open culture anonymous blog comments , vapid video pranks , and lightweight mashups may seem trivial and harmless , but as a whole , this widespread practice of fragmentary , impersonal communication has demeaned interpersonal interaction lanier 's various laments extend to among other targets popular music culture a retro wasteland of recycled motifs of the s and s , online advertising which he says is elevated by open culture from its previous role as an accelerant and placed at the center of the human universe , and the lack of originality of the open source movement on the latter point , lanier notes sardonically that the crown jewels of the open source world , linux and wikipedia , are little more than finely honed , handcrafted digital tributes to the utterly creaky museum pieces known as unix and encyclopedia britannica let 's suppose that back in the s , lanier remarks , i had said , 'in a quarter century , when the digital revolution has made great progress and computer chips are millions of times faster than they are now , humanity will finally win the prize of being able to write a new encyclopedia and a new version of unix ! ' it would have sounded utterly pathetic i'm not finished reading you are not a gadget i still have pages to go , and still not sure what i think of some of the ideas , but on the whole , i'm glad i'm reading it it 's like a blast of fresh air
