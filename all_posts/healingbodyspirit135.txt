the effects are threefold and involve three inter dependent aspects of their brains and bodies blood sugar , and serotonin and beta endorphin levels when we eat carbohydrates , such as sugars and starches , our blood sugar rises and our bodies release insulin insulin then helps to fuel the body but for children who are sugar sensitive , this careful balance of food and fuel is disrupted blood sugar rises more quickly and reaches higher levels than normal as result , a greater amount of insulin is released , and sugar is absorbed more quickly into our cells this creates that sugar high we 've all felt and it subsequently creates that nasty crash defined by feelings of exhaustion , spaciness , and irritability an important brain chemical affected by sugar is serotonin serotonin is a chemical that quiets the brain , writes desmaisons it is what makes us all have that feeling of well being and peacefulness when a child has low serotonin levels , she feels out of control , depressed , and overwhelmed sugar sensitive children have lower levels of serotonin than other children , adds desmaisons by changing diet , these beneficial levels can be raised , creating more self confident , in control children with a much happier outlook on themselves and the world around them beta endorphins , another brain chemical affected by sugar , are what desmaisons calls , the brain 's own pain killer children who are sugar sensitive are much more sensitive towards both physical and emotional pain trips to the dentist are far more traumatic , and feelings are hurt far more easily than in children who eat less sugar but even more importantly , beta endorphins are strongly associated with self esteem children with normal beta endorphin levels feel confident and secure however , children who eat too much sugar , which heightens these levels , then feel inadequate and unworthy , even if they are smart , once the sugar wears off , writes desmaisons a seven step solution sugar and addiction are strongly linked while not deadly like heroin , writes desmaisons , sugar similarly affects beta endorphin it impacts the same neurochemical system as heroin , although not as intensely and breaking that addiction can be a long and difficult process desmaisons understands that this is a problem faced not just in family 's homes , but at school , and in the world at large she suggests that the best way to approach finding a solution is to first focus on your family and home strive to make change there first , then supply your child with the tools to make healthy and smart food choices when she is out of your care the first true step is to take a look at your and your spouse 's or partner 's diet i 've written four books , and this is the hardest book i 've ever done , says desmaisons of little sugar addicts this is really about the parents and not the children desmaisons suggests keeping a food journal and becoming aware of your role as nutrition model for your children she gives the analogy of an oxygen mask on a distressed airplane in case of an emergency , flight attendants tell us to first administer the oxygen masks to ourselves , then tend to family members or loved ones this advice applies here as well assess your own diet and sugar intake before you take steps to improve your child 's diet desmaisons lays out seven steps to fight sugar and its effects eat breakfast with protein and do it within the first hour of waking , suggests desmaisons , to beat a drop in blood sugar quinoa and millet are high in protein make connections between food and mood never reward a child with food especially sweets change snacks and drinks children under the age of should eat every three hours to prevent a drop in blood sugar in addition to good , well balanced meals , your child should get several high protein snacks throughout the day eat protein lunches foods like cottage cheese , almond butter , fish , and nuts are all essentials shift to whole grain food cut any white flour breads and pastas from your diet take out the sugar notice that taking out sugar is not step one it is step six , writes desmaisons
