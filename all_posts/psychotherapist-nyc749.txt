the title of this blog post want to change ? start by accepting yourself as you are might sound counter intuitive after all , you might say , you ca n't change and remain as you are at the same time but , if you think about this for a moment , you might see that this is n't what i mean the key words in this blog post title is start by accepting the importance of self acceptance what does it mean to accept yourself as you are ? but what do we mean when we talk about accepting who we are ? does this mean we 're complacent and we 're not exploring ways to improve ? does accepting mean we 've given up or we feel hopeless ? not at all ! if anything , it 's just the opposite ! but why ? when we accept ourselves at a certain point in time , we 're acknowledging what is we 're not in denial or pretending that things are different we 're not wallowing in self hatred or calling ourselves a failure because we 're not where we want to be on the contrary , we 're starting at the point where we 're saying , this is where i am right now i 'd like things to be different , and i 'll work towards that goal but , for now , this is where i am why is it so important to accept yourself as you are ? so , you might ask why it 's so important to start by accepting yourself as you are ? well , for one thing , if we want to make changes we need to acknowledge the current situation otherwise , how will we know what we 're changing from ? we need a starting point secondly , very often , when we do n't start by accepting ourselves as we are , we become so negative about ourselves that we sabotage our own efforts to change the voice of negative prediction starts to haunt us you 'll never change you 've tried it before and you failed you 'll fail again because you 're a failure let 's take a common example as part of their new year 's resolutions , many people make a commitment to lose weight one of the obstacles that gets in the way is that people who want to lose weight start out by being very self critical about their body image they berate themselves for being overweight , compare themselves unfavorable to others , and then dwell on all the reasons why they 're not going to succeed this negativity and self criticism sets them up to fail because they get to the point where they say to themselves , why bother ? how much different it is when a person comes from a place of self acceptance instead of being self critical and feeling shame and self loathing , they feel nurturing towards themselves with this positive attitude , they 're much more likely to be nurturing towards themselves , thereby increasing the likelihood that they 'll stick with their healthy weight loss plan self acceptance as part of self care and freeing yourself from old negative patterns self acceptance can be challenging getting to the point of self acceptance can be challenging ingrained negative ways of thinking can be hard to change if you 're struggling to make positive changes , but you 're stuck in old negative patterns , you could benefit from seeing a licensed mental health professional who has expertise in helping clients overcome these obstacles i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr therapist , and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples , and i 've helped many clients overcome obstacles to living a more fulfilling life to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at photo credit creativity timothy k hamilton via photopin cc photo credit alicepopkorn via photopin cc
