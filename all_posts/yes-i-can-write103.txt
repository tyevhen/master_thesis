some people may have noticed that i changed updated sort of made a new page it used to be speaking at and never got any hits last week it 's entitled speaking schedule and information on booking up until recently , my approach to public speaking tended to be more along the lines of oh , yeah , i guess i probably will , if someone asks , so this new page is signifying a change in perspective i 've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the things i like doing , and how i could do them differently , as part of a last ditch attempt to figure out ways to earn some money doing the things i actually enjoy doing , before surrendering completely to the idea of hunting for a real job some of this rethinking will not involve money , but money has been on my mind , as i 've been thinking of how it relates to what i'm doing and want to do , which is something i never really did seriously before i always seemed to have the mostly subconscious idea that the only way to really earn money was through far less fun ways , so those are always what i thought of when it came to money earning tuc definitely a case of what ? um , yeah , i guess ! and , well , in that thinking and rethinking of things , i decided to make it clear that not only will i do public speaking , but i actively want to be doing more public speaking gigs i enjoy it quite a bit , and though stress is often involved , it 's a challenge that i genuinely like so here 's what i have to say on my new public speaking page if you would like me to speak at your event or to your group , please contact me at unschooledwriter gmail com if it 's something local montreal and surrounding area , i'm happy to do q a 's , panels , and or short speeches for only the cost of transportation bus fare , basically , simply because i think it 's important that people learn about unschooling ! however , especially for longer speeches though for the above as well , i prefer to speak on a by attendee donation basis , thus helping to support me and my ability to write , travel , and speak , while still being accessible to everyone who 's interested in hearing what i have to say , regardless of income level receiving a flat fee also works , of course ! i'm very open to discussing and trying hard to make things work for everyone involved i'm also quite happy to travel further afield to speak , with similar views on cost paid transportation , beyond that it 's negotiable contact me ! i do n't know if this will change anything in terms of frequency of public speaking i'm currently discussing speaking in quebec city sometime next month , though i started talking to the organizer in that case before making any changes on the blog , but i felt it was important to at least put it out there to see if anything comes of it comments , questions , advice , suggestions , are , as always , welcome in either the comments or by email ! you might also like idzie is speaking at the rethinking everything unexceptionally exceptional the meaning of success blame unschooling ! talks and magazines linkwithin
