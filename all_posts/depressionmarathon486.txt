well we tried my mom and i did our best to make the best of a trip we never would have taken had the new york city marathon been cancelled immediately after hurricane sandy , as it should have been , but i could n't take it any longer , so we left we were supposed to enjoy new york city for another days , but i woke up tuesday in tears overwhelmed , anxious , and stuck , and as a result we flew home yesterday i 've never been so happy to be home , alone with puck , in my quiet house from the beginning this was a tough and almost immediately disappointing trip the marathon was cancelled a mere hours after our arrival again , had the new york road runners and mayor bloomberg not insisted just one day before that the race would go on , i never would have made the trek worse , the media coverage was incredibly negative i totally understood the backlash , but it really felt like we , the runners , became the bad guys in this whole mess it was very uncomfortable i had no desire to be an extra burden in a city already burdened and chaotic we did our best to stay positive through the closures , the overcrowded subways , and the mess but i grew more and more anxious with each passing day emotionally , i grew more and more fragile i felt stuck in a place in which i had no desire to be the final straw came monday evening when we waited in line for more than hours just to catch a bus home i guess it was then that i broke tuesday morning we decided to go like i said , i woke up in tears we changed our flights from saturday to wednesday ironically , our last day in the city was one of the best i took a fast , tough run through central park , which helped calm me down a bit we rushed to the memorial after we heard it had reopened , and that was amazing we had a nice dinner in times square and then ended our evening with phantom of the opera at the majestic theatre but still , i could n't wait to go thankfully , my travel home went off without a hitch despite another impending storm , my flight took off and landed on time my friend , cindy , graciously picked me up from the airport and brought me home i hugged puck harder than i 've ever hugged him and again broke into tears and then i slept , and slept , and slept this morning , i'm still feeling very fragile i 've been in contact with my social worker and my psychiatrist i'm worried all i want to do is curl up and sleep i need to get back to my life , but i just want to sleep i'm not interested in doing laundry , going to the grocery store , taking puck for a walk , or even going for a run my head hurts i'm tired and i want to sleep this is not a good sign i'm going to try to fight i know curling up and staying in bed will not help , as enticing as that may seem and i know , please know i know , that my problems are minor in comparison to those still suffering out east but , as some of my readers pointed out , this is my blog , and it is about me and what i'm dealing with right now my life is good i will recover but right now , depression is trying to take over i'm in trouble i'm anxious i'm overwhelmed i'm scared i feel fragile , and fragile sucks i'm happy to be home yet i do n't want to move but move i must , or i will lose
