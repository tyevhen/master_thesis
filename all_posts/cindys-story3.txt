sometimes i look in the mirror and i do n't know who i am at that time when death called my name i ended this life had not been my plan i looked down the red flowed from my wrist as my mind shut it 's door with that decision i died that day but somehow you saw me as i sank to the bathroom floor tick , tick , tick what is this that i am moving through ? its was not supposed to be god , you 've done it now ! who am i ? what do you want me to see ? my hands move the blood is not my own someone else had died instead he brings me back touches my scars with his he saved me just as he said sometimes i look in the mirror and i do n't know who i am but he knows me he is my life this life is a part of his plan i look in the mirror and i see his face i stare straight in to his eyes he looks right back with love and grace and i no longer need a disguise i turn from the mirror i bow my head to the one who goes before me his arms wrap around this war torn body as he says i am with you 'till glory !
