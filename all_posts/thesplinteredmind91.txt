i'm not going to complain it was a productive day considering the chaos that went on in my kitchen the problem is the toll it had on me let me explain i'm not a creature of habit as much as i wish , but i have trained myself to write at the kitchen table when i sit there to work , i do n't wander off to watch tv or traipse into the living room to find a good book i work i write blogs , articles , and novels on my macbook at the kitchen table i do design and coding on my mac mini in the studio i even have different apps installed on each machine it works for me sometimes i succumb to the siren call of html and click on certain links you know the kind hot , steamy , sticky news links the more revealing controversial the better as entertaining as that can be , it does n't help me get anything done so i got all geeky on my hosts file last night and locked myself out of my favorite news sites for today 's writing session i was going to pounce on that addaboy ! article like a cat on a mouse and make short work of it i woke up , read news on my iphone yeah , pathetic , then entered the kitchen just as i finished eating , the landlord dropped by i had already missed him earlier this morning when he replaced our garbage disposal now he was back to replace the dish washer i'm not complaining who would complain about getting new kitchen appliances ? not , me but i was colossally unproductive first , i took hours to get going on the article , and then as i began to build up a psuedo momentum the kids came home it was an early out day so my afternoon became feed the kids , ignore the installation noises , deal with the kids , ignore the installation noises , deal with the kids , help the landlord , discipline the kids , ignore the installation noises , troubleshoot photoshop cs os for an hour , troubleshoot the kids , etc the landlord was in and out my kids were in and out my focus was in and out when i finally posted the article for publication in the morn , hours had passed and that did n't count the getting started time when i think of my hourly rate on that article , i cry a little i know what 's at fault it 's adhd as usual , but there 's a part of me mad at myself why did n't i lift up the macbook and move into the living room ? could n't i have done that ? was that so difficult ? apparently , it was i was so focused on focusing that i did n't think creatively i fought with myself throughout the entire day , forcing myself to focus under the present conditions that is both the strength and weakness of adhd 's hyperfocus ability we accomplish goals by hyperfocusing , but we lose awareness of other priorities now it 's pm , and i'm supposed to work on my novel , and i'm mentally fatigued but i'm not complaining i finished the article i just wish that in this i could be more like the productive powerhouses i admire to go from point a to point b without going for a swim with z in the alphabet soup non adhd people tell me all the time oh , everybody has that problem no you do n't i watch you i see your productive lives and your lists of accomplishments i watch you do the things you set out to do i always seem to do the things i did n't set out to do , and every once in a while it discourages me but i'm not complaining
