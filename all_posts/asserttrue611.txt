with all the talk of ajax in yesterday 's blog , i somehow managed to never once talk about xml how ironic is that ? but it turns out that one of the pleasures of doing javascript programming in acrobat is the ease with which you can manipulate xml , thanks to the acrobat interpreter 's built in support for ex if you 're not familiar with ex the ecmascript extensions for xml otherwise known as ecma you really should take time to look into it it 's a very handy grammar for working with xml you 'll find that ex is implemented in spidermonkey gecko 's javascript engine since version and in rhino mozilla 's other javascript engine since version r it 's also supported in actionscript , hence is available in flash cs , adobe air and adobe flex add to that list adobe acrobat how or why would you ever want to use ex in adobe acrobat ? let me give a brief example the other day , i wrote a short script that harvests all of the annotations from a pdf document i wanted to put the data in xml format the script that formats the data as xml looks like this pass this function an array of annotations function getannotationsasxml annots var xmloutput annots annots for var i i annots length i get the properties for each annotation var props annots i getprops add an annot element xmloutput annot start adding child elements var parent xmloutput annot i parent author props author author parent contents props contents contents parent page props page page parent creationdate props creationdate creationdate parent type props type type return xmloutput toxmlstring to test the above code , first open a pdf using acrobat pro that already contains some annotations next , open the javascript console in acrobat control j , copy and paste the code into the console , then add a line use acrojs api call 'getannots' to harvest all annotations getannotationsasxml this getannots highlight select all of the code and execute it in the console by hitting control enter assuming the document you 've got open contains annotations , you should see some xml appear in the console in my case , i got annots annot author admin author contents we need to strike this contents page page creationdate tue jul gmt eastern daylight time creationdate type highlight type annot annot author admin author contents i am underlining this contents page page creationdate tue jul gmt eastern daylight time creationdate type underline type annot annot author admin author contents i liked this contents page page creationdate tue jul gmt eastern daylight time creationdate type highlight type annot annot author admin author contents this does not seem right contents page page creationdate tue jul gmt eastern daylight time creationdate type text type annot annot author admin author contents is this the correct copyright date ? contents page page creationdate tue jul gmt eastern daylight time creationdate type highlight type annot annots of course , there are many more properties on annotations than i 've captured here but you get the idea not bad for a dozen lines of code sure beats messing around with dom methods , dom serialization , etc
