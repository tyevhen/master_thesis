the sore throat and aches i was experiencing on monday have strangely hung around this week it 's weird i feel better overall i have more energy for running and work , but i have also been having attacks of fatigue that knock me flat and every time i think my throat is no longer sore , i feel soreness i do n't remember having any soreness when i got up this morning , but my right tonsil is swollen and sore now it 's weird i saw my psychiatrist today we talked about the fatigue , but she 's hesitant to change any medications i understand that , and i agree with that neither of us want me to go through another depressive episode anytime soon we also talked about work restrictions i 've been handling the hour shifts pretty well , so i'm going to begin working hour shifts now i'm looking forward to the opportunity to work more i signed up for my local marathon yesterday my miler went well over the weekend , and my runs this week have been good , so i figured , why not ? i'm going to use it as a training run for grandmas marathon in june the mile mark is just down the street from my home , so if things are n't going well , i can always walk off the course and come home if i'm doing okay , i 'll go ahead and finish the race is memorial day weekend , so i'm officially tapering again i'm hoping for good weather and a good run i do n't have anything else going on right now , and that 's a good thing quiet and drama free is exactly how i want to live i so appreciate when my mood is good and life is moving along smoothly i'm living gratefully today
