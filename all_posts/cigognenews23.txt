a hospital back east has just come up with an idea to save and change lives an idea so simple it is brilliant they have founded the cuddlers club where people volunteer to cuddle babies , kiss and caress them while the mother is gone they are first trained on what and how to do it and then they are given a baby to hold and sing to it aids general development , general health , and enhanced brain development newborns need all this immediately in life , not years later isn t it ten times more valuable then letting babies rot alone in a hospital bed ? even at our age , wouldn t we want comfort and company when we go to hospital ? why not a baby who is first learning to react to others and to feel their love and comfort above all , he senses and feels he is not alone and abandoned how else could he react ? i have seen so many patients who relive being very young and left along in a hospital and they are terrified , to say nothing of sudden death syndrome , where babies die from fright on being abandoned , left in the dark without human succor , feeling isolated with no help anywhere why can t we understand their fright when they are just coming into a new world and have no idea what that world is about ? they cannot ask for help but they can feel terribly frightened they have no words to express themselves and since we live in a world of language , it is beyond our comprehension there is a way to give them a primitive language which i shall discuss elsewhere but their needs are for closeness and physical reassurance a smiling soft face and voice they need love in the language they speak holding , touch and kisses they need protection and when they do not get it , we find the beginning of an imprint of never feeling safe it is a basic low level terror that we do not see but the child cries all of the time , is chronically timid and skittish his first reaction is to withdraw , not see out and approach he is imprinted with passivity and lethargy he cannot smile fully because it is layered over with terror remember , there is a critical period when imprints take hold because the need is at is asymptote the need for caress above all caresses years later through compulsive sex won t fill the bill it is far too late but the need lingers on and dogs us all of our lives is he a sex addict ? no he is a need addict where lack of fulfillment is a constant reminder of what is missing i have seen patients who are compulsive sexers one woman got high blood pressure when she could not have sex compulsive anything informs us of what has gone missing early on even the search of fame and adoration can begin very early on when the child was not cuddled and adored at age thirty he needs it desperately and he gets it symbolically from applause but it is symbolic so never fulfilling and then he needs it more and more now add to this indifferent cold parents who never touched the child , never cherished him , and were never physically close to him the need is compounded and becomes more importuning he now brags and makes himself important because the parents never could he is trailed by his exploits that he has invented where he is the best , most talented and adored trapped by figments of his imagination they love me all this the hospital knows to avoid bravo , bravo to them they are setting the stage for normal healthy children who could do better ? the babies get physical care but too often what is neglected is their emotional life some hospitals have figured it out and what is more they give a chance for women who have lost their baby to again love a child wonderful
