i forget where and when i 've heard his name before , but when i got to the airport and picked up something to read on the plane , my thalamus filtered down onto fast company 's cover article what if you never forgot anything ? use acces code fcnoveng on microsoft 's gordon bell , ringing a bell in my head the bell ringing was attached to other dimly recalled bits xanadu or something like that ed it 's memex , a guy from the 's what is his name ed vannevar bush ? i wish bwi had free internet access so i could google it , and past articles i 've read about neurocomputer interfaces the article is about this brilliant microsoft researcher who has spent the last years recording every single interaction he has conversations , phone calls , emails , faxes , paper documents you name it he accumulates an average or over a megabyte per hour , a gigabyte per month he 's obviously not keeping any video but he does snap a photo every seconds why ? it 's an experiment in computer assisted human memory , or maybe call it memory augmentation it 's a log of your life , or a lifelog editor mark vamos would miss the ability to forget those memories which evoke embarrassment or regret , but the delete key or hard drive failure could take care of that okay it came back to me as i read the article i 've been to his website before mylifebits when i saw something about this a few years ago i can see the utility of something like this well , the challenge with this sort of thing which , i must say , is pretty cool is not in doing it it lies in the ability to search the info searching text easy , audio harder , and images harder still while also being about to easily access and efficiently use associated data and metadata if you want to start your own mylifebits experiment , writer clive thompson includes a item shopping list use acces code fcnoveng so , i'm thinking about the impact this would have on psychiatry now i'm putting myself in the patient 's place recorders blaring , i could easily review my therapy session and get more bang for my emotional buck if my therapist flogged too flog lifelog i'm still on the plane so i cannot google flog , but i'm sure that i ca n't be the first to coin this term , i could tap into her system and see my reactions from her perspective , maybe in a picture in picture sorta deal some quotes frank nack 'i'm a big fan of forgetting i do n't want to be reminded of everything i said ' forgetting is key to cultural concepts like forgiveness and nostalgia knowing that everything is being logged might actually turn us into different people we might be less flamboyant , less funny , less willing to say risky but potentially useful things if you lose your keys , you can scroll back and figure out where you put 'em but the real goal is to 'discover things that even you did n't know that you knew ' in spring , gemmel lost a chunk of his memory his hard drive crashed , and he had n't backed up in four months when he got his mylifebits back up and running , the hole that had been punched in his memories was palpable , even painful the article also reviews experimental software which mines the data in gordon 's lifebits it associates unexpected ideas based on past memories , recalls long forgotten bits at just the right time , and creates new information , connections , and ideas buried in your flogs like a good therapist this could put quite a few therapists out of business but it would also open up a whole new area of psychotherapy lifelog assisted psychotherapy flog therapy ? this could only develop after folks have flogged quite a bit of their life , i would think so the therapist would become a sort of guide , teaching folks new , psychodynamically informed methods of mining their flogs and tapping into their unconscious well , i guess i 've gone out on a limb here but probably not much further than i did in reality therapy vlog the flight attendant is making us put our portable electronic devices away and place our tray tables in their upright , locked , position if i had my flogging equipment , i 'd show you all her picture looks kinda like bjork , very cute and you could hear her admonish the guy in front of me who was refusing to turn off his ipod alas , it will all be a dim memory in a few weeks gotta go blogged with flock
