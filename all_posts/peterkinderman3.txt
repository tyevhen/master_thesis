of course they were not walker went on to state very clearly that we can talk about medical solutions to mental health problems , and of course medicine has a part to play in reality , however , society has the biggest part to play this is society s problem james morris mp made a similar point we must also examine whether our approach to tackling the problem is fit and appropriate for the st century our approach to mental illness over a number of decades has been based on what i would call the psychiatric model the model has medicalised mental illness and treated it as something to be dealt with using drug based therapies it is clear that someone who has been made suddenly unemployed might feel miserable and hopeless as a result research , including research conducted here in liverpool , backs this up the greek ministry of health has reported a increase in deaths from suicide over the same timescale and our colleagues ben barr and david taylor robinson have demonstrated how deaths here in the uk can be specifically attributed to the economic crisis this has several profound implications it means that our psychological well being is as much a problem for politicians as for health professionals and it means we need to think differently about mental health itself it s obvious how the economic downturn could affect our mental health it s clear that someone who has been made suddenly unemployed might feel miserable and hopeless as a result these feelings might be so bad that they begin to interfere with other aspects of that person s life , and it may be that they would benefit from some kind of professional help and support but it makes little sense to describe their distress as an illness or a disorder and we need to apply social and psychological not medical solutions this means focussing on prevention and early intervention , on a life course approach and reducing inequality and tackling stigma our thoughts , our emotions , our behaviour , and therefore our mental health , is largely dependent on our understanding of the world our thoughts about ourselves , other people and the future our thoughts , our emotions , our behaviour , and therefore our mental health , is largely dependent on our understanding of the world , our thoughts about ourselves , other people and the future biological factors , social factors , circumstantial factors our learning as human beings affect us as those external factors impact on the key psychological processes that help us build up our sense of who we are and the way the world works good mental health is a consequence of how we make sense of and understand the world , primarily our social world and how we make sense of and understand the world is largely determined by our experiences and upbringing mental health services should be designed and commissioned to that end we should simply drop the language of disorder and think about we can help people fulfil their potential and maximise their personal well being a more rational and humane approach that means working with our medical colleagues , of course , but it means we should be commissioning and delivering much more fully integrated services we should be linking with jobcentre plus employment advisers who are delivering what are effectively wellbeing interventions for people we should be working with the education services and we should be working with the physical health services we should be working with employers , there s plenty of evidence that interventions aimed at improving people s wellbeing , not curing their mental illnesses but improving people s wellbeing is productive for employers evidence based psychological therapies will be a key part of this picture , but we need a much more thorough going psychosocial revolution in mental health care it s great that mental health is back in the news and discussed in more positive terms than ever before this is an opportunity not only to press for greater understanding and investment in science and care , but also to argue for a more rational and humane approach to the problem
