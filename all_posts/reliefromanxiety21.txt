i can just her my mother 's words ringing in my ears it all comes out in the wash and i guess it does right now i have just finished university and for the first time in my life i do n't have a set plan because of my anxiety , i like to be sure that everything is in control and so i know what to expect , but currently i only have a very loose plan ! at the moment i am taking it day by day and slowly forging my future it 's hard because i feel that i'm in a race against time , knowing how fast life can pass you by but at the same time not everything can be achieved in an instant and things can take time looking back at my mental health journey , it has been extremely tough and still can be but focusing on the present , it 's strange to see how everything has come together it 's almost as if mum was right to say that everything comes out in the wash even though i can still get panic attacks , anxiety and depression , i am a world away from the severity that it once was many years ago at that time i did n't think that i would live to see the next day , let alone ever get better and yet years later i am in a much better place and achieving the things that i want to , even if i do find it harder than others it 's almost as if it 's beginning to come out in the wash now after university i am in a place of uncertainty and it is scary because for the first time ever i do n't have a set plan but just like my mental health journey , i'm hoping with hard work , help and determination it will all fall into place i'm not expecting it to be easy or straightforward but it can just happen that things we never think we are going to get through or are n't working out , may do just that it 's about taking things day by day and looking at how much you have already achieved it will come together in one way or another amy xx
