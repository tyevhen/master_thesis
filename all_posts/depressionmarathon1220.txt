i am leaving for colorado today i 've never been there before , believe it or not ! i am fortunate to have friends who own two family cabins in northern colorado , and who like me enough to invite me to their annual family gathering ! we are driving out , which will also be really nice i love road trips , especially if i do n't have to drive ! i am packed and ready to go of course , i must admit my ridiculous worries about going that they 'll hate me after spending an entire week with me there is some precedence , i am sad to say , for this fear but i have to remind myself i am all growed up now ! i am a different person than i used to be , and my friends are also long in recovery , so should be a healthier trip all the way around but those old fears still creep in i hate that ! i hate when those old fears crop up despite all of the work i 've done throughout the past several years i have to diligently guard myself from those old , destructive thoughts i picture the thoughts like annoying gnats buzzing around my head when i hear them buzz , i squish them flat with my gnat crushing fly swatter feels good to give 'em a good wallop if i'm really into it , i can even hear them pathetically screaming just before their final whack ! dead , sad , no longer destructive gnats ! i'm tucking that swatter in my pack , but hopefully the air , food , fishing and company will stifle those gnats before they 're able to take flight have a great week , everyone !
