what i value in life are connections connections to the humans around me , connections to the other non human animals , to the land , wind , water connections to the food i eat , to how and where it was grown , to how it was cooked connections to my health , to the medicines i take sure , i may watch a few tv shows , i may wander around the internet , but those things have a disconnect about them a passivity and distance to them they 're not fulfilling to me on a deeper lever and that 's what i mean when i talk about connections , and why i can tell people , in all honesty , all i need to be happy , truly happy , is clean water to drink , food that is n't poisoned , a whole and healthy land base , and a supportive , loving community that 's all i need all i want i 've been thinking about this a lot , since i 've realized how much i enjoy , and always have enjoyed , living as much outside of the commercialized consumerist lifestyle as i can i adore wonderful thrift store finds , warm wool sweaters and worn jeans , love going to local farmers markets and picking out fresh produce , or , even better , harvesting our own homegrown vegetables and herbs and this is far from a new thing ! this did n't come from when my views got more radical when i was a child , for years i was absolutely obsessed with pioneers yes , i now have very different opinions on those individuals who took over land already being lived on by aboriginal peoples , but , well , i was a kid , and those thoughts never crossed my mind i would dress in period garb , read anything , both fiction and non fiction , about pioneers that i could get my hands on , and all of that jazz but even more then that , we made our own candles our own lanterns for them i sewed and embroidered things myself in the great ice storm of ' , i was positively thrilled when the power went off ! then , as now , our main source of heat was the wood stove , so we really did n't suffer much , unlike so many other people we cooked on the wood stove , heated water there for our baths , which then had to be lugged upstairs to the bathroom burned candles for light when it got dark i loved it ! that 's what i mean when i say connections that joy , warmth , and fulfillment that comes not from purchased things , not from experts , but from all the little connections to the little things , that make life feel good to be intimately acquainted to all aspects of your life , and as an extension of that , all aspects of the community as a whole that 's my dream , my ideal , and my vision for how i want to live my life , and the world i want to help create or , more accurately , help to re discover i ca n't think of any better way to live than that ! peace , idzie you might also like building life on a foundation of untamed learning green anarchy anti civilization , and what that means earth day linkwithin
