i saw the psychiatrist last week and he has reduced my sertraline from mg to mg because i am having too many hypo episodes i have been taking the lower dose for about days i feel quite empty and possibly a little depressed i wonder if it s the change in medication or whether i am just cycling not even sure if i am just in a normal mood or slightly low i do n't think i know what normal is like anymore i am still takng the quetiapine and have no plans to reduce that ever ! ! i am feeling quite fed up and almost want o be hypo again ! i'm just really fed up with it all at the moment
