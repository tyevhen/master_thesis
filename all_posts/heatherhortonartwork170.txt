this is the second portrait of jade that i just completed i really wanted to paint a pregnant woman they are truly beautiful and i wanted to try to capture that at the same time i also wanted to imbue a tension or almost apprehension in the piece i wanted the concept of waiting to be obvious but also subtle could she also be waiting for something or someone else besides the baby ? you probably ca n't tell , but she is in the elevator of her building where she lives there was a mirror on the wall on the left but it was creating weird shapes and i found it distracting i would rather create a bit of interest with the texture and brushstrokes than have a shape that is annoying in there besides , i wanted more weight , literally and figuratively on the right hand side with the figure the railings in the elevator help to hopefully draw the eye in to jade as well as usual , i like to ask questions within my work and encourage viewers to ask them as well no offense to anne geddes , but you wo n't be seeing any paintings of children with halos of sunflower petals any time soon this piece is x , oil on wood panel it took about hours to complete i would guess i found i could say things with color and shapes that i could n't say any other way things i had no words for georgia o'keefe
