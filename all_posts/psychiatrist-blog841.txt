jesse went to prison for hopping a train to providence without paying another episode for clinkshrink ! he 's back in paul 's office with his dad , and dad does n't have much use for shrinks he tells paul he should have been a plumber and now that he and jesse are cool , jesse does n't need to come paul talks to jesse alone he implores jesse to stay in treatment , and he puts it in terms of how he cares for jesse and how jesse will lose the gains he made to watch paul , leaving therapy is a catastrophic event , one that warrants blowing a few cerebral blood vessels it 's a do or die deal for once , could paul just say , i'm glad this has been helpful to you i think there are still issues to address and it could continue to be helpful to you if you need me , please do call
