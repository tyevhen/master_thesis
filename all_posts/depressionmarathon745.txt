if you 've been following along , you know my brain has been a bit off lately first i had screwed up thinking that was followed by a precipitous dive in my mood , which scared the crap out of me ! well , i'm feeling a tiny bit better my thinking has cleared , and my mood has elevated slightly , but it 's still low it 's nice not having screwed up , racing , nor intrusive thoughts , but my low mood is disturbing like i said , it is a little better but of course i want it to be all better i find i'm growing more impatient with these low mood episodes actually , my doctor pointed that out to me she said she sensed i had an urgency to get through this she was right i was in a bit of panic mode , which was not helping at all ! i'm not sure what the urgency is about cognitively , i know this episode will pass they always have in the past , and there is no reason to think this time will be any different i know that yet i was pressuring myself to get better immediately and i was fearful that if i did n't get better immediately , something big and tragic would happen strange my tolerance for feeling low seems to have decreased dramatically i was feeling worried and shameful about that , but my psychologist put a positive spin on it for me she said it made sense that i 'd be more intolerant , as i spend much more time feeling good , rather than bad , these days hmmm i think she 's on to something feeling low is the exception rather than the rule now that is a nice thought this too shall pass
