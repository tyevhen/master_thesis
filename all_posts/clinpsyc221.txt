in the you 're kidding me category , we have a report from forbes that abilify aripiprazole is going to be going up for fda priority review as a depression treatment i was able to track down exactly one placebo controlled study using this drug as an antidepressant participants who did not show satisfactory response to an antidepressant trial were assigned to receive either abilify or a placebo in addition to their antidepressant as you 'll see , this was a study worthy of close examination study results i read the study results and was underwhelmed the authors via their ghostwriters to some unknown extent reported that the difference between those receiving add on abilify vs add on placebo was three points on the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs for perspective , the madrs has questions , each rated from zero to six so suppose three of those ten questions show an improvement of one point each whoopee but keep reading it becomes bizarre study design patients were initially assigned to receive an antidepressant plus a placebo for eight weeks those who failed to respond to treatment were assigned to abilify antidepressant or placebo antidepressant those who responded during the initial weeks were then eliminated from the study so we 've already established that antidepressant placebo did n't work for these people yet they were then assigned to treatment for weeks with the same treatment ! and compared to those who were assigned antidepressant abilify so the antidepressant placebo group started at a huge disadvantage because it was already established that they did not respond well to such a treatment regimen no wonder abilify came out on top albeit by a modest margin here 's an analogy a group of students is assigned to be tutored by tutor a regarding math the students are all tutored for weeks the students whose math skills improve are sent on their merry way that leaves students who did not improve under tutor a 's tutelage so tutor b comes along to tutor of these students , while tutor a sticks with of them tutor b 's students do somewhat better than tutor a 's students on a math test weeks later is tutor b better than tutor a ? not really a fair comparison between tutor a and tutor b , is it ? ghostwriter watch yep , the study acknowledged editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript was provided by ogilvy healthworld medical education funding was provided by bristol myers squibb co of the study authors , all but one were employees of bms or otsuka which is also involved in marketing abilify unless bms is hiding data somewhere , this is hardly the stuff breakthrough treatments are made of not that the fda has a history for expecting much in terms of efficacy , but seriously can we have a study without a ridiculously biased design before we jump on the abilify for depression bandwagon ? oh , the wonders of evidence based medicine this one reminds me of the arise rd study for risperdal as a depression treatment update i forgot to mention that this is not the first time i 've been puzzled by abilify 's claims for information on how abilify is supposedly a great long term treatment for bipolar disorder , you really have to get the story from furious seasons , who had a great post on the topic in december get ready for more flimsy evidence from bms
