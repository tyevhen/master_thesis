is it just me or have you noticed an increase in high conflict parents in your school ? not too long ago , i was walking through the front office and a parent with three small children in tow came flying through the front office door demanding to see the principal the secretary regretfully told the parent that the principal was out of the building and asked if she could help the parent was very cross and informed the secretary that she wanted to see someone now ! ! feeling really uncomfortable , i walked out of the office and toward the counseling suite as i was walking down the hall , one of our administrators asked the parent to step in another office to talk about the issue on the way to that office , i heard the parent shout that the school was mistreating her child and she wanted something done about it today ! as the assistant principal was trying to explain the reason for the student 's discipline , the parent started hurling expletives in front of her children and everyone else in the office at this point , i am asking myself what made this parent so irate that she would lose all sense of civility ? in my school , i have definitely noticed an increase in bad behavior in parents students' bad behavior i understand , but parents ? what could be the explanation for this rise of incivility in schools ?
