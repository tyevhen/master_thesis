it may come as a shock to you as it did to me to discover that most of what you know about the stock market crash is wrong people lined up outside the stock exchange to get updates on the october ticker , which ran as much as four hours behind the crash was not much of a crash , for example , and it did not cause the great depression stocks were not overvalued the market 's p e was just , and margin buying while certainly a factor in the rate of decline was not the cause of the crash people did not jump off of buildings after losing their life savings the myths go on and on but they 're just that myths let 's take some of the myths one by one the crash how big was it ? the largest one day move , black monday october , , was a drop of , followed a day later black tuesday by a drop of what 's seldom reported is that the day after black tuesday , the market went right back up , finishing at dow jones industrial average black monday and black tuesday date change change close october , october , but surely was a down year ? yes , it was the dow was down from the start of the year to the last day of trading but considering the fact that the market was up almost the previous year , a drop of is hardly upsetting we constantly read that billions were lost in but even more billions were gained in did the crash cause the great depression ? it 's hard to see how the crash october saw the dow fall in a single day the u s economy was vibrant compared to in the years leading to , gdp had increased by , while inflation was near zero short term interest rates fluctuated between and the federal budget ran a surplus in and if anything , the crash should have caused a depression yet it did n't did n't people jump off of buildings ? actually , no i could find no substantiated accounts of this , except for winston churchill 's account of one incident was n't the crash caused by margin buying ? it 's true that prior to , you could legally borrow money from a bank for the purpose of investing in the stock market however , in february the fed outlawed margin borrowing from banks , which means that by october the only way to obtain margin was from a brokerage , directly and brokerages were conservative about this back then , as now , requiring coverage note that no large brokerages went bankrupt in brokers' loans , in , totalled around billion , less than of the combined value of all stocks so all the nonsense you 've read about shoe shine boys speculating in stocks , using margin , is mostly that nonsense joseph kennedy famously got out of the market pre crash when he realized that shoe shine boys were talking investment strategy however , i find this story fishy anyone attempting to make a living shining shoes on wall street would naturally develop a certain fluency in stock talk it 's just good business it is true that certain investment trusts forerunners of today 's hedge funds , prior to , borrowed a significant amount of money to speculate in the market the fed 's february edict was aimed at halting such activity what , then , was the crash about ? it was actually a classic tech bubble electricity was the high tech of the era stocks like rca with a p e ratio in the s and edison electric illuminating company of boston with a share price of were the google and priceline of their day electrification was still in its infancy , of course as late as , less than of rural america had electric power but bright lights had come to the major cities , where scores of power companies , as yet largely unregulated , made huge profits in local markets , often operating without competition electric utilities were seen by many as having an almost magical ability to mint money accordingly , utility stocks had the highest p es , as a group , ran up the most prior to the crash , and went down more than any other group after the crash read an excellent analysis here the importance of the utility sector in the crash is underscored by the fact that utility company shares often sold at more than times book value utility shares were largely owned by investment trusts investment trusts sold their shares at a substantial premium to underlying holdings investment trusts often purchased utility shares with borrowed money investors used margin to buy into investment trusts thus , hidden leverage compounded the utility sector 's woes when the high flying utiliy sector finally went down , contagion ensued ironically , some historians have suggested that the lack of stricter fed control over monies flowing into the markets played a role in making the crash possible but it 's equally possible aggressive fed action is what actually triggered the crash one of herbert hoover 's first actions as president , in early , was to pressure secretary of the treasury andrew mellon and governor of the federal reserve board roy young to strangle the speculative movement in his memoirs , hoover titled his chapter we attempt to stop the orgy of speculation milton friedman has said and he may actually be right that a contracting money supply after is what ultimately triggered the run of bank failures that led to the great depression which quickly spread around the world due to rigid adherence to the gold standard but the real lesson of is that lack of transparency in investment trust finances , particularly , coupled with non real time dissemination of market information through newspapers , and tickers that ran four hours behind , plus copious amounts of hidden leverage concentrated in one high flying sector , can do nothing good for a market that 's in bubble mode one wonders if we 've learned some of these lessons , even now the crash of says we have n't i 've made some improvements to my twitter timeline scraping code and can now thank even more people for retweeting me the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might still not be complete , but it 's more complete than it would have been with my old code in any case , you should get busy following the folks shown below they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links if you enjoyed this post , wo n't you pass the link along on social media ?
