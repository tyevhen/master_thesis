i forwarded this email to bell 's executive office of consumer relations now is this even a hoity toity title or what ? after a week all i had received as a response was their automated reply which said to go through channels i sent a second email to this office to advise them that thank you for not providing any response that addresses the matter i have contacted a representative that referred the matter to you i can only assume you condone the behaviour of your representative and will therefore not mind that i have posted this email on my facebook , twitter and blog now many can see the quality of responses provided by bell and they can choose to go with another company as well for the record , it has been well over a week since i sent this second missive and still no response i can only assume i was right thanks for reading you might also like pet peeves , or things that annoy me collection agencies luck not a changing linkwithin
