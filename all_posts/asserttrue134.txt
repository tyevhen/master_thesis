suddenly it 's not looking good for common core in a broad based populist uprising , parents in the state of new york this week pushed back hard on standardized testing the tests in question are all based on common core jaun gonzalez writes in the new york daily news at west seneca district near buffalo , nearly of some , students refused testing likewise , at tiny southold school district on long island s north fork , of the students opted out so did of rockville centre s , pupils and in the westchester town of ossining , nearly of , students boycotted at the patchogue medford school district in suffolk county , of , students in grades three to eight abstained from the test in westchester , former republican gubernatorial candidate rob astorino refused to allow two of his children to take the test today , sheila and i join over , parents across new york in opting our children out of the common core tests , astorino said in a statement the new york daily news again conservatives like astorino have formed an unusual alliance with liberal education advocates who claim the test , developed by pearson plc , does nothing to help assess students they re secret , you can t even discuss the contents of the test with anyone , said william cala , superintendent of fairport central school district outside rochester , where of students boycotted the test tuesday what 's interesting is that conservatives and liberals have joined together to push back on common core testing , which puts hillary clinton in a bit of a bind while she has studiously avoided endorsing common core explicitly , clinton nonetheless has praised teacher groups who support it and has indirectly endorsed common core as recently as last week beyond that , the clintons are well known to favor a top down , federalist approach to public education clinton 's ties to teacher 's unions are well known , and many teachers now have their pay tied to standardized test outcomes , so it will be interesting to see how hillary backpedals her way out of this one common core has been billed as a state led initiative , but in fact these are national standards , created by gates funded consultants for the national governors association nga states were coerced into adopting the common core by requirements attached to federal race to the top grants and , later , the no child left behind waivers nclb required states to adopt rigorous curriculum standards and test students annually to assess progress under the threat of losing federal funds , all states adopted or revised their standards and began testing every student , every year in every grade , from and again in high school before nclb , only states tested all kids every year , after nclb all did but many now consider nclb a dismal failure in both raising academic performance and narrowing gaps in opportunity and outcomes nclb mainly succeeded in creating a narrative of failure that led to a decade of attempts to fix schools while blaming those who work in them by the time the first decade of nclb was over , more than half the schools in the united states were on the lists of failing schools common core picks up where nclb left off , further intensifying the divisive debate over top down curricula and the channelling of students and teachers into success tracks and failure tracks from the looks of things , clinton will now have to distance herself from common core and quickly , or face the wrath of parents of all political stripes , who have rejected core based standardized tests as onerous and manipulative your move , hillary addendum the brouhaha over l a schools pushing back on ipads may conceal a larger issue the ipads are basically a delivery vehicle for common core , which in turn is a major pearson profit driver by the looks of things , the whole common core mess is exploding in pearson 's face , with apple now caught in the middle tired of lies and half truths about mental illness ?
