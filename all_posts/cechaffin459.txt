i may not be blogging for a couple of days in the tangle of wires leading to my easy chair i got my leg trapped yesterday , and in ripping away a cord i also dislodged my dial up port for getting online i'm at a cafe with wireless today , but none of the financial tasks kathleen so nicely listed for me can be done , due to the lack of this or that information this is much like yesterday , when i got a manuscript mailed off with some difficulty but did nothing else some days are like that in mexico it was doubly so if i awoke and made one phone call and the person did n't answer , it was almost a guarantee that i would connect with no one and nothing that day , so that it was better to lounge somewhere with neruda and a margarita when strangely , those whom i was supposed to meet would somehow run into me , and other things would get done , or not , but at least i was in the flow by giving up to the flow when all connects , a friend of mine calls it shredding a term derived from his being a short order cook , when the orders and the food came flying out in a perfect dervish of effort i call this connection of desire and action with life the river of kairos kairos being the greek term used for the birth of christ in the fullness of time , or at the right time when you 're in the kairos slot everything leads to everything else inexorably and you are drawn through the necessary connections as in a dream when you are out of kairos , or stuck in kronos , the greek word for measured time , you will spin your wheels and never get a thing done spinning my wheels allowed me to blog , since i could n't do anything else no matter how i tried maybe that means this is what i was supposed to do the sonnet below expresses this difficulty more succinctly the phrase and so it goes is taken both from vonnegut 's slaughterhouse five and marquez 's one hundred years of solitude and so it goes we all have them days when nothing clicks , tab 'a' wo n't fit slot 'b' all your calls find only message machines you cannot fix the toilet without a part your engine stalls you fear it might be going , too it 's not that you 're not trying , you 're trying with all your heart but this is not the day to try the knot of kairos wo n't unravel you 've done your part and that is all you can do no results are results , too you know what 's not permitted to be realized today you 're so bull headed that it took a lot to grant your head banging a brief stay you 're from the west , convinced you can impose your will on randomness and so it goes rodent neutral , craig erick
