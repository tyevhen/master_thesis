i'm on a lot of meds i owe my shrink a lot of money i really , really need to start seeing an add coach so i can structure my job search but i ca n't quite scrape the money together i have dyscalculia , so i really , really need a checkbook with carbon duplicates unlike all the other checkbooks which my bank offers for free , duplicate checks checks cost no , is n't ton of money but then , i do n't have a ton of money and it 's just frustrating that i have to pay for adaptive tech that other people do n't need to worry about maybe i 'll just give up on the duplicates and rely on my online statements
