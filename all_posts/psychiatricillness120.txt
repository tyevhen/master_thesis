the week before last i was at the gym every night my mood was not particulary high but i was feeling fat and frumpy and thought the exercise might help by last week i stopped the gym each night i could not get up to go to work in the mornings so getting to work late meant i had to stay late to get the work done i spoke to my boss yesterday and discussed working at home for some of the time this week just to get life back on track he agreed without any resistence , he just asked me to make an appointment with occupational health as a follow up the thing is though , have i just got behind at work because i have been staying up late at night my mood has got worse because i have not been eating properly and i'm just over tired and a bit fed up or have i got myself into a hole because my moods were not stable in the first place i wonder if i just hide behind my diagnosis as it is easier than sorting my life out everyone has moods and i am just wondering if i suffer anymore than anyone else i have a comfy job , working from home of the time right now i feel really lucky i feel a bit worried about taking advantage and using my illness as an excuse for poor performance at work i have also been wondering about diagnosis , is there really anything wrong with me do i just make too much fuss about small fluctuations in my mood or do i really need to be aware of my moods and manage them i'm so pissed off with this label , if you are told you are sick in the head and your thoughts are distorted how are you ever suppose to trust anything you think again ! justbeing given this label is enough to screw you up for life even if you are perfectly well ! ! ! i think i spend too much time analysing my moods and just need to let go i really fear being psychotic again though ! why oh why is this happening to me ! ! ! ! ! !
