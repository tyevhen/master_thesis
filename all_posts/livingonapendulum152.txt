there are some things about my kids that i hate , absolutely hate when they do these things it puts me in this horrible frame of mind i just want to punch the living daylights out of them one of them is when they throw a temper tantrum and lose total patience and start being unacceptably rude to others , just because things are not going their way you know what the biggest problem about all of that is ? if i am perfectly honest ? and with you all i must be they get that from me i do n't know if it 's innate , or if i taught this totally unacceptable behaviour to them , maybe it 's a bit of both but it 's ugly and thoroughly unpleasant to live with it 's the whole violence , in actions and in words that is barely leashed the swearing and bitching and insults flung about throwing things here and there smashing things i have worked very very hard at controlling it in the last few years it 's not pretty and i have to stop subjecting those around me to it however , it pisses me completely off when i see my kids do it , and they do , some more often than others can someone tell me why i have such a hard time accepting the faults in my kids that are my own ? why do i expect them to be so much better than me ? thanks for reading ! feel free to comment i fixed the comment options you might also like visit to the emergency being careful do you believe in ghosts ? linkwithin
