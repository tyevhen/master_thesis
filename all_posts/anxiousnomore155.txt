new year , clean slate , fresh look sorry i did not write over break , my computer broke and i had no internet access it s nice to get in touch with the world again happy new year ! what an amazing feeling to know that you have a whole new year to start over as natasha beddingfield says , today is where your book begins , the rest is still unwritten i am sure you have all made new year s resolutions by now and i hope you are staying positive and motivated just a tip , make realistic goals and not too many of them i looked back on my resolutions and saw that one was to get over my stomach anxiety and to gain weight this made me reflect on everything i have been through this past year and helped me to realize just how much i have accomplished i have learned so much about anxiety , phobias , etc and hopefully my journey has helped others to find hope and motivation as well i may never get over my anxiety , but i have learned tools to help me manage it which has helped me to heal , grow stronger in my self esteem , and have a happier life sure there are setbacks and bad days where i am not panic free , but i will take today over last january any day the holiday break was extremely helpful for my fried emotions i did nothing i sat around all day long in my pjs make up free and watched tv , sewed , and more tv today i may be back at work , but i am more relaxed , more patient , and it feels good i often need to take a day off from work for this purpose only what are my resolutions ? besides the obvious baby parenting ones , all of my goals revolve around finding and bringing more peace into my life by forming good habits i want to get back into yoga and keep it up consistently it helps me to stay relaxed and calm more often when i do it regularly , but it s hard to make time for it when i get home from work and am tired and just want to sleep so i want to work on that i want to find a way to stay at peace at work whether it s just remembering the light at the end of the tunnel , or finding remembering a mantra ex happiness happens inside of you , not to you something to help me not pull my hair out and cry everyday i want to add more spirituality to my life reading my scriptures , prayer , stuff like that so it all equals more peace what are some of your new year s resolutions ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like celebrate i can only imagine new year 's resolutions new year 's resolutions my year linkwithin
