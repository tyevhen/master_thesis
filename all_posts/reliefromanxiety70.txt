an anxious comedian attempts to talk about it public speaking is terrifying all my life , it 's been one of my worst fears and as someone who has also lived with anxiety for much of my life , that 's saying a lot but it was also something i 've always been drawn towards this poses a problem if i do n't get up on stage and speak or do standup comedy , i feel weak and pathetic for being too scared to do something i want to do but if i do , then i have to face my fear of public speaking in the end , i decided if i was going to suffer either way , i might as well do the thing rather than sitting around miserably wishing i had for years , this was the arrangement i 'd get up on stage , make jokes , have fun but one thing remained off limits talking publicly about my anxiety this added to the pain my anxiousness caused me i was too scared of it to even talk about it partly , i think i subconsciously believed that talking aloud about anxiety even only acknowledging its existence could somehow make it stronger this is wrong , of course so now i 've decided to take that power away from anxiety i'm sharing about it publicly , to show my anxiety that i do n't fear it anymore and hopefully to help others to do the same one of the things i 've learned is that opening up is important and through this i was invited to give a ted talk about my anxiety , where i shared the other important part of what i 've learned that it helps a surprising amount to compare anxiety to custard allow me to explain http tedxtalks ted com video walking on custard how physics okay , so if you 've seen the video then you 'll know a few more things about me including that i apparently ca n't operate very simple slide changing machinery but let 's ignore that for now i want to talk more about openness like i said , it feels so natural to keep our troubles a secret we 're afraid of judgement , of vulnerability , of being hurt of so many things we should n't feel bad about finding it hard to talk it 's natural , it 's common , it 's human to struggle with vulnerability but it does n't have to remain this way bottling anxiety up gives it extra power , and sharing about it takes that power away more than that our openness helps others to be open themselves each time we share our troubles , we take a small step towards creating a world where more people feel free to say i feel that way too ! the more i 've spoken publicly about anxiety , the more people have said to me me too ! of course , it 's crucial to choose how , where and who we share our struggles with openness is important , but so is feeling safe i think that often the very first step to reduce the power of our anxiety is to begin talking about it with someone that we trust it 's a long journey from there to peacefulness , but it 's a long journey i hope we can share with one another neil hughes is the author of 'walking on custard the meaning of life a guide for anxious humans' you can find him at www walkingoncustard com or talking nonsense on twitter as enhughesiasm he likes it when you say hello
