i have had a few crap days where i have been lost in unrealistic fantsies i even pretended the person was with me to talk to , i kept telling myself to stop but i felt loved and happy , emotionally fullfilled i convinced myself that someone loved me and wanted to spend the rest of their life with me and have children , i convinced myself they loved me what a fuckin idiot ! what goes up must come down ! crashing down ! i now feel numb , stupid and sick because i have been comfort eating and have ate far to much junk as if i am not fat enough already ! why is life so shit ! ! ! why did n't i stop myself ! i do n't think i will ever meet a nice man who understands me and who is attractive and has half a brain cell between their ears , not ancient and not immature ! agggghhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! i hate myself and i feel shit ! ! ! ! why is life so crap ? ps have not met my new neice yet , her mummy is still feeling very rough ! hopefully tomorrow buti think i might just hold her and cry and cry right now !
