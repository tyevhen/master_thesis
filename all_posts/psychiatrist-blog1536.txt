dinah is off to a warm sunny place this week , leaving roy and i to care for the blog uh oh much as we i like to tease dinah about talking too much , the fact of the matter is that it 's nice to know she 's here taking care of the blog when real life intrudes on my blogging capacity , which lately has been pretty often so in her absence i thought i 'd put together a list of things i would like for i 'd like a never ending list of topics to blog about that really catch my interest i 'd like dinah to have good hair days , every day , all year round i 'd like roy to keep getting the latest and coolest mac gadgets so i can enjoy his geekhood vicariously i 'd like dinah to have her own ipod really , she deserves one i 'd like to have an organized and coherent podcast i really believe this can be done and that we should do it , or try to do it , at least once i 'd like a list of good non crunchy food to eat during our podcast tapings i 'd like pet sized mikes for monkey and max so they do n't feel left out during our podcasts i 'd like blogger to start showing our little icon pictures again when we comment i miss seeing my little guinea pig behind bars i wish my patients would behave every day , all day , for a full year hey , i can dream ca n't i ? i wish someone would give me an office or maybe just a telephone i did get the heat turned on a few weeks ago i'm making progress i wish someone would explain to me how pregnant pigs came to be one of our post labels i wish all our listeners and readers would continue to find my three shrinks a comfortable place to learn , ramble and rant it certainly has been for me finally , i wish the best of all good things to both of my co bloggers i 've had a wonderful time with both of you
