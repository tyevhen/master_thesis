here 's a fresh draft regarding my recovery and referred pain i owe the idea of this piece to scott murphy and his wonderful poem , a conversation , a praise no doubt this poem on a phantom tweak needs some real tweaking before i put it in a finished folder comments and criticism appreciated to my left pinkie you were not sprained as i twirled as if suspended on a rotisserie , slamming each shoulder before my helmet broke and i lay supine , a failed gymnast in a hair raising routine you make my neck a liar the pain comes from my cervical disks , old donuts leaking jelly on the nerves , not from some local dislocation i'm past the blackout pain , a telegraphic shock sharper than any razor stropped , as if my arm were an electric cattle prod , my scapulae molten bomb fragments , my ribs losing their welds , barbed wire around my thorax like a poisoned barrel hoop three weeks post accident you have achieved a stardom undeserved , you , alien digit on my keyboard punishing each 'a' and 'z ' faintly i feel your origins descend my inner arm and elbow down to the ulna 's tip until pain absolutely concentrates in your three jointed misery you ache as if you had been broken or come too near to frostbite but there 's no bruise or swelling , just your wrinkled cylinder with two patches of blond hair in pain 's intensity , your pink and yellow flesh tones seem strangely psychedelic how dare you play the fool and insist it 's you that hurts ! you , you were spared , no miner 's canary but a turd left in the tunnel after rescue so easy to ignore before , i'm sorry i underestimated you i pledge allegiance to the body 's meanest parts , all are potential understudies in the drama of pain 's economy how odd to be upstaged by such an undistinguished part the indignity ! i cannot play a th chord on my guitar , rude evidence of how the body boils pain down to an elementary deception how can i rail at you and indemnify my spine ? who switched a deuce for a queen ? your pain enlists a mother board of cervical and other plexi whose interwoven signals processed through a blind committee agree you are the victim and the oppressor , symbol of all that alienates us from ourselves if we ca n't trust the origin of sensation how can we trust anything ? locke , berkeley , hume , i take it back if a tree falls in a forest , ha ! it may be that a headache comes from undetected hemorrhoids , bursitis from a hangnail , the tick of my fluttering eye from an abraded knee pain is a currency , it seems free traded throughout the corpus , for me now hoarded in a pinkie bank of all my separations , dislocations and compressions , you claim pre eminence if you were my middle finger i could make the right response of you instead i use my right hand to curse you mainly your insult is one of disproportion , how you encapsulate my suffering into a small appendage , oppressed and oppressing , in no need of splint or dressing , a nothing elevated to celebrity in the tabloid of the brain you , traitor , puppet , fall guy , shill , least valuable of digits ! you , worm not worthy of a ring , usurper through your phantom pain , poseur , impostor , bastard of extremities , not even my first choice to pick my nose when it should be my neck on the marquee ! still , ouch , ouch ! you win ! unstably yours , ce
