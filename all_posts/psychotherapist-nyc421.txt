mourning the future might seem like an odd concept at first but , as i 'll discuss , mourning often involves not only mourning for the past and present , but also mourning for what will never happen in the future mourning the death of a loved one we usually associate mourning with the death of a loved one if the relationship with the loved one was good , we mourn the loss of the loved one as well as the loss of what we do n't have now as well as what we wo n't have in the future if the relationship was n't as good as we would have liked it , in addition to mourning the loss of the loved one , we mourn what we did n't have in that relationship that we would have liked to have had in the past and the present we also mourn what can never be in the future the breakup of a relationship the breakup and loss of a romantic relationship can feel like a death even when there 's no physical death involved it 's the end or death of the relationship mourning your future dreams in your former relationship if the romantic relationship was good in the past , we might reminisce about the days when it was what we both wanted , but we can no longer have in the present or the future all the future plans we had with this person , who we thought we would be as individuals as well as to each other all of this is part of the mourning process here 's an example , which is a composite of many different cases with all identifying information changed alice alice and bob , who were in their late s , were engaged to be married they had been together for three years and , for most of that time , they were happy together but then , four months prior to their wedding , bob told alice that he was n't ready to get married even though all their plans were in motion , they had talked about how they wanted to start a family , where they wanted to live , and how their lives would be in the future bob told alice that she was his first serious girlfriend and he realized that he was n't ready to make that kind of commitment he thought he should go out with other women to make sure that he was n't jumping into a marriage with alice too quickly alice was completely shocked bob had never mentioned this to her before she had no idea he felt this way even though alice realized that bob was emotionally torn up about his decision , alice felt overwhelmed by a combination of shock , disbelief , anger and sadness a few months after the breakup and the cancellation of their wedding plans , alice came to therapy to sort out her feelings by now , she realized , in hindsight , that there were telltale signs that bob was n't ready to get married , but she ignored these warning signs even though she was angry with bob , she still very much loved him and missed him in her current life and missed the relationship that they had in the past as we continued to work together , alice realized on a deeper emotional level that the future she thought she would have with bob all the things she wanted in her life with him were n't going to be possible now and she was n't going to be who she thought she 'd be at least not in the context of a life with bob so , she mourned for the past , the present as well as the future of her dreams with bob mourning before moving on our culture places a high value on moving on from loss as opposed to giving ourselves the time we need to mourn our losses on multiple levels , including past , present and future mourning before moving on but if we force ourselves to push our feelings down without working them through , we risk having an even more protracted form of grief that could manifest itself in other ways , including depression as well as physical illness mourning is a personal process mourning is different for everyone no one can tell you what the mourning process should be for you it 's best not to rush the process or to try to conform to other people 's ideas of the mourning process there can be many ups and downs with
