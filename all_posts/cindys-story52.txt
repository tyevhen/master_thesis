the following are some truths i learned during a session with my counselor in the midst of the years when i was experiencing self hatred , depression , self harming behavior , and suicidal ideation i wrote them down in a journal these truths i learned during that time were to counteract the lies that i told myself in my head about life and about myself i wrote quite a few short entries in that journal , and this is one journal entry after counseling december , when i am feeling hatred toward myself and wanting to hurt myself i can know that jesus does n't condemn me i can realize that god says anger is okay it is just an emotion i can be angry and not direct it at myself i can remember that when people get to know me , they like me i can go through hard stuff and know that there are people who are willing to go through it with me i can ask god for help i can fight the thoughts of self hatred and the desires to hurt myself , with the truth that god loves me and took my punishment for me
