i'm feeling a little giddy i had a really nice , productive day , including a stellar run i'm also getting prepared to go on vacation soon with my boyfriend , d i'm really looking forward to seeing him we have n't seen each other since christmas ! we 're heading off to a warmer climate i'm looking forward to some heat , as it actually snowed here today it was very cold and blustery ridiculous for this time of year , but that 's the great state of minnesota for you ! regardless , i'm still feeling a little giddy maybe the crazy weather is actually contributing to my giddiness , as i ca n't wait to get away from it i was cursing it earlier today i had a nine mile tempo run scheduled , and i just could n't face the cold temperatures and high winds the alternative , of course , was to run nine fast miles on the treadmill , which as you know , i frequently curse ! but the weather pushed me to the treadmill , and i actually did my tempo run inside i knew running nine miles on the treadmill was going to be a significant challenge , and running at tempo pace , which is defined as comfortably hard , was going to be even tougher i'm happy to report i survived not only did i survive , i actually did well it was very tough , and i had to do a lot of mental gymnastics and bargaining with myself to get it done , but i did it i love surprising myself by accomplishing a difficult task i felt very satisfied when i left the gym running well and accomplishing goals has helped my mood remain stable and strong i expect some sunshine and warm temperatures will also keep me going i will be running miles one day while away , and i have a half marathon scheduled soon after i return more goals to shoot for more to look forward to and anticipate anticipation is good looking forward is good it means i'm moving , not stuck , and movement is very good keep moving forward , my friends
