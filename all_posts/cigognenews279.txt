there is some new work by the rush university medical center october that begins to inform us about alzheimer s disease they say that experiencing traumatic events in mid life can lead to later alzheimer s they recruited middle aged women and followed them for years , checking in to see if they had a trauma and when and what kind this would include the death of spouse , caring for a sick relative or unemployment for each of these events there was an increased risk of later alzheimer s disease by this was despite how well they seemed to cope with it see http www nydailynews com life style health mid life stress linked alzheimer study article the researches claim that this is the best evidence by far to date linking psychological stressors with dementia they go on to state that previous studies showed that stress hormones could help increase the build up of proteins that are found in the brains of people with dementia this means that serious disease such as dementia is related to stress not surprising but wait ! they have not touched the critical source of stress the traumas during gestation and birth in our clinical work we have found that as patients start to relive these early events the vital signs skyrocket , brain waves are increased in amplitude and frequency and other signs of severe stress we need to imagine what happens to a fetus fighting for her life because of lack of oxygen or of the carrying mother ingesting alcohol or serious pain medication there is terror and panic her life is at stake , not the same as losing a job later on the fetus cannot scream or talk or explain her agony but we see it in her biologic signs and unlike the current research , the scientists , when discussing what to do about all this , believe the person needs stress reduction techniques to help eliminate the problem i am not sure i am very not sure the point is that these very early traumas are imprinted and are locked into the system for a lifetime they form the basis for how later stress will be reacted to that should be the next study to see how the imprint plays into all this i think it does in a big way that primal stress is important in the later advent of alzheimer s disease so if middle age stress can lead to disease think about how traumas on a na ve and vulnerable being can affect later illness just because the fetus cannot scream does not mean that she is not suffering and that suffering continues on and on what we are planning to do soon is study the imprint and how to reverse it that is the ultimate reduction of stress we want to see if we can reverse history through reliving traumas for if we can do that we may well help patients to avoid serious disease later on we will measure the methylation process by which traumas are stamped into the brain if we reverse methylation we may stop historical traumas from going on to do damage later on we will reverse history think of that stopping an imprint from going on to cause damage that is mind blowing
