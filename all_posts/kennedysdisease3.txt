several years ago i read an article about how motor neurons and muscles in athletes develop some type of coordinated synergy so the actual physical movements involved in running , playing tennis or football , for example , are almost automatic instinctual not requiring any forethought i have known that feeling and it was a wonderful experience unfortunately , i haven t experienced that sensation for over twenty five years and i miss it today , i have no self confidence in my muscles being able to support me or react in time to prevent a fall when the leg muscles are fatigued , for example , they might give out at any time and i could drop to the floor without having a chance to catch myself today , i have to focus on locking the knees while standing or pushing off with the leg and arm muscles when trying to stand up from a seated position it is now a coordinated effort between the brain and the muscles any deviation from focusing on the current activity could result in a fall i can no longer be walking and have other thoughts running through my mind distracting me if that happens , i am an accident waiting to happen i believe the statement about being able to 'walk and chew gum at the same time' is appropriate
