jealousy by edvard munch since coming out of my depression , now on firm ground for nearly a month , breaking into kilobunnies at times , clean and sober save for my prescribed medications , i have had a return of sanity to my art as well i have been guilty in the past of whining in a corner , decrying the state of contemporary poetry , jealous of the successful , feeling my genius ignored , yada yada piss bam boom i recall a moment of sanity i had once in palm springs , where in driving around i noted that over of the cars on the road were mercedes benzes a twinge of jealousy pricked me why did they have such handsome buggys while i drove a beater ? i was a practicing doctor , was n't i ? then it occurred to me they had worked for them , budgeted for them , else sacrificed to lease them in a word , they had earned them and i had n't i had n't even tried get real , dr chaffin ! back to poetry in the same way i have half heartedly sent out a few submissions now and then , completely inconsistent , the rejections either provoking me to despair at having no talent or to disdain for the editors who lacked the wisdom to perceive my gifts i have just completed sending out submissions to paying journals both by snail and electronic mail , depending on the guidelines to the best of my ability i seriously studied the preferences and examples of each magazine and sought to tailor my submissions to their wants this is so elementary that it unfailingly appears in every writer 's guidebook in the very first chapters instead of listening , i have wasted so much time complaining about the state of poetry that i never tried to get on the bus in earnest this attitude did result in some good essays is n't that how most of us are ? experiencing jealousy over the possessions or accomplishments of others as if someone had waved a magic wand and dropped such things in their laps ? get real , ce ! the chinese pictograph for danger is also the symbol for opportunity it 's been said that luck is when preparation meets opportunity wish me luck i 've decided to start behaving as a grown up when it comes to my art thine in truth and art , craig erick
