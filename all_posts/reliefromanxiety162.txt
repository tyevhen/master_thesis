a few of you have asked me how to start a blog or how to get followers i have written below some tips that may help topic you need to have a specific topic or theme with your blog is it a lifestyle blog ? is it a beauty blog ? if you start with a topic or theme , then you focus all of your attention on that specific area , your readers will know what to expect as your blog grows , you can slowly develop your blog to other areas schedule i find having a schedule not only helps me to write regularly , but for my readers to know when i have written something new i know there are sites such as bloglovin where you are automatically updated , but remember not everyone will follow you on these sites twitter creating a twitter account specifically for your blog is what i 've found as the most beneficial through twitter i have found so many new bloggers and most of my readers have found me through twitter too without twitter i do n't think i 'd have the audience that i currently have ! ideas i always have a list where i keep a note of all of my ideas for my blog posts i often end up writing quite a few of my blog posts in advance , just in case i do n't have time to write them on the day design i have found that some people have amazing designs on their blogs , whereas mine is quite simple if i'm honest , i have n't quite figured out how to customise everything ! having a design where people can easily find your blog posts and follow you on various sites , makes everything so much easier and more memorable if you any questions or anything you 'd like me to write about , leave a comment below ! best wishes , amy xx
