yesterday , yesterday i posted a very negative post a post in which i expressed all the things i hate right now some would probably have a hard time reading a post like that and i do n't blame them one bit i hope the title was a fair warning today i want to talk about the struggles involved with raising my son in an earlier post i described his as pdd nos with odd cd pdd nos is a very complex condition as by it 's definition , it 's for persons who do not quite fit the diagnosis of other well defined conditions on the autism spectrum , but do have some aspects that are so strong , that they must be acknowledged as on the spectrum no two child with pdd nos is quite the same they all have various challenges , for sure , but the challenges vary it took years for the medical system to figure out what he had why ? it took them so long because they never had him tested why ? well because as he is pdd nos he happened to lack the most common sign my autistic son can make eye contact he does very good eye contact my son is also very smart in fact he is gifted in some areas , which means he was also able to develop all kinds work arounds while he was younger as he grew older , some of those work arounds started failing his frustrations started increasing people wanted my son to perform and act like other kids his age and he could n't because of his developmental disorder history from the moment my son was old enough to walk my son has had violent tantrums , often breaking things my son would disappear within seconds , causing his caregivers to often search for him he would disappear when his caregiver would go to the washroom , or go get something in another room , he required constant supervision even though my son grew up in a bilingual environment , he always refused to communicate in french my son however as a toddler was a very affectionate , loved cuddle time would often come to people in his life to hug them and kiss them out of the blue physical contact has always been a huge need in my son s life my son has always been prone to taking things apart to study them it was very difficult to keep any toys and they would often be taken apart when my son started school kindergarten he would not sit still and would bite other students in grade my son experienced severe distress in school , he would try to jump down stairwells , he would scream , throw things , try to hurt himself and others in various ways after many difficulties , including children s aid trying to frame me for abuse , i finally was able to have my son seen by a doctor from pierre janet , they diagnosed him as a child with adhd since grade i have been trying to get my son tested for a learning disability and for giftedness while in grade one , my son was attending a french school in quebec he was therefore being taught strictly in french while at a doctor s office , my son picked up a magazine , found an interesting story and started reading it out loud to me not only did he read very well and fluently , but the magazine was an english one my son had not realized the language of the magazine he simply read by the end of grade my son was put on ritalin we told my son it was a magic pill and it did seem to improve things in grade , my son was put on concerta by doctor aruju gonzalo he was also prescribed clonodine to help his sleep and his chest pains in grade my son was referred to cheo for the first time they confirmed the diagnosis of adhd , but added odd to his diagnosis by grade they took him off clonodine and put him on risperdone while in grade , we bought a carpet steamer these things as you know come in pieces which need to be assembled while i was at the washroom , my son unpacked and built the steamer by himself , without any errors from grade to this day , my son has been a victim of bullying his first school in ontario took years to recognize the bullying , however , they were always delayed in acting upon it his name is a fag was painted on a school dumpster and it took them several months to remove it i reported it to the school many times before anyone ever checked my son had an eip done that provided him with extra support in grade , he was transferred to middle school all his support was removed and the bullying intensified they increased the dosage of all his medications , but my son kept getting worst in all communications with the school , they described my son as some type of demonic child , a child i was not recognizing as my son did not display many of those behaviors ate home my son was getting regular chest pains , he was barely sleeping any more , yet when trying to talk to the school about the problems they stated there was no bullying and the only problem was my son my son would come home with bruises from the bullying and beatings he decided to stop taking his medications as things only kept getting worst he was suffering from the side effects of the medication but we were seeing no positive changes this became so horrible for my son at school that in may , i pulled my son out of school and tried home schooling him while home schooling , i noticed that my son was very behind in the things he was supposed to know my son had about a grade three level knowledge in all subjects , but read at a grade level first order of business was to catch my son up in all subjects , while encouraging his reading skills even though my son was un medicated , from may to july , he was able to learn and advance from grade to grade , with little support once removed from school , my son s anxiety went drastically down and he was sleeping through the night he was happier child , even though i had trouble getting him to do many of his non school related chores in august , i gave my son an ultimatum , if he wanted to go visit his grand mother he needed to clean his room when he did not , our neighbour offered to take care of my son so i could visit my mother and not deny myself and my mother the trip while i was gone , my son went into crisis mode , regressing to how he was in grade one , he refused to obey the neighbours , he told other neighbours that i had left him alone and was caught hanging out the window , i was called home because he was threatening to kill himself we brought him to cheo and they suggested a reward program since my son was a toddler , i have tried various reward programs reward program do not work with my son my son refuses to work for anything he has a sense of entitlement that he believes everything should simply be given to him and he sees reward programs as an insult i have tried every variation , from the simple to the complex , they will not work i still have various reward programs in place since january , he has returned to school and things have escalated dramatically my son does not seem to understand human emotion in others he does not understand why things he does will have an effect on others when he steals things from another , he does not see why the other person is upset he wanted it he took it , simple as that he feels like hitting someone for entertainment , why should it bother anyone ? he has extremely low impulse control , and frustration tolerance my son has been known to steal , from others and from stores if you refuse him he will become violent if you take back from him something he stole from you , he will break things and attack you calling you a thief he seems to enjoy the pain in others he sees everything as an attack and will attack in return my son has a very negative outlook on life in seemingly every situation he will jump to the worst possible scenario , complaining about everything he views school as a social punishment , a place of torture he will often refuse to attend , and will have meltdowns rages , emotional distress , violence , threats , destructiveness at home he will play video games either on the computer , the game cube , game boy , ds he will barely eat or sleep , all he does is play video games , and will become increasingly belligerent when we try to make him stop playing the games we often try to make him stop to do things like eat , sleep and clean himself unless reminded , he may not do any of these things by himself even when reminded , he will often refuse my son has very few friends for the longest time he had none those he has currently also have social difficulties , miss social cues his friends are very much into video games as well so that when they are together either they talk about video games or play video games my son can switch from extreme violent behaviour to sweet and loving within a moments notice he will act like nothing happened and will not understand why those around him are not in the same mindset as him sometimes , he will not even notice that he had what we now call a meltdown last fall , we applied to section , for special schooling they have denied him through cheo , they were supposed to apply for a residential program to help my son catch up on all the things he missed out by the late diagnosis he was only diagnosed with pdd nos during the summer nothing is happening the educational system throws the ball in the medical system 's court , they throw it into community resource groups who throw it back into the schools court he is currently on abilify and adderall they tried vyvanse to no avail they tried many medications to no avail meanwhile , my daughter and i struggle to deal with all the problems my son is having causing we have inadequate help my son has a non verbal learning disability and also meets the province 's exceptionality criteria for something thanks for reading !
