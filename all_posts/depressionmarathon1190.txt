i have n't mentioned it i have n't written about it , because i was n't sure it was realistic actually , i'm still not sure perhaps it 's a bit more realistic today my hip has tolerated three weeks of training , miles per week the injection into the iliopsoas tendon hip flexor seems to have worked i tolerated a mile run two days ago , and i 've tolerated the energy expenditure so far i 've been able to run i think my training secret was also due to fear fear of failure , specifically if i do n't reveal the goal , it 's as if i never set one no goal , no possibility of failure ! how 's that for some really screwed up reasoning ? truthfully , setting goals is daunting for just about anyone setting goals when you have an intermittently debilitating , chronic illness takes audacity i 've written about the dicey ness of goal setting before goals are tricky things when you have depression the evil depression constantly bombards my brain with condemnation you are worthless ! you are stupid ! you are slow ! you will never be the person you used to be ! this is it this is how you are going to be the rest of your life ! what a hopeless waste , you are ! insert evil laughter here the audacity it takes to strive for a goal you may fail to achieve is enormous ! yep , goals are tricky with depression with my illness constantly corrupting my thoughts , setting goals is often terrifying if i fail to meet or exceed those goals , all of the nastiness screaming in my head is instantaneously reinforced and once those thoughts are proven to be real , they stop being thoughts and become me my depression loves it when that happens it gets what it was craving , and it is satiated by my desperation depression wins from goals , well , here i go ! i'm about to be audacious ! i plan to run and finish the twin cities marathon on october , my secondary goal is to run it under , which , i believe , would qualify me for the boston marathon , april , wish me luck !
