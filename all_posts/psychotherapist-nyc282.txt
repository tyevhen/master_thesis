during the holiday season , many people think about the childhood holidays they had with their families , which were disappointing as a adults , they look back on those times and feel sad as the holidays approach usually , when clients talk about this in their therapy sessions with me , i remind them that , as children , there was n't much they could do about miserable holidays because the adults were in charge but now , as adults , they have the power to create their own joyful holidays and their own traditions they 're no longer dependent upon the adults to create the holiday occasion they can now use their own creativity to create the holiday they want feeling empowered to create a joyful holiday if spending time with your family of origin during the holidays is difficult , why not create your own holiday traditions with your family of choice possibly , your significant other and your friends ? developing your own holiday traditions and rituals can be fun as you use your imagination and creativity to have the kind of holiday that you desire i know people who consider their new holiday traditions with their spouses and friends to be their real holiday as opposed to their visits with their families exchanging gifts , christmas tree trimming , or christmas caroling in their neighborhoods are among the traditions that they 've incorporated with the people that they enjoy being with on the holidays of course , there are many people who enjoy being with their families not everyone had disappointing holidays but if you 're someone who dreads the holidays because it brings up sad memories , remember that you 're now empowered , as an adult , to create the kind of holiday that you want i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me photo credit andrihilary via photopin cc
