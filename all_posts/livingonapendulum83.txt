who among you has fallen in love ? are you in love in the forever after kind of love ? or is it a deep intense love without it being the one true love ? valentine 's day is coming and i have started pondering about love as some of you may know , i am single and celibate at the moment by celibate , i am not using it as the synonym of single but rather to mean that i am avoiding and have no interest in men , relationships or sex i also have no intention of changing that status right now , nor do i know when i might want to this does not prevent me from pondering my life and past relationships there have been way too many relationships with men in my life i have had enough so far to last two lifetimes , maybe even three , but i was looking for the wrong thing in all the wrong places i was looking for proof that i was lovable in men that were only interested in sex very bad for self esteem anyway so i have been pondering all my past relationships and have determined that of all of them i have actually probably fallen in love times a fourth the jury is still out on if it was love or infatuation of those three men , i do n't think any of them loved me the first one was my first real boyfriend in the beginning maybe he did feel something very strongly for me i was , he was we were the cutest thing most called it puppy love and few expected us to continue seeing each other until i was , he for two years , we saw each other almost every day , we did break up once or twice , but it did not last very long then , when i was , i moved away we continued being involved through letters , and when i visited in the summers as with all long distance relationships , it could n't last and it ended terribly i met up with him years late , when i was in my s , but the magic was gone for good , we had become two very different individuals , worlds apart the second one , i was , he was just yeah i know , robbing the cradle and all actually , he was the one who pursued me in the beginning i would have nothing to do with him because he was younger he kept hassling my friends , trying to get them to convince me to give him a chance he knew i was a single mother he was willing to become part of her life after he turned , between him and my friends , i decided to give him a shot i fell for him hard and fast the relationship lasted barely more than a month i broke up with him the outside pressures were too much for me to handle , for us to handle his family disapproved of me and were always on his case to break up with me the people kept telling him that i was cheating on him , they kept telling me that he was cheating on me his friends were telling him to stop seeing an older woman with a kid , that it was too much responsibility the people around me were telling me that i was insane to go out with someone so young when i was a mother well he might have been able to handle it , he did after all join the army and survived a tour of duty in afghanistan later i regret to this day not toughing it out i am very proud of the man he became , i have told his parents this and they thanked me i lived a few doors down from his parents for years eventually i am sure they figured out who i was , even though we never discussed it his parents got to know me years after i broke up with him and respected the person i was they probably realized their original fears were for naught he went on to marry and have beautiful children lucky woman ! the third man , i fell in love without noticing i was falling he made it so easy for me it started out that we were booty call partners we worked together and i was complaining that i could not get a guy to help me with my needs and he mentioned that he could help me with that he was not my type at all he was younger than me , shorter than me , and blond ! considering up till then i had gone for tall dark and handsome , if it had not been for that conversation i totally would not even had considered him even when he offered , i did not take him seriously and kind of dared him and myself to do it boy that first time was awkward ! he was so sweet and so shy every time i would visit him , he did not make me feel like a means to an end he was sweet and romantic and considerate he treated me like a princess in every which way our arrangement was to be a secret it was understood that neither of us would discuss our encounters i had a friend that had been involved with him and so many times i almost blurted out details about my encounters with him , but that was against the rules he did not want me to tell her i found keeping the secret from her so difficult after years of us seeing each other , he eventually decided to tell people about us , to become more in the open he was the first to tell our friend , and she took it hard she took it hard that he had gotten involved with me and took it even harder that i had not told her it destroyed our friendship i miss her to this day , yet understand her feelings our involvement lasted about years , at most ending it was the hardest thing i have ever had to do in my life part of me still longs for him for a while , i thought he might have cared for me , even maybe loved me , especially since he was so sweet , treated me so well and at times i thought i heard him say those words in the height of passion , or when i was asleep and snuggled against him i had been thinking of possibly ending the relationship if we could not make it official for a while i was trying to get him to agree delicately to become an actual couple he had seemed to be taking steps towrads it , telling people about us , being seen in public together and so on , but he was not making that final step the one day i see on facebok that he is in an open relationship i would find out shortly that he was going out with her , being official with her but the open referred to keeping his unofficial relationship with me that made me feel so dirty and worthless that i put an end to it once and for all i sent him an email that i was not interested in being the side dish anymore , i was looking to be the main dish and if that was not going to happen then it was over i still miss him i also miss my second but in a sweet kinda way my third , his absence still hurts i tried to replace him , but it did n't work so that 's it , the story about the men i loved thanks for reading
