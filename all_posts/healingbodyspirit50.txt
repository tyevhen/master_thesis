infra red light helps eyes elan light therapy anti aging and light for recharging the cellular batteries in old eyes or really age related tissue decline anywhere in a non invasive way use near infra red light help your cells be fully charged shine with light recharging mitochondrial batteries in old eyes near infra red increases atp pubmed ncbi exp eye res may doi j exer epub mar near infra red nm is thought to be absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase cox , a key element in mitochondrial respiration and it has been demonstrated that it improves mitochondrial membrane potentials in aged eyes it also significantly reduces the impact of experimental pathology and ameliorates age related retinal inflammation we show atp decline with ageing in mouse retina and brain also , in these tissues that atp is significantly increased by nm exposure in old mice in the retina this was associated with increased cox and reduced acrolein expression acrolein , being a free radical marker of retinal oxidative stress , is up regulated in alzheimer 's and retinal degeneration this is the first demonstration of atp manipulation in vivo and may provide a simple non invasive route to combating age related tissue decline ncbi nlm nih gov by gkotsi d , et al http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed ? log activity https www facebook com permalink
