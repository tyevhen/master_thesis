ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh i love the internet i received some really awesome responses to my call to action y'all are beautiful i'm looking forward to working with everyone i am considering starting a google or yahoo group i am wondering about names though social workers against size discrimination ? the size diversity social work coalition ? social work size action initiative or network ooh ? do you have an awesome name suggestion ? i really love the kind you can some how verbalize instead of having to say each letter individually i think names are important because i think it will really set the tone for the group for example size acceptance vs fat acceptance vs size diversity the last one being a fav of mine anyway , suggest away names can always be changed down the line as the group dynamics begin to unfold
