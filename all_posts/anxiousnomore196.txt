i do n't usually post funny things on here , mostly because i feel that my anxiety is n't funny i also am hesitant to put anything controversial on here because of my sad nature i very much so want everyone in the world to like me if heaven forbid someone did n't than i would have to spend forever analyzing why and what i needed to do to change their opinion thats how i have always been and probably always be middle of the road , happy go lucky , be nice to everyone however i do think that its nice to be able to laugh at yourself every now and then otherwise we stay in our self awareness nit picky judgmental attitudes right ? so since i have been working a lot and am getting tired of it , i can use a laugh while surfing for a serious webmd video on youtube , i came across this parody instead personally it made me smile if it offends anyone , sorry , but like i said , i think its good to laugh at what you are going through occasionally ok if you want a really good serious movie about reducing stress and anxiety you have to go to the webmd website cause its flash so unfortunately i ca n't bring it to you enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like how stress affects the body what to do when feeling overwhelmed chronic stress more belly fat ! ? ! celebrate linkwithin
