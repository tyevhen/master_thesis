various danger signs in the global economy have a lot of people worried these days , and as always seems to happen during these times people are paying a lot of attention to what the fed will or wo n't do , or should do , or should n't do which begs the question of why we have something called the federal reserve system in the first place historically , the reason we have something now called the fed is because of a banking panic that happened in the knickerbocker crisis was a financial crisis that took place over a three week period starting in mid october , when the new york stock exchange fell almost from its peak the previous year a much bigger drop than the drop so take note the stock market event was bigger than the event , yet did n't cause a great depression also note , the fed already existed in and yet failed to prevent the great depression with regard to the crash , we learn from wikipedia panic occurred , as this was during a time of economic recession , and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies the panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of new york city banks and a loss of confidence among depositors , exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops the panic was triggered by the failed attempt in october to corner the market on stock of the united copper company when this bid failed , banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts , leading a week later to the downfall of the knickerbocker trust company new york city 's third largest trust the collapse of the knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city 's trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from new york city banks panic extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks the panic might have deepened if not for the intervention of financier j p morgan , who pledged large sums of his own money , and convinced other new york bankers to do the same , to shore up the banking system at the time , the united states did not have a central bank to inject liquidity back into the market by november , the financial contagion had largely ended , only to be replaced by a further crisis this was due to the heavy borrowing of a large brokerage firm that used the stock of tennessee coal , iron and railroad company tc i as collateral collapse of tc i 's stock price was averted by an emergency takeover by morgan 's u s steel corporation a move approved by anti monopolist president theodore roosevelt the following year , senator nelson w aldrich , father in law of john d rockefeller , jr , established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions , leading to the creation of the federal reserve system according to the fed 's own web site , the fed sees its mission as falling into the following areas conducting the nation 's monetary policy by influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long term interest rates supervising and regulating banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation 's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets providing financial services to depository institutions , the u s government , and foreign official institutions , including playing a major role in operating the nation 's payments system it 's interesting that the fed sees maximum employment and stable prices as within its purview it 's not clear to me that the fed has anything but the most contrived , indirect , strained control over the nation 's job market , but apparently on november , , the federal reserve act was amended to require the board and the federal open market committee to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long term interest rates hence the first bullet point we can probably agree that the fed 's main purpose is to keep the banking system sound it does this through a variety of policies involving reserve requirements , key interest rates , and open market actions collectively known as monetary policy the fed has other duties , including the collection and analysis of economic data it seems to be okay at collecting data , but no better than mediocre at analyzing it some would say mediocre is being kind forty years ago , when the u s economy was facing serious inflation and a wage price spiral , the fed was able to put the brakes on the economy by adjusting key interest rates upward in , the economy ground to a halt , and the fed found out very quickly that it could not speed the economy up by lowering interest rates even to zero instead , the fed had to go to a liquidity based pseudo stimulus plan called qe quantitative easing , which stimulated the only part of the economy it has direct influence over the banking industry as it happens , the vast amounts of money created in support of qe a little over trillion mostly went to bond and mortgage buybacks that led to banks bolstering their reserves it mostly did n't have the intended effect of stimulating borrowing , and in the low interest rate , easy money environment of the last few years , most large coproations have used their money not to expand their core businesses which would have meant hiring people but to buy back stock we see the effect of qe mainly in high stock prices and low mortgage rates , not in hiring or economic expansion , which is why i called it a pseudo stimulus defenders of the fed would say that without qe , we 'd now be in a very deep recession , but the question is whether we 've prevented that scenario or merely delayed it common sense says that monetary stimulus which can only be about borrowing is not true stimulus you ca n't borrow your way to prosperity if the economy is n't truly growing organically in the first place which it 's not in the uk , there 's been some talk recently of green qe , which is the idea of funding infrastructure projects by bonds that would be bought back under qe some have criticized this idea based on the fact that green qe conflates fiscal policy which tends to be agenda based with monetary policy however , monetary policy is arguably already conflated with fiscal policy , inasmuch as traditional qe 's stimulus formula is agenda based , with a definite sector bias toward finance and housing the question of whether qe should now favor other sectors and other agendas is a fair one many people would argue convincingly , i think that we 're already expecting monetary policy to do too much the reason we lean so heavily now on monetary policy fed action qe is the lack of tolerance in washington and london and elsewhere for real public policy decision making fiscal policy decisions decisions involving taxing and spending have become too difficult , politically it 's not just that our leaders are cowards it 's that contentiousness has paralyzed government it takes a full blown crisis now to get anything done and more often than not , the will of the people is ignored for example , the overwhelming majority of americans favor taxing the rich more aggressively but this is n't likely to happen while the rich are pulling the strings my take ? looking to the fed or to monetary policy generally for answers is a form of denial we need to confront our problems head on and demand real solutions , not qe based wishful thinking non solutions that favor banks and landlords , exacerbating the wealth inequality problem we need to start dealing with real issues job creation , opportunity , the need for high wages , less student loan debt , etc now , before the next crisis happens the fed did n't prevent the great depression it 's not going to prevent the next depression we need to redeploy real , existing wealth , now , in ways that make the economy stronger for everyone , so that we do n't have to invent whatever comes after the fed , after whatever disaster comes next have you checked out my free book mental health myths
