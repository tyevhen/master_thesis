so that time of year has come the one in which the days become more dark along with my thoughts every year about this time , i get bipolar depression or perhaps i should call it seasonal affective disorder regardless of the name , it 's very real i become lethargic , i cry for no reason , and suicidal thoughts traipse through my brain but that ca n't happen to me this year because i 've got a full time job to hold down at the same time as taking abnormal psychology and an emt training class so what do i do ? preemptive strike ! first thing give up caffeine i always say i'm not addicted to caffeine i give it up all the time and i will try , try again starting today , i will only drink one can of diet dew a day at the end of august , i 'll switch to one every other day and at the end of september , i'm done part of my worry is that my teeth will rot out of my head but i 've also heard a lot of stories about how getting caffeine and aspartame out of your body does wonders for health and decreases anxiety let 's try it out next exercise now , i have a job where i'm scrubbing and lifting and squatting all day long i'm exhausted when i get home but i can exercise on saturdays and sundays i plan on spending an hour or so each of these two days at the gym running and biking is the goal i can listen to my audiobooks while doing that i 've always promised myself i would n't become a pill popper , but over the years i 've added more and more supplements to my list i'm going to ween it down to just a few and make sure they 're quality my doctor tells me that most minnesotans are low in vitamin d , and that raising vit d can help fight depression sure enough , when tested , i was low i will start taking cod liver oil each day it 's high in vit d and is apparently the magical oil that fixes everything from brainpower to complexion i will switch from the cvs brand of calcium which is calcium carbonate to one that uses calcium citrate apparently , this increases absorption and i'm going to take an iron supplement because often when i go to the red cross they find that my hemoglobin is too low that 's it those , and my multi vitamin tablet , is all i need get rid of all those extra , dubious supplements last but not least , i'm going to be like this woman basking in a happy lamp each morning i 've never tried this out , but i hear it works wonders it 'll mean i have to get up a half hour earlier , but if it will save me from depression , it 's worth it the scientist in me is flinching switching so many variables at once but i must ignore those anxieties and journey on
