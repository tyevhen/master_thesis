hi friends ! lately i 've been doing a lot of thinking about mothering i capitalize it because it 's more than just an occupation or career it 's a way of life and a sacred calling for serving god i 'll be honest , it does n't always feel sacred or special it 's muddy work it 's sloppy work most of the time , i feel frustrated how many freakin' spills can i clean in one mealtime ? ? , angry shut the hell up and go to sleep noah ! ! ! ! , tired wake ups in the night for the binky or the bottle or for who knows what , and spent give give give give giiiiiiive do n't even talk to me about all the guilt yes , i yelled shut the hell up ! to my month old when he would n't stop fussing constantly during the night about a month ago , i became tired of feeling , well tired i was sad that i was n't feeling a sense of fulfillment and purpose i 'd always imagined i 'd feel once i 'd become a mother i was sad i was feeling frustrated and yelling most of the time i was sad i was n't finding the joy as much as i 'd wanted i fretted that time was passing me by these little moments with my babies was going to pass too quickly and i worried i 'd miss out on the chance to truly soak up every second with my precious ones do you ever feel like this ? like you need the answer for how to be quiet , enjoy motherhood , savor every messy moment , and thrive in all ? it 's so easy to get caught up in the minutiae of the everyday wake up before you want to , go about your same routine whatever that looks like for you , battle the same battles , cleaning , preparing , laundering , and so forth just to hit the bed to prepare for it all again the next day in all of this busyness and sameness , it 's so easy to forget to look around and notice the little things that make each day a wonderful part of the journey of motherhood we race , we scurry , we plot and plan for the next events all to get through the day , longing for a moment of peace and relaxation alone i do n't want to wake up one day with my surly teenage kids who want nothing to do with me and wish i 'd paid more attention to the little things and focused less on my frustration and challenges back when they were little and wanted to be near me spiritual sidenote i'm currently working through these issues with a good friend of mine who is now a pastor in montreal he is helping me to realize there is support from a higher place and that my purpose is a great one i'm working to find my identity through jesus and discovering my faith in a new way that everything i do yes , even scrubbing the dishes is a way to show love and serve god because i love him and am grateful for all he did for me what once seemed like drudgery is simply another way i can show my love to my family being a mother is easy doing all the work a stay at home mom entails can be laborious physically , and emotionally demanding i can find some peace knowing that everything i do can be done with a smile because it means something special that being said , i also needed some inspiration and advice from other mothers how do the other women do it ? the ones who have a bunch of kids , volunteer , work , and find time for friends , creative pursuits , etc ? i found my answers in the book deliberate motherhood key powers of peace , purpose , order , and joy it is filled with essays from seasoned mothers who have been there essays i feel like i could have written ! there are suggestions on how to deal with different struggles hooray ! i read the book in days and filled the margins with notes i ca n't recommend this book enough if you are struggling with the daily challenges from behind the scenes or want a realistic view of what motherhood looks like i can say strongly that it has changed the way i view my role as a mother and the way i handle each day i 've been feeling so much more calm , purposeful , and joyous the book is set up in chapters that correspond with each month of the year january focuses on the power of acceptance i 've decided to follow along with the book and ponder each topic through this next year i 've already read the whole book , but i want to explore each topic in detail i 'll write about that topic throughout the month and think about how it can apply in my own life do you want to join me ?
