i spent some time getting my new space set up yesterday it 's mostly done , yet the walls are still quite bare which definitely will change over time as this space evolves into what i 've been envisioning in the meantime , it 's definitely functional and so much nicer than working out of closets and drawers and bins it is glorious to feel organized and to have a dedicated creative spot
