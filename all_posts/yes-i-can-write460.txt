last night it was beautiful i talked for hours with my mom , discussing everything under the sun and because we were talking , we were still up a bit past am when i heard a noise on the deck of course , my paranoid mind going into overdrive , i called for reinforcements in the form of my mother than we switched the outside light on and looked out the door there , peaking out from behind a bin , was the cutest raccoon i have ever seen he looked to be young , i'm guessing maybe a year old , and what struck me so much about him was simply his expression there was no malice in his eyes , no anger , just slight caution , and curiosity he watched us for several minutes , furry ears sharply perked , before deciding we did n't seem to be any threat and creeping out from behind his hiding place once out in the open , and seeing as we still had n't made any move to harm him , he started ignoring us in favour of the fresh grapes that encircle our deck i could n't blame him , really they are delicious ! sadly it was only the that we thought to get a camera , once the spell was broken a bit we got a few blurry shots , but although we have n't downloaded them yet i do n't think we got any good ones i will always remember that look on his face though , eyes bright and appraising , full of curiosity and life anyone who can look at a beautiful wild creature like that and see only a pest is blind , and anyone who can look at a beautiful wild creature like that and desire to own him , either as a pet or as a fur coat , is simply fucked up it always feels magical when i come across a wild creature , when we make eye contact , or somehow connect in that short time we are in each others sight , then go our separate ways without ever harming or frightening the other , those moments truly stay with you is n't it a sad testament to our current world that those moments are few and far between , and that because of what we 've done we 've taught most animals to fear , or even hate us ? and we have all learned that wild animals are vicious , dangerous , and had best be avoided i want a world with mutual respect , where all of us animals can live together naturally , the way we 're supposed to in case you had n't noticed , i have n't given up hope yet ! pictures of my mom and me i 'll add the raccoon shots when i get them uploaded onto the computer
