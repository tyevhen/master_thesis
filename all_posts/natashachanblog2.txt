ok so the attempt to update frequently did n't go so well things kind of changed drastically in my work life i left my old job which was giving me frequent and bad cases of anxiety and a week later i started a new contract that lasted until two weeks ago it was overall good and a great learning experience , but i did have a few cases of anxiety again if you 're wondering what i do for a living , my last two jobs have been in the film industry the industry is known for being tough you work long hours , you do n't really have a social life , and it 's very fast pace with that being said i did wonder to myself can people with a mental health illness work in that environment ? i toss back and forth between yes and no but more on that another day so for the past week i 've been simply relaxing i'm spending these next few weeks cleaning , seeing old friends , running weekday errands , walking the dogs , seeing my niece , and preparing for mine and b 's move in december that 's right this yuppie is moving to langley ! more on that another day as well my goal for this blog is to update every sunday write about something even though i feel like i have nothing to write about till next sunday
