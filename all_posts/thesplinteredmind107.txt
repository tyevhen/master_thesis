hear this article read to you as i sit with my near year old daughter in a caf , i was musing on something that happened to me a week ago i had set out to do some early thanksgiving day shopping , sweeping the eggnog display for the tasty cream of weber brand that sells out if you 're unlucky , and getting some pumpkin pies in the bargain over at the bakery , as i was foraging for a certain cookie , one of the bakers came over to help me she asked me what i was looking for and i eagerly told her i was searching for maroons i should probably take time to note that the sun was freshly over the mountains , yet i had n't been to bed yet i was going through a nasty bit of insomnia when i'm tired the first warning sign that my brain is about to seize , aside from spontaneous ticking , is the disconnect between my mouth and my mind if my adhd mind is like an iphone with a cracked screen , my tired adhd mind is like a waterlogged blackberry with taffy in the keys its bad enough trying to express what 's in my mind on a good day on a bad day , i'm usually just as surprised as the listener at what comes out of my mouth now , i know what you 're thinking do n't beat yourself up , you might say anybody could make that mistake we usually look in the beer aisle for the morons then i 'd tell you i was n't shopping after midnight like i usually do , and i was looking for macaroons and you 'd snigger just like the nice , short bakery lady sure , let 's find you some red cookies , she yucked as she led me over to the special cookie section reserved only for idiots who ask for help there they were , over toasted and in perfect prefabricated puck shapes not quite the swirling , artsy macaroons with a cherry on top that i had in mind are they all coconut ? i asked , meaning toasted is there any other kind ? she inquired with a smirk i quickly corrected my mistake , but i was hardly impressed with her adversarial customer service as bugs bunny would say , what a maroon there was a time when interacting with snotty store peons who mocked me would have upset me on a molecular level i would have sworn never to visit the store again , hated myself , then beat myself up about it for days every time i drove by the store i would remember the incident hotly and hate myself all over again on the other hand , if i was feeling confident i would have confronted them over their rudeness and then complained to management i thought about that afterwards and realized i was a lot happier without all the drama i was also mildly surprised that i did n't get angry at the lady , but simply shuffled on in the past if i did n't fight it was mostly because i did n't trust myself this time , however , i just wanted to shop and get home to bed i suppose i should consider that progress like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe !
