over the weekend i found myself using floppy disks for the first time in i do n't know how many moore epochs it was a brain bending reminder of how much great technology was built atop operating systems that fit into a few k of memory and mylar storage media back in the mid s , bob yannes , the guy responsible for the mos technology sid sound interface device chip in the commodore and the ensoniq digital oscillator chip ensoniq es doc that powered the apple iigs computer 's audio system , introduced the first low cost digital sound sampling keyboard , the ensoniq mirage at in dollars ! , it might not seem low cost , but you have to realize that the mirage 's main competition at the time was the fairlight cmi series ii , which , at , , only very successful musicians could afford the mirage was an incredibly versatile and for its day , quite impressive sounding midi keyboard , with a note sequencer big stuff back then ! , velocity sensitive keys , and of course , the ability to use sampled sound it loaded sound samples from k single sided double density floppy disks each disk held six note voices plus a copy of the operating system in my case , i could n't afford a mirage keyboard was too steep for me , but around ensoniq came out with a rack mount keyboardless version of the mirage that was much cheaper once it became last year 's model , i picked one up , new , at sam ash for the rack mount unit exactly the same as what i have is pictured above my mirage box had collected so much dust in the basement that i had to spend minutes just cleaning the chassis exterior i was very worried , of course , that the accompanying floppy disks without which the device is useless , now years old , would be so corrupted with flipped bits that i would n't even be able to boot the machine cheap floppies always seemed to go bad on me in two or three years could these still be good after years ? yes amazingly , i was able to boot the mirage and load sound samples from disk and just as amazingly , everything else worked midi in out thru , all the front panel buttons , etc what had me challenged was the fact that i could n't find the user 's manual and this was a complex box to operate not really complex , just a poor user interface many buttons , many numeric inputs , no text messages whatsoever it 's a matter of knowing which buttons to push in which order i looked online for a user 's manual , assuming there would be one there was n't instead , it turns out there 's a lively aftermarket in mirage user manuals , which often sell for more than used mirage boxes themselves ! but i did finally find a cheat sheet showing all the parameter codes from there , i figured out the button combos myself i wired the midi in port to my yamaha dx 's midi out , and lo ! there was sound coming out the mirage 's mono output jack and the layered sound mirage over dx was actually quite marvelous , especially when piped through cakewalk 's digital effects running on my compaq presario i often wonder if we really need the gigabyte drives and ghz cpus and mega ginormous operating systems so called on which we so slavishly rely today do we need to live in such digital squalor , really ? i look at the mirage and think not
