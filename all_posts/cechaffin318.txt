i had planned upon our return to have refills of my most needed medications in the mail from canada , namely my antidepressant , cymbalta , and my pain medication , celebrex to my horror and surprise , neither had arrived , only an old telephone message that both had been back ordered from europe both ? i said , calling back solly , one was n't weady yet and dey do n't like to ship dem together cheap bastards , i thought i urged them to get them to me asap , whereupon the hindu pharmacist said den you would accept generic ? of course , you bubble headed booby ! i thought i try to keep such thoughts to myself today , because uttering them does n't help anyone in private with kathleen these past two and a half weeks on the road , i have often sat in a motel bed and said , i hate everyone ! i hope they all die ! bite your tongue and ask for forgiveness , she would say , especially if i mentioned a family member by name so i would do what she asked , but the prayer always sounded disrespectful with the lisping effect of teeth on tongue nevertheless i did comfort myself with the knowledge that all would die , if not soon enough to suit me why these near nightly rages on the road , i do n't know they were not manic , just a feeling of general anger towards everything , cheap motels , fast food , ungrateful children and obtuse others , all the while suffering pain , emotional and physical , while on limited means on what seemed an interminable road trip to long beach , ca , even if no major snafus occurred i would n't have missed my baby 's graduation , but i would n't do it again , either i think my anger may have been warning me about my grief , particularly over the fortunes of my eldest daughter of late , whose care on the trip exhausted me but i 'll keep her secrets for now , even if she is fond of broadcasting them every time i think i have come to accept her as she is , she finds some new hot buttons to push she 's gifted that way yes , she 's the redhead in the picture at the top right of the blog back to the meds when i had no cymbalta for two days i sank into a depressive episode , weeping for half an hour , struggling not to let any verbal equivalents enter my brain , as in you 're worthless you suck you 've never done anything you despise your own children no , i did n't let the lies of the frontal cortex insinuate themselves into the vortex of my lizard brain , thus was proud i could recognize my depressive seizure as just that , an uncontrollable outpouring of emotion unrelated to any specific thing i also had the wherewithal to call my doctor for a short term supply until the cheaper meds from canada arrive i got these yesterday afternoon and then proceeded to twitch so badly i had to sleep apart from my wife this is an early side effect of some antidepressants , but thank god , it means they are starting to work i sometimes think that part of manic depression is a complete disconnect , in time , between the emotions one should naturally experience and a safe time to let them out so , for example , i could go tight lipped through a funeral and weep at a video arcade a month later once i even thought i had come closer to integrating my emotions better in regard to circumstances , but i fear for us bipolars this is a chimera it 's as if we build up mountains of rage and chasms of grief of which we are consciously unaware , and one day we smack into them and all hell breaks loose chemically , from the standpoint of the actual illness , this likely holds little scientific truth , but it is a useful metaphor for conceptualizing how the phenomenon sometimes feels in the end manic depression is really just bad genes and bad luck in the face of yesterday 's weeping seizure , i found a poem by fred pluto that spoke to me of the matter the fever marches on there can be no refund for your parents or your children , no jeweled compensation for their liver piercing defects though your hepatic perforations leak like christ s wounded side but if you were the christ would you suffer any more ? and what about the spikes you drove into their palms you thought justified , now long forgotten ? your hands are not uncontaminated think what infections linger now it was n't entirely my fault that i was out of meds , but first a cautionary note if you respond to an antidepressant and go off of it , your chances of responding to it a second time are much reduced since cymbalta was the only thing i responded to after a year 's misery , even missing one day was inexcusable but that 's all i missed so whoever reads this post , remember to take your medications faithfully , especially if you suffer a mood disorder thine as ever , ce
