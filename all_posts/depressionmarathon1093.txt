i began this blog one year ago , january , at the time , i did n't know a thing about blogging i did n't have a clue how to create , organize , or program a blog i knew nothing about attaching files , creating links , downloading videos , posting pictures , defining keywords , or understanding statistics readers , followers , feeds and subscribers were all foreign concepts i am somewhat amazed to be here , now , days later while i knew little about blogging , i did have a fairly clear idea of my motives one year ago i 've been reflecting on those motives the past couple days i created this blog out of my passion to educate others about depression and mental illness i hoped to connect with others who ran , trained , and raced despite suffering chronic mental illness i wanted to enlighten the world about the inadequate healthcare coverage , nonexistent job security , and tremendous financial struggles faced by those with mental illness i planned to highlight stigma and discrimination over time , i discovered my desire to focus on recovery from , rather than wallowing in , these difficulties slowly , i attempted to incorporate an attitude of gratitude and tried to focus more on coping , solutions , and support depression sucks , but it does n't mean our lives must suck all the time the only reason i am still alive today is because i 've learned to cope with this shitty illness ! i hope this blog has helped at least a couple of you , too i'm proud to be writing here one year later i'm pleased a few of you have found me , commented , subscribed , and hopefully found something useful in my words i always enjoy hearing from you , and your comments have supported me more than you will ever know i am not an expert on depression , mental illness or recovery , but i am an expert on my mental illness and recovery most of the time ! if you discovered something in my experience which resonated with you , helped or enlightened you i could n't ask for more than that i thank you all for sticking with me throughout i 'll be here tomorrow , and i hope you will be , too
