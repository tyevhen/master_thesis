recently i 've fallen down the rabbit hole it looks like i 've been making progress , but inside i feel worse than ever other people have such busy lives and yet i feel exhausted at the thought of my minor commitment to writing one blog post a week although i know people read the blog i do n't get much feedback from people i can understand why , especially if readers are experiencing similar problems to my own , it can be scary and hard to speak up , even online i have thousands of page views , yet i feel like no one is out there i hear no reply when i call out , but i never want to skip a week of posting i do n't care about how many followers i have on various social media platforms , i'm not the type of person or blogger that is driven by gaining hundreds of followers of course each page view and follower i do have i am very grateful for the thing that keeps me going and motivates me is the idea and hope that at least one person benefits from reading these posts , that makes it all worthwhile to me my apologies if these ramblings do n't make sense , my waking hours are few in number these days you 'd think i 'd be bright eyed and alert , but i'm more tired than ever and it only takes me being up for an hour before i'm crawling back upstairs to bed of course it can be motivating , inspiring and uplifting to read the words of someone who is recovering from a mental illness it provides hope and confidence that you too will succeed in defeating the dark monster i used to find it equally helpful and reassuring to read about other people 's worst times too sounds terrible to most people , but just knowing that you are n't alone in what you 're feeling can also be helpful my cheery thoughts this week are on some of the simple truths of depression i'm overwhelmed by everything , yet i have nothing going on in my life i frequently feel very lonely , but i'm terrified of leaving the house and meeting new people i want to be up and about getting on with tasks , but i'm confined to my bed i want to watch a funny film , but even the lighthearted moments make me sad my mind is racing , but i ca n't fixate on a single thought i do n't want to waste time , yet i sleep the day away i feel disgusting , but i do n't have the strength to stand in the shower i have lots of ideas but no self belief my life is n't bad , but i'm so unhappy
