graham wrote in a question ok , so since it was a pretty generic post , i'm going to ask a question of you three that 's pretty far off topic why do you think mao inhibitors are so infrequently used in psychiatric practice today ? besides dietary drug interactions , their safety profile is good there are masses of studies showing efficacy why switch patients from one ssri tca to another to another instead of trying a mao inhibitor do you think maoi 's have a place as second line agents in certain circumstances ? what a great question , i 've been thinking about this one for a bit and this is what i 've come to i do n't use monoamine oxidase inhibitors maoi 's to treat depression or anxiety , though from time to time , i think about it why not ? it 's a really good question , they are really good medications , sometimes helpful when other meds do n't work , and lore has it that they are helpful with rejection sensitivity in patients with borderline personality disorder so why do n't i use them ? they are dangerous in combination with a bunch of foods aged cheeses , certain red wines , fava beans , and i 'd have to look up the rest of the list it includes medications , even some over the counter medicines accidental or purposeful ingestion of these substances in combo with maoi 's can lead to hypertensive crises think stroke and death this makes me a little wary pure gut bad association at the hospital where i went to medical school , the young daughter of a new york times editor died the combination of maoi 's and prescribed demerol were thought to play a role in her death i do n't like to give patients medicines that they can easily fatally overdose on my own naivete by the time i started residency training in psychiatry , ssris were hot many patients were on tca 's tricyclic antidepressants , and you can od on these , too i saw two patients in my residency on maois i 've worked in different clinics , each with an active caseload of about , patients there was one patient in the first clinic i worked in on an maoi i 've never seen the chart of any other patient treated at any of these clinics with an maoi okay , i have n't seen any patient 's chart , but the point here is that i'm just not familiar with them , so they are n't my first second third fourth choices for treatment should they be ? once you 've used an ssri , you have to wait weeks to use an maoi , not always an easy prospect for a depressed patient thanks graham , i'm running my next sidebar poll in your honor !
