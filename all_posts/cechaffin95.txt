here 's today 's poem another definition two stellar 's jays perched beside the blackberry bramble , black mohawks shining above metallic blue feathers , mendocino blue ocean behind such beauty wed to such an irritating squawk like a beautiful woman with a high nasal pitch and a strong bronx accent who wo n't stop talking until her defects collect in your mind and you are forced into another definition of beauty i know the stanzas lack verbs to make them complete sentences , but hey , poetic license but surely both men and women know the phenomenon of which i speak , where the outward beauty of a person transfixes you until they open their mouth , whereupon the pitch or accent or absence of any substance slowly deflates your initial impression until you wish they were just a silent playboy doll real beauty is often not symmetric think of ingrid bergman 's nose or meryl streep 's face , women i consider beauties , or how everything about sophia loren 's face is too big nose , ears , lips , eyes but the whole leaves you with such a wonderful impression pretty faces are a dime a dozen true beauty includes character in fact , until someone reaches their mid to late thirties , can beauty even be intuited without character ? i suppose so back to meryl streep or glenn close angelina jolie is sultry but is she beautiful ? besides her pumped up lips , she has nice features but she does not strike me as beautiful , or handsome , or even pretty more sexy , alluring , even a little wicked i was once considered good looking in my pre pubertal days in second grade ten girls even held me down , struggling , so loretta could kiss me but after puberty my looks went , somehow all our features get larger as adults , and it 's the premature bags under my eyes that really did me in besides , my face except for character is so terribly average , as this picture will show this in turn reminds me of a poem that has not been published , maybe never will be , but as it is virtually my only self portrait i post it here reflection see mine , in the window there , beard quilled in white ? above , a vast forehead like a desert as if the skull were pushing through ? right , a scar from cops' batons extends my eyebrow , and my mustache is split by a brass knuckle 's kiss the right eye 's green , the left is blue with crow 's feet spread out like shatter proof glass shattered , then all the luggage below , harvest of late nights drinking nose , flat and aboriginal , strong even teeth but yellowed by smoke and coffee , wide smile , full lips upcurling at the corners laugh lines outnumber other furrows though puzzlement grooves much not a rich man 's face , it lacks a certain earthly satisfaction i hope is free of envy ii the poor you have with you always , the rich man ca n't help but rub it in , his mere existence fathers envy which powers ambition which feeds achievement which seeks comparisons which breed dissatisfaction , giving birth to envy it 's not the thorn against the rose but both against the deer the deer make them equals and the sun , confederates iii on and on the human engine runs toward the swimming pool purchased on credit from a second mortgage , toward the notion that having all might cure not having all on we fly like wasps disturbed by a lawnmower , no furies needed but our lusts the ouroboros of desire , lugubriously predictable how much is that buddha in the window ? again i would remind you of this month 's contest send your best poem , published or unpublished , to cechaffin at gmail dot com for a chance to win one of two signed hardback copies of my new book , pictured above days off cigarettes and i made a mistake today i had been saving a fine onyx cigar for the occasion of my quitting cigarettes , but smoking it this morning on the porch while reading william mcneil 's world history only inflamed my desire for tobacco , duh if i had a terminal illness i would take up smoking again , truly as i prefer the best hand rolling tobacco , on april the taxes on it went up astronomically by a pound packs of cigarettes will now exceed in california as i recall , new york is even worse but what can you do if you 're an addict ? quit , pay the price , or make contact with smugglers from mexico where cigarettes are still under a pack some of you may remember when i posted my long poem , the deprivathon , here it was all about quitting but i managed to start again here 's a link to the page where the poem appears entire for any interested it is not my best work , though inspired pun intended in places in fact , here 's one movement from it vi i saw the spirit of fire , tobaccohontas in her coronet of coals dancing in a leaf skirt of golden brown , her incendiary thighs burning burning burning before her only god breathed fire afterwards came dragons , venomous snakes and toads finally man 's penis swelled and woman 's labia grew bloody purple , pink and wet i heard tobaccohontas speak i burn for you , brave do not forget your love cleave me with your tomahawk , undo the seam so lightly stitched by nature or my own nails will ream it , drive your spear into the ravenous slit beneath the golden curls of my mons , pound me as a bear ruts a sow in a ditch littered with acorns and salmon bones my mouths have swallowed the seed of many warriors , come ah , tobaccohontas , i once fingered your moist fragrance in blue pouches of drum tobacco your scent still calls to me from the tent of the elders with their pipe of bone and feathers but moderation is beyond me i must devour and be devoured hear me now my lava grows hard in your ocean your undersea cleft shapes me my tip breaks off like a coal in your wet purse i shudder , deflate and die you are the siren of my death i stub you out in ashtrays as if they were vampire coffins through which to pound my filter now i can only inhale the memory of your forbidden pleasure and cast its usage toward some future beyond obsession forgive me princess you were the best now i 've certainly given you enough to read for one day the key to quitting smoking , i 've discovered , is not to smoke no matter what and if you do stumble and bum one , get right back on the horse do n't globalize and say , oh , i 've started again no , that is what your unconscious wishes through its chemical addiction reason tells us that we can quit again and again and again and if we quit enough the moments shall be sewn together and formed into a pleasant curve as in the calculus at kilobunny though feeling a little edgy despite the nicotine patch , ce
