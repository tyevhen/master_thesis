whenever i hear people saying things like unschooling obviously would n't work for everyone , but parents should have a right to choose what 's best for their kids , or one of the hundred other variants on that same sentiment , i always feeling a niggling sense of unease it 's never a statement i 've agreed with but until recently , i was n't entirely sure why it bothered me ! i mean , there 's the obvious in that i believe unschooling can work for anyone , as unschooling is really free choice in education , so a child could choose something very structured , like their parent teaching them with a curriculum or going to school but there was something more than that bothering me , and i only realized yesterday what it was that type of statement puts the focus on parental rights it 's a parents right to educate their children however they choose ! but to me ? unschooling is n't about parental rights it 's about children 's rights a childs right to choose their own path in life , with the support and assistance of parental or other care giving figures in their life me and my sister , playing on the beach i needed a picture of kids , so why not one of my sis and i ? in a society where children are truly an oppressed class , denied the rights given to older people , i suppose it should n't be surprising that something i see as potentially majorly liberating for children , the right to take control of their own education , is couched as being a parental right instead for sure , i think it 's important for parents to have the right to make decisions about their children 's care , instead of the government or other powerful institutions , but in talking about a parents right to unschool , i feel like we 're taking away the power , in words at the very least , and words to a large extent shape thoughts , from the children themselves and that 's definitely not something i think anyone should be doing am i , once again , just quibbling over small details in the language used ? perhaps but when something unsettles me , even if it seems like just a small something , i feel it 's important to examine why , and i often just like working out or sharing my reasoning here on the blog ! you might also like review of a rule is to break a child 's guide to anarchy youth rights , community , and why everyone should care emotional health and the power of choice , or why kids favorite unschooling posts on this blog of linkwithin
