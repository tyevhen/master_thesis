sometimes it is the mistakes and misfortunes of others which remind us how good our life currently is whether it 's the relapse of a fellow alcoholic , or as i found out today , potential bone cancer in a friend 's year old canine companion , observing others work through their difficulties nudges me into an attitude of gratitude life is weird that way life lessons come from strange and unexpected places sometimes as long as i remain open and willing to learn , the big book of aa promises , we will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us that promise has certainly been realized in my life i am grateful for that observing others , and reflecting on these past years , highlights how much opportunity to grow i 've been given and i have grown boy , have i grown ! oddly enough , and i 've spoken about this before , much of my growth has come as a direct result of having depression and being an alcoholic i'm grateful for the growth of course i had opportunities to grow earlier in life , pre depression and pre alcoholism , but apparently i was too thick to notice i know i was unwilling to learn ! perhaps i needed the stronger motivation , and i certainly received it i never thought i 'd be grateful to be an alcoholic or to have depression , but the misfortunes of others remind me things could be worse in the past , things have been worse for me , too but today i have a good life , and i'm grateful for that i'm grateful for my journey through depression and alcoholism i 've received many gifts as a result of these illnesses i 've crossed paths with and come to know many wonderful people i 've reestablished loving relationships with family , especially my mother i 've regained my competitive running i 've learned the tools to deal with situations which used to baffle me i 've raised a loving canine companion and despite his painful loss , i'm in the process of raising another i 've developed a relationship with a caring man and i 've returned to working in a profession i love i have food on my table and heat in my house life is good thanks for the reminders , god
