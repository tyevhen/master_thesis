i 've put on some running and biking miles recently i ran miles today it was cold and very windy not at all like a may day should be , so it was a rough run my hip , however , felt okay good news it 's a bit sore now , but it does feel better than i thought it might i rode my new bike for the first time a couple days ago figuring i 'd fall over at stop lights , i headed out on a local trail instead no stoplights no cars very few people i rode miles it was weird riding in that low , aerodynamic position i could n't get used to barely being able to see feet in front of me i kept lifting my head to get a broader view and ended up with a really sore neck in fact , it 's still sore today ! i had a complete fitting , so it 's not a case of the bike not fitting well if any of you ride a tri bike , i 'd love to know how you got used to it back to running now for those of you who 've followed the discussion accompanying my post , having imprudent running thoughts , i 've made the decision not to run the inagural minneapolis marathon later this month as much as i 'd like to participate , i decided not to run for a couple reasons first , the marathon course appears to be fairly hilly i'm not sure i want to put my legs through a hilly course only weeks before my goal race at grandma 's secondly , i know myself too well i do n't think i could run in a race and not race i 'd certainly run too fast and spoil my chances to qualify for boston at grandma 's maybe i 'll run a foolish marathon a few weeks after grandma 's instead ! as for my mood still okay yippee !
