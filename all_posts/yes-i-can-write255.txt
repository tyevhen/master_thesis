i do n't feel that poetry writing is my strong point however , i really enjoy it and i want to get better ! so i actually made a new years resolution that i really , really want to keep , and that is to write some poetry every day it could only be two lines the point is to make sure i write something ! i have a pretty new notebook , with two pages , from the last two days , filled up already and , since i find that posting stuff online can be a tool for keeping me accountable in my personal goals , i'm going to be posting my daily scribblings on my poetry blog now , i hesitated before mentioning it on this blog , because i really feel that most of the poetic stuff i write is crap ! but , well , i finally decided to mention it anyway now off to bed after a long night spent around lots of people , because i am truly exhausted peace , idzie p s while i'm on the subject of blogs , my blog adventures in the accumulation of trash is , as i'm sure you 've noticed if you 've been over there in the last well , forever , entirely inactive i'm not quite ready to delete it , but it looks like it will remain inactive for the foreseeable future my book review blog , frequently magic has also kind of failed i may decide to resurrect it soon , though i 'll see how i feel my photo blog awkward angles should have more updates soon , as i attempt to actually complete the photo a day challenge this year ! you might also like poetry poetry blog musings on poetry snow , shovelling , and poetry linkwithin
