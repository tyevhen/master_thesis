pop culture is full of terrible things all of which have been combined here for your viewing pleasure the various entertainment industries of the world are just that industries they exist to make money the artistic advancement of mankind is all well and fine , but at the end of the day , people care more about paying their rent and buying their gold plated yachts than they do about creating artistically integral masterpieces for future generations to enjoy to be successful , you 've got to capture as much interest as possible , and to capture the interest of millions , you have to appeal to the least common denominator above the least common denominator and so our tv stations and ipods are bombarded with trash , junk , more trash , garbage , teen mom and crap but it 's not all bad if you take a break from mourning the loss of breaking bad and googling game of thrones spoilers , you might find some hidden gems in the sewer of pop culture gems like glee for those of you who spent in a coma , glee is what happens when television producers vomit every known modern social issue onto a stack of kidz bop cds and pay acclaimed broadway actors to help them do it in the five years that the show has been on the air , it has gone from a quirky re imagining of fame to a veritable musical hot dog eating contest of teen angst and hastily shat out music mash ups if you flip on the news one night and see a story about a heroine addicted transvestite getting into a head on collision with a minivan full of paraplegic dwarfs on her way to audition for spiderman turn off the dark , you can bet that somewhere out there , a glee writer is watching , frantically masturbating with one hand and penning an episode with the other i went to a high school that openly encouraged its students to partake in half naked kiddie pool oatmeal wrestling for the amusement of the students and staff , but in comparison to mckinley high , i might as well have attended a victorian era finishing school remember that time your high school teacher dressed you in a bondage angel costume and made you sing while your underage classmates writhed around in cages and steam baths ? and that 's what makes glee so great watching the producers try to keep the show on the air is like watching a five year long train accident in slow motion you want to look away , but you just ca n't glee has its own law of probability anything that can happen and can be slipped past the censors will eventually happen they 've got everything you could ever ask for in a high school themed show teen pregnancy ? check teen marriage ? yep heinously uncomfortable depictions of people of various ages losing their virginity ? brace yourself , they 've got it in spades a teenager mentally succumbing to the pressures of leading a competitive show choir by entering into an unhealthy relationship with a puppet ? girl , please yeah that happened the entire show is a glorious frenzy of impossibly strange characters and increasingly half baked subplots that attempt to cover the entire spectrum of the youth experience in one hour celebrations of short attention spans if you started a letter writing campaign to the show claiming that you were absolutely appalled by their failure to recognize the presence of musically gifted albinos in american high schools , i'm almost certain that they 'd bring out a perfectly choreographed troupe of emotionally stunted teenage albinos , just to make sure you keep watching at its current pace , the show is just going to continue to pile on characters and conflicts and plots and relationships and breakups and songs and defeats and wins and competitions and rivalries and friendships and dance routines until it implodes in on itself like a proverbial dying star ke ha if you gave me a fast food dumpster , a feral raccoon and unlimited access to the used mattresses of homeless people , i still could n't devise a way to be as repulsive as ke ha every time she shows up in front of a camera , she 's frantically slathering herself with miscellaneous filth like she 's singlehandedly trying to breed smallpox back into existence she makes so many references to doing drugs that it 's impossible for her to tell if the little crawling sensation she constantly feels is a hallucination or a particularly aggressive infestation of body lice her music is mostly a combination of dial up internet tones and white girl rapping that would make tupac shakur want to dig himself out of his grave and die all over again any attempts to get a handle on ke ha have been miserable failures , as she appears to repel both water and sense looking this dirty in a bathtub is actually a life skill which is exactly why ke ha is my spirit animal she 's a genius , in both the got an almost perfect score on her sats sense and the discovered the cheat codes to the music industry sense it 's pretty obvious that ke ha gives exactly no fucks , and most importantly , she 's fully aware that at this point in her career , giving a fuck is no longer a requirement she can do literally anything she wants to she can metal plate the side of her head , smear glitter on her crotch and teach her six year old fans eighteen new euphemisms for 'vagina' because she knows the world will actually reward her for this behavior she once wrote a half joking post on facebook , asking fans to mail her human teeth , and they did as long as she stays on this side of the line between functional human and coke whore , she gets to live a dream life where she earns millions of dollars for purposely experimenting with the limits of what the public will buy you and i can only aspire to that kind of unbridled , free range public lunacy admit it you have no idea what 's going on here , but you want to be there and make no mistake , ke ha 's career is her own doing she 's not a skinny blonde puppet dancing on the strings of a desperate record executive ke ha learned songwriting at her mother 's knee , and she 's personally penned everything that shows up on her albums , which is more than a vast majority of current recording artists can claim i 've been to a ke ha concert because my admiration of this woman is genuine and i'm delighted to report that it was a two hour spectacle of body paint , stolen pants and backup dancers in penis costumes there 's no way that ke ha 's alleged hard partying lifestyle of brushing with whiskey and peeing in sinks is anything more than a brilliantly calculated act in an age where even ordinary people have their entire lives documented , ke ha has never had even so much as a parking ticket come to light she leads a relatively tame , legal private life while convincing millions that she spends her weeknights humping barnyard animals and mainlining jack daniels , just because she can which is awesome maury if you 've never been bored and channel surfing at two in the morning , let 's do a quick run down of what maury is all about the half fossilized maury povich runs a talk show on which the coffee grounds of humanity come to air their dirty laundry and foist their mystery offspring on the near strangers they once bumped uglies with like the jerry springer show , maury is the olympics of human debauchery , featuring events like confessing to infidelity , revealing dubious parentage , reigning in hostile teenagers and broadcasting incredibly toxic relationships the thing that really sets maury apart , however , is the use of dna tests again and again , women get up in front of gigantic photos of their infants and the alleged fathers and dazzle america with their profound misunderstanding of how genetics works they point out the fact that both individuals have nostrils , chins , and openings in their faces for eating food , proclaim themselves to be roughly sure of paternity , and take a seat to await the results of the dna test if watson and crick had known that their groundbreaking discovery was going to be used like this , they 'd have thrown their nobel prizes into the ocean seeking out more fine individuals to appear on the show maury is the closest that modern society has ever come to putting people in a zoo somehow or other , the producers seek out the absolute dregs of humanity , toss them aside , and track down people with even worse problems to come and discuss their personal issues in the most public venue possible if you are ever having a particularly bad week , maury is the best pick me up you could hope for feeling stressed about an exam ? this women has a pathological fear of chickens ! got into a car accident ? this man is leaving his wife for a gay prostitute ! accidentally triggered the robot uprising ? this women can name fifteen potential candidates for her son 's father , and the real father still is n't among them the whole show is a gigantic , decades long case study on the scope of human depravity , with just enough shouting and preview clips to keep you from thinking about pesky things like the effects of poverty and lack of equal access to opportunity and getting too sad child exploitation , or potential subject of a master 's thesis ? you decide ! the great thing about the show is that there seems to be no end to the rabbit hole of uneducated people with complicated love lives one year , they 'll parade around some sexually active year olds then they 'll find sixteen year olds with children then fifteen year olds eventually , they end up marching out a group of sexually active , bisexual , drug addicted thirteen year old dropouts with full fledged prostitution careers who answer to real life pimps at any point in time , they are one bearded lady away from being technically classified as a circus sideshow act if you 're clever enough to know what the word schadenfreude means , you probably think you 're far too sophisticated to trifle with trashy cable television trust me , my friend you are not no one is ever too good for maury honey boo boo alana honey boo boo thompson is a former child beauty pageant contestant and current star of the reality spectacle here comes honey boo boo , and i'm not going to insult her because seriously , people , she 's years old i have limits the show takes place somewhere so far into the asscrack of the deep south that all of the show 's cast require subtitles to be understood , and the only acceptable forms of locomotion appear to be tractor or truck the episodes mostly revolve around the daily life of the thompson family , which consists of honey boo boo , her three half sisters , her infant niece , her toothless father , and a giant talking thumb you knew who i was referring to whenever honey boo boo is mentioned , it 's usually accompanied by a reference to some sort of cultural apocalypse here 's a word of advice if you 've ever heard honey boo boo hailed as a sign of the end of days , i can guarantee you that the person talking has never actually sat through an episode the thompsons have a better family life than half of the people reading this there 's no abuse , no serious dysfunction , no use of drugs or alcohol , not a lot of fighting , and everyone in the house seems pretty darn content there is absolutely no sex , nudity , blasphemy , racism , sexism , lewdness or indecency honey boo boo 's parents are happily together , and 'sugar bear' raises the other three girls as his own with no complaints when the worst things you can say about mama june is that she uses a lot of coupons and lets her children drink caffeinated beverages , you had best step away from your own glass house before you start picking up stones she puts every cent the family earns from the show into trust funds for her children , and continues to live off the family 's regular income in fact , she 's such an effective parent , most casual viewers of the show have no idea she 's blind and now you feel bad for laughing at the thumb joke but what makes honey boo boo awesome is n't its surprising adherence to traditional family values it 's the fact that everything the thompson family touches turns to weird mama june , as mentioned , is legally blind due to untreated childhood cataracts , and has unspecified foot problems from an also unspecified forklift accident pumpkin , the eccentric middle child of the family , has never been quite right after being electrocuted by lightning while playing a video game mike sugar bear thompson is a human medical textbook , having suffered from an atv accident , a diabetic episode , pancreatitis and an undiagnosable neurological condition in the course of less than a year they ca n't even reproduce without things going awry baby kaitlin , honey boo boo 's niece , was born with an extra thumb these are n't things the producers can stage to drum up interest in the show this family apparently spends their weekends desecrating indian burial grounds , because they have some of the worst luck that any family could have , and it shows no signs of slowing down these are my favourite guilty pleasures what are yours ? tell me about the terrible things you think are awesome in the comments
