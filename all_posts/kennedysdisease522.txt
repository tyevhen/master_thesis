the video is a minute tour of the international space station given by the departing commander she was leaving for earth the day this is shot she shows how they sleep , exercise , use the bathroom , eat , perform experiments , dock , get rid of their trash , arrive and depart , and a whole lot more seeing everyone floating around and the commander mimicking superman was pretty cool watching this video was an incredible experience this is the best video i have seen and it visually explains what life is like living aboard the space station if you are claustrophobic , you wouldn t do well but , the idea of not having gravity holding you down is somewhat appealing for those of us living with kennedy 's disease i highly recommend the video so , sit back and relax and see what life is really like in space https www youtube com embed dontnkw k
