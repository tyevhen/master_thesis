the journal of clinical psychiatry october has an article comparing haloperidol haldol , risperidone risperdal , and olanzapine zyprexa in treating first episode psychosis this is a great design because patients were medication na ve they had not taken antipsychotic meds before the results on all outcome measures , there was no significant difference between medications they were equally effective for side effects , haloperidol caused more extrapyramidal side effects and both risperdal and olanzapine caused more weight gain especially olanzapine again , patients on the vastly more expensive second generation antipsychotics essentially fare no better than patients on the older medication don t take this as a ringing endorsement of older meds medications that cause heinous extrapyramidal side effects among a host of other unpleasant effects are certainly a mixed blessing i ve posted extensively about second generation antipsychotics feel free to read about them here , here , here , here and here
