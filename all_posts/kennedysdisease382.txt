over the last couple of weeks i received two emails from women asking if they could have kennedy s disease both women thought that it only affected men one woman had previously been diagnosed with als not gender specific kennedy s disease is not gender specific both men and women can have the defective x chromosome gene it is rare , however , for women to show symptoms until later in their life also , symptoms for a woman are generally less severe my mother , for example , began to experience leg weakness and twitching in her early s she also began experiencing swallowing issues the symptoms are caused because the mutated gene cannot process testosterone correctly do its job and , since men normally have higher levels of testosterone , the symptoms are more severe and begin to show up earlier in life dna test women are tested for kennedy s disease the same way as men your family doctor can draw the blood and send it to a dna lab for analysis if your doctor is unfamiliar with kennedy s disease , you might want to print this web page that explains the dna test http www athenadiagnostics com content test catalog find test service detail q id a dna blood test normally takes about weeks genetics since the disease is genetic , both men and women can pass the defective x chromosome gene on to their children women are considered carriers normally , they have one healthy and one defective x chromosome there are very rare cases where a woman has two defective x chromosomes a carrier can pass either a healthy or a defective x chromosome on to her children son or daughter a man with the defective gene can only pass the defective chromosome on to his daughters the genetic chart below shows how this can happen should you have any questions , please don t hesitate to ask if i don t know the answer , i will try to find someone that can answer it for you
