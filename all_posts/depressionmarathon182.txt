tomorrow is the day i begin some semblance of normalcy again i am returning to a regular work schedule , and i'm jumping right in i am scheduled to work hour shifts three of the next four days that 's more than i 've worked in a week since i got sick in late july i'm a little nervous about it , which is why i'm writing about it here i hope getting the worry off my chest will help me navigate the next four days with skill and composure while i'm looking forward to getting back to work , earning some much needed money , and interacting with my patients and coworkers again , i also have fears i fear the full days with little rest will be tough on me physically and mentally i worry about not being able to handle whatever is thrown my way i worry about fatigue and mental stress i fear the ever looming potential set back i am battling the fears i'm trying not to give them too much time or space in my brain i'm focusing instead on what i can control i 've already packed my lunch and laid out my clothes for tomorrow sounds silly , but the less i have to organize in the morning the better my day goes being organized deletes early morning stress , and that translates to more energy i can dedicate to work i'm going to need that energy having enough energy is a huge concern i ca n't control whether or not i will get fatigued , but i'm expecting it i think that 's realistic i wo n't be surprised , and i'm already accepting that i may not be able to do as much , like exercise , over the next several days i 'll do what i can , but i'm focusing on work now perhaps after a few weeks of a regular employment schedule i can refocus on fitting in my extracurricular activities staying healthy is all about balance for me i have a feeling the next several days will be slightly out of balance i may feel more stress i may be fatigued i may not spend as much time exercising , taking care of the house and yard , or spending time with jet , but it will be temporary i have to remember that if i continue to focus on the things i can control and quell worry about the things i ca n't i think i will be okay that 's my hope anyway i 'll let you know how i do
