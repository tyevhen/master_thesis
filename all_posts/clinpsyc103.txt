in july , i posted about a very strangely designed study that claimed to show abilify was an effective treatment for depression when added to antidepressant medication here is what i wrote about it then study design patients were initially assigned to receive an antidepressant plus a placebo for eight weeks those who failed to respond to treatment were assigned to abilify antidepressant or placebo antidepressant those who responded during the initial weeks were then eliminated from the study so we 've already established that antidepressant placebo did n't work for these people yet they were then assigned to treatment for weeks with the same treatment ! and compared to those who were assigned antidepressant abilify so the antidepressant placebo group started at a huge disadvantage because it was already established that they did not respond well to such a treatment regimen no wonder abilify came out on top albeit by a modest margin here 's an analogy a group of students is assigned to be tutored by tutor a regarding math the students are all tutored for weeks the students whose math skills improve are sent on their merry way that leaves students who did not improve under tutor a 's tutelage so tutor b comes along to tutor of these students , while tutor a sticks with of them tutor b 's students do somewhat better than tutor a 's students on a math test weeks later is tutor b better than tutor a ? not really a fair comparison between tutor a and tutor b , is it ? well , these experts in study design decided that once was just not enough , so they ran the same exact study twice same huge design flaw similar results the results are posted in the journal of clinical psychopharmacology by a statistically significant , though not overwhelming margin , those on abilify antidepressant improved more than those on antidepressant placebo or did they ? dear patients we do n't care what you say on depression measures rated by clinicians , patients did modestly better on abilify but on measures completed by the patients , there was no statistically significant difference between abilify antidepressant vs placebo antidepressant so the patients did n't actually perceive themselves as being less depressed um , should n't the opinion of the patients matter ? the message that the authors are trying to make is that the opinion of the clinical raters matters much more than the opinions of patients , which strikes me as ludicrous these people are depressed , not floridly psychotic , so i think they would have a pretty decent idea as to their mental health status the authors attempted to explain this inconvenient finding away as follows these patient rated scales were included for exploratory purposes , and the lack of emphasis on these ratings may have contributed to increased variance the corresponding clinician rated versions were not included , which may have hindered patients in responding accurately to the self rated version i'm really confused here what do they mean that a lack of emphasis resulted in increased variance ? and as for accusing the patients of not completing the ratings accurately , that just sounds like sour grapes to me if there was a significant difference favoring abilify , you can bet your life savings that the authors would not have accused the patients of reporting inaccurately only if a drug is shown to not work can we accuse patients of inaccurate reporting because all new drugs must work such is the dogma of modern day psychopharmacology gone wild the authors close their paper with the following jewel given the public health challenge of antidepressant nonresponse , this is a significant clinical finding we 're getting knee deep in bogus public health claims these days even though patients do n't perceive that they improved any more on abilify relative to a placebo , this is a significant benefit to public health ? you bet if someone has a defense for designing a study in such a manner , i'm all ears , but this really looks like a blatantly biased study that still managed to find no benefit according to patients in using abilify
