on december , , my youngest brother had his first child i have nieces and nephews , and with the exception of the aforementioned nephew , i do n't know any of their birth dates truthfully , i do n't even know exactly how old most of them are but i 'll never forget evan 's first day , because december , , was also the first day of the rest of my life today evan turned , and today i celebrated years of sobriety there is no relation between evan 's birth and my last drink in fact , it took me a few years to even realize we shared this special day nonetheless , we both turned today it is a special day to say i'm amazed i'm sober today is a huge understatement my first years of sobriety were rocky i was stubborn and self centered i did n't want to be an alcoholic , and i sure did n't want to listen to anyone who thought they might have a solution ! i was sure i was different i did n't need any help after all , i was a professional i had a car , and a home , and food on my table i 'd never been arrested for drunk driving i had n't lost family and friends because of my drinking how could i be an alcoholic ? despite my severe case of terminal uniqueness , i somehow made it through those early years i stuck around the people with the solution long enough , even though i did n't want nor think i needed to be there , that some of the solution actually began to sink in i shut my mouth and opened my ears i became willing these sober people had lives i wanted to live they were people of character , compassion and love and most of them had recovered from more difficult circumstances than my drinking had ever imposed upon me i was , i figured out , lucky to have arrived when i did if i had continued drinking years ago i would not have been able to avoid a much darker fate actually , if i had continued drinking i'm certain i would n't be alive today the combination of depression and alcoholism would likely have taken my life years ago i am so grateful i hung around , opened my ears , and eventually took the suggestions offered to me i did n't just stop drinking i changed i became a kinder , more gentle human being i learned to live life on life 's terms i am the person i am today because i am sober it is a special day today years sober more grateful i could not be
