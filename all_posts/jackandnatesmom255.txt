i was just browsing on etsy looking for some fun things for nate 's big boy room , which is almost done it is brown and blue with stars and monkeys in it i know sounds kinda odd , but it all does come together i swear those are two things that i am sure that he likes , so that 's how it 's gonna be i have been focusing on this aspect lately because i have been frustrated with what feels like yet another stall in language development for nate say some prayers for him i hope he is just getting over being sick , adjusting to the new supplements , etc anyway , i saw this picture on etsy , totally does n't go with the decor in his room , wrong color , wrong theme , but the quote just struck me as nathan through and through nathan is singing his song , it 's just not quite the one i wanted or was expecting time to take a deep breath and take another step towards acceptance this picture may end up in his room after all
