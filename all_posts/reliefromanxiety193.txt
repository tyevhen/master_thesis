whenever someone thinks of anxiety , the first thing that usually comes to the mind is 'worry' yes , it is true that most of us anxiety sufferers worry , but not all in the way you 'd expect there are so many types of anxiety disorders that people 's worries can come in all shapes and forms , whether that 's through health anxiety or panic disorder and there may be certain triggers but , even if this is the case everyday we are prone to worry and many people have asked me how best to stop worrying , so i have compiled a few tips that may help you write down your worries writing you problems down not only relieves the stress , but if you organise them too , you can start a plan of action to combat your troubles one day at a time often when you look at the big picture , you will start to become overwhelmed i know the feeling ! thus , by taking one day at at time organising that day and only focusing on what you are capable of doing in that day , you will be in control talking often when you talk to someone else about a problem , they may have a few wise words which may help you see things in a different light i understand that not everyone has somebody to talk to , but there are charities if you feel you can talk to no one else yoga this may not be for you , but i often find that when you do yoga , you can have some piece of mind for a few minutes alongside this , you will be able to relax understand the most important , but perhaps hardest thing to grasp is that worrying does n't change a thing a very famous speech titled 'wear sunscreen' noted worrying is as useful as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum in other words , it does n't change a thing there are absolutely no benefits from worry thus , it might be better to go with the flow best wishes , amy xx
