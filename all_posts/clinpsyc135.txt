bernard carroll , a psychiatrist who is known for laying down the smack on drug industry spin , has a fantastic post at health care renewal that should be read by all it deals with the marketing and science surrounding the use of risperdal for treatment resistant depression , a topic i 've discussed at length on this site previously teaser the campaign aims to shape a favorable climate of opinion for the drug through experimercials commercially strategic clinical trials and journal publications that are really infomercials the stakeholders are some major corporations , key opinion leaders kols , leading medical journals , and several million patients who suffer from nonresponsive depression in the us the winners are the kols and the corporations , while the big losers are the patients the plot thickens you begin to see the picture we have the appearance of editorial self dealing , including product placement for a corporate client of the editor an incompetent or possibly dishonest journal review process and the appearance that somebody went out of his way in two places to insert a false claim of efficacy into the report of a negative clinical trial the depth of reporting is excellent i can vouch for the dr carroll 's analysis of the situation and note that it closely matches my own investigation into the risperdal for depression studies when industry , academia , and buckets of money collide , the outcome is predictable
