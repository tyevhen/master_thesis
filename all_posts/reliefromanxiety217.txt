as much as we would like to turn back time and change things , we ca n't perhaps one day in the future , but not now things are locked in the past and cannot be accessed , as much as we 'd like to there are things we cringe about and things we wish we had done differently , but it 's all part of being human and at the time , it 's something you felt was right we can no longer worry about it , as it does n't change anything , whether that be in the past or the future we can only improve as each day goes by , there is another chance to change the way you are living another one of my favourite quotes every second is a chance to turn your life around as we cannot change the past , we can only better ourselves each day our understanding of the world increases and our actions change as a result every action we learn from we learn from our mistakes and hopefully become better people the moral here is that as much as the past may hold both good and bad , each day you can change and improve we cannot differ the past , but learn and understand why each day you can do something you 've always wanted and work towards your ideals do n't let the past rob you of your present i know with anxiety , each day can seem a drag it 's important to learn from the days you spent crippled with anxiety and know that it 's part of the journey and it 's made you stronger as a result if you cannot change it , then we must find a way to battle and survive it so , what are you going to do to better yourself ? eat healthier ? join a club ? use social networks less ? give to charity ? any moment is a fresh start as russell brand stated , you do n't have to wait for a new week or certain day to change you 've got the power to change , what will you do to better yourself ? best wishes , amy xx
