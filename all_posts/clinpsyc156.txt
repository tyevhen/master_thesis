a recent comment was left by a reader steve b md who claims to be a psychiatrist i only say claims to be because , hey , this is the internet , and you never know who people really are his comment was regarding a rather lengthy post on antipsychotics for dementia i found his comment thoughtful enough to merit its own post here is the second part of his comment , with my emphasis added because i could not agree with him more regarding your comment that it takes time , effort , and using one 's training in mental health , that just speaks to how the mental health profession particularly psychiatry , despite its stated interest in improving the lives of patients , is too focused on the immediate effect on a patient 's behavior than in long term outcomes as a psychiatrist , i am sometimes appalled at how my colleagues focus on the short term benefit afforded by an unproven medication and ignore any consideration of the long term side effects or , more importantly , other ways that the patient may learn to change his her behavior for the better we have indeed been hijacked by drugs i would n't entirely blame the drug companies , though , because psychiatrists have every right not to use meds in this way it 's just that our profession 's knee jerk reaction to a psychiatric symptom is to medicate , and not to help a person through his her struggle in a more compassionate and productive way amen , brother
