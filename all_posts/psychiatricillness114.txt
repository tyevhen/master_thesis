i have had this horrible flu like virus thing the last few days the physical symptoms are begining to clear but the depression is starting to set in o i am still tired with a blocked nose and headache tho' all the uncertainty at work really is n't helping my supervisor has told me that he will be moving to a new role so that is fact not rumour now i have a lot of anxieties about how my job is likely to change when i have a new supervisor i think i got a bit hypo as i have taken on far too much work and with one particular project i have i am beginning to feel out of my depth there are new people working on it and they are very negative i'm ready to give up on work for various reasons i use to thinki was good at what i did and i had a future now there is nothing apart from a lot of hassle and no suport from anyone but if i do not have work what is there ? i am feeling very very low
