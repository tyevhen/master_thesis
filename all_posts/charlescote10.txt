in other words , what got you interested in poetry and how have you developed your craft ? th what got me interested in poetry ? there are like events that got me interested in poetry when i was very young , in third grade , i wrote a poem about life after a nuclear holocaust the final image was of a lone dog barking then i secretly started writing in high school i don t know what drew me to it i went to college in as physics major one day i heard the voice of bob dylan on his album infidels it was the summer , between my freshman and sophomore years of college i was with my friend jeff stremick and dan goettel in jeff s chevy cavalier in a mall in west irondequoit , and dan popped in the cassette oh , it was love i wanted everyone to be quiet so i could listen to this , what allen ginsberg called , angelic voice and it was angelic ! i didn t know it at the time , but i was drawn to his moans and long vowels it changed everything cc physics seems a way off from what you re doing now what s the story there ? th well , i drank myself out of my physics program at clarkson university i also played too much hockey then i went to a community college in , and threw myself into literature and poetry after that , i attended suny oneonta in to get a bs in english and , fuck , everything was plunged into poetry everything and i had the best poetry teachers in graham duncan and patrick meanor duncan knew everything about modern american poetry and meanor pointed me to the black mountain poets and taught me poetry on levels i didn t know existed duncan didn t teach me about music , but he opened my ears but it s college so what did i want to do in college ? drink and get laid if drinking didn t get me laid , then surely a poem would what woman doesn t want a poet , i thought so half my intentions were to write poems to impress women the other half was to improve my skills cc yes , a familiar story for the male poet , and i m sure it s still true , regardless of the skill set so how did you develop those skills ? th richard frost , a professor at suny oneonta , once told a story in poetry class about a man who talked in sonnets i thought , damn , i want to do that so to train , i started talking in iambic pentameter , which took a while to learn to do i actually had to write a lot to learn to speak it then i added some rhymes to my iambic scats but after a month or so , when i was getting real good at it , i stopped because people didn t much care for the rhyming i didn t rhyme in front of all my friends , like the people i played high stakes poker with three times a day cc you spoke in rhymes but not at cards with friends ? see , i can speak in iambic pentameter too sounds like this got you thinking about the formal elements in poetry th yes the next few years , i studied and wrote as many meters and forms as i could find in any language i particularly enjoyed sapphics , which is a form with a meter where the syllables are based on the length of the syllable , as many languages do then i discovered swinburne , who pretty much taught me everything about meter he also made an accentual version of sapphics , as did ezra pound who combined stress and length and james wright who americanized sapphics eventually , i tried to write poems where i could create tensions between the length of the syllable and its stress , and then used those to create tensions against whatever meter or form i was using sappho swinburne cc well , swinburne was a bad ass too , or at least tried to be who else influenced you ? th i learned about harmonies , mainly from gerard manley hopkins , who along with wallace stevens taught me how to work etymologies into a poem i eventually wrote some really good musical poems but as happened with older swinburne , my poems became abstract and with long words and were hard to follow then add in some black mountain aesthetics and this interest in l a n g u a g e poetry , and the poems became even more difficult gerard manley hopkins wallace stevens l a n g u a g e cc it would seem to me that any serious student of poetry would fall in love with etymologies i often draw from that well when i need ideas for poems because it suggests so many other possibilities , resonances , and imaginative leaps how did you end up in brockport , which of course was one of the literary hotbeds in this state , if not the country ? th eventually , in , i studied with william heyen and tony piccione at suny brockport to get an ma in english i was the only one at the school who preached black mountain aesthetics i stood firm with those black mountain poets in this deep image school the robert bly deep image not the robert kelly deep image from trobar issue with jerome rothenberg the funny thing is bill and tony didn t have much effect on me not for a very long time , anyway not until maybe i was a bit stubborn and closed minded william heyen tony piccione robert kelly robert bly cc you say that in the past tense do you mean to say you re not so stubborn anymore ? th i m still stubborn , though not as much it just takes a while for new things to settle into me hmm how to explain ? between and , i wrote and wrote my writing seemed good at the time , but it was wasn t there came a point in the late s when i was getting too cocky i thought i was great , but i wasn t improving my writing i was just strutting around as a writer my ego was huge i was resting on my laurels , or the laurels i thought i had so one day , i took my two boxes of everything i had ever written , went to a fourth of july party with a bonfire , and burned each poem one by one sometimes i read the poem aloud to the sky and gods before i placed the poem in the fire and watched its ashes rise to the audience i just read to i purged myself cc that s a great image did it help ? yes , i could start over and i did a bit and then more so a few years later , in , at eastern washington university ewu with jonathan johnson , christopher howell , and nance van winckel there i earned an mfa again , like suny brockport , i didn t learn until a few years after graduating when it all sunk in jonathan johnson christopher howell nance van winckel suny brockport ten or fifteen years later taught me about the image , and ewu about two years later it really was two years later , i saw it happen before me taught me about tone and humanity and i taught myself clarity , which i m still pursuing cc it seems to me that clarity is the highest achievement in writing when it s done well , it seems so simple , and yet it s so hard to attain th true though , i still have not written a musical masterpiece that is clear on an imagistic level or written a perfectly clear poem that is musically awesome oh , i have so much more to say , but i reckon this is enough for now there are so many people to mention , like rob carney , who have influenced me so much rob carney but there is my answer to your initial question oh , and i m bad ass cuz i drink and swear and have slept with women cc well , i d say you re bad ass for other reasons , too , namely your writing , and , of course , the work of others you present in redactions poetry poetics redactions , of course , means the process of editing or revising a piece of writing can you share some of your philosophy about revision , something that i don t think most poets do enough , though i m probably over generalizing th revising i think that 's a familiar condition of american poet today poets revise so much the mood about revision is almost puritanical , it seems that is , if you work a lot on a poem , it will be good or successful but are they successful ? that 's the question i see poems in journals which are okay , but they still need work i 'd love to take those poems and fix them up puritans when i revise , and i 'll get more into this down below , i first start by writing all my poems by hand i used to only use a pencil , but i'm now able to use a pen anyway , in the handwritten versions , i write , scratch , erase , and write the poems over and over and over again then , when i think it 's done or done for this phase or when i just need to see it more clean and laid out , then i type it up on the computer this is where i think many of poems stop the ok ones i just mentioned seeing in journals but there 's more to do , like shaping the poem honestly , a poem has to look good on the page , too eight four line stanzas are easier to look at and read than one line stanza but each poem has its own shape , and occasionally the line stanza poem is required plus , when i type the poem and print it , i can start marking up the poem i can scan the poem or track certain sounds i can make marks to see what i hear i can follow harmonies , melodies , rhythms , and tones much better with a visual representation i do less of this now , as i ll explain below , but it 's still a step in the revision process , especially when i'm stuck man , if you get stuck in poem , then it 's time to start using syllabics or a meter if i'm stuck , and i see a meter or rhythm pattern here and there , then i 'll chase them down i 'll try to make the rest of the poem follow it until i free myself from where i was stuck you know , just because during the writing process i wrote a villanelle or a sapphics does n't mean i have to keep the villanelle or sapphics sometimes you just need them to see the poem differently for a while , and meter and form can do that for you cc what gets your attention as an editor , both in writing that you d consider publishing , and writing that stops you from reading further ? th paying attention to language gets my attention you can tell pretty quick when a poem is paying attention to language when it 's not , it becomes boring when it becomes boring i stop reading and a poem can get boring quick oh , and the poem has to keep moving forward so basically , you get a few lines for free , but if the poem stops moving forward or stops paying attention to language , then i stop reading i have to do this out of necessity , too , because i get so many submissions so the poem has to keep moving line after line of course , this is all ideal talk and there are always exceptions basically , the poem has to sustain my attention cc i loved henri , sophie , the hieratic head of ezra pound poems blasted from the vortex , especially as it imagines with much historical accuracy , the relationship between sculptor henri gaudier brzeska and poet ezra pound i ve always been fascinated by rodin s influence on rilke what was this collection all about and what did you discover about yourself in the process ? henri gaudier brzeska ezra pound th first thank you for the plug and the compliment now to the question historical accuracy ? ! i do n't know if i 'd say that i mean , for instance , nina hamnett did visit sophie breszka at a cottage during world war i , but , everything else i write in that poem is metaphorical or an imagining i think in the end , the book is trying to get behind the swirling creative energies that existed during henri gaudier brzeska s time and because of henri henri had a long and powerful influence on ezra pound and sophie , and what i accidentally discovered , and it was a fun accident as the poem made the discovery while it was been written and i just happened to be the first witness , was that ezra and sophie both ended up in a mental hospital because of henri 's death i loved watching that discovery i wished i had thought of it myself the way i wrote the poem explains it better than i can here , because here i just want to say the only reason ez was in a hospital is so he did n't go to jail and get executed for anti american propaganda from his radio shows out of italy during world war ii free speech without free radio speech is as zero , i think he says anyway discovery that 's the second part of the question what did i discover about myself in the process was the process prior to these poems , i used to revise so much i even have a poem i worked on for years i 'd revise a poem on a phonic level to make sure all or most the sounds in a poem harmonized so if i had a k sound in line five , for instance , i made sure it chimed within two lines before or after i never could do it as well as linda bierds or gerard manley hopkins , though and i 'd revise to make sure the language was tight and interesting harmony and fresh language consumed a lot of my revisions , and when it was all done , i 'd have a tight poem but you know what ? during all that revision and craftiness , the poem would lose its original energies hell , it would lose energy in general it would be a well wrought poem that seemed smart i also unintentionally revised out tonalities so now i have this flat poem that 's technically clever in the composition of the henri book , i learned to revise lightly , as allen ginsberg said what i did in this book and what i'm doing now is to trust my ear i spent years of concentrated detailed work to tune my ear and hear harmonies and rhythms , during the henri book and since , i thought it was time to trust my ears and let them work on their own i did n't need to interfere so i instead concentrated on clarity and tone i think the problem with my earlier poems was that people could n't get into them the poems were obtuse , obfuscating , and sharp they 'd cut you if you got too close in other words , the poems did n't have a surface layer so in the henri book , i just made sure all the poems were clear and made sense on the surface so that anyone could get into them , and if they wanted to go deeper into them , they could is n't that a mark of all good poems ? they have a surface level , ya know , like a story , but the more you stare at it the deeper it gets is n't that a beauty of a frost or merwin poem ? they invite you in , and if you want to visit all the rooms and basements and attics and secret panels in the poem s house , you can so what i learned was to trust my ear , revise lightly , be clear , and ensure the tones are working well i'm just starting to get good at all this now , especially in trusting my ear oh , and i wo n't even get into harmonic tonalities oh , i just remembered this sean thomas dougherty introduced this term about my poetry , and it works for every book i have and most of my poems investigative poetry edward sanders coined this term and i just received his book with the same name , but it s been around longer you can read about investigative poetry here http thelinebreak wordpress com investigative poetics and better yet here http bit ly gsfdlv read the latter essay , and you ll get my poetry , even my newest collection , the oldest stone in the world amsterdam press , which is more like imaginative investigative poetry , a topic for another time sean thomas dougherty cc what exactly is vorticism , and by the way , the ez head looks a lot like you coincidence ? clearly , ezra pound has had a big influence on you talk a bit about that the hieratic head of ezra pound th i don t think i can define vorticism it 's too slippery a term each vorticist did their own thing however , i can say that each vorticist piece is a high energy construct i can say there was cubism then futurism then vorticism vorticism was sharper than futurism and celebrated less the machine and technology i would say i look like the hieratic head of ezra pound , but i'm less phallic than it i look like it because i tried to be like ez for a while pound 's influence is incalculable his major influence on my writing came from his prose pieces about poetry , specifically the literary essays of ezra pound and even more specifically these two essays a retrospect and how to read i don t even know if i can explain but if you want demi glace reduction of poetics to pour over your poetry , read these essays they changed my life
