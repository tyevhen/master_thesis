some years ago , i was on a book tour when a familiar face appeared at my last television stop in oklahoma city she was my favorite and toughest former northwestern university journalism professor elizabeth swayne yamashita elizabeth was a tough on the outside , soft on the inside australian , big , blonde , larger than life , a sort of female crocodile dundee she was a noted journalist teaching part time when we first encountered each other at northwestern her other world was at time life where she was an investigative reporter for fortune magazine by this time , she had shifted the focus of her career to mostly academic pursuits and was now dean of the journalism school at the university of oklahoma she planned to write books when she retired six years hence thus , i was surprised when she replied to the television producer 's question about whether she was a journalist , too i used to be , she said softly my heart sank used to be there was nothing used to be about elizabeth in my mind , she was still a journalistic star , still a contender , and was choosing , as well , to pass her craft on to new generations how could she be talking about used to be ? i told her the phrase made me sad , like she was giving up a part of herself i not finished , she said just growing on the conversation has stayed with me through many of my own life changes the other day , in the gym , a fellow exerciser was talking with my husband bob about his concern over his wife 's serious depression when i joined them , the man smiled and said i heard that you 're a therapist i felt a mix of emotions wishing i could help , especially when i heard how difficult it was to get psychotherapy in this rural area but my licensure is in california , not arizona i made the decision to retire from practicing psychotherapy to concentrate on writing once again when we moved last year i ca n't legally practice in arizona i used to be a therapist , i said at last and it only stung for a moment , mostly because i wanted to help more than i was able we say used to be at major transitions points in our lives as we look back to the certainty of what was as we stand poised for the uncertainty of the future i remember my first night at the freshman dorm at northwestern university we all sat in the hall that night , trying to look cool and not nearly as scared as we were many smoked for the first time we shared stories about the big shots we used to be in high school we were trying to hold onto our specialness , trying to impress each other but we were in for a shock we had all been high school superstars when i said that i had been editor of my high school newspaper and co editor of the yearbook , there were echoes down the hall so was i me , too count me in as well my shoulders sagged and i wondered if i would ever be special again only a few weeks later , i found myself excited and happy to be surrounded by so many bright peers who shared my passions it is n't all that different in early retirement when , at least initially , who you are in your own mind is more the person you used to be rather than the person you 're becoming it 's harder for some than others observing people whose retirement was n't voluntary , i see some of them choke on the words used to others scramble to find a new cause , a new identity , to fill the gaping hole of loss there can , indeed , be a grieving period when one steps away from a career that has meant so much , even if that step is completely voluntary i see it in retirement and i saw it throughout my working life i have some experience with stepping away , winding down , one career in favor of another and grief has been a part of each transition my first five years after college , i had two demanding careers i was a writer and editor on the staff of a national magazine and i was a professional actress , doing stage , television and voice overs when i was and in the middle of a run of the musical high button shoes starring gavin macleod , i came to the painful conclusion that while i liked acting , i did n't like the business it was n't a good fit for me emotionally even those of us who were working at least a little in the business experienced so much rejection and insecurity i saw very talented actors who were not stars though they deserved to be aging , working less as actors and more in marginal part time jobs and i did n't want that to be me so i decided to quit , once the show closed , and concentrate on writing although i ended up doing one more show dylan ironically , my favorite acting experience i stepped away from acting forever when i was i shed a lot of tears in the process of deciding and , again , after my last curtain call then i walked away and have n't looked back i used to be an actress i can say it with wonder and amusement now it seems like another lifetime , though my acting experience was very helpful when my writing career blossomed and i was a frequent guest on national television talk shows i never felt that my time as an actress was wasted it just prepared me to grow on as elizabeth put it and twenty years later , when publishing began to change and my once flourishing writing career took a dive , i went back to graduate school to become a psychotherapist both to gain more credibility as a writer and to have an alternate gig to keep me afloat financially the transition was n't easy i shed a lot of tears over the downturn in my writing career pursuing a whole new career demanded that i grow in very different ways but through all the hard work in school , in clinical internships and in establishing a private practice , i never even thought used to be when i thought of writing even though my career as a therapist took a much larger portion of my time during the last years of my working life , i was always , at heart , a writer first , though i loved reaching out and helping others as a psychotherapist today , i can smile and say that i used to be an actress and a therapist i learned and grew so much from each career , each life experience and now i 've come full circle back to writing but it 's different the book contracts are n't lined up anymore the national television shows are n't calling but i do n't focus on what used to be i'm happy and growing and optimistic whatever happens i realize that i am fortunate to be rediscovering a passion we all find our own ways to define our lives and life purpose in retirement some find happiness and purpose by being only semi retired a former university physics professor who lives nearby is transitioning from college teaching to teaching physics at the local high school he has taught there for two years and just signed up for one more then , he says , he will be ready to fully retire another neighbor , who found that he very much missed his managerial position in a major corporation , has become involved in local politics and city planning and finds that this gives the structure to his days that he so missed in his first months of retirement his wistful i used to has become an excited i am others find fulfillment by using the skills of a lifetime of living and working to help others as community volunteers still others , who made a smooth transition from employment to full retirement , share excitement and wonder at pursuing so many interests and activities so long deferred and now quite possible perhaps , whether or not we choose to launch new careers or to discover or rediscover passions , we need to counter all of our i used to feelings with affirmative i am statements so here 's the list i'm just starting i used to be young now i'm young in spirit i used to be slim now i'm working on reaching a healthy weight i used to dance now i exercise more than i have in decades i used to have an exciting career now i get excited by daily life i used to be sort of , almost , famous now i am content i used to think if i could reach another career milestone , i would be happy now i am happy we can allow our thoughts about what was , what used to be , to cloud our vision of today we can look back wistfully to the days when we had small waists and firm thighs , big dreams for the future and a myriad of options or we can focus on the people we 've become , who we are right now and we can celebrate the ways that we 've grown on through a lifetime of challenges and triumphs to the wonderful possibilities of today
