i was board certified in geriatric psychiatry initially in and have been a member of the american association of geriatric psychiatry since then members receive the american journal of geriatric psychiatry treating depression in geriatric patients is a a very rewarding experience for psychiatrists because depression often masquerades as a severe medical problem like dementia , chronic pain , or parkinson 's disease treating the underlying depression clears the manifestations that appear to be these other illnesses even pure depression in an elderly patient can lead to significant medical compromise because of diminished physiological reserve and rapid compromise of nutrition or mobility as the result of sleep deprivation and inadequate intake that can occur as the result of discontinuing long standing antidepressant maintenance therapy the elderly also have some of the highest rates of completed suicide and that also factors in decisions about maintenance antidepressant treatment as well as effective psychosocial interventions to address that problem in the january edition of the ajgp , erlangsen and conwell look at the relationship of completed suicide and antidepressant redemption in a nationwide cohort in denmark the methodology of this study is not available in the united states denmark has several registers based on a unique personal identifier for all of its citizens the authors looked at the register of medicinal product statistics and suicide as a cause of death in the registry of causes of death for a cohort of people who were years of age or older on january , through december , data on antidepressant use was identified and classified into tricyclic antidepressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other types of antidepressants a treatment episode was considered to have occurred if a second prescription of antidepressants was filled and the patient appeared to be taking tablets per day in terms of sheer number the study included , , men and , , women in the follow up period deaths by suicide numbered , men and , women as illustrated by figure below there is a decreasing number of those dying by suicide who redeemed antidepressant prescriptions in the year olds it was less than one in four women and less than one in eight men trends were noted that percentage of men and women dying of suicide who took antidepressants decreased with increasing age this data is consistent with previous data that show that most elderly patient die by suicide are not in treatment at the time and they have clinically significant symptoms of depression graphic removed by copyright manager please see the original article this study is a good example of what kind of data is available with large databases across entire populations the limitations of the data are discussed by the authors including the fact that the pharmaceutical registry does not have any diagnoses and antidepressants have numerous indications they discuss why antidepressant redemption may not be the optimal proxy for antidepressant use in this case their study design considering only people who have redeemed the second antidepressant prescription to be in treatment that contrasts with some data suggesting the highest risk for suicide may occur in the initial days or weeks of antidepressant treatment they point out the usual qualification about association versus causality , but also conclude that it is possible that antidepressants protect the oldest old from death by suicide and point out the important public policy question of how to identify these patents there is a similar interesting study available that looks at a database that includes of the population of the netherlands see reference it looks at the correlation between antidepressant use and both suicide and violence and concludes that there are significant negative correlations with both in other words increased antidepressant use led to decreased rates of suicide and violent behavior over the years when i read this study , i was also interested in what medical specialty is prescribing the bulk of the antidepressants i e mailed one of the authors and asked that question the response was that the specific specialty of the prescriber was unknown but that bulk of antidepressants in denmark were prescribed by primary care physicians and the likelihood of antidepressant prescription by primary care increases with patient age psychiatric consultation was more likely to occur at a younger patient age in the united states we need pharmaceutical registries similar to the danish registry we need a more factual basis to evaluate issues of pharmaceutical use over time , complications of prescription drugs , over prescription of drugs , and adequate drug utilization for example , with the recent concerns about stroke risk factor reduction in the elderly and stroke risk reduction from atrial fibrillation graphs similar to figure looking at all of the relevant medications may prove very useful practically all pharmacy data in this country is proprietary and the largest database was developed to see if pharmaceutical representatives were having an impact on prescriptions written by individual physicians the current development by individual states focused on the prescription of controlled substances is an opportunity to expand that data to identify important public health trends and reduce speculation george dawson , md , dfapa figure is reprinted from am j geriatr psychiatry jan erlangsen a , conwell
