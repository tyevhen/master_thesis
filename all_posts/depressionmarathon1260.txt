that 's ironic i'm sitting here contemplating how the passage of time is all we need to heal sometimes , and time after time by cyndi lauper comes on the radio hello , god ! how are you today ? thanks for the subtle cue of course , if you had n't subtly hit me over the head , i never would have noticed ! but you already knew that as i was saying , despite my mood still being unexpectedly low after yesterday 's crash , today is a more functional day my skin fits today i am less overwhelmed and have more energy whereas yesterday i could n't make it to two planned evening meetings nor out the door for my scheduled run , today i 've already done some work and completed yesterday 's tough run sure , i 'd prefer my mood hover somewhere above the toilet bowl rim , but i 'll gratefully accept the non paralysis and the functionality ! and wait for the passage of more time
