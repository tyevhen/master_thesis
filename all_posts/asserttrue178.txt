every once in a while , if you have enough coding skills to be dangerous , you come up with something marvelously dangerous like , say , an openoffice libreoffice macro that can send e mails directly from a spreadsheet see code , below i looked and looked online for an example of how to do this , but found no code that worked , so i wrote and debugged my own e mail hack which works , but requires some setup apparently , this trick is fairly easy to do in outlook or in excel using an excel vba macro , but it 's not obvious how to do it in openoffice it can be done in openoffice , though , thanks to the fact that when you write an openoffice macro in javascript , the js is actually running inside a java virtual machine using the mozilla rhino module i do n't know if openoffice has switched to java yet , which does n't use rhino so be advised , if you 're using the very latest version of java , the following code may not work for you i have n't tested it on the latest java platform the neat thing about javascript macros in openoffice is that they give you the full power of the java runtime environment , which means you can do network i o yes , server roundtripping from a macro , if you know the special call through syntax yes , you heard me right you can do just about anything in an openoffice js macro that you can do in a java program insert evil bwah ha haaa here what you should do , first off , is go into openoffice 's tools options dialog look for java in the pref pick list and point your copy of openoffice at the particular jre on your machine that you want to use mine is a version jre the next thing you need to do is make sure you have the javax mail jar and activation jar files in your jre 's lib ext folder you may need to go to oracle 's web site to download the javamail and javabeans activation framework put the appropriate jars the ones i just listed in your lib ext folder and restart openoffice when oo o restarts , it should slurp up the jars , and now you 're ready to rumble if not , the macro wo n't be able to find the necessary classes and you 'll get cryptic errors saying such and so is not a method the next thing you need to do is determine whose smtp server you 're going to hack into use for test purposes gmail wo n't do , because it tries to engage you in a dialog probably a captcha rather than letting your code send e mails directly to their server , or at least that 's the problem i ran into beware that many smtp servers are throttled and or locked down in various ways to prevent programmatic access bottom line , i set up a free account at easy smtp for testing purposes , and it has worked fine , although although ! you should note that they use usernames containing a backslash , and when you try to use myusername admin in a javascript string , you need to type myusername admin double backslash to escape the backslash but you knew that , right ? also realize , when testing e mail code , that smtp servers are queue based , and it may take minutes or more for say the easy smtp server to send your e mails out so if you do n't see your test e mails arrive in the mailbox right away , it might not be a bug it might be a feature be patient allow time enough chatter here 's what the code looks like function sendmail recipient , subject , message var fromaddressarray java lang reflect array newinstancepackages javax mail internet internetaddress , var sender new packages javax mail internet internetaddress kas e thomas gmail com fromaddressarray sender var provider ssrs reachmail net var smtpusername myusername admin change to your username var smtppassword mypassword change to your password mailserverproperties java lang system getproperties mailserverproperties put mail smtp port , or for tls mailserverproperties put mail smtp auth , true mailserverproperties put mail smtp starttls enable , true var getmailsession packages javax mail session getdefaultinstancemailserverproperties , null var generatemailmessage new packages javax mail internet mimemessagegetmailsession add recipient generatemailmessage addrecipientpackages javax mail message recipienttype to , new packages javax mail internet internetaddress recipient add subject generatemailmessage setsubject subject add message text the e mail , in html generatemailmessage setcontent message , text html add from generatemailmessage addfrom fromaddressarray try to connect var transport getmailsession gettransport smtp transport connect provider , smtpusername , smtppassword send it var allrecipients generatemailmessage getallrecipients transport sendmessagegeneratemailmessage , allrecipients finish transport close obviously , to use this function you have to add a little code of your own to the js macro try sendmail myemail domain com , this is the subject line , this is the b html b e mail body catche throw e tostring something like that rather than simply rethrow the exception , you could show the message in a console window for this , i like to create my own java console window with this code which runs fine in an openoffice macro create a java jeditorpane to show stuff in function displayerr msg function editorpane swing packages javax swing this pane new swing jeditorpane text html , this jframe new swing jframe this jframe setbounds , , , var editorscrollpane new swing jscrollpanethis pane editorscrollpane setverticalscrollbarpolicy swing jscrollpane vertical scrollbar always editorscrollpane setpreferredsizenew java awt dimension , editorscrollpane setminimumsizenew java awt dimension , this jframe setvisible true this jframe getcontentpane add editorscrollpane public methods this getpane function return this pane this getjframe function return this jframe end inner class if typeof gjavawindow 'undefined' gjavawindow new editorpane gjavawindow jframe setvisible true show the message in a java window gjavawindow getpane settext msg tostring now you can use displayerr message to put up a console window with messages if you 're wondering what line of the sendmail code is about , it has to do with the fact that when you add a from sender address to the message in line , the mimemessage method addfrom is expecting an array of type javax mail internet internetaddress you can create an internetaddress object directly , in javascript as in line , but not a typed array of them if you create an array in js , it 's a js array , not internetaddress , if you see what i mean the point is , the addfrom will fail if you simply supply a string or a javascript array to get around this , you have to create a internetaddress array using java lang reflect array newinstance as shown in line to my knowledge , this is the only working example on the internet of how to send e mail from openoffice using javascript obviously , you 'll want to modify this code if you 're sending e mail to multiple cc recipients , and you may want to throttle your loops if you 're sending lots of individual e mails using java lang thread sleep millisecs in a loop , to pause between sends create a function for that function delay millisecs java lang thread sleep millisecs if you want to pluck addresses out of an open spreadsheet , you need to use the following code importclasspackages com sun star uno unoruntime importclasspackages com sun star sheet xspreadsheetdocument function getsheetbyname sheetname get the document object from the scripting context odoc xscriptcontext getdocument get the xspreadsheetdocument interface from the document xsdoc unoruntime queryinterfacexspreadsheetdocument , odoc get a reference to the sheets for this doc var sheets xsdoc getsheets get named sheet return
