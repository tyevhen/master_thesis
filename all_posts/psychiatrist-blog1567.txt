this is our th post ! lately my neighbors have been apologizing to me , which feels a little bit weird we 'll have brief ok , sometimes not so brief conversations and they end them by saying something to the effect of , i'm sorry to chew your ear off , or i know you 're off duty , so i'm sorry about that , or words to that effect they know i'm a psychiatrist so i guess they think they 're burdening me when they do the normal problem sharing thing that goes along with being a friendly neighbor now , it 's possible that i get more than the usual share of mental health related problem sharing because they know what i do for a living and it 's true i know lots of stuff about who in the neighborhood is on which medication , or who would never in their life take that particular medication , or who is looking for a psych referral i give them names but they rarely follow through , just because of what i do for a living but it does n't feel like they 're burdening me i like my neighbors i 've never had a bad one , and that 's pretty unusual considering how long i 've lived here that being said , i ca n't say that i 've ever gone to my mechanic neighbor for car advice or to my hair stylist neighbor for coloring advice although dinah probably thinks i should but that 's not because i do n't think they 'd help me if i asked for it it just never occurs to me to ask it is nice to know though that any one of those folks who apologized to me for problem dumping would be just as quick to listen to me if the tables were turned that 's just being a good neighbor
