during the last few years , there have been many more articles , books , and even a tv program about hoarding there have even been articles about how children of hoarders have been affected by a mother 's or father 's hoarding see link below all of these stories serve to highlight our emotional attachment to our possessions and how possessions can become imbued with personal symbolic meaning even when our emotional attachment to our possessions does n't reach the level of hoarding , it can be a psychological problem that causes distress for the person with the problem as well as loved ones who live with him or her but this problem can be worked through in therapy when our emotional attachment to our possessions become a problem for our loved ones the following fictionalized scenario , which is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality , is an example of how one person 's emotional attachment to his possessions can be a problem that can get worked through in therapy joe joe became depressed after his girlfriend of years , mary , broke up with him the breakup occurred four years before , but joe still missed her everyday when they were living together , mary was the neat one and joe tended to be more messy but after mary left , joe went from being messy to accumulating clutter the things he accumulated in the house were mostly clothes , books , and mementos from the relationship other than that , he cleaned the house and never accumulated any garbage , the place was habitable , and he had people over it never reached the level of hoarding , but it was still becoming a problem and he feared that this problem might get worse when our emotional attachment to our possessions becomes a problem when he began therapy , he talked about other big losses in his life , including losing both of his parents at an early age prior to mary leaving , joe did n't think about their deaths as much as an adult but after mary left , joe began having dreams of himself as a child searching for his parents it became apparent in therapy that the loss of his relationship with mary triggered this early childhood trauma , and his emotional attachment to his possessions took on a new meaning for him with the triggering of this early trauma his possessions became imbued with a personal meaning that he never felt before it was as if his possessions were like beloved friends and family members , and he could n't bare to part with them on the one hand , having them around him gave him a certain amount of emotional comfort but , on the other hand , the clutter increased his anxiety he also felt ashamed about it his bedroom closet was filled with clothes that he no longer wore , but they had come to have meaning to him because they were purchased for him by mary his desk and his floor were littered with books and papers that he also associated with mary during his therapy , joe mourned the loss of his relationship and the loss of his parents he learned to nurture the inner child in him that he had ignored for years and who was feeling emotionally deprived joe learned to mourn his losses and nurture his inner child so he could let go gradually , he started letting go of the possessions he was accumulating in order to let them go , he did a simple ritual in which he thanked each possession for what it gave him on a symbolic level it was still hard for joe to let them go , but he did although it was sad for him , he also began to feel less anxious because he could now relax more in his environment he also began to take steps to meet other women when possessions take on a personal symbolic meaning and you ca n't let go of them in the above scenario , the accumulation of possessions never reached the level of hoarding as we 've come to define it i think it 's important to recognize that people can go through stages in their lives where they develop an emotional attachment to their possessions that is n't hoarding per se but is still problematic i believe there 's a difference between clutter and hoarding , and it 's important to recognize the symbolic meaning of possessions often , possessions take on a symbolic meaning of being like a friend or loved one that provides comfort after a loss under these circumstances , the person usually has mixed feelings about these possessions because , even though they provide a degree of emotional comfort , the clutter also creates anxiety mourning and problems with letting go of possessions that belonged to a loved one many people go through a similar feeling when someone close to them dies and they have to get rid of clothing and other possessions sometimes , they have to wait a while before they can do it because it 's just too hard they might spend time holding and smelling certain items of clothes that still have the scent of their deceased loved one but , eventually , they usually let go of these things because they know they have to do it or they 'll remain stuck emotionally it 's part of the mourning process not just messy the importance of understanding the meaning of holding on it 's not unusual for possessions to take on this symbolic meaning without the person who is affected realizing it at first a person who begins to accumulate clutter might just see him or herself as messy at first without realizing that the possessions have taken on a new meaning at that point , it becomes hard to get rid of these things because who wants to throw out a loving friend or family member ? the importance of understanding the meaning of holding on to personal possessions imbued with symbolic meaning this problem is a lot more common than hoarding overcoming this problem is n't easy it begins with an awareness that the possessions have become imbued with emotional meaning that goes beyond their functional status then , overcoming the problem involves working on a deeper level , as
