i'm revamping this blog as in i 've deleted my old posts and am starting fresh so hi again if anyone is reading this life has n't been the best this month and blogging about it has always made me feel better , but i held back because i was scared to mention the words anxiety and depression but the truth is that i am someone who is living with anxiety and depression and i 've been struggling with it for years i wish i could say i am going to blog about how to overcome anxiety depression , but i'm not there yet do n't get me wrong i'm not saying my life is bad because it 's actually pretty great , but sometimes i ca n't get out of bed and i want to be able to share why so if you 'd like to follow along feel free to subscribe i 'll be blogging about life , beauty , food , mental health , and wellness , all while anxiety pops up every once in a while just be warned that it is n't always going to be pretty , but it 's going to be honest
