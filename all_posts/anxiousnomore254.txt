lately as my anxiety has been more constant and longer lasting , and i have been miserable i 've been so worried about losing weight with my loss of appetite and so consumed with the pressure of having to eat , that just the thought or sight of food was making me want to retaliate and run away so today i took a long look at what i am doing to make things so bad i realized that i am simply putting too much pressure on myself all for the sake of other people knowing that i am gaining weight so i took a long walk and thought about my priorities its not worth it to me to gain pounds if i am miserable everyday i wonder why i am such a people pleaser so i am releasing my pressure that i have placed on myself to please everyone else and doing something so out of the norm i am going to eat what i want , when i want and not care what anyone thinks about it my fear is n't food , but being judged by others but its my life , my body , and when i am good and ready i will take steps at my own pace , because i want to for me , and not for everyone else i want to be healthy , and i will be but i want to be happy too it is a very refreshing feeling the hardest part is going to be not caring what others think of me but you know , as soon as i started wrapping this blog up , i suddenly got hungry you might also like proof that positive affirmations work finding beauty in the storm preparing for countering negative self talk theres no need to push myself linkwithin
