a lot of you are writing in about justice and seeking justice in your lives , just as i , when younger , read police stories where there was always justice at the end but , but , though i did this for years i never knew what i was doing my life was unjust but i had no words for it nor any conscious awareness of it my life , like yours , is just that my life as i lived it i never knew about any alternative i never knew what life should be about since all i saw was how my life was i never knew i should be treated with respect , that my parents should know and call me by name i never knew that i had a right to do nothing without feeling lazy i never knew that children should be hugged and kissed because it never happened how was i to know ? you don t know what is missing until you first get it then you know or if you begin to feel your life in primal therapy and you feel what you needed , what was missing and why it hurt you finally find out what was missing through your feelings , not your top level cognition that won t tell you doo doo about yourself too often we put ourselves in a replica of our early lives , trying to provoke a different ending but it never happens we get involved with mean people or critical ones hoping for a smidgen of love , appreciation and approval we never think it out we are just attracted to those who will give us nothing one woman patient told me that immediately when she saw a tough looking guy she was attracted to him she wanted a strong father who took charge very unlike who her father was another woman was attracted to a strong man who would lead and guide her like her father never did so what did she get ? a man who took control , dominated her and ordered her around she obeyed like a little child she got part of what she needed but did not want the other domineering part , which she also got some men want a mother for a wife and want her to do everything around the house the little girl complies and does it all because daddy says so the problem is that this can drift into the husband s paranoia where did you go today ? who did you meet , what did they say ? what time did you come home ? never do that again without my permission this man over the years becomes dangerous until he stalks and follows she is in danger they almost never escape until it is too late look for the warning signs and do not hope for the best it is not to come what is behind all this ? so many things but basically an absent mother , or mother who left for someone else , or an indifferent cold mother he needs her close now , and has to make sure he has her she is now his mother and he , and she , cannot differentiate what is real and what is not watch out for someone suddenly showing up , as if by accident you are being followed and if you do not act like an obedient child , violence ensures he will beat you up and even when he does , you will go on hoping for something different and stay around she and he are trapped in the past and cannot distinguish the present it is all acted out she needs a father who helps and guides her while he needs a mother who is always there for him getting our needs from the past fulfilled in the present seems natural , and the way it should be alas , it can only happen during the critical period when we are in the womb or in our infancy there is a time limit for fulfillment and only then can it happen after that , we act out , trying to get fulfillment in every way we can it is never enough how can we get over that ? only one way go back to the critical period and feel the need during the critical period again with it the pain and then you will be free to stop the act out what is so diabolic is that we never know we are acting symbolically we keep on doing it because the deprivation of need during the critical period keeps it alive need is eternal it only dies with us , not before the need is often so distant and alienated that it is like from a strange country we act on it but never know we are doing it so we are squeezed at birth and suffocated and we keep on keeping windows open or we keep on moving there and there because to stop means back then being helpless and hopeless and guess what ? when we stop we slip into depression hopeless and helpless so here we see manic depression keep on moving till we can t and then feeling depressed hopeless we remain in the grips of history , of our past even though we never understand that simple fact we keep on gambling because lady luck is going to help us win we have compulsive sex because we have so much pressure inside that we do not know exists in the case of sex it is understood it rises from deep in the brain , long before we have words for sex and often long before we can have a relationship that includes sex with another person it is called onanism you relate to yourself only because you lack the social skills that could combine love and sex you are no more than a pressure cooker others are but a relief valve for pains that have no emotions , only impulses there was some guy who once called this an impulse neurosis a prisoner of pain oh i remember who he is impulsive people are loaded with preverbal pain that comes from the time we were preverbal daah
