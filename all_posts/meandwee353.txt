hi friends ! i finished my recent sewing lessons and made a little skirt i learned a lot and decided to make something on my own to build my confidence i made zippered pillow cases to cover the bland and boring pillows on our couch i'm thrilled with out they turned out and they were very easy albeit a little time consuming i used this tutorial which made it so simple and easy once i did one , i was able to do the other from memory weeks later easy , right ? it 's been nice finding another creative outlet and my next project will be a tote bag more ambitious ! no word yet on the nursery contest results , but i will keep you posted ! before after save you might also like art and mothering time happy monday ! linkwithin
