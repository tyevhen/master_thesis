i have always maintained that we can get along without therapy with the use of tranquilizers and pain killers the only problem with that is that we can cut off the message of very early remote memory to the prefrontal cortex with medication but the imprint goes on rampaging throughout the system now , we have some supporting evidence in the psychiatic news march , mortality with antipsychotic use in alzheimer disease page they discussed a study in which mentally ill patients received antipsychotic medication , and others who did not haldol , thorazine the probability for survival was high in those who took no medication after two years those who continued to use medication had only a percent chance of survival , while those who took no medication had percent chance in other words , being on drugs can kill you and can kill you much faster than not taking drugs , given approximately two groups with the same mental health problem yet not being on drugs can kill us in a different sense producing ineffable misery thus , drugs simply suppress pain , leaving its force intact and , as i have said many times over , repression is the number one killer today because it underlies so many different kinds of diseases pain killers put more pressure on the system by adding to repression so here we have a self deluded state a person out of touch with what he is feeling , and doctors add to that delusion by helping the patient deny his feelings long term drug therapy can be dangerous to our health there is other evidence there is a greater risk of stroke in those taking medication an obvious conclusion when we are busy holding back pain and feelings the pressure has to go somewhere , and the brain is an obvious choice because that is where we focus our mental efforts
