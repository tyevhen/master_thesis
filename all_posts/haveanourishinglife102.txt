worth it can i get an amen , sister ! i am really hating all this emphasis on weight loss in our country , particularly , all of the campaigns the first lady is doing in the schools it makes me so sad and angry and frustrated and sad again to see these young people subjected to false information that could potential hurt them for life maybe that s why i loved lindy s poignant sarcasm in her post you see , i was a chubby kid , at least , chubbier than my peers i noticed because the adults noticed and could help but point it out when i was standing close enough to hear you see , i was the kid that tried to please everyone by doing the best i could do no one seemed to care whether or not i was healthy , but everyone noticed that i was losing weight ok , second last one things selective eaters want you toknow i don t have kids yet but , i ve said this before , one of my worst fears is passing on my disorder eating tendencies to my children so , i like to read articles about being aware of how you affect others with your words , actions , and habits the post is from the blog , mealtime hostage the author wrote reminders in the perspective of a child when it comes to eating number five is , embarrassing me or allowing others to embarrass me based on my eating habits doesn t encourage me to eat i really don t want to be the center of attention this only makes me feel uncomfortable and less likely to want to eat in a social setting i can totally relate each one of her points the quote above particularly reminds me of when i was going through the worst years of my eating disorder being the center of attention definitely did not help at all , and , sometimes , even hurt my progress toward normal or healthy eating the last article i think you should read is titled , our diet bias this post is from the blog , building family counseling dawn , the writer , very clearly presents the problem with weightloss she says for some people , trying new fruits or vegetables is a health goal meeting this goal may or may not lead to weightloss but it will certainly give that person insight into their wants , wishes and will expand their nutritional horizons for some people , learning to eat a cupcake without becoming mired in fear , anger , regret and guilt is a health goal meeting this goal may or may not lead to weightloss but it will certainly give that person relief , freedom and will expand their self acceptance when we talk about diets and health we need to go beyond the idea of restriction and weightloss being healthy is about way more than what you weigh i can t get enough of this positive message i think it s because i feel like i ve lost years of my life to this disease of an eating disorder and i want to do everything i can to stop other people from falling into the same trap i see so many people hurting from this terrible lie that you have to be thin in order to be good enough don t believe the lie we have the cure ! come and drink the medicine stay away from women s magazines , diets , and poisonous weight loss propaganda the tonic is learning to love yourself for the way you are i hope you enjoyed the smorgasbord have a wonderfully nourishing weekend !
