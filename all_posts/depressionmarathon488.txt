hurricane sandy has certainly wreaked havoc and left a path of death and destruction in her wake my prayers go out to everyone on the east coast at this time having been the victim of a flood myself , although mild in comparison , i have some understanding of the clean up that awaits i wish nothing but speedy restoration and recovery to all of those devastated by this storm in comparison to what 's happening out there , my dilemma , which i'm about to explain , is barely worth mentioning the storm left me up in the air as far as my travel plans the once in a lifetime trip to new york , which i 'd been planning for more than one year , was suddenly in doubt airports were closed subways were not running and the city of new york needed to decide if they wanted the marathon to continue as scheduled they finally made that decision yesterday it will go on as planned but that did n't end my uncertainty after perusing the internet , listening to espn , and reading comments to the many newspaper articles written about the subject , it became clear to me that many new yorkers do not want us marathoners there ! i had to decide , did i want to participate in an event where i'm potentially going to be despised for participating ? did i want to be , in many opinions , part of the problem ? no , of course not ! nonetheless , it was not an easy black and white question to ponder take away the fact that this was a once in a lifetime trip , which i was really looking forward to , the reality of the situation was that i had hundreds of dollars already spent which could not be recouped the marathon entry fee alone was nearly ! and that was money lost if i did n't show up likewise , because of my precarious financial situation , i could n't afford trip insurance on my flight i have no plans to fly anywhere within the next year , so no chance to re book for another date , meaning the ticket cost would also be lost tickets to nyc shows and events had likewise already been purchased if i did n't go this year , it 'd be unlikely i 'd be able to gather the funds to try again next year so i decided to go i leave early tomorrow morning for nyc perhaps it is a selfish decision i do n't know but for many reasons , it is the decision i made i hope to have a wonderful experience there are new yorkers who do want us to come perhaps those people will be out in force on marathon day we 'll have to wait and see , i guess i know the marathon organizers are putting plans in place to raise money for the locals in need i 'll definitely do my part i do n't know what else to do or say i'm going to new york i'm less excited than i was one week ago , but i'm hoping for the best
