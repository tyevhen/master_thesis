when i came home from the hospital last week , i celebrated by removing my boot after weeks immobilized in my boot , my right achilles tendon is now free i am doing as my doctor ordered i'm wearing heel lifts , not exercising , and only walking household distances unfortunately , the tendon does n't appear to have healed it is still swollen and sore i cannot walk without a limp running , of course , is out of the question i'm incredibly disappointed i do n't see my orthopedic doctor until the end of the month , but in communication with him the other day , he intimated surgery may now be required this was not good news there is no longer any uncertainty regarding running the new york city marathon this fall it is definitely out of the question this is the third time i have entered the nyc marathon , and i have yet to run it it was cancelled secondary to hurricane sandy in i was in the hospital being treated for a depression relapse in , and now this hopefully will be my year the achilles injury certainly has not helped my mood i'm back on my bike , but not being able to run is wearing me out i 've continued with ect treatments this week , and i think my mood has rebounded a bit , but i am not yet where i want to be i am looking forward to finishing the treatments this friday , hopefully , and getting back to work next week i think getting back to work and back into a routine will help me feel better both mentally and physically
