ahhh yes jack is prone to periods of anxiety and unfortunately , things seems to fly out of his mouth at these times and it 's really whenever he is in any way uncomfortable if we are tickling him and it 's gone too far for him , if we are swinging and he 's going too high all of the sudden a hole will come flying out of his mouth it 's not like we have n't corrected him over this or punished him for saying this a million times we have and i honestly do n't think he 's doing it to be naughty he 's changed it to ashhole for the most part , it 's hard to punish him for this , although we have made it perfectly clear that this is not ok either it 's tough when your kid calls you an ash how do you even respond to that ? when he was younger , it used to be idiot we told him this was not acceptable , so he shortened it to idi this is legend among our family in fact , my coworker 's entire family has adopted this term even her kids who live outside of her home use the term idi to describe someone they do n't like so is this a punishable offense ? i know that jack has trouble expressing emotions , and sometimes i feel like this is just him trying to express that something is really bothering him or stressing him out he knows these are big words and that 's why he uses them i want him to express himself , just do n't want a potty mouth around the house i guess it does n't really matter what i want , since all of the reprimands and punishment in the world do n't stop it kids with aspergers are prone to tourette 's like symptoms , sometimes i think this is part of that it 's just hard to know how to handle it this morning the four of us ended up in our big bed at about am , everyone always seems to wake up especially early on the weekends john went to get nate and bring him in when he woke up the minute he realized that jack was in the bed he went ballistic he does not want jack to touch mommy at all so nate was on one side of me , jack on the other nate kept swinging his little legs over me to karate kick jack jack kept telling nate he was an ash then of course he would recommence his baby lion persona of the week this involves the most annoying high pitched squeak you can imagine it is actually very authentic this would in turn tick nate off all over again and the whole cycle would begin again just another relaxing morning at our house john and i ended up hysterically laughing , because really , what else can we do ? at least they 're interacting right ? ha
