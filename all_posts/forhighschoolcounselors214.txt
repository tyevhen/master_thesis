note this post was inspired by a tweet from dr michelle borba one day i was walking through our library when a staff member stopped me she said she was so glad to see me because she was really concerned about a student as she was talking about the student , i remembered my colleague had referred the student for mental health services the year before why the concern ? well , the student was trying to check out books about serial killers like the child clown entertainer john wayne gacy and the student was boldly announcing the fascination on how they became serial killers the staff member was concerned because the student had been banned from checking out books about killers by the parent i thanked the staff member for the update and reported this information to my colleague my colleague shared that the parent knew about the student 's fascination and unsuccessfully tried to prevent the access of information about them at school , the public library , and book stores although the parent was relentless , the student was able to access information , drawings , pictures , and resources via the internet there is a lot of concern for this student and everyone is fearful for this students' future john wayne gacy , famous killer there has always been a attraction for the macabre with adolescents as kids , we were strangely drawn into horror stories , but terrified at the same time in my own life , i have been drawn into playing games to conjure ghosts for instance , one childhood game i played with my friend was bloody mary you may remember the story you turn off the light in the bathroom , light a candle , say her name three times as you spin around and boom she appears in the mirror this urban legend developed from stories integrating evil women over time mary , queen of scots , elizabeth bathory aka lady dracula , and the witch , mary worth to name a few my friends and i swore we would always see her and then we would run out of the bathroom screaming with our hearts pounding ! legend of bloody mary another fascination for teens is scary movies one in particular that terrified me was the exorcist i hated it , but i was often allured to the story by my fascination for the unknown i found myself going to the library and reading the reading the novel , looking up information about movie facts , etc at a sleep over , i finally watched it for the first time and the nightmares started when i tried to sleep , the face of the young girl would be looking at me from the edge of my bed or i convinced myself the bed was shaking not to mention the name of her imaginary friend captain howdy lingered in my head and haunted me when i tried to sleep side note captain howdy capt howdy i hate this guy ! ! ! is so popular in our culture that he has his own font , songs about him , a band name after him and his own website c r e e p y ! ! as a teen , i knew the difference between real and fantasy however , fantasy created sleepless nights and phobias that i had to extinguish as an adult he is definitely not a peer helper ! the world of fantasy and reality is still at war in our culture the national news broke a tragic story about the stabbing of a year old wisconsin girl who was stabbed by her friends to please an imaginary character called slender man unfortunately , that is not the first time i had heard about slender man when my son was , he mentioned the name of this fictional character to me in passing hey mom , do you know about slender man ?
