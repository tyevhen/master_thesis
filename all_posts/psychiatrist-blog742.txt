i remember when birthdays were a quiet thing a few phone calls from first degree relatives a couple of cards from extended family members a special meal with family , and a couple of gifts now there 's facebook birthdays are have become a multi media event the phone rings , repeatedly , a friend drops by with a giraffe toilet paper holder , there are text messages from my cousin , my kid , my kid 's girlfriend , a friend of my other kid , and yes , a text message from the vision care place where i get my contact lenses my father in law sends an e card with music forty of my closest friends , including people i have n't talked to since elementary school , and my prom date , wish me the best the request to serve on yet another committee comes in an email and notes happy birthday and yes , the vision care place also sent a happy birthday email , complete with animated balloons for the first time ever , my beloved sibling seems to think that writing on my wall suffices and i do n't warrant a phone call , and this year , i did not get a greeting card from the toyota dealer as long as the roses and chocolate continue irl in real life , then count me in ! when the cake turns virtual , i'm signing off
