tomorrow is the first anniversary of the worse day of my life no one outside the cyber world really knows what happened and how i felt that day the july was not only the day of the london bombings for me it was the day my anxiety crossed a line and i was no longer in control the live news coverage of the bombings gave me a few hours relief from the hell that was going on inside my head i intended to tell people who read this about what happened to me that day but as i have started to type i am finding i do not want to remember what bought my thoughts back was slicing a tomato with a very sharp knife my mum bought me for christmas i was looking for a knife that day as i wanted to cut my wrists , i did not have one sharp enough as i got better i found i do not like having too many tablets in the house as i decided on that once i could not find a knife when i was given the knives all i could think about was how easy it would be to slice flesh with them the images come to my head each time i use them the other day while washing one of them i got a very shallow cut on my thumb the knives are a weapon i could use on myself if i ever get that low again i really want to get rid of them , as i know on that day , had i found one i would have used it to end my life i did not want to wake up again , i swore in previous depressions i would not risk my life on a cry for help , i would have done it properly ! i am frightened of getting that low again i only buy small packets of headache tablets for this reason and i do not want a set of giant kitchen knives in my flat ! ! ! my mother would not have bought them for me had she known , she says they frighten her , if only she knew what they did to me ! she spent a lot of money on this gift so what would i say to her next time she comes to stay and takes over my kitchen ?
