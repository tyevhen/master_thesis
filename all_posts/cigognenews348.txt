something touched a nerve about this subject because the forthcoming book on heaven is on the cover of newsweek oct , , read the article here and is a new book it is written by a scientist , self proclaimed , because he is a neurosurgeon scientists and neurosurgeons are not necessarily equal in the field of psychology he is far from a scientist but let s look at what he claims but first in order to establish his bona fides , his disclaimer he never believed in near death experience he was a faithful christian but not a practicing one i think he means he was a believer but not really a true believer he contracted meningitis , fell into a coma for a week , and a good part of this thinking aware neo cortex was shut off then on the morning of the seventh day in the hospital , as my doctors weighed whether to discontinue treatment , my eyes popped open while the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them , my brain free consciousness journeyed to another dimension of the universe he went to a place he never dreamed existed sorry , i mean he went to a place that he dreamed existed this placed him in a new world and i am sure that world is new to him but not to me and not to me as a scientist who studies the deep unconscious i will need to explain as soon as our doctor had his top level surgeon brain knocked out he was like all of the rest of us non scientific schlubs with no critical judging cortex to help understand our experience he was no longer scientist but someone who went through what our patients go through every day the difference is that our patients are able to connect their experience to higher level processes , where the doctor could not because there were no higher levels operating at the time i will have to explain better our therapy is based on the three levels of consciousness , not as a theoretical abstraction but as a scientific therapy that has been heavily researched we take patients back to their childhood to relive and integrate childhood trauma , and even before to birth trauma and earlier events during womb life , which is neurologically possible these events operate on different levels of consciousness where the deepest level is processed in brain structures that lie on the bottom part the brain in the brainstem which handles our instincts , primitive experiences such as terror and fury , and imprints early events far below our ordinary levels of conscious awareness and that means far below the emotional experience of a surgeon whose whose life is focused on the here and now , not on his childhood and emotional trauma the top level cortex is the thinking , comprehending analytic brain that understands experience , but we have experience without all that look at the alzheimer patient who has a pretty full life , albeit unconscious or unaware , who operates on below conscious aware levels she can fall in love , care for animals , take walks with someone she cares about and carry on minimal conversations , bereft of fancy abstractions she can have a life well that is what all of us have but beyond that we have a deeper , brainstem life with a little bit of an emotional limbic system component that signifies a life before words and even before the full development of our emotions i reiterate , those brain levels exist in all of us and have their own operating system that dictates how we respond unfortunately , few of us ever have a chance to go back to visit and relive those experiences , except for our patients and what happens when they do ? the imprinted experience on the brainstem sends its nerve shoots brain pathways to higher levels that in turn respond in their own way the limbic area offers emotions to the mix , and then at long last the cortex enters the fray and adds is ideas and fantasies the final step in our work is arriving at conscious awareness lower levels rising and gathering up parts of each higher level , finally recruiting the neo cortex to make sense of it all it unifies the entire experience into a specific meaning they didn t love me how do we know ? well we have years of research behind us , discussed in peer reviewed journals , but also in our therapy when patients descend to deeper levels they not only begin to feel deep sadness or pure terror but as the feelings expands the brainwaves also mount , as does the blood pressure and body temperature more important , when the feeling is unified there is a descent of key vital signs below starting baseline that signifies the beginning of integration and over months those vital signs remain changed as the body changes we change all levels of consciousness not just the top level neo cortex , as happens in cognitive therapy we have seen patients approach these deep levels , after months of therapy , never right away , and begin their strange ideas i am in a washing machine that won t stop and i don t know how to stop it or , i am suffocating in a cave there is no air and i cannot get out these , in my experience , are derivatives of the birth experience foreshortened here , that first send up vague but related ideas , the forerunner of the reliving experience it is very possible in those who approach these experiences too soon or who have take drugs to get there , that they will get stuck in the fantasy , the dream sequence , and never arrive at a connection here is where our surgeon enters surgeons , and we have treated them , are notorious unfeeling souls who left their emotions far behind to be able to cut into our brains we get them in therapy after a stroke or from some exotic disease we get them when they have no other option they are the last to believe in feelings and the emotional level i am not sure that if we are fully feeling we could take a knife and cut into someone s brain but you know what they say , a shrink is a doctor who cannot stand the sight of blood so what happens ? experience on deep brain levels are like the spokes of a wheel that radiate upwards and forwards to inform high levels of it all but without words or verbal information we later put words and fantasy images thanks to our emotional levels and then we believe what we have experienced this only means that the person has stopped short of connection and has conflated or grown into a cosmic consciousness thanks to lsd , rebirthing and other nonsense he gets blocked on the emotional level , in this case , because the meningitis brain is not doing so well and cannot help out much and so later he really believes he has been to heaven , which our previous lsders believe after an acid trip we know from research that the acid takers are flooded with pain as the control mechanisms in the brain shut down with the drug their pain of a lifetime surges forward into the top level their only recourse is to manufacture another planet with the little cortex they have left and they can construct someplace else where all is wonderful pink clouds and softness , and especially , where death is not only not so bad but a nice place to be everyone s dream of heaven if our doctor had written that it was a horrible experience it would never be on the front page of newsweek it doesn t help that he is a scientist in fact it hurts , because he has less expertise on feelings than most of us have he is on another planet that of surgeons he states that although his top level was out of commission his lower brain levels were alive and well and they are but he never knew what lies on those levels it took us forty years to get down to those levels safely and finally to understand the brain well enough to know about those three levels and how they make out our conscious awareness we have been there and have taken careful notes on our patients experiences they go through pretty much the same thing first emotional dreamlike fantasies , as the limbic system contributes and later the concoction of elaborate notions of heaven and new planets of existence thanks to the neo cortex if you want to call that heaven that is fine but don t give it the imprimature of science it is fantasy pure and simple , even when offered by a scientist i have found that the minute a scientist gets slightly out of his specialty he tends to talk nonsense and he stops being a specialist he leaves off where we begin we don t dissect the brain but we dissect what the brain does with feelings our doctor could not do that so he hears beautiful chants and songs of angels by the way , if the top level was completely shut down where did he get the idea of angels ? he now sees that we are one , unified beings , part of all the world and then he says it gets worse he has a companion through it all , someone young and beautiful , riding along on the wings of a butterfly you need a limbic system to have even an imagined companion , so clearly , higher brain levels were at work and then without any words a wind thrusts through him and he heard , you are loved cherished you have nothing to fear there is nothing you can do wrong all three basic primal feelings that one gets to in our therapy over time but it is not an idea it is a feeling where patients beg , love me just a little say i am good and not wrong , etc basic needs that we all have and need to experience it needs connection which is liberating , something our doctor never had and needs for a real experience doctor , it is not the wind speaking it is your father years ago there was a similar book , also a best seller , who had little men who looked like et who bundled off the author to a waiting starship where they performed all kinds of booga booga on him it sounds crazy but no more crazy than riding on pink clouds with a beautiful princess it is all fantasy and does not make heaven any more real except for the true believers it is all in the mind the doctor believes , it as if i were being born into a larger world , and the universe was like a giant cosmic womb exactly a symbolic birth primal we have patients who have been on drugs or who are very disturbed who have those feelings once they connect , it all disappears but imagine me explain to the doctor that birth imprints stay in the brain and direct part of our lives and then tell him that we can relive it all he will surely think i am the crazy one he says that what he went through demands explanation here i am one part of the explanation is that as death nears the whole system goes into alarm state there is secretion of endorphins and serotonin as the system fights the danger , and then it is over or not if it is not over , the person may have felt the near death syndrome but he never went to heaven he touched on hell and that drove his brain to fabulate heaven there have many studies on near death usually it is when someone has fallen into a coma , comes out and imagines she died she didn t but that doesn t stop the notion that i left my body and traveled to another planet let us not forget that wilder penfield in canada , decades ago put an electric probe on areas of the temporal lobe of those undergoing surgery for epilepsy and got delusions and hallucinations it so happened that the closer he got to the actual memory site the more real the memory became all this means that we can get all of these fantasies in a surgical setting in those not near death the minute that we interfere with neurotransmitters we can get this effect , as well lsd affects serotonin turnover and this can result in disinhibition which then results in delusions as repression and inhibition falters in short , we cannot believe what the cortex tells us when lower brain levels is telling us something else but when the cortex offers goodies such as gorgeous girls and heaven instead of death it can t be beat if i were to take this doctor into therapy we would get to the real feelings eventually but then he couldn t sell a million books
