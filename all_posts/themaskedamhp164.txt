masked amhp hi , blog reader nice of you to drop by blog reader clash of the titans , eh ? what s that all about then ? ma i m glad you asked me that this post is all about when s aftercare goes bad br ooer ! tell me more ma don t worry , i will this is essentially all about local authorities and their efforts to avoid their financial responsibilities to provide aftercare under s but don t go away , it s fascinating honest just to briefly recap on my last post about s , the mha established the duty of pct s and local authorities to provide aftercare to people who had been detained under sec and certain other sections imposed by the criminal courts from then on , many local authorities challenged the implication that they could not charge for aftercare services under s as far back as , the department of health had to issue guidance stating clearly services provided under section of the mental health act are not subject to charging in , a parliamentary written answer stated charges cannot be levied for services , residential or non residential , which are provided as part of the programme of after care for a patient under section hansard written answers , july , col br i ve think i ve got that carry on ma if only local authorities were as astute as you ! a number of local authorities over the years have sought to either challenge this statement or find ways around it a good example is regina v manchester city council ex p stennett and two other actions ukhl this involved consideration by the court of appeal of cases of people with mental illness who had been detained under sec , discharged into residential care and then charged for their accommodation these cases were appealed by the individuals , and their appeals were upheld the local authorities involved then took the cases to the house of lords they argued that s merely operated as a gateway section to trigger provisions under other statutory provisions , for example , sec national assistance act , under which services can be charged the court of appeal dismissed this argument and the appeals br quite right , too justice prevails ma but then another tack is to simply try to avoid providing appropriate aftercare at all ak v central and north west london mental health nhs trust and the royal borough of kensington and chelsea , queen s bench division , th may concerned the case of a man with schizophrenia who made an apparent suicide attempt by jumping from the second floor window of bed and breakfast accommodation whilst he was under the care of a mental health nhs trust and the local authority he was seriously injured he brought a case of negligence against them for failure to provide appropriate aftercare under s , as he had previously been detained under sec , specifically , for failing to provide or arrange for the provision of a competent social worker or care coordinator to address the claimant s need for high to medium supported accommodation , and to ensure his safety by securing such a placement the original case was dismissed , but there was a further appeal to the court of appeal , which found that both the nhs trust and the local authority , as well as acting negligently , had breached articles of the european court of human rights , and the appeal was allowed br the european court of human rights , eh ? this goes right to the top , doesn t it ? by the way , just remind me what articles are ? ma i do like your questions it s almost as if i wrote them myself article prohibits torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , and article concerns the right to respect for private and family life br do you think that s why the present government has been talking about getting rid of the human rights act ? ma i couldn t possibly comment br do local authorities always get a hammering ? ma mmmm , let me think not always , there s the case commonly known as mwanza r v greenwich london borough council and bromley london borough council , ex parte michael mwanza ewhc admin qbd admin hickinbottom j th june this case involved a zambian national who was in this country on the basis that his wife had a student visa he was subsequently detained under sec he and his wife stayed in this country for several years , during which time his wife s student visa ran out and they were then considered to be residing in this country unlawfully , so they were unable to work or claim benefits he applied for accommodation and financial support when this was refused , he applied for judicial review on the basis that s aftercare covered both eventualities , as they could be considered to be necessary in order to prevent a deterioration in his mental health the court found that a local authority s duty to provide aftercare was limited to the services necessary to meet a need arising from a person s mental disorder as his mental disorder had not been the cause of his homelessness or destitution , then there was no requirement on the local authority to meet this need br that must have been a relief ma you re right , it does put clear limits on what can be considered to be aftercare , ie services only need to be provided under s in order to meet an assessed mental health need br any other problems around provision of s aftercare ? ma this is where it gets really dirty local authorities mud wrestling with each other over which one is responsible for providing aftercare ! figuratively speaking , of course i m not suggesting that representatives of local authorities literally get into a pool of mud and resolve disagreements over funding by wrestling with each other br i didn t think you were ma although , come to think of it , it could be a good way of sorting out disputes br so , what sort of disagreements do they have ? are they fighting over the opportunity to pay for aftercare ? ma hardly i ll give you a theoretical , but not unusual , scenario mr x lives in the area covered by authority a he has paranoid schizophrenia , becomes unwell , and is detained under sec mha the s aftercare planning meeting concludes that he needs specialist long term care that can only provided in a care home they find an appropriate home in the area covered by authority b and he is placed there a year or so later , his mental state deteriorates and he is again detained under sec so who is responsible for his aftercare when he recovers ? br well , if authority a placed him there , then surely they are still responsible for his aftercare ? ma wrong you see , he has changed the place of his residence he no longer resides in authority a , but authority b therefore authority b has to pick up the tab for aftercare br let me think about this so authority a might be quite happy for mr x to become unwell and need detaining again , because they would no longer have any responsibility for providing aftercare ? ma i m sure that no local authority would be so unscrupulous as to permit that to happen but there are some local authorities in the country that have a lot of care homes compared to other places , and therefore other local authorities frequently make placements out of area those local authorities can therefore end up with a disproportionate number of complex cases for whom they become responsible for the duty to provide s aftercare and they re often not terribly happy about it consequently , they go to law from time to time there have been a couple of very recent court cases in which the courts have been asked to make judgments about which local authority is responsible r hertfordshire county council v lb hammersmith and fulham jm as interested party court of appeal , carnwath , rimer and sullivan ljj , ewca civ , th february , and r on the application of sunderland city council v south tyneside council ewhc admin qbd admin langstaff j th july the first case looks at the concept of ordinary residence as defined by sec national assistance act , and dismisses it for the purposes of s aftercare during the court case , the argument was explicitly advanced that there was a need to reduce the temptation for local authorities to place people for whom provision was made under sec out of their area so that the authority in which they were placed became responsible if sec of the mha was invoked this argument , however , was dismissed in the second case , one of the conclusions was that there was no material difference between resident , ordinarily resident and normally resident , and also that a hospital could not be considered to be a place of residence for these purposes that would be a relief to local authorities who have hospitals where people from out of area may frequently be admitted br well , thanks again , masked amhp , for yet another enlightening post i will in particular be left with an indelible image of directors of adult services slugging it out together in a pool of mud over who s going to pay for mr x s aftercare ma it s my pleasure
