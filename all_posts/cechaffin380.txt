i had a dream about the superbowl last night in which the bears won despite a last second touchdown by the colts that was disallowed , and pandemonium ensued as sides warred over the trophy as my chances of prediction are , my vision , even if true , means nothing statistically unless the game ends as i saw i do n't like watching football much , though i did catch the colts vs patriots game , which was excellent i think it 's the grinding inevitability of football , only occasionally punctuated by a few great plays , that keeps me from it except for free throws and timeouts , i find basketball infinitely preferable mood same as yesterday , but i had many dreams we ate yellow coral mushrooms for the first time delicious whether they induce more dreaming i do n't know thine , ce
