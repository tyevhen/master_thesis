sitting here drinking my coffee this morning , i'm tired but satisfied i survived my very busy week and while i did n't do so perfectly , i made it my house is a bit of a mess , the laundry needs to be done , jet needs some attention and exercise , my bills need to be paid , and i need some groceries , but hey , i survived looking back , i worked of the last days , got in a couple of cycling classes , and made it to one step meeting i tackled an urgent medical situation and a sick friend i traveled miles round trip to see an expert regarding the ongoing saga with my teeth , specifically my missing canine and i checked in with my psychiatrist my mood is okay i 've been so focused on going forward and doing what i needed to do next , i do n't think i had much time to even consider my mood maybe that 's fine as i sit here now , checking in with myself , i think i'm okay like i said , i'm tired i 'd really like to crawl back into bed , but i 've got a lot to do today before returning to work tomorrow it was an abnormal week for me i had more time and energy constraints i missed about half my normal amount of exercise , including all but one of the therapeutic for both of us walks with jet i had to cancel my hour with a private patient i assist i normally attend three , not just one , step meetings and like i said my bills , chores , and errands were all put on hold today getting groceries is a priority as my stock dwindled this week , and as my fatigue rose , i found myself eating more and more junk sugar is my primary foe i crave it like mad and put up only cursory defense when my energy is low unfortunately , i indulged those cravings these last couple of days , and as is typical , i ended up feeling like crud , physically and mentally , afterward it 's time to get some better nutritional options back into my house i'm looking forward to what i hope will be a slightly less busy , less stressful week ahead i will be working four days , but only two in a row , as i have wednesday off i'm already committed to attending at least two meetings , as i am actually leading one finally , i plan to find more time for jet and exercise and less time for ice cream ! i 'll let you know how it goes carry on , my friends
