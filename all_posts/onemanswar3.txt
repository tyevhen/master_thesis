by jack smith this has everything to do with mental health and nothing to do with mental health publishing here because several folks asked me to i posted this on facebook last night after an experience with little league baseball sports are a lot like life the battles we learn to fight there may help us when we face far more imposing opponents , like disappointment , loss or mental illness we can all use good coaches to help us through the hard times couple observations about youth sports and coaches encouragement works yelling does not watch elite coaches who 've won national championships up close and personal and you 'll learn this lesson children have good memories so do n't tell them one thing before the game and another after a loss that 's called hypocrisy kids may not know how to spell it but they know how to smell it from left field respect must be earned not demanded kids do n't care how much you know until they know how much you care about them not the game you are trying to win to prop up your own ego it 's not possible to be objective about your own children so guard against that blind spot everyone else sees it from miles away
