this is the first of a serie of articles by peter prontzos peter g prontzos department of political science langara college vancouver , b c note my scientific associate bruce wilson bruce medicalwriter ca contributed valuable research for this essay introduction even though al gore won the presidential election in , tens of millions of americans voted for george w bush tens of millions voted for bush again in , despite the lies , the wars , and his obvious incompetence , ignorance , and arrogance such a high level of support was not rational , except perhaps from those who bush once described as the haves and have mores the elite my base fahrenheit it s hardly surprising that the wealthy and powerful would vote for someone who would make them even wealthier and more powerful but what about all those , especially working people , who voted for a candidate committed to an agenda e g increasing inequality , environmental destruction which was against their own rational self interest ? why were they fooled in such great numbers ? some of the answers are obvious , such as the way that most of the media framed the issues and the greater corporate funding for republicans the power of such influential actors should not be misunderestimated sic these factors were more salient in , following the terrorist attacks on september in that election , bush benefited from the turn to authoritarian leaders and institutions for security that fear often produces jost , there are , however , other factors which account for much of the irrationality of those who have less voting for a puppet of those who have more a view of the world and themselves that is neither conscious nor rational , but based largely on reflexive actions , unconscious feelings , and social conditioning all of which can lower a person s emotional intelligence such ideologies , like virtually all other belief systems , are adopted in part because they satisfy various psychological needs jost , op cit this essay will consider three levels of unconscious influences on political ideology first are the automatic processes which we have inherited from our remote ancestors , such as the flight , flight , or freeze response to perceived threats , and the tendency to be biased towards those ideas that make us feel better second , are the effects that parenting , socialization , and modeling have on our thoughts and actions , as well as our view of ourselves and the world our ideology this conditioning may begin before birth , and have profound effects in later years a third critical driver of unconscious , irrational behaviour derives from the dynamics of the particular situation in which a person finds him or her self social psychology has shown that situations and the actions of peers can shape both an individual s beliefs and behaviours i the automatic brain any explanation of human activity including political behaviour and beliefs that neglects the unconscious processes that shape our worldviews , our ideologies , is incomplete most of our thoughts and feelings are below the threshold of consciousness and , in the view of cordelia fine your unconscious is smarter than you , faster than you , and more powerful than you it may even control you fine , understanding these mental and emotional phenomena must begin with the fact that the human mind is embodied and that our ideas and feelings do not float around somewhere in the mind rather , they are mental and emotional reflections of physical states of the brain and body and our relationships with the outside world siegel , the body is the basis of human subjectivity , while the mind , in turn , is an emergent quality it developed from other abilities e g being aware of our environment , both external and internal a symphony provides a metaphor for the relationship between the body and the mind while the music is created by people and their instruments , the music itself is something different , even though it is created by the physical actions of the musicians the music cannot exist without the orchestra , of which it is an epiphenomenon and like music , the mind itself is a continuing , ever changing process and not a static , eternal thing second , the mind must be seen in the light of our primate past and in the context of how evolution shaped both brain and behaviour such traits as the fight , flight , or freeze response , the tendency to perceive patterns with only minimal information , and the urge to deny what one does not like , do not support rational decision making for instance , a study last year found that , people who believe they would be bothered by a range of hypothetical disgusting situations display an increased likelihood of displaying right of center rather than left of center political orientations smith , et al mounting evidence points to the relevance of subconscious factors in broad social , decision making situations and in specifically political decision making situations the established role of such factors opens the door for the possible involvement of biological variables , including hormone and neurotransmitter levels and neural traits and patterns psychologist daniel kahneman , who won a nobel prize in economics ! , points out , in his fascinating book , thinking , fast and slow , that our unconscious mind is constantly making judgments and decisions of which we are mostly unaware our minds are susceptible to systematic error , in large part due to , our excessive confidence in what we believe we know and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance , as well as because of the inherent uncertainty about the world nevertheless , both thoughts and feelings are needed to make rational choices neuroscience has shown that clear thinking requires the careful engagement of one s emotions , contrary to descartes and much of the western tradition uc berkeley cognitive scientist george lakoff and mark johnson have found that everyday human reason does not fit this classical view of rationality at all while rational thought is assumed to be dispassionate , lakoff and johnson show that , emotional engagement is an absolutely necessary component of means end rationality they also argue that the capitalist view defining rationality as the pursuit of self interest makes no sense given the unconsciousness of most reasoning , the existence of conflicting goals , and inconsistent understanding of self interest we are not rational self interest maximizers in the traditional liberal sense ibid the case for the economic rational actor whose decisions are not based on emotion except , of course , by greed is seriously deficient the capitalist homo economicus is a fictitious individual because human judgment may take shortcuts that systematically depart from rationality altmann emphasis added the new field of neuroeconomics is showing why so many calculations of value are not rational our decisions are determined by an almost endless number of factors , such as risk aversion , fear , wishful thinking , endowment effects from ownership , lack of information , pre conceptions , biases , and cognitive dissonance
