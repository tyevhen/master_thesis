i'm busy preparing for chicago i just had a really great run , so i'm feeling more confident about running well in chicago on sunday i only have a couple of mile runs left , tomorrow and saturday , before the big event i 've been mentally preparing by picturing myself running confidently and comfortably past various mile markers and across the finish line marathon day is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one , so i think it helps to do some visualization beforehand i'm really looking forward to a good race speaking of mental , i'm still doing well my mood has been good i 've had enough energy to work and run and take care of my pre travel business of course , most days do include a minute nap , but that 's always been a part of my routine i need a lot of sleep i'm grateful to be doing well i'm looking forward to seeing d in just a couple of days we are going to chicago together he ran his marathon this past sunday , so he 'll be my cheerleader in chicago we have n't seen each other since mid august , so i'm just as anxious to see him as i am to run i 'll try to post an update or two when i'm in chicago as is typical , i'm sure there will be a lengthy dissection of my race at some point you may suffer through it if you so choose until then , carry on , my friends
