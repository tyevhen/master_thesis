equanimity , it was a word with which i was unfamiliar baron baptiste , in his book days to a personal revolution , defined equanimity as the art of meeting life as it meets you calmly , without drama or fuss i loved that ! calmly and without drama or fuss one of the things i 've learned throughout the last years of illness , and especially during the past plus years of sobriety , is apparently equanimity it took me awhile , but through cbt , dbt , and the big book , i eventually learned to meet life where life met me attempting to change or control life , or those in it , is akin to banging my head against the wall i'm not always perfect at this lesson , but life is definitely less painful if i'm not banging my head against a wall baptiste goes on to quote the infamous serenity prayer , which is used daily hopefully by those of us in recovery he states , when we become centered enough , we have the ability to accept the things we cannot change , and are able to instantly and humbly admit that our willpower and ego are ultimately powerless over most of the realities in our lives i do n't know about the instantly part of this statement it took me a few bloody noggin episodes before i got it but i digress one of the things i cannot change is my diagnosis i have depression it 's a reality that became a lot easier to accept once i stopped trying to exert control over it once i stopped playing with , changing or discontinuing my medications once i stopped self medicating with alcohol once i stopped ignoring my symptoms , or worse , actively fighting against them once i stopped trying to figure out why i felt so bad once i stopped trying to be in control and instead accepted my mood , my fatigue , and my thinking my life with depression got easier it 's not fun i do n't enjoy it , but i do n't have a bloody forehead either as baptiste points out , fighting only leads to more struggle you do n't get to the light by fighting or wrestling for control with my sometimes irrational illness , it is in surrendering that i find peace it is waiting , as in waiting out the bad times , that allows me to cope we change by finding equanimity and learning to relax right in the middle of conflict filled moments , baptiste says equanimity releases us from unrealistic expectations about what life should be and allows us to stay centered amid the inevitable highs and lows how many of us with mental illness have railed against our inevitable highs and lows ? how many of us have thought , or even said , this is not what my life should be like ! this is not what i planned ! if you are like me , you did n't plan to lose your job to illness you did n't plan to lose your spouse to illness you did n't plan to lose your financial security or friends to illness if you are like me , you 've spent a lot of time struggling against symptoms you ultimately could n't control this is not equanimity this is drama and fuss baptiste 's discussion of equanimity reinforces acceptance as the answer i'm not talking about lying down and playing victim , but rather accepting my life , and illness , right where they are calmly , without drama or fuss i pray for acceptance of the things i cannot change , courage to change the things i can , and the wisdom to know the difference it 's not necessarily simple , but in my experience , it makes my life simpler
