stevebmd asked is there a way to find out the street value of various psych meds in different cities ? we know that benzos and opioids are highly valued , but i'm curious about other things like antipsychotics and sleep meds so i did some googling and did not find much i even went on erowid com , but could n't find much there , either so , i thought i 'd set up a little database for people to enter what they know about the street value of , say , a mg pill of seroquel now , i am not trying to encourage these sorts of illicit transactions you do know that it is a federal offense to sell a controlled prescription drug , right ? indeed , the more we become aware of the potential for diversion of the drugs we prescribe , the more we can guard against it so , please complete the following form for any medications you may have knowledge of either from asking your patients or from your own personal knowledge include your zip code so that i can set up a google map of all the entries once we have a number of datapoints , i will add the map to this post view database
