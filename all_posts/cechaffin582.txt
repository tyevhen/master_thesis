fairy tale rejection seems as alien to you as your face reflected in aquarium glass , fish passing through your ears yet familiar as your mother s sour breath as she snored insensibly beside a littoral of beer cans each day brings floods , fires , crashes terror to those who never suspected nature and neighbors as enemies if tragedy is interruption of the usual pain by something greater , yours is that nothing can make another love you in today 's poem the speaker turns from memories to an actual person , addressing someone near though blind in his view after the soul killing experience of depression the speaker has difficulty imagining what it must be like for the other person how could she not suspect that anything , anytime , could turn on her ? worse , how can one 's chief motive for living be to avoid rejection when rejection is inevitable ? to live for the approval of others is to not have a life rejection begins when we are thrust out of the womb and continues as we are weaned , expected to communicate through language , abandoned to our own locomotion , and later to our own lives independence requires an increasing loss of dependence this is healthy and normal , but the pain of that loss cannot be helped to live for the approval of others means a stunted , infantile development after surviving depression , the speaker finds this attitude beyond belief then perhaps he is being too hard on others ? ce
