so as part of my fitness for work , i was sent to a neuropsychologist for testing it all started with a two hour interview i have to say i am getting pretty good at all this divulging stuff cause something came out during that interview that shocked me he asked me about traumas i have had i mentioned that when i was a child , my parents would go on vacation without the kids , more often without me as being the youngest and rd child , i was the expensive one one time they forgot to come back for a week during that week , i thought i had been abandoned the aunt i was staying with thought my family had died so she was showing signs of stress the psychologist asked if it had a lasting effect on my i realized that it did i had trouble forming close relationships , had trouble trusting people because of that event if i care about them too much , it hurts more when they leave and they will always leave when i made the comment i now take for granted that they wo n't stick around the psychologists face registered emotion it goes on par with the fact that i am unlovable i guess anyways quite enlightening the second day was all kinds of tests emotional intelligence ei tests intelligence quotient iq tests memory tests short term only processing tests and so many more when i left my brain was hurting i would like to know the results of the tests i guess i should ask i did stop to think at a certain point that even though they were doing all these tests , it would give them a result they would know if i have bad memory short term , if i have emotional tolerance but as for the iq aspect , without something to compare it against how do they know that i have a reduced ability compared to me ? they 'll know what my ability compared to the average joe is , but not compared to what i can normally do i used to tell my former doctor that at my reduced ability mentally , i was still higher ability than many she saw that as a sign of mania it 's like telling ben johnson that because he says he can run faster than the average joe on a bad day , he has an inflated sense of self that would be a wrong assumption now would it not be ? note my mental abilities are not exactly like ben johnson 's running ability just using exaggeration to illustrate my point thanks for reading
