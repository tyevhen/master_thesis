when i was in my s , i had little exposure or belief in intuitive abilities but , one day a chance encounter with a friend caused me to question my skepticism about intuition and to , eventually , explore how intuitive abilities can be developed in relation to creativity abilities my introduction to intuition beatrice at bondini 's i remember the day that i ran into a close friend on my way home i had walked from my job at nyu medical center to the west village and i was about to get on the train to go home as i was going through the turnstile to get on the train , my friend was , coincidentally , coming through the same turnstile on the other side we both laughed at the timing of meeting each other this way in a city of eight million people when i asked her where she was going , she told me that she had an appointment with someone named beatrice at bondini 's restaurant on w th street in the village i knew of bondini 's italian restaurant from a former boyfriend 's mother who would rave about their food but i 'd never been there and i had never heard of anyone named beatrice there when i asked my friend about this , she hesitated then , she grabbed my arm and told me to come with her to see beatrice , who was a psychic i remember laughing and teasing my friend all the way there because she believed in psychics her only response was , you 'll see since my curiosity was greater than my skepticism , i went along with her i thought i would encounter a woman with a turban on her head looking into a crystal ball , but beatrice was an average down to earth woman who looked and acted nothing like i expected she had a room in the back of the restaurant , but she had no mystical props or crystal balls originally , i had no intention of getting a reading from beatrice but , once again , my curiosity was greater than my skepticism , so when my friend volunteered me to go first , i went along with it , not expecting very much beatrice asked if she could hold an item that belonged to me , so i gave her a topaz ring that i wore everyday for the last years or so then , to my great surprise , without my uttering a question or a word or giving her any information , she began telling me , in detail , about the man i was dating not only did she describe his physical appearance , his personality and how he interacted with me , but she also described the strong effect he had on everyone around him that he charmed both men and women , so much so that he was often able to get away with things that most people could n't have gotten away with i knew this to be absolutely true and had seen it many times fortunately , he was n't a sociopath , so he did n't use his charm in any illegal or unethical ways needless to say , i was stunned she told me things about him that even my close friend did n't know all the while , i said nothing , so she was n't pumping me with questions for information , as many so called psychics do i did n't understand what was happening , but i was fascinated so , unable to resist , i asked her if she had a sense of our future as a couple she was very tactful and kind there was no drama or offer to sell me love candles or love bath she simply said that she did n't see us staying together until then , everything she said rang true , but i thought she really got this wrong but sure enough , a few months later , we broke up while i was in my s , i went to see beatrice a few more times i continued to be fascinated by her intuitive abilities and level headed , no nonsense approach then , she was written up in new york magazine , and it became difficult to see her without making a six month in advance appointment because she became so popular , so i stopped seeing her developing intuition following my experience with beatrice , i attended a workshop with a woman in nj , who used her psychic abilities to help the police solve crimes she was also very down to earth and had a good reputation among law enforcement she made the practice of developing intuition for the average person seem like the most natural thing in the world i also read books about intuition and became interested in dream work as i followed my dreams , i began to have flashes of intuition , both in my dreams and in my waking hours i did n't have any earth shattering intuitive flashes about world events these flashes of intuition were mostly about my everyday life and the people in it intuition for creative solutions over time , i came to trust these flashes of intuition to help me come up with creative solutions to everyday life situations i find that the more connected i am to my dreams , the sharper my intuitive abilities are during everyday situations i am , by no means , a psychic and my intuitive abilities do n't extend beyond the ordinary situations that develop in life , but i 've found that using intuition to tap into creative , problem solving abilities has added a richer dimension to my life of course , the ability to use logic is crucial to living our lives but rather than being exclusively focused on only living a life based on logic , i encourage people to develop their intuitive side , if this is something that interests them intuition and dreams one way to develop intuition is to pay attention to your dreams not all of them will be intuitive dreams , but you might find that , if you write them down and make them a priority , you might get glimpses into your intuitive side then , rather than being skeptical about intuition , as i was initially when i was in my s , if you remain open and curious , you might discover that your intuition can be tapped into to enhance your creative abilities i 've included some resources below if you 're interested in developing your
