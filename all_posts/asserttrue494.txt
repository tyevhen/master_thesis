punctuation matters a while ago , i wrote about some easy ways to pump up your writing it turned out to be a fairly popular post though nowhere near as popular as my january post on how to write an opening sentence , which got a bewildering , page views i thought i 'd share a couple dozen more of my favorite tricks for forcing oneself to do a better job of writing so here goes disclaimer all rules can be broken try sticking to them first on a separate piece of paper or in a separate doc file , write down as simply as you can your main message what you 're wanting to say keep that piece of paper or doc file visible , off to the side , while you work avoid long sentences try varying your sentence lengths more paragraph lengths too when in doubt , leave it out fewer words equals less revision do n't hoard a good phrase until the ideal situation comes write full out , all the time hold nothing back do n't tell me the moon is shining show me the glint of light on broken glass chekhov an ultra short sentence at the beginning or end of a paragraph adds impact try it go back to the last thing you wrote and strip all the adjectives and adverbs out how does it read now ? stop using seamlessly unless of course you 're a seamstress stop using effectively it adds nothing stop using burgeoning trite lazy never use whilst , thusly , ergo , or any other arch words that make you sound like an insufferable pedant substitute 'damn' every time you write 'very' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be mark twain stop giving a shit what your english teacher thinks get on with it if any sentence has you working on it longer than seconds , rewrite it immediately as two or more short sentences recombine ask a friend to change three words in something you just wrote go back and edit something you wrote a year ago notice how much of it stinks in thirty seconds or less , take three words out of whatever you just wrote if you ca n't do it , the penalty is to take out six words learn to recognize , and stop using , overused expressions a good rule is if you 've heard it before , do n't use it things like hell bent , all hell broke loose , adjective as the dickens , so quiet you could hear a pin drop , etc will creep into your writing while you 're not looking go back and find such atrocities rip them out set ablaze bury specificity counts your friend does n't drive a car she drives a tired looking red camry it 's not a sweltering hot day it 's the kind of summer day that makes even pigeons sweat the gunman did n't have a gun he had a caliber semi automatic glock see the difference ? do n't use the same adjective , adverb , or pronoun more than once in the same paragraph unless of course somebody is holding a caliber glock to your face see how long you can hold out before using any word a second time think of synonyms , alternative phrasings , pseuodnyms , creative euphemisms , indirect references , colloquialisms , never before heard coinages anything except the same old word , repeated elmore leonard once said if it sounds like writing , i rewrite it leonard also said to leave out the parts people skip read good writing
