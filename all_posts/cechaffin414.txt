celebrity i heard the raven call me to its nest blue wings on black , he made a low pitched caw i went to climb his tree i did my best thick overhanging limbs made me withdraw he ruffled in a redwood far above me and still he called , and still i answered back i think he was the first bird ever to love me even though i was white and he was black we strive for some great prize above our station , to win the lottery or find a cure for cancer , or to uplift our sad nation embroiled in a suicidal war i ll take the raven , he s high enough for me let others scramble for celebrity i returned to the sonnet today because yesterday s was so inferior i had to make a second stab at it i love the way sonnets often unfold the first eight lines are a set up , and the last six often an exposition certainly that obtains for today s offering i wasn t as anxious this morning and have no notion why i made the coffee and went back into my html madness , trying to construct a website as the final project for my class i m not the greatest detail person , and in code you can make very few mistakes so i end up scanning my code for missing quotation marks or semicolons that can make the whole difference for what code follows with luck i ll have a website up by the new year then anyone interested in my poetry and essays can go straight to them and avoid the blog or do both i do admit some of my literary essays may be slow going for the uninitiated , but i believe the prose is clear it s the ideas that give some trouble , or so i flatter myself to believe had a much needed tune up for our beater van , from which we ve lost , in our travels , all the back seats , and whose sliding doors only open on the driver s side at least we recently paid it off , and though ugly , it is reliable i would love to drive it into a tony la restaurant and hand the keys to the attendant , sandwiched between a jaguar and a rolls it s raining pretty steadily here yesterday on our walk i nabbed a king bolete and a chanterelle prized mushrooms kathleen called me her truffle hound so after all these years i ve finally discovered what i m good at collecting fungi the mold in the shower was trying to tell me but i didn t listen nor did i listen to the ringworm of my patients but the call to fungi was always there unrated , ce
