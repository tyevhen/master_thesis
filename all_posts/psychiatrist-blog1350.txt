so what , exactly , does the term lock down mean to you ? from time to time , dear clinkshrink tells me the prison or the hospital or her kitchen is on lock down she says this so matter of factly that i 've never pressed for details hmmmm , did the garlic try to escape ? can you leave if you want ? what if someone has to go to the bathroom ? where is your cell phone during this process ? what if your meter runs out ? how long is the longest a lock down can last ? is everyone locked down ? to what ? i have visions this does n't sound good if clinkshrink were n't so matter of fact , i 'd worry , but she never does what images does lockdown conjure up for you ?
