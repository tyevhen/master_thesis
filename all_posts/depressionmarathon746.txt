ten years gone finished over it 's now been one decade since depression stole the life i once had , shredded it , and threw it away it 's my own , personal lost decade i could spend the rest of this post lamenting everything i 've lost spouse , friends , home , job , financial security , opportunity but lamenting the losses wo n't bring them back and i 've already spent plenty of time lamenting over the past ten years including time earlier this month suffice it to say that depression , like any other major illness , is a life altering event my life has certainly been altered i was so sick in those early years , i do n't know how i made it to this point i could n't do anything , take care of anything , or sustain a relationship my head was sunk in a morass so dark and thick , death felt like my only option fortunately , i failed at that , too at some point a few years into my lost decade , the drinking began drinking worked where nothing else would it numbed me it stole me away from my barely tolerable reality it was a miracle unfortunately , the miracle cure quickly became its own separate problem help , fortunately , was something i was lucky to get and willing to accept an inpatient dbt program , outpatient dbt groups , and years of aa have taught me life skills to deal with people , places , and things including my illness medications have been tweaked , and tweaked , and tweaked again numerous doctors , psychologists , social workers , sponsors , friends , family and patients have helped me find a level of stability i never thought possible just years ago i would never wish this devastating illness on anyone yet because of depression and alcoholism , i have reinvented myself i look nothing today like i did years ago in almost every way , i'm actually a better , kinder , more responsible , harder working , more humble and grateful person than i used to be is it possible to grieve the loss of a life i will never know while simultaneously feeling grateful for the difficult , painful path i 've been given ? i think so it 's been ten years one decade no , i would not want to re live this decade but today , on a day when my mood is low and my thoughts are still off , i have to look for the gratitude i have to , or i will not survive ten years is a long , long time here 's hoping year is the best one yet
