hey friends ! today marks weeks in my pregnancy ! i went in to get checked out today and i 've still made no progress no dilation , no changes so , i am to head in this thursday afternoon where they will insert the cervidil and i 'll spend the night as my cervix ripens friday morning , if labor has n't begun from the cervidil , i will be induced with pitocin and then have a baby according to my doctor looks like we 'll have a baby in our may day basket ! my fingers are crossed that it will go ok i know anything is possible , so i'm trying to not expect anything of certainty just that little p will arrive and be healthy i 've got a bunch of work to wrap up today , so i 'll leave you with that but i certainly have a lot of thoughts running through my brain and i 'll have to check in with you tomorrow ! the adrenaline that is running through my veins right now well i bet i could throw a schoolbus save you might also like weeks weeks weeks linkwithin
