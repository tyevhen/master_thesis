in one of my classes i received a less than stellar grade on a group assignment at first , i began to work myself up my pulse quickened my mind raced and i began to blame myself i had thought we had done an average , if not above average , job but the professor disagreed i remained in temper for several hours i did spot that to talk it up is to work it up and avoided bringing up my disappointment with others i avoided apologizing to other group members as excessive apologizing is a form of temper i have spotted that my imagination was on fire , and i have been taking steps to practice forced objectivity so i do not dwell on this triviality i m endorsing for my efforts before recovery , i would have called up many people to analyze this grade for hours on end now i know better this is a triviality and not worth working myself up over
