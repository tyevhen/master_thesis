my mom was here today and told me about this story which was on the nbc nightly news the other night i encourage you all to watch of course this woman 's story hits very close to home for me , being the mom of two boys with autism myself and the pure joy she feels at her son 's accomplishment is something that every autism parent strives for on a daily basis kudos to nbc news for putting this on their broadcast a dose of reality for everyone what we wish for more than anything else in the world is for our child to communicate with us the day nate said i want cup will go down as one of the best days of my life now if only he would start saying it again
