this is the strangest bit of lexical legerdemain i 've seen in a while according to the sept post on the twitter blog which tries to explain twitter 's new terms of service in plain english twitter is allowed to use , copy , reproduce , process , adapt , modify , publish , transmit , display and distribute your tweets because that 's what we do however , they are your tweets and they belong to you pray tell me , in what possible sense does something belong to me if i 've given every worthwhile right of usage over to somebody else ?
