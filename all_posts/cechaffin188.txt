we just passed the anniversary of my daughter 's memorial service prior to that , on the anniversary of her death , we scattered her ashes where the river meets the sea on the mendocino coast , where she and jacob had played together it was tough but also freeing amidst my tears i lost control of the empty bag of ashes while being pushed at once from both the river and ocean currents i almost fell in i did n't recover the bag there 's a poem in that while looking through a draft file last night i found a three line sketch and re formatted it on rachel 's death the hole in the ground left by the tree the hole left by her life or my life or any life always lacks dirt enough to cover the uprooted root crown loss is a coin tossed down a depthless well you listen for a splash that never comes i'm in some sort of mixed state , can go from anger to worry to sadness to confidence to happiness in a matter of hours i 've increased my abilify dose because of it are n't some of the olympic commercials terrific ? love the united ads in kiloinstability , ce
