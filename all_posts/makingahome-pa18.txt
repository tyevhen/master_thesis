yes , well apparently the wild things are in my house the kids found a baby cottontail rabbit in our back field yesterday one of our dogs had gotten a hold of it besides being covered in saliva , it seemed to be all in one piece we could n't locate the rabbit nest so my kids brought it into our nest of course , the kids were elated at this opportunity as we just finished reading the green ember last week ! i did some research and found that if they still have the little white blaze on their forehead , they are too young to be left alone in the wilderness i could not , in good conscious , let this little furry ball of cute be put back out in the frigid temps it snowed here again , people and especially knowing that it was absolutely too young to make it on its own so i found a recipe for milk replacement for wild rabbits , and we mixed some up thankfully , i had a syringe that i had washed and saved so we used that to feed the rabbit the milk lily has taken on the role of surrogate mother , and she is fulfilling her duty quite well she 's feeding it , massaging its belly that is supposed to help its digestion , talking to it , reassuring it , making sure it stays warm we filled a couple of old socks up with beans and are heating them up and putting them under the towel in the box to keep him her warm and cozy oh , she 's in her element , this daughter of mine and , of course , brad and i did n't argue with any of this why would we ? we 're past that by now we just chalk this things up to wonderful learning experiences and wonderful ways to teach our children to care for god 's creation
