once we have a firm grasp of history and its evolution we will know that addressing mental illness is not a matter of just understanding it but being immersed in it submerged in our history , in its feelings , ceding to its power until words our top level brain will no longer suffice only feelings can words will simply not do it in fact , words are the antithesis of cure , inimical to any therapeutic progress , as odd as that sounds , because they are too often used for a defense as a matter of fact , in many situations the more the intellectual brain is active the more suppressed the feeling centers are i practiced freudian oriented psychotherapy for many years one key reason was that there was relatively nothing else for the practice of dynamic psychotherapy at least freud posited an unconscious , and were he alive today i am sure he would not be a freudian let me start with my first important observation in therapy a young man in conventional group therapy was recounting a visit he made in new york to see raphael ortiz in the theater of the absurd he said that ortiz was marching up and down the stage shouting mama ! and inviting the audience to do the same when they did many people in the audience began to cry and scream i encouraged this young man to do the same he refused but i insisted finally he began to scream mama ! , fell off the chair and was writhing in pain on the floor it went on for a half hour , something i had never seen before when he came out of it he touched the carpet and said , i can feel ! he felt different i taped this session and for years afterward i listened to it to see what secrets this held i also tried this again on other patients with very much the same result i knew that i saw something that therapists practically never see but i did not know what it meant i finally figured out what it meant only years later i tried to see what these patients had in common it was feelings access to feelings that made the difference it would take another twenty five years to figure out what was going on inside the person and her brain but there was some basic truth i had uncovered the result , i believe , is a new paradigm in psychotherapy and it is not just a belief obviously , if we allow patients to go deeply into their past without any intellectual interference we can learn so much there lies a sequestered reality undreamed of in our field and there lies the cure by cure i mean arriving at ultimate causes if we see time after time that those with migraine often relive oxygen deprivation at birth we begin to realize that perhaps oxygen deprivation may be one cause of later migraine particularly when those migraine begin to disappear after many relivings this without a fixed theoretical mind set the same is true of many symptoms until we see in therapy the relationship between high blood pressure and traumatic events around birth we cannot alter it significantly cure means addressing and reliving the ultimate cause of our behavior and physical problems we cannot do that until we acknowledge that very early events , even before birth , are imprinted and endure for a lifetime that in order to eradicate serious even life threatening symptoms we need to go back and relive those suffering aspects of an imprint that could not be experienced originally due to their load of pain in my book , primal healing , i document the many , many studies that confirm the enduring power of early imprints there is no jungian unconscious or shadow forces to blind us to the patient s reality , no id nor other mystical notions we can observe and later , we may draw some conclusions those conclusions would follow our observations the problem is the need to absorb current observations within some kind of pre established theory in order to make sense out of it some of the past trauma makes no sense in the ordinary scheme of things there are no words nor scenes to put to it i saw birth reliving for months and told my patients this was absolute nonsense because a local university neurologic department said that it was not possible but they continued on and i had to reorient my thinking not only is it possible but we have seen it now with hundreds of patients from many countries of the world including those individuals who never read about it in my books it is a measureable event and we have researched it at the ucla pulmonary laboratory as well in several brainwave studies thomas kuhn wrote that in the evolution of science there are periodic shifts or jumps that represent major changes in the direction of a particular scientific discipline he labeled these jumps paradigm shifts in our view , primal therapy and primal theory represent a major paradigm shift in the science of psychology and in the course of this new perspective i want to demonstrate how a brain system designed to allow us to function under stress is in fact at the root of our mental problems it is the story of the evolution of the brain and feelings and evolution cannot be ignored in the therapy of human beings let s take the case of deep depression there are now modern techniques to ameliorate it from tranquilizers and pain killers to drilling holes in the brain and probing deep down the reason that we have had to used drugs and surgery is because there is no therapy extant that can go deep enough to affect the areas specifically involved in processing emotional pain we can and we do it is why we can use the word cure
