back in the dark ages when i applied to medical school , all applicants were required to take the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory or mmpi this is a personality test designed to identify psychopathology by examining the answers to literally hundreds of questions , many of them innocuous sounding or not clearly related to any pathological answers for example , one question that stood out in my mind was i like to paint flowers now , i happen to like flowers and paintings of flowers but never in my life have i ever even tried to paint flowers you 're supposed to answer true or false to this question keep in mind that the answer to this question was going to have some bearing on whether or not i got accepted to medical school ok , you make your best guess on the right non pathological answer , whatever that 's supposed to be , and then you run into this question i always tell the truth oy talk about your wife beating question in other words , sir , when did you stop beating your wife ? if you answer yes then you 're obviously lying because everyone fibs now and then if you answer false then you look like a dishonest person who could n't be trusted to hold a friend 's purse much less a scalpel so anyway , that brings up the issue of truth telling in psychiatric treatment no patient ever tells the truth not the whole truth , not at first , and not in the way they want you to hear it it 's not a matter of intentional dishonesty or deception and it 's not a character flaw , it 's just being human i 've had friends not my co bloggers who have told me , oh , only your patients lie well , as dinah puts it , in my little bubble world it would be nice to believe that the only misleading people were the ones inside the prison walls there are many reasons not to tell the whole truth , or to tell it in a way that puts the best light on things self deception or therapist psychiatrist deception is a way to look your best to help the therapeutic relationship form it 's a defense mechanism for people who are feeling self conscious about their problems or embarrassed about their background or humiliated by their real or self perceived failures in extreme cases , it 's a way of protecting oneself from negative consequences eg if i tell my doctor i'm suicidal , i 'll get 'put away' for my patients inside the walls , it 's the way they 've found to cope with life and get their needs met because they learned early on that simple requests for help often did n't work the gradual unfolding of truth , the step by step admission of distortions , is part of the treatment process it 's a positive sign that trust is growing between patient and doctor in psychiatric treatment , at least in my clinic , you do n't get punished for admitting you lied so now in all honesty , i 'll admit that i 'd love to paint flowers wow , this is a first in the history of the blog i 've posted over myself !
