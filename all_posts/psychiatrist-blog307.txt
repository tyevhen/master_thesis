we all think stigma with mental illness is a bad thing because mental disorders are stigmatized , people hide their psychic distress and do n't get help , or they live in denial about their problems when the fact that they are mentally ill is obvious to others people live in pain , or they simply do n't live up to their potential stigma is only part of the problem , of course there is also the issue of access to care , access to good care , cost of care , dislike of the care that exists mean psychiatrists , side effects from medications , lousy food or uncomfortable beds on inpatient units , and the fact that sometimes people lack the insight to be aware that they have a problem insurance companies , i believe , add to stigma , not because they want to stigmatize patients , but because this is a vulnerable group of people where they can avoid shelling out money inadvertently , however , policies that exclude mental disorders or reimburse them differently , increase stigma whatever the intent , the result is the same some people like to compare mental illnesses to diabetes or hypertension it 's chronic , it 's biological we believe , it 's an illness to treat like any other illness it 's a lousy metaphor for a number of reasons we do n't know the biology behind the disorders , and psychiatric disorders are not predictably chronic okay , actually , some people can get rid of their hypertension with weight loss , and then the disorders do n't actually exist , but somehow once you 're labeled with diabetes , it sticks diet controlled , even if you 're not on a medicine , even if your blood sugar is normal but aside from issues of insurance parity and certainty about the biological causes of psychiatric disorders , there is a reason i think that untreated or unresponsive mental disorders will always have stigma in the world of reduce stigma , this is going to be the totally politically incorrect thing to say psychiatric disorders come with stigma because people in the throes of certain psychiatric illnesses sometimes behave in distasteful , frightening , unusual , and disturbing ways i think we 've done a lot to decrease the stigma of depression and anxiety , and it 's been immensely helpful that famous , brilliant , successful , beautiful , rich people have talked openly about their struggles with these disorders and while i think we 've made progress identifying other disorders as problems disorders illnesses and not the 'fault' of the person , if a psychiatric problem makes it such that a person refuses to bathe , or becomes loud , irritable , and irrational in the work place , then no amount of reduce stigma campaigning will make it so that people will want to be next to someone who smells bad or whose behavior is erratic i , too , want to see stigma reduced but if someone is running down the street naked screaming about aliens , they have a bigger challenge to face than the person who quietly sits in the doctor 's office and learns their blood pressure numbers are over a certain level the answer ? better treatments , of course and more success stories from those with major mental illnesses i remain hopeful
