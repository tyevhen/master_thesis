i need your help this year at the american psychiatric association 's annual meeting in toronto , i will be talking on what adds 'value' to mental health care from the patient perspective it 's a symposium , and the other speakers will be approaching the issue from the perspective of the insurance company , the hospital , employers , and looking at things like quantifiable measurements of success measured with standardized tools and how to recognize waste in the systems i wo n't be talking about standardized tools so i need input if you 're a health professional and you 've never seen a psychiatrist as a patient , please do n't answer i want to hear what people see as 'value in mental health care' straight from a patient 's perspective some possible questions include those below , but please feel free to tell me what you value about your mental health care i 'd like to hear what experiences and outcomes make you feel like you 've gotten your money 's worth ? why do you go to treatment ? what are you looking to get from it ? do you have specific goals that you 'd like to see measured by objective criteria ? have you ever seen a psychiatrist for treatment , gotten better from your disorder , and yet not valued the care ? why ? do you like that insurers and providers are looking at what makes for good value , meaning the best outcomes for the lowest cost ? in short what makes for a good experience with a psychiatrist ? you can also tell me what makes for a bad experience while i 've got you here , do you value having your psychiatric chart in an electronic medical record ? if you do n't want to comment here , please feel free to email me at shrinkrapblog at gmail dot com
