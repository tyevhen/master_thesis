it was a long night here at the etta house my friend , wendy , went home late in the evening , but she ended up coming back to spend the night i was having a hard time settling things are very dark right now i do n't like writing about feeling dark i certainly do n't like feeling dark at this moment , depression has me tightly in its grimy grip , and i'm not sure what else i can do to release its grasp it looks like running the twin cities marathon will not be possible i do n't even have the energy to go pick up my number at the expo , which is a one hour drive from here it 's probably better that i do n't run , as running a marathon can impact my mood , and at this point i'm betting the impact would be negative still , i'm sad and frustrated to give up such a beloved race it 's yet another example of depression 's master thievery i'm feeling pretty rough it 's been quite awhile since my illness has taken such a stranglehold i'm still fighting , but right now i feel like i'm losing more ground than i'm gaining that 's frustrating if you 're open to prayer , a few thrown my direction would be welcome anytime
