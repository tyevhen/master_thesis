sam rasnake tagged me to list five poetry collections off the beaten path that ought to be read , in my opinion unfortunately , i only take time to read established poets , eschewing current minor ones , unless i have a book review to do , as in the most recent book by leonard gontarek , a little known poet from philadelphia , deja vu diner i can mention some poets i think presently neglected richard wilbur , philip larkin , howard moss and randall jarrell sp suspect on two of these many of their lesser contemporaries get more attention , imho today i went birding with my brother in law , richard , who 's visiting from ny in exchange i bored him with native botany , at which i am becoming more proficient he saw a pair of bushtits , which he had only seen once before on the east coast , whereupon i said make up your mind did you see bush or tits ? apparently it was both , but that , in my experience , requires a wide angle lens cheap puns keep me going i was able to show richard the bush monkey flower , the bull thistle and the scotch broom , so i got my own freudian revenge on his brag through the plant world i , too , am sad that kurt vonnegut died he meant much to me and my middle daughter nice to chain smoke and survive until longevity has much more to do with attitude , i think , than health habits , judging from my patients and anecdotal evidence lies , damned lies , and statistics richard woke me at am this morning , apparently not knowing that most poets are not morning people , also interrupting my dream of a gourmet dinner where kathleen had just passed me a taste of her fish to accompany my exotic soup but richard woke me before i could taste either last night a friend gave me liver tea and i became very tired and kathleen said my breath smelled of ketones i'm wondering now whether that strange potion began a detox in me , given that i drink , i like to drink , and i likely drink more than i should see vonnegut , above in mendocino you never know what eye of newt and wing of bat the warlocks may be grinding into your tea i 'll have to ask my friend what the hell that was the tea even tasted like liver while richard was birding on our walk today i spent a long time staring into a stagnant pool covered with pond scum or glisteningly beautiful green algae , if you prefer watching pollywogs cavort some had grown hind legs already , assuming a square morphology near frog like others were still tiny and looked like motile black sperm i also saw a small brown spider skittering over the drier algae and a strange fly pursuing it there were short legged water striders as well with the birding the binoculars richard lent me it was amazing what i could see in the pond , though i'm sure stagnant pond gazing must be considered slumming by birders , especially since birding is the new yuppie craze out here ah , all this trivia in so short a missive i'm almost halfway through madam bovary , and flaubert is a poet unfortunately , he is not the best author of character , as madame bovary , so far , has developed little , and there are many stock characters the best develped so far is the druggist , monsieur ome' i think flaubert 's prose presages proust which reminds me of that great movie i highly recommend , little miss sunshine my back hurts too much to continue writing , even leaning far back with the laptop on my lap anon 's comment from yesterday was sure an ego boost thanks for that thine in pond slime , ce
