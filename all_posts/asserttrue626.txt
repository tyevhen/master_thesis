they say good things come to those who wait well , a lot of us have waited a long time ten years , roughly for internet explorer to support svg , and some of us did n't think it would ever happen some of us have been proven wrong , however it now develops that microsoft has decided to provided support for the wc s scalable vector graphics svg second edition specification in the internet explorer platform preview after years of resisting svg in favor of vml which never took off , microsoft now says we value web developers as our customers and anticipate interoperable svg becoming a powerful tool that can be written easily across different web browsers moreover the use of the more interoperable svg over vml is highly encouraged the following svg features are currently supported in the ie platform preview at least partially methods of embedding inline html , inline xhtml , object , full svg documents structure svg , defs , use , g , image shapes circle , ellipse , rect , line , polyline , polygon , path text filling , stroking , css color doml core and svgdom events presentation attributes and css styling transforms translate , skewx , skewy , scale , rotate not yet supported , but soon to be methods of embedding embed , iframe , img , css image , svgz gradients and patterns clipping , masking , and compositing cursor , marker remainder of text , transforms , events i , for one , am glad to see microsoft support svg natively in ie even if this version of ie is n't supported on winxp one wonders what adobe 's reaction is adobe , you may recall , spearheaded the development of svg and tried for a while to jumpstart acceptance of the standard by trojaning an svg browser plug in into every adobe product install eventually , firefox and the other browsers began adding native support but microsoft withheld svg support from ie , and the standard never really caught on , as far as web graphics are concerned will it catch on now ? hard to say ie does n't run on xp or other older versions of windows , and it 'll take years for people to convert en masse to ie from ie and ie witness the slow death of ie as cameron laird recently said , if conventional 'universal coverage' is a requirement , this winter 's announcements can only truly impact decisions several years from now but hey , better late than never , i say
