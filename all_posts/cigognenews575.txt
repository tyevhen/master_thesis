a coward dies a thousand deaths , but the valiant taste death but once act scene line of julius cesear , by william shakespeare this was sent to me by a patient throughout my life , in every major endeavor , i have given my all in the struggle for success each time i would work long hours filled with enthusiasm , damn the sleepless nights , damn the overwork , damn every obstacle , whether it was my restaurant , my advertising agency or whatever all along the way and with each i would progress to what i perceived as the pinnacle of success and then , almost like magic , it would all collapse and turn to shit i would be left broken , awash in pain , feeling helpless and worthless , and thinking of suicide oft times it would take years for me to recover enough to begin anew on to the next big project , culminating with the same results over and over i was dying my own thousand deaths finally , in my late s , at the end of my last great failure , i became extremely ill and convinced my life was over , i was welcoming the opportunity for death but in some weird fortune landed me in primal therapy i had no trouble getting to my feelings i was what they call a m lange all my feelings , at all three levels , were coming up at once on the surface it was an ugly business with all that pain , but at the end of each session , i would be more relaxed and feel better than at any time i can remember early on in my therapy i began descending into birth feelings now i was quite skeptical of the whole notion of birth primals i could not wrap my mind around the idea of having a clear memory without pictures in my head nonetheless , here i was i was in the middle of a devastating toddler feeling at that time in my life i suffered severe eczema my parents would put socks on my hands and tie them to the bars in my crib , so i could not scratch myself bloody , then leave me there alone to cry myself to sleep the itch , the helpless feeling of being so restrained , and the abandonment by my mother was hideous but then the feeling took a new turn it slowly became all physical i started to cough the itch and restraint became the pain of being crushed i felt smothered then as though there was some camshaft like machine inside me , my body went into a writhing , waving dolphin motion my head pushed against the padded wall in the therapy room time lost meaning it was just forever the feeling of suffocation was like sharp needles from deep inside my chest jabbing out through every pour of my whole body this next is a little difficult for me to explain because during the feeling there were no words the words came after , when i was integrating the feelings and connections with the help of my therapist i pushed and strained and pushed and strained as the feelings became more intense i felt like i was doing something wrong there is something the matter with me it s too much i was dying the terror and panic accelerated until i got to a point when i thought i had made it through , and was finally going to be free but too late i was spent i gave up to die my whole body gave up the ghost and collapsed then my body went into wave after wave of the most radical trembling i could ever imagine this sequence repeated itself i didn t seem to be in the driver s seat again and again until my body just quit the feeling slowly dissipated and left me drained , but so relaxed it was as good as feeling gets no fear , no panic , terror , or tension life felt good then in discussing with my therapist what i was going through , i made the connection that what i had just experienced is the pattern of my life struggle , fight , suffer , and plough forward to success and then collapse give up the ghost to death i was amazed at the clarity , and simple obviousness of the connections so , you say , that s all nice , but what does that get you ? the short of it , in janov s language , is that when those feelings come up at times when they are re stimulated , the valance will be reduced here i should add that this primal was not a one shot deal after some years i am still having to relive that scene or related scenes this is because i can only tolerate such excruciating pain for from to seconds at a shot , and my birth was besought with all this agony over a course of at least hours that s a lot of pain to feel in order to free myself of it in addition when those feelings come up , i know what they really are , and i can separate those historical feelings from my present life but let me elaborate to give you a more concrete context after about a year and a half of reliving those birth scenes repeatedly , i realized that i was not close to death , and had a brand new life to live i decided to go to graduate school and get my ms in marriage and family therapy applying and getting accepted is no easy chore , especially for an old man csusb gets a lot of applications but they only accept students a year from the git go all those old birth feelings come up i feel weak and helpless and i m convinced my efforts will be for naught i tell my therapist , what s the use even if i got accepted , which i probably won t , i ll be when i graduate and he said , yes , and you will be even if you don t every time i would think about all i had to do just to apply made my arms feel weak , and found myself thinking , what s the use ? i had to get really great references , and it had been so long since i was in college , most of my old professors were already dead i had to write a letter of intent , which meant the best pitch letter i ve ever written in my life but i could do all that because i have felt my pain in its proper context i knew the enemy , and had sufficiently weakened it by reliving it to where it no longer had complete control over what i did i didn t have to fail i got accepted and quickly found out that the battle was just begun i started the program on my th birthday , and found myself face to face with beautiful women , all brilliant scholars , with young facile minds and energy that far eclipsed mine this is where i really began to understand the connections i had made in my sessions i continually feared that i would struggle , do well , and just at the point of graduation , or sometime before , i would fall on my face i felt like it was all over at the end of every quarter that old feeling would start to overwhelm me , but this time around , i could just lay down and let myself have the feeling , or i could hold off until my next session , and grapple with it again this time success was mine i not only graduated , i managed to get the best possible placement with an organization filled with great people but i m not through yet i ll have more opportunities to give up and collapse in agony i ll also have to feel those feelings so ruinous in my past , and make them work for me as i continue to live my life with all the fullness i can muster and , of course , i never fail to be amazed with every primal and the personal growth that comes with it by frank robinette
