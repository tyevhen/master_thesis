the first descriptions of anorexia nervosa in the western world date from the th and th centuries , most famously saint catherine of siena , who denied herself food as part of a spiritual denial of self by the sixteenth century , ascetics were considered witches and burned at the stake there are several other clinical descriptions of wasting disease in the th th century , and in the early th century , anorexia was considered an endocrine disorder and treated with pituitary hormones in , hilde bruch published a book with a number of case studies , called eating disorders obesity , anorexia nervosa , and the person within as the disorder reached public awareness in the s , cases increased , spreading beyond the upper class bulimia binging and then purging via exercise , vomiting , or laxatives is first reliably described among some of the wealthy in the middle ages , who would vomit during meals so they could consume more apparently this behavior did not happen in ancient rome despite a common conception otherwise the first clinical paper on bulimia came in bulimia nervosa , an ominous variant of anorexia nervosa everyone agrees that the cases of anorexia and bulimia escalated in the s and s , and though some will say they peaked in that time , the national survey data suggests that bulimia , especially , continues to escalate while most scholars will point to cultural pressures for thinness , increasing depression and obsessive compulsive behavior , and increased dieting behaviors as precipitants for eating disorders , it is impossible to ignore the fact that the s and s is when the rates of obesity in the united states began to increase at an unprecedented rate , and low fat eating began its popular progression through the mainstream there is a third eating disorder , binge eating disorder , where periodic food binges are not compensated by restricting or purging behavior while many obese people eat normally , binge eaters will consume up to tens of thousands of calories in a singe day , entire bags of candy , or dinner from five or six fast food restaurants , one after the other again this disorder has been described for centuries , but seems to have escalated only recently all eating disorders remain relatively rare anorexia afflicts about of women and of men bulimia around of women also of men , and binge eating disorder of women and of men anorexia nervosa remains the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders , with a death rate within years of developing the symptoms , and an death rate within years anorexia is endemic in the fashion industry , to the point where models are now being airbrushed to add curves eating disorders in adolescents are strongly predicted by the earlier presence of depression , bipolar disorder , and anxiety the eating disorders also appear to be genetic , perhaps related to inherited differences in serotonin receptors with the growing prevalence , genetic susceptibility , and correlation with increases in obesity and consumption of industrialized food not to mention the zinc connection , i ca n't help but wonder if the eating disorders are yet one more disease of western civilization , most strongly predicated by our poor diets i 'll keep an eye out on the literature , of course , though much of the natural progression of anorexia can be explained by disordered thinking about body image combined with the process of starvation itself given the speculation that a combination of massive quantities of fructose , wheat , and omega fatty acids lead to inflammation , leptin and insulin resistance , and obesity , disordered thinking and restrictive or purging behaviors may be the only ways to remain skinny on a standard diet the cost is high , and borne primarily by our young women i 've found that a personalized approach , based on treating underlying depression , anxiety , nutritional deficiencies , and teaching that our bodies deserve to be nourished with proper , whole foods can be surprisingly effective do eating disorders exist in a population where there is no obesity ? i do n't know i imagine they are vanishingly rare
