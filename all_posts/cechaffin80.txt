the lakers have won it all and my anxiety is slaked how nervous and pessimistic i become as i watch ! even a point lead in the th quarter was n't enough for me i could only think of how we might blow it , and victory was more a relief for me than a celebration call me a nervous fan i lived through last year 's sixth game blowout just as the lakers did , and we came to the same conclusion toughen up and toughen up we did we played hard in the post , making dwight howard ineffective just as importantly , we shot better tonight than they did from three point range ariza was wonderful , as were kobe , lamar and fisher we had the grit we had the determination and it feels almost as if kobe willed us this championship he was hungry , he let everyone know it , especially his teammates and they took their cue from him who 's better , kobe or lebron ? i 'd have to say lebron but kobe has a superior supporting cast , it 's clear there 's talk of shaq going to cleveland , but they need youth what with robotic ilgauskus and washed up ben wallace and ca n't shoot varajao all lebron has is mo williams and change he needs a real post player like garnett or gasol to excel in team basketball and may i say , regarding garnett , that if he and leon powe were healthy for the celtics they would have represented the east , and the series would have likely gone seven because of injuries the two best teams did not meet in the finals good to see kobe with his first mvp award as well , and for phil to get that number ten over red auerbach , longtime nemesis of the lakers so what will we do now ? my wife and i exclaim basketball takes up a big portion of our psychic life in its season , and now perhaps we 'll be freed to work in the garden and socialize a little more like i said , it 's a relief at kiloneutral , ce
