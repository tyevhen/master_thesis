symptoms , symptoms , symptoms this is recovery language for all of those head pressures , electrifying zaps , heavy breathing spells , tightness , and other feelings and sensations that can make living with anxiety so miserable one of my most disturbing sensations is blurry vision when i become anxious it becomes difficult to focus or read or at least that is what i have told myself i have had this problem for about years , during which i ve worked this up into a vicious cycle in fact , i thought i was the only person who suffered with this symptom until i came to recovery , in which i met people who have this symptom as well as read about them in dr low s works harriette was tortured by headaches and nausea and fatigue and dizzy spells , by weak spells and palpitations her ears ached and her eyes blurred and her throat choked emphasis added i have been in recovery since last may reading dr low s works and attending meetings and i still do have blurry vision however , i now know that when i m having this sensation , i can control my thoughts i do not need to react to this i can remind myself that yes , this sensation is distressing , but it is not dangerous while i may feel that anything i do while i have this sensation will turn out wrong , that is not a fact one of my relatives likes to remind me that i always will perform in a reasonable way if i make a mistake , it s no big deal mistakes are average and happen to everyone , whether they have a bout of blurry vision or not hopefully some day i won t deal with this sensation anymore but in the meantime i now have the tools to cope with and ultimately conquer this problem reference low aa mental health through will training glencoe , ill willett publishing co
