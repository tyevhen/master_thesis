i'm feeling kind of sad today i do n't know why nothing special happened in fact , i even got to see my therapist , as she had a cancellation which allowed me time i otherwise would n't have had until next week yet , i do n't think i even mentioned feeling sad to her i do n't think i talked about much of anything it 's like my brain went blank once i sat down in her office stupid or weird , i'm not sure which there 's still a lot going on in my life i'm having some financial stress , which i hate i'm filling out applications , interviewing , and trying to figure out how much i will be able to work if offered a position as i wrote last week , i do n't want to take on too much , as just having a regularly scheduled job will be a big , big change i do n't want to fail i do n't want the depression symptoms to worsen it 's scary my parents left today they are full time rv'ers heading south for the winter i guess that could explain some of the sadness my mom and i have had a strained relationship since she left when i was twelve in fact , i had n't lived within an hour of my mom since she left in the 's ! that is until she and my step dad moved into an rv park a couple miles away in early september fortunately , the combo of depression and alcoholism forced me to mature in the last few years it was actually nice to have her so close , although i think i 've probably gained pounds from eating out and , well , just eating i do n't really cook meals she does you know , like a salad , a meat , a potato , and a veggie ? that 's an extremely rare occurrence when i'm taking care of myself ! i 'll miss them i'm trying to deal with not being able to run by swimming , lifting , biking , etc , each of which involves going to the gym going to the gym requires planning running does n't require much planning in a moment , i could throw on my shoes and skip out the door it seems going to the gym is a two hour event no matter what i do i'm happy with my swimming swam another mile today however , my leg does n't seem to be improving today , i had pain picking up the pace to cross the street that was n't a hopeful sign i'm worried about losing my fitness i'm worried about gaining weight even without my mom cooking i need to strengthen my hip i'm worried i wo n't be willing or able to strengthen it enough i need to rest my leg i'm worried it wo n't be healed even after resting it and i just want to run ! no worries just run ! perhaps i would n't be feeling restless and sad if i could run into the night right now that 's the other thing swimming , lifting , and biking ca n't do for me , combat that restlessness i can only combat those feelings , it seems , by hitting the streets speaking of hitting the streets , i 've done a poor job keeping up with walking puck the days have been gray and cold i 've walked him a few times , and he is getting better , but i feel like a bad mom when i do n't walk him i'm trying to make up for it by playing tug and ball with him in the house , but i really need to be more diligent with the walks poor guy , he must be soooo bored ! sorry , buddy ! i 'll do better i'm feeling a little sad today i'm feeling a little restless , too a bit overwhelmed as well my thinking is also slightly , 'er moderately off not good
