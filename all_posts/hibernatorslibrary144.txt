the first christmas what the gospels really teach about jesus' birth by marcus j borg and john dominic crossan narrated by john pruden in this fascinating little book , borg and crossan explore the historical meaning behind the birth of jesus story they first point out the factual differences between matthew 's and luke 's versions of the birth story then they explain how , after the enlightenment , many people want everything to be either literally true or false many christians are in denial of the factual inconsistencies in the bible , and the ones who are aware of the inconsistencies often feel a little uncomfortable and do n't know quite what to think about them borg and crossan point out that the stories are meant to be parables they were not meant to be taken as literal truth they explore a deeper truth within the limits of historical culture borg and crossan study practically line by line at times each birth story separately , explaining the cultural , literary , or mythological meaning of the biblical text for instance , in his story of the magi and herod , matthew was bringing to mind parallels to the moses story in his gospel like pharaoh , herod wanted to kill all the baby boys because he 'd heard that one was born who would overthrow him as with the parents of moses , jesus' parents had divine inspiration to have a child despite great obstacles in the case of moses' parents , they had to have faith that their son would n't die in the case of joseph , he had to have faith that mary was yet a virgin against all odds , both boys survived and became great leaders such parallels to the moses story would help justify to first century christians the divinely inspired leadership of jesus i really enjoyed learning about the cultural reasons for the choices matthew and luke made while writing their gospels at times , i felt the book did n't translate well to audio , though , because the authors went into great detail in their lists of gospel references for instance , every reference of to jesus as light , and what the word light meant in that sense the lists did n't translate well to audio since they were something i would normally either skim over or use as a bible study guide neither could be done in an audiobook regardless , i'm glad i had the chance to listen to this book , and i hope to read their first book the last week i 'll save that one for easter , though
