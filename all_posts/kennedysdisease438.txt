for all the negativity applied to having kennedy s disease , occasionally research comes along reflecting something positive msn s health published the following report on april huntington 's disease linked to reduced cancer risk in study findings suggest shared genetic mechanism , researchers say mary elizabeth dallas wednesday , april healthday news people who have huntington 's disease are much less likely to develop cancer than people without the inherited disorder , according to a new study that suggests the diseases share a common genetic mechanism the swedish researchers found that those with huntington 's had a percent lower risk of being diagnosed with cancer compared to the general population besides huntington 's disease , the lower cancer risk applies to the other eight rare neurodegenerative disorders known as polyglutamine polyq diseases those diseases , which result in the progressive degeneration of neurons involved in motor control , include spinobulbar muscular atrophy also known as kennedy 's disease dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy and six types of spinocerebellar ataxia from through , the researchers identified , patients with huntington 's disease people with spinobulbar muscular atrophy and , with hereditary ataxia , a substitute for spinocerebellar ataxia cancer was diagnosed in percent of the huntington 's patients , percent of the spinobulbar muscular atrophy patients and percent with hereditary ataxia the study , published online april in the lancet oncology , determined those with spinobulbar muscular atrophy had a percent lower risk of cancer , and patients with hereditary ataxia had a percent lower risk before being diagnosed with a polyq disease , the patient 's risk of cancer was even lower , the researchers said our findings suggest a common mechanism in patients with polyq diseases that protects against the development of cancer , dr jianguang ji and colleagues from lund university and skane university hospital , in sweden , wrote in a journal news release future studies should investigate the specific biological mechanisms underlying the reduced cancer risk in patients with polyq diseases , they concluded
