there 's an easy way to get from decimal to hexadecimal in javascript function tohex n return n tostring the string you get back may not look the way you want , though for example , tohex gives , when you 're probably wanting x or x what you need is front padding just the right amount of front padding add just the right number of 'ch' characters to the front of string to give a new string of the desired final length 'dfl' function frontpad string , ch , dfl var array new array dfl string length return array join ch string of course , you should ensure that 'dfl' is not smaller than string length , to prevent a rangeerror when allocating the array if you 're wondering why dfl instead of plain dfl , stop now to meditate or run the code until enlightenment occurs at this point you can do function tohex n return x frontpad n tostring , , tohex gives x if you later need to use this value as a number , no problem you can apply any numeric operation except addition on it with perfect safety addition will be treated as string concatenation whenever any operand is a string that 's the standard js intepreter behavior , so if you need to do x , you have to cast the hex string to a number n tohex x typeof n string isnan n false x n n x n x x number n
