we keep busy and doing things to keep from feeling there is nothing i can do we keep having new projects to give us hope to keep from feeling there is no hope we keep controlling things to keep from feeling i am helpless we keep making phone calls to keep from feeling i am all alone now why would we do that ? because the feeling i am all alone isn t just something from yesterday or today it is the primal aloneness in the first minutes or weeks of life when mother , who was sick at childbirth , abandoned her baby it became a life and death matter it is a devastating aloneness that can be triggered off in the present whenever we are left alone for a time we are acting out against the pain , so that the act out is unconscious we do not know what drives us and we usually don t even know that we are driven it is all automatic we keep from sitting still by much travel all to keep from feeling confined at birth , stuck in the canal , then later stuck in a tense and depressed household which was again suffocating so we drag along our past but never know it is there weighing us down one reason we know the pain is there is by the act out , obsessive , continuous behavior that seems irrational we are acting out the feeling pain , trying to get over the feeling but never knowing what it is or how to get rid of it check your act out and you will get a good idea of what your pain is now the tough part feeling it if the lack of act out makes you anxious , you cannot sit home today , then you know you are usually dealing with a very early first line feeling that is , if for any reason you cannot act out , say you re are sick and cannot keep busy , the anxiety will be your companion the act out has a purpose , a relief valve from importuning feelings it lowers tension levels and allows us to function better the most universal act out seems to be keeping busy , never a minute to think or feeling , just keep going , usually to feel there is no where to go and nothing to do when we cannot act out we most often act in we suffer from cramps or high blood pressure or worse , epileptic attacks i treated a woman who needed constant sex , to keep from feeling having never been touched by her parents early on when she could not act out her blood pressure rose dramatically the pain has to go somewhere , so let us not moralize about it no one is obsessively sexual without that pain not even tiger woods so what is it we must do ! no we now what our deprivation was early on if you need the windows wide open or else you get anxious you know you lacked oxygen if you cannot be enclosed , say in a locked car for any time , you may well have been an incubator baby so the act out is usually what we call neurosis it is not the behavior that is neurotic it is logic in the extreme it is our feelings that have been deviated and not normal when we feel our pain we then normalize along most parameters from blood flow to sperm count , to the speed at which sperm move , to how fast our heart beats so we see why it is so useless to do behavior therapy , treating the logical extension of pain instead of the pain itself underlying the behavior if someone is awkward and often pushes us and we fall we know to avoid that person but if we do not know what is pushing us we may tend to focus on the fall instead of the push , missing the point entirely behavior therapy is extremely superficial and deals only with what anyone can see instead of focusing on what is not obvious and cannot be seen it doesn t take a shrink to figure out behavior therapy it takes a real shrink to go deeper and that will only happen when someone has reached into her feelings and has complete access to herself then she won t misfocus then she will understand what drives her and therefore what drives others she understands the push of feelings no more mystery
