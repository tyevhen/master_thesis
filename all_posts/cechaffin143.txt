i should be doing my honey do list but could not resist blogging something in lieu of my failure to send christmas cards below i 'll try to attach pictures of everyone in our family , including the pets to all my readers a merry christmas i do n't like the generic happy holidays any more than i like the tyranny of tolerance to which our culture has been subjected i say merry christmas because i'm an unabashed christian if i were a pagan i would likely say , happy saturnalia it is a diverse holiday but diversity is best served by individual commitment as i often advise , it is better to pursue one path or religion assiduously than sample them all like chocolates the spiritual discipline of every path does or should lead to the love of god all else is dross regarding peace on earth , our cats and new dog are finally co existing in a semblance of harmony he rarely barks at them and some nights both he and a cat sleep in our california king but when the cats are roaming outside , he still thinks them fair game for a good treeing i'm grateful for so much this year kathleen , my children all doing well , this beautiful place i live in , friends , enough to eat , shelter , and of course the miracle of the incarnation that ennobles man more than anything to the peta people notice he did n't come as a bunny ! i used to dislike christmas , but over the years my heart has healed from the bleak ones i 've known , particularly those endured during a depression each ornament , each hug , each gift speaks of a generosity within in us that i wish we could access all year long then there might be peace on earth and i think of all our troops in places far away i even have a good friend serving in afghanistan as a psychiatrist may they come home soon may obama keep his pledge to withdraw from iraq in mos , and may he reconsider expanding the mess in afghanistan i'm also naturally grateful to my publisher , kelly , who sought me out to publish my first volume of poetry in over ten years poetry is a great joy to me , especially as a reader there 's no better brain candy i think stockings should be stuffed with poems , although the children would no doubt complain if ifs and buts were candy and nuts then every day would be christmas dutch proverb here 's a poem by emily the savior must have been a docile gentleman to come so far so cold a day for little fellowmen the road to bethlehem since he and i were boys was leveled , but for that 'twould be a rugged billion miles to all you who read me but whom i 've never met , i hope my ramblings , especially about my difficulties with manic depression , have somewhat extended your compassion and understanding for a disease that affects one in a hundred worldwide and i'm grateful for all those who read my literary musings and poems it is a strange thing , this anonymous connection through the ether i would name all the countries from which people come here , but it would take to long for now hello to iran , kuwait and the ukraine have a blessed christmas ! ce
