today , the amazing victoria sent me a paper that is way too great to pass up depression and altered serum lipids in cynomolgus monkeys consuming a western diet i know , it 's monkeys , not humans but these researchers actually took the connection between diet , cardiovascular disease , and depression seriously , and found a reasonable animal model that covered everything more or less they are lipophobes , but with a spoonful of sugar , they did eventually discover that the omega fatty acids go down in the most alarming way and could n't find a way to directly blame the sat fat but that 's the punch line let 's throw out a few facts and then get to the set up first off your brain is fat , and , even more importantly , the important neuronal plasma membranes are of the fish derived and you are dreaming if you think you can get enough from flax omega dha yeah that much arachidonic acid aa , derived from the pro inflammatory omega fatty acids , is the other major pufa in the brain dha is widely distributed throughout the brain , aa is found primarily in the white matter the gray matter is where a lot of the actual neuronal communication takes place white matter is more like wiring one of the main differences between traditional and ancestral diets and our western diet is the vast excess of omega pufas , primarily in the form of doritos and hidden valley ranch and hellmans real ahem mayonnaise , i mean stuff fried in and composed primarily of vegetable seed oils such as corn or safflower or soybean oil i 'll quote the article here several studies suggest that patients with clinical depression have either an elevated ratio of circulating long chain pufas , or just low circulating long chain pufas there is a fold variation across countries in annual sh consumption and a strong inverse relationship between national per capita sh consumption and the prevalence of depression early clinical trials suggest that dietary sh oils reduce signs and symptoms of depression in some , but not all patient populations and just to reinforce the fact that these monkeys are rather reasonable models of human like depression these female monkeys respond to stress via depressive behaviors certain depressed postures , decreased movement which is accompanied by changes in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in a similar way to humans experiencing depression they also show decreased hippocampal volumes , ovarian function changes , serotonergic system changes , and changes in serum cholesterol similar to humans with depression depressed female cynomolgus monkeys also develop four times the coronary atherosclerosis as their non depressed counterparts so , the actual experiment monkeys were placed on an atherogenic western diet i'm sure they meant the crystalline cholesterol butter , beef tallow , and lard i'm a bit suspicious of the sucrose and the safflower oil , myself and was there any choline ? diet composition was the following casein lactalbumin dextrin sucrose alphacel this is non nutrative bulk otherwise known as fiber lard beef tallow butter , lightly salted guessing this was not kerrygold saf ower oil linoleic crystalline cholesterol yum ! complete vitamin mix mineral mix calcium carbonate calcium phosphate diet composition of calories carbohydrate , fat , and protein with mg cal cholesterol i'm not sure what sort of western diet this is supposed to mimic it looks a lot like milky sugar in animal fat and vegetable oil sprinkled with cholesterol to me where are the grains ? but that 's okay , i suppose adding the grains might add an extra variable that we would have to parse out , and now we do n't have to when you get to the actual fat content , it was about saturated , monounsaturated , and pufa but the pufa omega ratio was a whopping , and to add insult to injury , there was dha or epa so what happened ? the monkeys were put on this diet for a total of about two years and observed for signs of depression , and several body and serum measurements were taken interesting and significant developments a whopping of the monkeys developed depressive behavior the depressed monkeys tended to eat less and have a lower bmi this is actually typical for a classic depression and more short term severe depressive episodes people tend to gain weight over the long term or in atypical depression the researchers compared fasting lipids of the saddest monkeys compared to the happiest ones measures of depression included the amount of time spent in depressed postures and pretty objective signs of depression they did not have the monkeys fill out the depression scales we tend to use for humans the sad monkeys had higher total cholesterol , but lower hdl i would call this a cholesterol pattern consistent with inflammation the happier monkeys had lower total cholesterol and a higher hdl the researchers also broke down the fatty acid composition of the monkeys' plasma there was no correlation between saturated fats and the amount of depression which does not surprise me or the readers of evolutionary psychiatry , i would hope however , the depressed monkeys had significantly higher circulating omega fatty acid which would also mean that the higher circulating omega fatty acids would match up with those monkeys with higher total cholesterol and lower hdl hmmmmmm than the nondepressed monkeys omega fatty acids were not much different between the two groups possibly because they got so little omega anyway so there you have it there was no control , which is problematic it would be nice to know how much depressive behavior these monkeys have in the wild , and in a similar captive situation but with their indonesian forest diet flown in but i think that if you are a female cynomolgus monkey who is apt to be in a stressful subservient social position , you ought not to eat a diet of omega pufa in a ratio of i'm guessing that a moratorium on soybean oil mayonnaise for the human animals out there might be a good idea too chilton fh , et al , depression and altered serum lipids in cynomolgus monkeys consuming a western diet , physiol behav , doi j physbeh
