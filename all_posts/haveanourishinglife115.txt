in high school , i was a kind , polite , introvert who was everyone and no one s friend i perpetually felt like an outsider and wanted to belong to a group but in reality , i desperately wanted just one friend whom i could spill my guts talk about anything and everything until the wee hours of the morning i was quiet i was compassionate i was a good listener on my forehead , i wore a sign that read tell me all your problems i had no boundaries i internalized everything i heard i was moved with pity for the human race overtime , i had a lot of pent up emotion because i rarely shared my own soul with another person in the th grade , i started running and quickly realized it was a good stress reliever for me during high school , i was a four year member of the cross country team surrounding the sport was a lot of focus on weight and such i was am a perfectionist so in the name of health , i went on a diet i thought that if i lost weight i would be a better runner because i was so rigid with rules , that diet eventually turned into an eating disorder i am not intending to put the blame on one specific thing or say ha that s how it started i believe my eating disorder resulted from a bunch of unfortunate situations put together also , my perfectionist personality , my desire to fit in , and my ignorance of health led me to use food to deal with my problems the thing was no one stopped me don t get me wrong , it s easy to hide an eating disorder but , for me , i think it was easy because no one knew the signs and signals of an eating disorder and i wasn t necessarily quiet about it in the beginning i read everything i could about health and nutrition and shared my knowledge at home like the know it all oldest child i am none of my friends and family thought this was a problem because i was surrounded by a weight loss environment my mom was constantly trying to lose weight we would talk about food and calories on a regular basis once i started severely restricting my food intake , my mom made the comment that maybe we should all eat that way it wasn t just my immediate family my aunt was on a diet and , when i was years old , i remember that she told me i could eat all the chips and salsa that i wanted because it had minimal calories my other aunt was on a never ending atkins diet i saw her eat the weirdest combinations of things because it was good for you and that made it ok my grandma continually commented on weight and appearance my brothers , sisters , and i knew that the first thing our relatives said to one another was either , you look great or did you lose weight ? so from a young age , i picked up on the belief that being thin was important or , at least , losing weight merited attention i picked up on everything little comment , joke , reference , and insinuation about appearance everything the people with the greatest influence on me , however , were the spiritual directors i had going through junior high and high school their intentions were to teach about fasting and sacrifice for me this meant a new measurable way to calculate how perfect i was and as far as food goes , now , not only were there good and bad foods nutritionally , but also sinful foods i not only worried about whether or not a certain meal would make me fat , but i also worried about whether or not it was pleasing to god my motto was , when in doubt , just don t eat anything at all in college , i confirmed my beliefs losing weight was everyone s priority and that the way you looked merited attention i skipped class to work out i tried to see how little i could eat i fasted in the name of sacrifice but secretly knew that it would mean weight loss i became very good at not eating but there was always more weight to lose , fewer calories to eat , and smaller pant sizes after several years of purposely starving myself , my bodily instincts kicked into survival mode and i began eat a little more i did not like this at all i counted calories obsessively if i ate more than calories , i make up for the extra calories by starving myself for however many days that it calculated out to be eventually , the math got complicated and i would be behind or days worth of food it was overwhelming , so i began to make myself throw up , abuse laxatives , or exercise for three to four hours at a time i wrote the calorie numbers on my hand in units one through seven not a day went by where my hand wasn t scribbled on after college , i got my first job at a school in cincinnati my schedule was eat calories for breakfast , teach all morning , calories for lunch , teach all afternoon , work out for three hours at the gym , sit in the sauna for minutes , shower , do my hair , calories for supper , lesson plan for the next day , calorie snack while watching gilmore girls , then cry myself to sleep i only lasted six months at the job however , this routine went on for several years i was so out of energy that the other teachers thought i had a terminal illness like cancer i did have an illness i had an eating disorder and severe depression lucky , the disease didn t take my life i started seeing a counselor and really tried to recovery on my own unfortunately , i was still using food to cope with my difficult emotions because i hadn t yet confronted the baseline issues so i started binge eating i have to say that , during this part of my life , i felt the most ashamed , the most disgusting , and the most unworthy of life at this point , my depression was extremely severe i could not stop counting calories when i would get up into the thousand calorie mark , i wanted to kill myself and thought about ways to do it my moment of grace came when i ran a marathon last fall my reasons for training for the marathon were probably rooted in eating disorder motivations still , god used the opportunity to reach out to me throughout my training processes , i also had been going to a very good counselor and on top of that , i started taking anti depressants so things were coming together slowly during the marathon , about half way through , i realized that i was still counting the calories i was eating that day and then it hit me , i was running a freaking marathon and i was still concerned with how much i was eating ! i was enlightened and , for the first time , realized how unrealistic i was being i laughed and laughed at mile or i was laughing out loud that moment , that wonderful moment of grace , i saw that my obsession with counting calories was controlling my life i thought i was in control i thought that i was the one doing the counting yet , if i was still counting now , during a marathon , then i will never stop nothing will be good enough there was no realistic basis for me to be counting calories twenty six point freaking two miles of running and i was still counting calories ! this was the finale when i crossed that finish line , i thought , i am going to end this obsession once and for all of course , it didn t stop overnight like i wanted it to like any bad habit , it took time , practice , and patience to beat however , i am happy to report that i have not written on my hand for one year i have been binge free for months and i have not counted calories for almost months i could not have recovered on my own i needed hospitalization , counseling , medication , coping skills , and a great support system in case you are a doubter , eating disorder recovery is possible i am living proof if you liked this article , see below to read
