there are remarkable similarities between birth and death elder bruce r mcconkie lds church leader said we know that this great plan of progression called for birth which would provide a mortal tabernacle for our eternal spirits , and for a death which would free those spirits from the frailties , diseases and weaknesses of mortality the words birth and death both describe movement birth describes our movement from the spirit world to mortality death describes our movement from mortality to the spirit world with each movement we terminate our existence in one place and initiate our existence in another when god sends forth a tiny soul to learn the ways of earth , a mother s love is waiting here we call this wonder birth when god calls home a tired soul and stills a fleeting breath , a father s love is waiting there this too is birth not death author unknown
