internet anonymity is it ever justified ? consider meagan s dilemma she is a year old , separated store clerk who is now living in a shelter for battered women meagan was severely abused by her husband , and now takes care to conceal her whereabouts , lest he try to find her using the internet connection at her public library , meagan finds a website that deals with issues of battering , including help for those women or men who want to obtain a restraining order against the abusing spouse meagan would like to participate in the online discussion , but is afraid to use her full name she suspects that her husband tracks websites like this , and that he might retaliate violently if he sees her name she chooses to use a pseudonym and posts a letter on the website is meagan justified in concealing her online identity ? i would not hesitate in saying that she is i would take the same position when someone faces reprisals from a totalitarian regime , such as protesters in iran and egypt or in the case of a whistleblower who wants to expose a public danger online , without risking being fired but absent such compelling dangers to life , limb or livelihood , i am generally opposed to the use of pseudonyms or anonymous postings on the internet of course , there are exceptions beyond those i have noted , and each case must be considered individually but as a rule , i believe that the burden of justification should be on the individual who chooses to conceal his or her identity , and that website monitors ought to be exceedingly selective in accepting unsigned or pseudonymous letters i am speaking , of course , from the perspective of a psychiatric physician who is used to posting my blogs with full disclosure not only of my name , but also of my potential conflicts of interest having retired recently from clinical practice , and having no financial connections to pharmaceutical companies , my only conflicts these days are the ones a psychoanalyst would explore but for those who want to delve , my disclosure statement is viewable on the psychiatric times website , at http www psychiatrictimes com all editorial psychiatrictimes pdfs piesdisclosure pdf the issue of personal disclosure bears on one reason i am opposed to anonymous blogs and postings the general public has no way of determining what , if any , concealed agenda or conflicts of interest the anonymous blogger or commentator may have i find this issue especially pertinent when the unidentified person launches a personal attack against someone who is identified by name , profession , etc as a psychiatrist who blogs fairly often on both the psychcentral and psychiatric times websites , it is especially upsetting when an alleged health care professional posts a highly critical , anonymous comment , in response to an article or essay i have written in my view barring some of the exceptional circumstances i outlined earlier a physician , nurse , psychologist , social worker or other health care professional has no business concealing his or her identity when voicing an opinion on a professionally related topic , especially when taking aim at a colleague i consider such drive by flaming both professionally irresponsible and ethically unjustifiable it is also downright rude and inconsiderate what my dad would have called a cheap shot ! so why do so many health professionals post anonymously , or sign their emails as miffeddoc or irateinternist ? i think that , in many cases , it is a simple wish to avoid embarrassment or discovery , either by patients or by colleagues and , in my view , that excuse simply doesn t cut it my understanding of professional ethics is that you should be willing to stand behind anything you say in a professional context , and that your audience has a right to know who you are and who may be standing behind you the american medical association ? the scientologists ? the government of iraq ? readers digest ? sure , there may be exceptions to this rule i can imagine a health care professional who is revealing an extremely sensitive personal issue let s say , a problem with substance abuse who does not want to disclose his or her name yet he or she believes that the message has important public health implications so , dr x may be posting a message saying , as a physician who has had a problem with alcohol abuse , i would urge all my colleagues to report obvious substance abuse problems among their colleagues to the appropriate authorities ok anonymity in this context is understandable , doc by the way , i also believe we have an ethical responsibility to avoid attacking another person s character , engaging in gratuitous insults , casting aspersions , or just plain being rude ! for more on internet ethics , please see my essay originally posted on the psychiatric times website , and also viewable at http www jeffpearlman com todays cnn com column a good rule of thumb , which i try not always successfully to live by if you wouldn t be comfortable saying something to a person face to face , think twice about saying it in an anonymous internet message you might just run into that individual at a conference ! only when self disclosure poses a great personal risk are we justified in hiding behind anonymity in short , all of us have a responsibility not only to tell the truth , but to tell the truth about who we are ronald pies md is professor of psychiatry and lecturer on bioethics humanities at suny upstate medical university , syracuse , ny and clinical professor of psychiatry at tufts university school of medicine , boston the views expressed here are solely his own note dr pies does not reply to unsigned , anonymous , or pseudonymous messages , except when the justification for anonymity is clear
