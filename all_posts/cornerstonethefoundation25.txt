in the previous article , learning to face distressing symptoms instead of dreading them i discussed the importance of facing depression s distressing symptoms rather than fearfully shrinking from them , as explained by dr weekes , 'i have no doubt that you are tensely shrinking from the feelings within you and yet , are ready to listen in in apprehension ? now examine and do not shrink from the sensations that have been upsetting you i want you to examine each carefully , to analyse and describe it to yourself do not tensely flinch from it go with it relax and analyse it now that you have faced and examined it , is it so terrible ? ' that is , although we are initially convinced that we cannot possibly live or function while these symptoms rage within us , the fact is that after we have faced them , we realise that we can still live and function with them once we have faced those symptoms and robbed them of their power , the next step is to put into practise a technique that will break depression s fear adrenalin fear cycle , as doctor weekes calls it the fear adrenalin fear cycle the cycle works like this we react to depression by fearing , fleeing or fighting it these reactions cause too much adrenalin to flow , and it is this adrenalin that causes depression s symptoms we are so desperate to get away from these symptoms that we fear , flee and fight even more , which in turn produces even more adrenalin , which prolongs symptoms and produces new , even more alarming ones , which we fear , flee , and fight , and the cycle continues it is crucial that we recognize that it is this cycle that causes depression s disturbing physical , mental , emotional and spiritual sensations symptoms , and that by breaking that cycle , we can eventually be free of them below i outline a system that can slow and eventually stop that excessive flow of adrenalin the system is simple and presented quite clearly in god s word , yet it is so unnatural that it does not occur to us when lost in a state of anxiety the natural reaction to depression is to fear , flee or fight the symptoms how to break the fear , flight , and fight cycle accept each of depression s symptoms as being part of our life , instead of fearing , fighting or fleeing them learn to live with the symptoms as part of our life as if they were background music let time pass while trusting that god is in control and keep ourselves constructively busy our first reaction to these steps could be , but i don t want to learn to live with these disturbing sensations i want them to go away ! and there lies the irony of it all it is only when we accept those sensations , learn to live with them , and let time pass , that the flow of adrenalin begins to diminish , as it the very reaction of desperately wanting them to go away that makes them worse and as the flow of adrenalin diminishes , the symptoms lose their intensity , shorten in duration , and slowly begin to disappear accepting them instead of fearing or fighting them is the way to make them go away the bible teaches us time and again that we should not be anxious , and it is not just because anxiety is the opposite of peace and trusting in god , but because god knows just how much fear and anxiety harms us here are scriptures that illustrate this technique of breaking the fear cycle by accepting , being content , and letting time pass here are some reflections in my diary about putting this technique into practice verses for acceptance consider it pure joy , my brothers , whenever you face trials of many kinds , because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance james be joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances , for this is god 's will for you in christ jesus thessalonians do not be anxious about anything , but in everything , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to god philippians verse for learning to live with the symptoms i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want philippians verses for letting time pass while trusting that god is in control do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also in me john blessed is the man who perseveres under trial , because when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him james therefore i tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink or about your body , what you will wear who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life ? matthew , trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding proverbs while i was depressed , although i knew the bible said i should not fear , should be content , and should rejoice in the midst of my sufferings , trying to put this into practice through sheer will power alone did not work however , once i understood that putting those bible verses into practice would break the fear adrenalin fear cycle , those verses suddenly came alive to me , causing hope to spring forth like spring rains after a drought it takes time for a nervous system to heal note that breaking the flow of adrenalin does not happen overnight , it is a gradual process that occurs over time however , my life is a testimony to the fact that it does happen dr claire weekes says , accept it the symptom as something that will be with you for some time yet in fact while you recover but something that will eventually leave you if you are prepared to let time pass and not anxiously watch the churning during its passing but do not make the mistake of thinking that it will go as soon as you cease to fear it your nervous system is still tired and will take time to heal , just as a broken leg takes time it is important that we keep ourselves busy as we let time pass while our nervous system slowly starts to heal we need to go out of our way to find engaging , constructive activities and hobbies that interest us physical exercise , such as swimming , aerobics , circuit , walking or jogging , can also be of great help within two months of reading self help for your nerves , a significant number of my symptoms , especially the physical ones , had greatly reduced in severity or ceased altogether over the next six months , i joined a new church , became a musician in a home group , started teaching sunday school , and engaged in normal social activities again some symptoms took longer to fade away than others , but by reacting to them in the correct way , they no longer had the same power or intensity as i no longer feared them some symptoms , especially the mental ones such as panic attacks , lasted longer , but in time , they too faded away counselling was a crucial step in helping to deal with these , by helping me to retain my thought processes and gain new biblical perspectives on the things i feared while stuck in depression , we think we have no future and no hope , but that is a lie from the kingdom of satan , for in christ we always have hope and a future no eye has seen , no ear has heard , no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him corinthians hope enters our lives again when we know it is only a matter of time , whether weeks or months , or in the case of some symptoms , years , for our nervous system to recover from this cycle after reading self help for your nerves , my diary entries went from being bleak and full of despair , to containing hope , like this entry th july this book has taught me how to react so that the merry go round will be stopped and it s teaching me how to react whenever it strikes again in the future the importance of surrender to recover from depression we need to surrender every aspect of our life , including our desires and will , to jesus romans assures us that god is trustworthy and can bring good out of any situation and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his purpose we sing , all to jesus , i surrender , but do we really surrender everything ? i am pointing a finger at myself here too ! for when a storm of life comes along , instead of surrendering every aspect of the situation , including our desires , to him , we typically react by fearing , fleeing or fighting because we do not want to be where we are yet , by reacting like this , we make the suffering worse as this causes more adrenalin to flow even in the midst of the storm called depression , when we accept what we are going through instead of fearing , fleeing or fighting it , when we learn to live with it , and let time pass , we can find rest and experience inner peace again come to me , all you who are weary and burdened , and i will give you rest matthew self help for your nerves , doctor claire weekes , angus robertston publishers , , p self help for your nerves , doctor claire weekes , angus robertston publishers , , p note , dr weekes includes 'floating' as a step in the treatment technique , whereas i wrote 'learn to live with it ' in my case i found the 'floating' concept hard to grasp , but easily related to that step or my interpretation of it when i thought of it as 'learning to live with it ' self help for your nerves , doctor claire weekes , angus robertston publishers , , p all verses from niv
