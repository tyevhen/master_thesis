i'm bored i get lonely sometimes as i find it difficult to make friends i avoid people out of habit i have been doing it too long i found myself waiting in the toilet cubicle at work the other day i waited until everyone else had left the bathroom so i would not have to talk to anyone i'm not nervous of it anymore but i have been avoiding people all my life so it is habit i do n't know how to meet people i am thinking of going to salsa dancing lessons tomorrow night i'm quite nervous though it says on the website that it is normal for people to turn upon their own the instructor pairs everyone up i find it difficult to strike up a conversation but i do not want to live on my own forever so i make myself go out in situations where i feel a little uncomfortable it is saturday evening and i am staying in on my own watching crap on tv like every other night ! it is not like i do not have any friends , i do have a few very close friends , most do not live in the same area and the only one that does is married and heavily pregnant , i see her and her husband about once a week but i ca n't impose any more than that i also get on well with my boss and the other people i work with , but they are all in relationships and i do not see any of them out of work i only really talk about work with them i talk to my boss a bit more he has been a great source of support to me i rang him when i was very ill and told him i did not want to die , he called the police and talked me down the stairs to the door on the phone i do n't think he realises that he probably saved my life i had got ready to go and jump in front of the next train about half a mile from where i was living he knows about my illness and has been very supportive i have told a few people at work about my bipolar , it is not common knowledge but i do not hide it if people ask why i was off work for months last summer and ask why i cancelled my career break to travel around the world , i tell them ! because i work in a professional environment and the company has an interest in psychiatric illness i have not had any problems i did get a bit frustrated after returning to work last autumn i was ready to do more work but my boss and occupational health wanted to protect me from a heavy workload , i was starting to go in and have nothing to do it was all well intentioned and when i spoke to them it was all resolved i'm getting on really well now and even have new responsibilities i am coping a lot better with more responsibility than i did before with less responsibility i sometimes wonder about the bipolar diagnosis and other times i believe it is correct my psychiatrist says he is as sure as he can be he also says i was definitely psychotic last year and the tablets i am taking are anti psychotics and mood stabilisers i have to take them for at least two years if i stay stable for two years i can try reducing the dose very slowly right now i do not feel like i could get myself in such a state again maybe the diagnosis is all wrong my mother thinks so i'm scared to stop taking the tablets though incase i get as ill as i was before when i was in hospital last year one of the other psychiatrists said to me that he was not going to give me a diagnosis because people are individuals and should not be pigeon holed the tablets work for me so i doubt if i will stop them anytime soon i do have the normal dream of falling madly in love getting married and having a family if i am ever lucky enough to have a family of my own i will stop taking them while i am pregnant
