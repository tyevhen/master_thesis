the sun is shining , and we 've had two beautiful days in a row puck and i ran miles yesterday and today my legs and body are constantly tired , but that 's pretty normal for this stage of the training game only four more weeks to marathon day ! i found a new sponsor for those of you following along , you remember my sponsor relapsed a few weeks ago it 's been a tough few weeks filled with all kinds of conflicting emotions surrounding this issue i finally did chat with my old sponsor on the phone i let her know i was angry she understood that i told her i found a new sponsor she thought that was a good idea , too things are okay , i guess well , i thought they were okay until i met with my new sponsor yesterday she had me do an 'anger inventory' about the situation i found out i'm still a work in progress on this issue as she put it , being angry is normal , but as alcoholics we cannot afford to hold onto anger and resentment if we do , we die it 's true if i hang onto the resentment , i 'd likely end up miserable if i'm miserable , i 'll likely drink if i drink , i will eventually die so i'm still working on my anger inventory one of the things i 've learned in aa is that expectations are just premeditated resentments i had expectations that my sponsor would never drink , and that she 'd be my sponsor forever when she drank , both of those expectations were shattered , and i quickly resented what she had done to my life can you say selfish ? what about what she 'd done to her own life ? ? ultimately , this has been and continues to be a lesson for me as usual , accepting life on life 's terms , rather than trying to control the world around me , frees me from my resentment and is helping me move on
