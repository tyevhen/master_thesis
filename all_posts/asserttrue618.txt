i'm dismayed and shocked to learn that the chrome javascript console still does n't support the manual entry of multiple lines of code instead , you have to copy and paste multiline code into the console to work around the problem , which frankly sucks pretty badly if i want to type lines of code into the console , like so function subtract a , b return a b i simply cannot the instant i hit enter after typing function subtract a , b , that line executes with a syntax error unexpected end of input i ca n't type the whole function , on multiple lines , then execute it in adobe acrobat pro which has a javascript console enter control j to see it , adobe solved this problem by letting enter take you to the next line as you 'd expect and letting control enter execute all lines of code firebug 's console has the same behavior i would like to see chrome implement the same behavior as it exists in the firebug and acrobat consoles the enter key should let you type on multiple lines control enter should execute code alas , chrome does n't work that way the one line at a time behavior has been in chrome since the beginning and is still there in beta issue was raised in february , addressing the problem let 's hope it gets fixed soon as a developer , i find it to be a blocker i e , it 's a top priority bug , not just an annoyance immediate attention required
