, i address these issues and provide some tips on how to boost your self esteem keep things in perspective ask yourself how many times have you worried about a particular problem only to find that the problem is n't as bad as you thought ? worrying about the problem did n't help , and it might have actually gotten in the way of your being able to problem solve keeping things in perspective being able to keep things in perspective can help you become more aware of what 's really important to you and what 's not sometimes , you have to let go of certain things that , in the long run , really are n't that important in my blog article , accepting the things you cannot change and having the courage to change the things you can , i discuss this important concept which is a central part of most recovery programs in my blog article , are you overreacting to routine disappointments ? , i discuss how you can learn to let go of routine disappointments so you 're not constantly overreacting find meaning in your life in my blog article , a search for a meaningful life , i discuss victor frankl , a psychoanalyst who was developed logotherapy and who has been an inspiration to millions of people dr frankl was a holocaust survivor even at the lowest point in his life while he was in a nazi concentration camp and he thought his beloved wife was probably dead , he found meaning in the every day things of life his attitude was that although his captors could imprison his body , they could n't imprison his mind find meaning in your life finding meaning in your life is often a matter of becoming more aware of the things you have to be grateful for , even in the midst of adversity most of us have never had to go through the ordeals that victor frankl endured , so it 's worthwhile to ask yourself what you 're focusing on do you tend to focus on the negative to the exclusion of seeing the positive things in your life ? stay connected with your emotional support system having supportive friends and family can make a tremendous difference when it comes to managing stress talking about things that are bothering you can help alleviate stress stay connected with supportive friends and family at the same time , it 's important to choose wisely when it comes to talking about your problems you want to choose people that you trust and that you know have your best interests at heart a short scenario of being resilient and coping with life 's ups and downs mary mary is a friend who is a hospital emergency room social worker she has one of the most stressful jobs you can have in health care , and she 's been doing this job for over years everyday she deals with a steady stream of patients who are in crisis either physically or mentally mary told me that she has seen many other er social workers with a lot less time on the job who have crashed and burned under the unrelenting stress so , i asked her how she has been able to deal with her stressful job at the same time that she is raising a family , and the things she told me are the same tips that i 've provided above first mary starts everyday by either going to the gym or going for a long walk before she gets to her job on the days when she does n't have time to get to the gym , she gets off the subway one stop before her regular train stop and walks the rest of the way it takes her an extra minutes , but she feels it 's worth it in terms of managing her stress second during her lunch hour , she finds an empty office and listens to guided meditation recordings that help her to relax she told me , i can feel my whole body start to relax as i listen to the meditation and feel myself being transported to a relaxing place in my mind third mary told me that it 's very tempting , especially when she 's busy , to grab whatever junk food she might find at the lobby news stand , but she makes sure she brings a healthy lunch with her so she 's not tempted to eat junk , which might be momentarily gratifying , but will make eventually pack on the pounds fourth mary and her colleagues spend time , even if it 's a few minutes , talking about their day they also usually find something funny to joke about to relieve stress fifth mary has a lot of good close friends that she talks to on a regular basis she has even maintained college friendships she has also developed new friendships among colleagues she has one of the best emotional support systems of all the people that i know sixth since mary has been a competent er social worker for a long time , so she has a good sense of her self worth even when she might be dealing with a difficult administrator , she maintains her cool and keeps her sense of perspective there are times when there are fatalities in the er , which are difficult for everyone but mary has learned to deal with these traumatic incidents by asking herself if she did everything possible that she could to help the patient if she knows she did everything she could , she does n't blame herself she and her colleagues also support one another through those difficult times seventh last , but not least , mary finds a lot of meaning in her personal life as well as in her career on most days , she feels grateful for the loving people and good things in her life although she is n't part of a formal religion , she has a sense of spirituality in nature , and she tries to be in nature as often as possible because she finds it nurturing mary has had plenty of adversity in her life , but she has developed the capacity to bounce back because of her resilience and her strong support system getting help not everyone is as fortunate as mary to have developed resilience and have a strong support system many people are struggling on their own and they have n't developed the resilience to deal with life 's adversity even people who have a strong support system often find that there are times in their lives when they need the help of a licensed mental health practitioner getting help to lead a more fulfilling life if you feel overwhelmed by your problems , rather than struggling on your own , you could benefit from seeing a licensed psychotherapist who has experience helping clients to become more resilient so they can overcome their problems i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples , and i have helped many psychotherapy clients to overcome their problems so they can lead more fulfilling lives to find out more about me , visit my web site josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com photo credit hey mr glen via photopin cc photo credit eddi van w via photopin cc photo credit eddi van w via photopin cc photo credit eflon via photopin cc photo credit gregpc via photopin cc
