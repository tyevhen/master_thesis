today was the first day of the next weeks weeks which will culminate in grandma 's marathon in duluth , mn for my long time readers , this will be deja vue all over again last year at this time , i began training for the grandma 's half marathon , a k a the garry bjorklund half marathon while that was a semi success , the twin cities marathon which followed was a huge dnf disappointment perhaps that dnf is what 's scaring me about taking on grandma 's in weeks setting goals is always risky , maybe more so when illness is part of daily life as was my goal last october at twin cities , i 'd like to qualify for boston how will i feel if i do n't meet that expectation again ? will my leg hold up , or will injury slow me down again ? do i want to take the risk , or do i want to let my apprehension hold me back ? finally , and most importantly , do i want to put in the amount of work required to not only finish the race but finish in ? perhaps that 's the biggest question today was the first time i 've run since the first week of my days of yoga class i did n't miss it the yoga was more than enough in fact , i think the core strength i gained during yoga will serve me well while running however , i'm not looking forward to the training that 's the first time i 've ever said that on my first three miles today , i could n't wait for it to be done it 's going to be very difficult to train properly if every miles feels like ten starting over is always difficult , and i hope that 's the only thing happening here it 's tough to train if training is unappealing it 's even tougher if training is drudgery since i'm starting anew , i'm going to push through for at least three weeks before making any long term decisions today the goal is a at grandma 's marathon in weeks i 'll keep you posted in the meantime , any words of encouragement or experience would be greatly appreciated !
