i'm having a good week on top of the blog award and the pay it forward breakfast gift , i had another good thing happen to me this week yesterday i was hired by another therapy company i will be an on call therapist at two of their local rehabilitation facilities the reason i applied and accepted the position , which is in addition to the two other on call positions i already have , is because they have regular hours for me at both of their facilities finally , i 'll be able to get back to somewhat consistent work , and i 'll be able to see if i can handle working part time hours i'm not sure i 've ever totally believed in the maxim , when one door closes , another door opens , but that 's exactly what happened this time i lost my part time position as a result of my recent depression relapse , and my employer has n't had any on call hours for me to work since march as a result , i 've been under a bit of financial pressure and worried about covering my bills and along comes a better opportunity a door closed , but another one opened i'm lucky and i'm very grateful i start monday
