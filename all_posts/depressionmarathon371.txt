i 've got bad news to report i'm back in the hospital my mom and a friend ganged up on me and brought me back in a couple days ago unfortunately , my mood has not responded yet to the ect treatments i had my tenth treatment session today usually i would have noticed a significant difference by now , but my mood is being particularly obstinant this time around i'm still feeling quite low i'm hoping for some relief within the next few days , although i'm not thrilled about spending the weekend here things tend to get quite boring here over the weekends the other issue i'm coming to terms with is how unprepared i am to run a marathon the new york city marathon is just a few weeks away , and i am not in marathon running shape i 've already paid my entry fee , reserved my plane ticket , and secured my hotel room if i decide not to go , that will be a lot of money down the toilet , but i do n't think i would have any fun going if i'm not in shape to run i 've got a lot more thinking to do yet , but right now i'm leaning toward staying home that 's all i have to report this evening i'm still accepting prayers for relief from my low mood any good thoughts sent my way will be gladly accepted
