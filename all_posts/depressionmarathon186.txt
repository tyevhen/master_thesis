it 's been a painful couple of days here i had oral surgery on tuesday morning to uncover , again , an embedded canine tooth that we 've been trying to pull down into position for almost one year the permanent tooth never came in , and the year old baby tooth finally had to be pulled last year after cutting away the gum tissue over the permanent tooth on tuesday , the oral surgeon found that the permanent tooth was re encased in bone the surgeon cleared away the bone , quite a violent little process , in order to loosen the tooth again in hopes that we 'll be able to pull it into place the tooth is connected to my braces with a bracket and chain the braces are supposed to be the anchor which pulls the tooth down these are the braces that have already been in place as long as planned , and we 're nowhere near the end of this process in fact , the likely scenario at this point in time is that the embedded canine will not move , the surgeon was not optimistic , which means it will need to be pulled another surgery , and an implant will need to be placed in the open space more surgery if i had to do it over again , i would n't needless to say , i 've been in a bit of pain since the surgery i 've needed to do a lot of resting resting , combined with my disappointment with the way this process has played out has not been good for my mood i'm trying so hard to keep my head above water mentally , but my body seems to be in revolt it 's been a tough year , and it does n't seem to have an end of sight hip surgery , oral surgery , achilles tendon , pneumonia , asthma i'm not sure i can handle much more i'm hanging in there , i guess , but i'm really frustrated and so much is yet unknown will the achilles ever heal so i may run again ? will i continue to have trouble with my asthma and require more and more medication ? when , at what cost , and after how many more surgeries , will i have a full set of teeth back in my mouth ? i realize i'm creeping up on years here , and perhaps i'm feeling sorry for myself , but c'mon i 'd really like something to break my way soon do n't get me wrong , i know things could be worse i'm just getting tired of the physical battle i'm grateful my mood has not crumbled , but i worry the continued physical stress will eventually take me down i do n't want that to happen i'm trying to stay as positive as i can i'm trying to quell the anxiety of the unknown by continuing to move forward it 's tough it 's a battle i know i 've got to keep fighting , but phew , this battle , i fear , is wearing me out
