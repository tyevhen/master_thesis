bipolar disorder is a spectrum disorder characterized by at least one manic or mixed episode , alternating typically with depressive episodes it conforms to kraepelin 's original concept of manic depressive illness , which can include psychosis symptoms during mood episodes in bipolar i , you see swings between manic and depressive episodes in bipolar ii disorder the individual never experiences a full manic episode but instead exhibits less severe hypomania which has the expansiveness of mania but lacks the delusional grandiosity there 's also a somewhat controversial diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder , which refers to a serious lability of mood that for whatever reason fails to meet the diagnostic requirements of bipolar on showtime 's homeland , claire danes left played a bipolar cia agent mandy pitinkin , right , played opposite her as a cia higher up despite bipolar 's depiction in modern culture as being somewhat common , it 's actually quite rare bipolar disorder occurs naturally in the u s at a lifetime rate of that figure turns out to be quite a bit higher than the condition 's actual worlwide prevalence rate of actual occurrence at any given moment the world mental health survey initiative found a prevalence of bipolar ii in the population of eleven countries to be , making it less common than schizophrenia the prevalence rates of bipolar i and ii are thought to be comparable in the u s , each occurs with a prevalence of about the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders th ed , in its formal criteria for bipolar , discounts mania as mania or as hypomania if it 's induced by drugs , which is extraordinarily convenient , in that antidepressant drugs can and do cause hypomania in some people i say convenient because the drug companies are keenly interested in dispelling the notion that unipolar depressed patients who start taking antidepressants are often , in so doing , converted to bipolar patients , which is exactly what does happen at several times the spontaneous rate in a literature review of studies involving nearly , patients with mdd without a history of mania or hypomania who were treated with an antidepressant , baldessarini et al found bipolar mood switching occurred in of patients within an average of years of treatment they also said we considered studies of patients initially thought to have unipolar mdd who required a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder , usually with verification by occurrence of spontaneous mania or hypomania such diagnostic changes occurred in within years , or times less than the rate of mood switching with antidepressants what it means is that if you go to your doctor with major depressive disorder unipolar depression and start taking antidepressants , there 's an chance you 'll be bipolar within years some people react to antidepressants by going manic or hypomanic it may not happen in the majority of cases , but it is a significant chance , and the longer you 're on antidepressants , the greater the chance of a changeover to bipolar from personal experience , i can tell you that if your daily routine includes coffee in the morning and alcohol at night , you stand a much better chance of avoiding the bipolar switch if you cut alcohol out of your life completely and keep coffee and other stimulants under control coffee and alcohol are cyclothymia triggers potentially you want to moderate their effects what happens if you do experience mania ? is there a known good way to treat it ? actually , there is it 's called lithium carbonate , and it 's one of the best proven , least expensive anti mania treatments money can buy it 's also fast acting and can be taken prn which means as needed , although it 's rarely prescribed that way the problem with lithium is that today 's doctors are using year old dosing recommendations that often result in a patient taking toxic amounts of the stuff a typical dosing regimen is mg two to three times a day that kind of dose will make you toxic in a couple of weeks , but unfortunately , there are few modern studies involving lower dose lithium one such study that 's worth considering is alevizos et al , which looked at the response to adjunctive low dose lithium in severely depressed patients who failed to respond to venlafaxine effexor alone said the researchers after weeks of augmentation , of the patients were rated as 'much' or 'very much' improved bipolar patients showed a better response than unipolar vs , p most patients showed a rapid response up tp days two things need to be mentioned with regard to the alezivos study first , there was no placebo control arm , hence the results await validation by a properly controlled , properly blinded study secondly , low dose here meant to mg per patient per day corresponding to about mg kg , which is still a high dose modern medical science still has n't wrapped its head around the idea that you can benefit from low doses of lithium , even though we have tantalizing evidence see , for example , this study there are others that micromolar concentrations of lithium in tap water can prevent suicide much of the information in this post was taken from a , word book i'm writing on mental illness to follow the book 's progress , add your name to the mailing list and return to this blog often thanks !
