if you 've been hanging out here on shrink rap for the past few days , you know we 've been talking about how the healthcare dollar gets spent do capitated systems coverage for all with a single pot of moo la make it harder to get services ? our readers say no do fee for service systems inspire doctors to order more and more services so they make more and more money at the mercy of the helpless patient and the poor insurance company ? are psychiatrists who do psychotherapy a total waste of money when cheaper professionals could do the same job ? some of the questions that have come up in our comments section imply that there are precise answers to these questions there are n't in situations where there are protocols , there is no issue , in any system , the protocol is followed for any patient who enters the arena it 's where stuff gets foggy that the questions get raised let me walk you through some examples jim is eating breakfast with his wife she is a democrat and he is a republican sesame street comes on and jim 's wife starts to cry , romney will obliterate big bird if he is elected jim wants to put in his two cents , but suddenly , he ca n't get the words to form he tries to speak , and nothing makes sense one of his arms is n't working , and one of his legs is n't working cookie monster comes on , jim 's wife refocuses her attention to the conversation they were having over bacon and eggs , and she realizes that something is horribly wrong she calls an ambulance and jim is brought to the hospital there is no question that jim will be seen by a doctor , probably fairly quickly , and sent for a brain scan no one will ask if the scan is necessary , his insurance company will not deny it , and even if he is poor and uninsured , he will have the brain scan who will get the bill is another story , but this will happen no matter where he is beyond that , i do n't know what the options are it does n't matter if the system is capitated or fee for service , and the ed doctor is paid a salary and he makes no more or no less for ordering a brain scan bill is having awful headaches his doctor does n't know why he does a neuro exam and it is normal he asks bill lots of questions there is nothing that indicates that these headaches are any thing other than tension headaches , and they do n't occur in the early morning or with have any nausea or vomiting with them , there are no scotoma , there is nothing to indicate that something awful is going on still , bill is and he 's never had headaches before and his doctor feels uneasy he 'd like to order a brain scan , but with a negative neurologic exam and no indicators of a mass or trauma , there is not a clear indication to order an expensive scan in a system where his doctor must either justify his decision for the scan fee for service managed care , or have money taken out of the big pot that serves everyone , bill wo n't get the scan does it matter , does bill need the scan ? well , if an operable lesion is found a tumor , an circulatory malformation , increased pressure then it was needed if nothing is found , then the scan was reassuring but unnecessary do note , that obtaining the scan does not put any money in the doctor 's pocket unless he has some interest in the radiology center this is not likely so would it change your opinion of whether he needs the scan if i told you that i know someone with headaches and no other symptoms who had a malignant brain tumor discovered because his doc got the scan that was n't indicated ? if bill 's doc knew someone with that story , he 'd really want to get the test done would it change your mind if i told you i know a man who told his doctor for years there 's something in my head years there was a large , benign , slow growing meningioma finally discovered so does everyone need scans ? does it matter ? the man who had something in my head for years had his tumor removed and did fine the woman who 's doctor jumped on ordering the scan for the headache told the patient it was n't urgent and she got the scan a few weeks later that end of that story is rather tragic finally , john is absolutely tortured , he ca n't sleep and he 's hearing voices and he 's acting really strangely john 's psychiatrist diagnoses the psychotic disorder of your choice and wants to start a medication which medication ? let 's be real , there are no good choices we could try one of the old medicines haldol works well and it 's cheap oh , did anyone mention that patients hate taking haldol , that back in the day when the old neuroleptics were all we had to offer , that people had to be coerced into taking them and they used to say it felt like molasses had been poured into their brains they walked stiffly , their eyes rolled up into their head during dystonic reactions and they drooled and in years , of them got tardive dyskinesia okay , we 'll skip the haldol , because everyone does let 's try a newer medicine zyprexa works really well for psychosis and it 's well tolerated it 's an older medication and it only costs month to be on the generic i kid you not oh , and of all the atypicals , zyprexa is the most likely to be associated with weight gain and metabolic changes and john is already overweight and his cholesterol is a bit high , and his father had a heart attack at a young age and has diabetes let 's avoid zyprexa for now risperdal might be a good choice , and it only runs about a month for a low dose if you shop around oh , but john is really worried about this weight gain and diabetes risk , and he says he wants the medication with the lowest risk of weight gain and diabetes that would be abilify , which comes in at roughly month john wants that , and he says he has a dollar co pay and he wants the minimal risk of weight gain and diabetes but really , his psychosis is bad , zyprexa probably works best , and not everyone gains weight and gets metabolic abnormalities on it the issue is one of risk if he does get diabetes , the cost of his care increases dramatically so does a patient have the right to request the safest medication , even if it will cost the taxpayer month more abilify versus risperdal ? what 's the easy answer here ? and if he takes a less effective antipsychotic and ends up in the hospital it will run roughly day , so it might be most cost effective to avoid that just so you know , if the patient has medicaid in maryland , the government does not allow the first trial to be with zyprexa costs too much with the metabolic risk or abilify too expensive john may want the least risk , but uncle sam or uncle martin ? just says no
