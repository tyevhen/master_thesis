today i climbed to the top of a large mass of rocks protruding almost straight up from the earth it was a beautiful , blue sky day in northern colorado we scrambled , hiked , and even crawled our way to the summit where the view was clear and uninterrupted for miles i had flashbacks to happier , younger days days spent exploring the shores of lake superior scrambling , hiking , and crawling over very similar rocks it felt great to test my balance , strength and agility in that old familiar way i was free freedom and exhilaration , sweat and scrapes , smiles and laughter , and it all culminated with a push up on the top do n't ask me why i just had an urge climbing is so satisfying my journey to the summit bears no resemblance to my journey with mental illness for example , when i climbed today there was a defined beginning , middle and end the end was exhilerating , mostly because i knew when i was there my reward was tangible , visible , beautiful which reinforced every step i took to reach it but along the way , each step was also its own precious reward , and not one of them was pre determined i was free to step , hop , jump , or crawl wherever i chose there were no hoops to jump through , no papers to fill out , no one to judge if i chose the right path i was free i was free i'm pleasantly exhausted now my lungs are filled with crisp , cool air and best of all , my brain is refreshingly vacant ! what a treat !
