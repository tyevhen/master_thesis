i read a lot of posts by young adults who skipped college in favour of self directed learning , from both unschooling and traditionally schooled backgrounds it s pretty exciting for me to see people discovering unschooling at all different ages , and i love that so many young adults are embracing it ! i love to read about the discoveries and experiences of fellow happily unschooling somethings but i find myself noticing lately how often uncollegers talk about the process of their learning , the detailed plans and self constructed curriculum , and i m struck by how very different my outlook is it gets me thinking about the positives and the negatives in my own learning , and how it compares to others experiences in some ways , i wonder if my own less structured approach is a sign of how long i ve been unschooling , and how much deschooling i ve done many seem to feel a strong pressure to create something school like , something to point to and say look , i m learning , just like if i was in college ! this is a pressure which , while i sometimes feel it , it doesn t really affect my learning i ve been an unschooler for so long that i m very aware of how ever present learning is , so i notice and appreciate how much i m learning and growing without needing to justify the validity of my education , at least to myself on the other hand , i think a little more planning would do me good , and maybe a little more thinking about my learning i d like to have a posting schedule on my blog , and manage to convince myself that self imposed deadlines are still real i d like to get better at saving and organizing all the articles i read on a variety of subjects every day i d like to get better at networking with like minded people in my local communities but when i start questioning whether i ve been approaching my college free life learning in the best way , the conclusion i find myself coming to is that far more important than building your own curriculum , or getting caught up in all the details of your education , is understanding what you want from your life knowing your strengths , your weaknesses , your values , and what type of person you want to be if you know the answers to those questions , from that base the paths to follow and the steps to take start to become a lot clearer i know that i m good at communicating , and feel that that s a big asset in my life i m not so good at consistently putting myself out there in the real world , networking , making friends , and getting involved in exciting projects i find learning in front of other people scary , so i know that taking classes can be a really good way to stretch myself and overcome that fear i write most prolifically when under the pressure of an imminent deadline , so i know that deadlines provide a certain helpful structure and much needed push when it comes to growing my writing career i know that i pretty much always regret not trusting my gut , or making sure a situation or opportunity is in line with my values and with who i want to be as a person yes , i need to get better at being organized , at being reliable , at producing even close to as much writing as i want to be doing i m working on it , struggling sometimes , finding moments of clarity other times but whenever i start to flounder , detailed planning never seems to help much instead , going back to that base , those important questions , taking a deep breath , and setting a few attainable goals seems to be the best course of action so far different ways of learning work for different people , and i know for some , the excitement is in the details and organization just not for me i m still figuring out what i want to learn and do day by day , and i think to some extent i always will be as we all know , learning isn t finite it s a lifelong journey , an endless series of experiences and choices my education outside of college isn t perfect my life is not exactly what i might want it to be right now but it s mine it s my choices , my experiences , my values and goals and it s something i value deeply i m not building a curriculum instead , i m just busy figuring out what it means to live a good life you might also like so you want to leave college now what ? authentic , personalized , flexible learning why valuing a different kind of education what i learn unschooling as an adult linkwithin
