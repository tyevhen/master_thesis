i am in love with this post by soulemama as someone who formally studied art , i'm really looking forward to the time when paige shows an interest in coloring , drawing , and art in general she still has a hard time using her hands to pick up small items so now is n't the time to introduce it but , that particular post really inspired me on how to get things rolling when the time is right it will be such a great opportunity for fun , confidence and pride building , and for making choices not to mention the development of fine motor skills and hand eye coordination i had to share it with you and i hope you enjoy it ! save you might also like toy simple ideas how to entertain your children in summer linkwithin
