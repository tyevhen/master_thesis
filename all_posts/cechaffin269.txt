i 've been avoiding the mention of depression since thanksgiving , after which i took a dive into my usual am and pm weeping spells i try to ignore them and let them play out i try not to globalize and condemn myself after the sadness comes it does bother me that in this run i have thought about myself more than rachel i hate melancholy at nights , partly with the help of a non prescription elixir , i feel better this is a standard pattern for clinical depression , mornings being worst , evenings better i'm a cliche' there 's nothing original about my disease like robert burton , who published his anatomy of melancholy in , i cope in part by writing the full title of burton 's book is typical of the obsessive depressive the anatomy of melancholy , what it is with all the kinds , causes , symptomes , prognostickes , and several cures of it in three maine partitions with their several sections , members , and subsections philosophically , historically , opened and cut up i have n't read the thing , but i know it outsold shakespeare , being one of the original self help books if one ignores origen one thing you have to ask about self help books if the author 's so frigging happy , why did he feel the need to write the book ? i find self help books toxic when i'm depressed i feel guilty for not being happier but melancholy is n't my fault , just my responsibility , like having diabetes thus i saw my shrink today and he doubled the happy pill so my friend eric calls it which i ca n't afford , making christmas a little thin it 's worth it if it works , because who wants a depressed craig around christmas ? it 's hard enough putting up with him when he 's well some of my friend 's wives have commented , in the past , that they actually liked me better depressed than euthymic not so my friends they expect hypomanic entertainment and adventurous shenanigans from me who i 've been in this blog is not how i will be remembered by those close to me i'm also going to withdraw from a narcotic pain management regimen to see if that may be contributing to my inability to put this depression to bed it will be hard , my pain will increase , yada but i 'd rather be in physical than emotional pain with modern pharmacopia we sometimes have a choice i cut a small redwood today for a christmas tree it looks like a charlie brown christmas tree on steroids , gangly , a bit barren but it 's six feet tall and perfectly green , not drooping like charlie 's sure , i could go to the store and buy one of those perfectly trimmed douglas firs if i so chose , but they are artificially manicured into a cone shape trees do n't grow like that in the wild and here in the redwoods you 're lucky to find a sapling with branches on all sides , given the fierce competition for the sun when kathleen came down from a nap she 's been sick with a middle ear infection she laughed and laughed at the tree but being a good sport , she began to decorate it in earnest as the foliage is not lush , the tree forces you to choose your favorite ornaments all i want for christmas is a stable , euthymic mood new word when paralyzed by the overwhelming chaos of a room in your efforts to clean it , a state of affairs we refer to as schmegged , you are in schmeggalysis i really want to end this entry with something positive , so from my poetic archives when i used to write poetry , here 's today 's salutation already if you have n't filed your taxes in years and with a dry throat call the number to be put on hold forever while dying to hang up , tempted to one more dereliction in a life of derelictions , or if your teenagers grieve you by apathy and drug abuse , reminding you of your own adolescence so you ca n't draw the line without feeling hypocritical , or if you cultivate a false smile over coffee because you went to bed angry at your mate , pretending to polite conversation while entertaining fantasies of divorce , or if you write a hopeful piece instead of your usual blue ramblings and fear others will find it facile , your art of no account , just therapy for the overeducated , then reach out through the stillness for a thimbleful of light poured into your words without measure look ! it is already in your palm published in kimera i had a bad dream last night about running green lights everyone was doing it but i knew it was dangerously wrong kilorats , ce
