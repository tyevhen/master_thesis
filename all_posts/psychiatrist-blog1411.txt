in psychotherapy , people often talk about how they are disappointed with their station in life by any given age , they should have had more toys , done more stuff , accomplished more more some people feel this way because the course of their life has varied a bit from what they 'd mapped out maybe they did n't make it through college , maybe the love of their life disappointed them , maybe a bad break derailed them maybe they did n't like what they started out to do and changed paths a bunch of times in search of something more interesting i 've taken to saying to these people and i say it a lot for some people life is about the journey , for others it 's about the destination for you , it 's about the journey so what if someone hits or or and they have n't finished college or they have n't finished law school or they are n't well up that longed for and often miserable corporate ladder if you are n't there , if you do n't have the car house whatever you thought you 'd have , it 's disappointing and it causes a lot of preoccupation i 'll point out , however , that many people objectively have all the things one should have by whatever age , in the world 's eye they have every measure of success and yet they still strive , still feel disappointed there 's always more money to be made , more toys to be had , another promotion that should have been gotten , more grants , more publications , the vacation home a story of failure why do we do this ? why are we always measuring ourselves and why have we set it so that some people are deemed failures by themselves , by others it 's good if you can support yourself financially , it 's good to be happy , enjoy the journey if my teenagers read this they would deem me the world 's biggest hypocrite they would be right i am a destination person i wrote my eighth grade career report on becoming a psychiatrist i think i was going to do research at duke running rats through mazes , but hey i went through college in three and a half years , went straight to medical school then residency , was a mom by , and i 've encouraged the older one would say pushed my kids to do well in school and strive i struggle with a teenage boy who values television and video games and sees my life as a rat race last year he told me his goal was to win three quarters of his on line games oh , he 's on the same trip i think , off to college in the fall , but he 'd rather not let anyone know so two more comments on journeys versus destinations one on the college application process oy ! the kid filled in one application that had essays they included asking what professor he wanted to do research with , and write page of your page autobiography all the colleges asked what he had to add to diversity , life , whatever it seemed like a lot of clarity , focus , accomplishment and form was wanted from a year old boy the college application process is a destination thing second yes , i really did write about wanting to be a psychiatrist when i was why ? yeah , why ? i 'd never met a psychiatrist , no one in my family is a doctor much less a shrink , and i 'd never met anyone with a mental illness if anyone figures it out , please call me so my take on it clink is a destination person , even if she does stop to smell the mushrooms roy is also mostly a destination person , but within the path , he swerves around a bit
