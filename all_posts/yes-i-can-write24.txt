this is the first of a three part series exploring what success is and means , unschooling when the going gets tough , and finding joy in the simple things the text is from a talk i wrote for the northeast unschooling conference , and i 've broken it up here into more manageable post lengths look for parts two and three on thursday and next monday ! as i was preparing for this talk , i found myself thinking a lot about what success means what it means in this culture , what it means to unschoolers , and what it means to me , personally culturally , the most common middle class narrative of success runs neatly from elementary school and high school , through college , and straight into a well paying office job unschoolers , obviously , have strayed from that path right near the beginning and i think it s fair to say that we ve all questioned whether that s really the best or the only best path to follow after all , as soon as you start re evaluating the place institutional education holds culturally and in each of our lives , it s a pretty natural step to start wondering if that education is really seeking the right results , or if we want to be focusing on different goals but , i often wonder if we haven t just replaced one set of expectations with another one , which , while less rigid , still falls far short of encompassing all the ways that humans can create their own versions of success in this world it s a day a couple of weeks ago i m curled up in the corner of the couch , knees tucked underneath me , the television playing something i m not watching in the background i ve spent most of the day caught in a negative thought spiral of failed attempts and disappointments in other words , it hasn t been a good day i m a loser i say the words slip out without my thinking them through beforehand , but in that moment , i believe it it doesn t matter that i don t want a degree i m supposed to have one , aren t i ? i don t have a real job , and despite the fact i m earning a small amount of money doing something i care deeply about , or that ongoing health problems have gotten in the way of outside work , it seems like something i should have it doesn t even matter that , at the core of all my beliefs about people and politics and everything else lies the belief in equality , and that there aren t or at least definitely shouldn t be any ranking of people based on how well they re winning at capitalism or success or anything else but in that moment , i m convinced that i m a failure those moments are just that moments , and ones that pass but i m reminded of how strong cultural messages are by how easily i can get caught up in and dragged down by those narratives , especially in moments of emotional difficulty and uncertainty unschoolers or not , i think many of us can t help but be affected in the unschooling community , ideas about success are different i usually feel like people consider me pretty successful in unschooling spaces popular blogger and speaker definitely falls under the range of well thought of unschooling endeavors , right alongside world travel and entrepreneurship writing , writing , writing it s nice to see other accomplishments beside the typical college to good career track being recognized for their validity but , the things that are viewed as successful by some vague yet very much felt unschooling consensus are things that , well , look good things that are somewhat performative , public , and easily seen it s the public intellectuals , the travelling writers , the startup superstars whom it seems we re most proud of i think it s no coincidence that the word performative was the first one that came to mind for me unschooling is often faced with such harsh criticism from uninformed non unschoolers , and even legal difficulties in some places when people first learn about unschooling , they don t usually get an image of the type of lifestyle many of us have lived and are living instead , they see one of chaos and ignorance and maybe even neglect , you mean you don t teach the kids anything ? ? how will they ever become productive members of society ? ? with that type of outside reaction , i suppose it s unsurprising that the lives of teenage and especially grown unschoolers can get turned into performances of success , most clearly seen in what and who we choose to talk about individuals become not just themselves uniquely flawed and skilled people with their own lives to lead , but results a product of a pedagogy , instead of simply people who ve lead a different lifestyle we broaden the definition of success , yes , to include more varied options but we still want it to look damn good i don t think it s a deliberate choice , or a deliberate ranking of some pursuits as more important than others , yet regardless of intentions , it can sometimes feel , as a grown unschooler , that you re caughts between a dance of sometimes conflicting , sometimes complementary pressures to prove unschooling success in one way or another , whether that means more mainstream or counter cultural narratives and when none of those paths looks like one you want to take , it can feel really difficult my sister , emilie is a musician , a martial artist , an amateur arthurian scholar , and a writer of fantasy fiction i think she s pretty impressive , as does pretty much anyone who knows her but unlike my own life and work , which i ve chosen to share in a very public way , her pursuits are much quieter she s an excellent writer , but she only shares her writing with a select group of trusted friends she s very close to getting her black belt in ninjutsu , and her teacher , who s moving , wants emilie to take over her class her accomplishments are real and important , but they re not necessarily ones that receive much recognition outside of the specific groups in which she practices her skills she makes adorable plushies , too many people , unschooled and not , lead quieter lives , with less outgoing passions in holding up the unschoolers doing ted talks or getting into prestigious colleges as the pinnacle of unschooling success , i feel like we might just be missing an opportunity to discuss , and to truly embrace , a vision of truly unique life learning if we mean it when we say that all interests are valid and important , then we must follow that belief through to it s natural conclusion , which would be that all life paths , as long as they re not harmful to others , are also equally valid , no matter how they might look to outsiders if we re to do that , it seems that we need to be making a lot more space in discussions of success for people whose success doesn t follow the most popular forms
