and amen ! can i hear an amen ! ? alright , folks , it 's party time ! you can now order my book directly through the publisher at the following site unexpected light only the hardback is available as yet we ship throughout the known universe in fact , we just got an order from the space station think how valuable that will be ! yet the shipping and handling are naturally enormous but what 's a few more dollars in the national debt ? here 's a poem i think might fit well with the astronauts ground control to major tom wait i stole that night train dark , dark , dark the moon a scimitar venus below a dull round diamond through low haze beyond mesquite and mud by the moon pebbled lake suddenly slicing through the night blue file of trees comes the train s brass foghorn and cyclops beam through high gaps in the trees soft palisade i see the hard edges of boxcars disappear as flatcars sneak by the hulking rectangles return , vanish again lights on the caboose box snake , mechanical river , pram over cobblestones won t wake the baby irregular rumble comes from darkness plows through darkness recedes in darkness in the lonely spaces the dark shape through the darkness hugely moving yet small against the hills and endless highlands tumbleweeds shiver jackrabbits prick their ears a coyote approaches under cover of sound by this campfire beside the moon pebbled lake i imagine the stars as receding trains head beams staring back an infinity of cars stacked behind them snaking through the black ether doppler shift confirms retreat the universe waving good bye constantly from its center good bye stephen hawking a lone train in the wilderness mysteriously comforting black obelisk on wheels slicing through night blue beneath the imperative stars moving to its own syncopation into the mexican night published in tryst one of the longer pieces in the book now the challenge of the book boils down to marketing how do you market a book of poetry , esp in the u s where the demand for it is likely less than in europe or elsewhere ? i must overcome the narcissitic quotient everyone in america thinks they can write a poem , by golly they did so in high school , so what 's the big deal ? and among poets it 's really i that deserve a book , and i'm not going to contribute to another poet 's narcissism by buying his ! malcom gladwell in outliers just posited that it takes , hours to master something i guarantee i have put at least that much time in the reading and composition of poetry , not to mention near a thousand publications so do not fear you are not in the hands of an amateur i listed twelve reasons to buy my book in a previous post is it too early to throw my ambitions on the bonfire of charity and beg you to buy the book , so i can feed my dog and afford a cardboard shelter as a starving artist ? no , i have n't come to that juncture of marketing humiliation yet , but stay tuned the mere existence of a book does little it is only by purchase and word of mouth that a buzz is created , and once the buzz happens , it can snowball , and soon healthy sales result i guarantee you , as in the poem above , that my book will stretch your mind and help prevent alzheimer 's i say this as a doctor and a poet so , what else is new ? my darling baby daughter turned yesterday , the same day my book became available , a nice coincidence or synchronicity here 's a picture of her for those who do n't remember her beautiful mug she 's not only beautiful but talented , a star of stage and screen majoring in theater although she turned , i heard a rumor that there might be beer at her party of course , only for friends that are right , and i'm going to win the pulitzer ! but back to my plea it is you , the long time readers of this blog , who now need to step up and do your part in sustaining my dream of being a recognized poet by not only purchasing a copy but telling your friends the first version available is the hardback , but it 's by far the best deal for the price and will last a lifetime especially if you put it in a plastic bag and do n't read it , although that is not the usual purpose of a book some think books should be read , unlike my younger brother who is more a collector but that 's another story the secret of marketing is twofold first , branding you gotta make your name known , especially in your marketing niche , which in the case of this book is mainly enlightened beings to whom i'm already sending telepathic vibes secondly , you gotta make people want the product because their lives are incomplete without it , because without it they wo n't be current , and besides , as everyone knows , poetry is the caviar of literature and just the fact that you read it will elevate you in the eyes of others , leading to romance and riches and a generalized respect for your intellectual powers moreover , a book of poetry is convenient , as it can be read in one or two sittings or relished slowly poem by poem but i guarantee , for those who take public transportation , the fact of your reading it will invite admirers and discussion there are those who read this blog from china , as well as kuwait and other muslim nations , where the act of purchasing the book may lead to problems with the authorities , but i say , stand firm with me on freedom of expression still , do n't be in a hurry to share the book with your local imam or communist censor the work does contain a couple of words that might be censored elsewhere but only a couple i wo n't tell you which ones , because i'm trying to generate prurient interest as well after all , the book contains love poems ok , i 've had my say here 's that link again unexpected light do not think this will be the last mention of unexpected light , but i will try to temper its promotion with other posts about the usual suspects , poetry and manic depression and life on the redwood coast in worldwide solidarity for free expression in the fine arts , and in expectation of support by all the readers here , c e chaffin p s those who do buy the book , please write me or comment here , wo n't you ?
