dear curtiss please tell me how can i respond to someone try to make fun of me because i have depression i felt very bad and could not talk i do not respond to anybody in the situation i keep quite and talk to my self is it my fault to have depression in my life please help r dear r if you could tell me exactly what someone said i would have a better idea of how people are responding to you you have a right to feel bad and then take action to feel better if people make fun of you because you feel bad that is their problem , not yours you could respond by saying thanks for making me feel better with your uplifting comments if ever you feel bad be sure and let me know so i can say something cheerful you are being sarcastic and that is one way to reply but it would help if you told me exactly what they said to make fun of you it 's not your fault to have depression but it is your fault to talk about it all the time and think about it all the time it might be a good idea to start acting cheerful , even if you do n't feel cheerful because by acting cheerful , cheerfulness becomes a habit in the same way acting depressed and talking to people about your depression and thinking about being depressed becomes a habit if someone is bullying you , speak up it does n't matter what you say just that you say something to show you are not a wimp you can say hey , thanks for that comment i 'll give that some thought have a nice day , man ! ! a b curtiss
