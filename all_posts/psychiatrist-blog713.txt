one complaint about psychiatry is that psychiatrists wo n't entertain ideas that counter what 'established' psychiatry believes we actually do n't think that 's true psychiatry has made a lot of changes at shrink rap , we pride ourselves on taking all comers and letting people rant about whatever they want no obscenities , please for years , we 've put up posts and people have come on to tell us about their experiences , both good and bad lately , we 've had a lot of contention in our comments , and some repetitive links to sites that counter what we feel is good medicine we have n't removed them it 's not that we oppose the idea that there are people out there who think our treatments are n't helpful , and we certainly believe that they are n't helpful to everyone but at times , the comments are incessant , repetitive , angry , mean , it feels like we 're being harassed , and that we 're being used as a site to place advertisements to other blogs information which we feel are incorrect , and i worry that these anti psych messages may insult our readers who a practice psychiatry , b feel helped by psychiatry , or c feel frustrated with psychiatry but have found shrink rap to be a somewhere they can respectfully vent while i do n't want to shut down dialogue , this is a psychiatry blog , and those who do n't like us are welcome to start their own blogs ! funny , some of our ardent 'haters' i use that term kind of affectionately do n't have blogs , do n't have sites that allow comments , or moderate their comments , all while accusing us of being closed minded should we begin to moderate our comments ? oy , one more thing on the to do list one more thing for the 'haters' to kvetch at us about we would continue to allow opposing views , but we would moderate out obscenities , pure hostility without a clear message , rudeness to us or other commenters , repetition , and comments that are placed merely to direct readers to other websites with the idea that those hold the truth while our views are simply wrong what do you think ? we 'd love to hear your comments and please do vote on the sidebar poll , and only vote once we 'd love to hear your comments even if you think psychiatry might be helpful to some people ! someone suggested putting pro psychiatry comments and a plug for the shrink rap book ! on these other websites i 've surfed over to some of them and you know , it is amazing to me how much more vocal people who do n't like medications are , it 's almost like it 's not socially cool to say meds helped me your comments are welcome , and if you 'd like to put shrink rap plugs on other sites , go for it !
