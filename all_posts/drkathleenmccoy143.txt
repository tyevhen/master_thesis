in the midst of the timelessness of another maui vacation with bob running four miles daily along a coastal trail and our swimming across napili bay and back twice a day there were reminders today about the relentless march of time we got an email from our former neighbors jay and linda that alice , one of their two surviving cats after the late zoey , about whom i wrote a post in april , died yesterday at the age of about she was a spirited member of their family for sixteen years and a great pal of zoey 's if there really is a rainbow bridge , i hope that alice and zoey are playing there together once again free of the pain and infirmity that their old age brought alice , a beloved member of jay and linda 's family , died yesterday it 's a reminder of how brief and fragile all our lives are our beloved pets just live a speeded up version of timelines that confront us all while walking to breakfast at our favorite sea side restaurant this morning , bob and i saw a woman out walking , supported by a walking pole , aged and unsteady on her feet as we approached the restaurant , we saw an elderly couple , both bent with severe arthritis and walking with great difficulty and i wondered if i might be glimpsing the future looking back at our first visit to maui together in , i realize there is quite a difference between the slim young woman i was then with nary an ache or pain , running in and out of the surf now i approach the waves with a heavier step and fling myself in , re experiencing youth only while swimming and jumping the waves only when i step out of the sea once again am i reminded of the passing of time and its toll on me physically and yet , perhaps , i enjoy days here in maui at least as much and probably much more than i did in my youth i realize now , with new clarity , how finite the time that will permit bob to continue to run and both of us to swim through choppy seas without undue fatigue there probably wo n't be many more of these active holidays which is why we decided to come back again this year aging is a fascinating passage for some of us , our bodies age and our spirits remain young some years ago , my year old maternal grandmother was visiting us and bob asked her how old she felt inside grandma 's eyes twinkled with amusement why , , of course , she said i 've always been in spirit all these years later , i know what she meant more than ever i'm in the water and all of my years on land where did the time go ? i'm astounded when i think of my sister 's child nick and get the image of a bright and droll child in my mind before realizing that nick is now years old it does n't seem possible that i 'll be attending my th college reunion in october and my th high school reunion in april of next year bob and i ca n't help but look at each other with wonder when he recounts every moment of the day we met and we both realize that was years ago and that we 've known each other and been married to each other quite a few more years than we had been alive when we met and i cuddle my beloved cat gus , remembering the delightful , sweet kitten he was , then see the impact of time on this wonderful animal whose gait is slowed and jumping days are over is it possible that he is years old ? a wave of anticipatory grief comes in a rush then i kiss his massive head , vowing to enjoy every remaining moment with this lovely cat however long or short the rest of his life may be and i watch him nurturing our new kitten hamish , who is quickly growing out of kittenhood and toward young adulthood in what seems like an instant gus as a kitten in august , curled up with late brother timmy gus , , and hamish , months , in august it 's the cycle of life we all inhabit where we 're always saying hello and , as time goes on , more and more often saying goodbye goodbye youth , hello young old age and hello to new generations of kids and kitties hello , sweet henry , two months and precocious maggie , the children of my brother mike and his wife amp their lives in a multi cultural , high tech world will be very different from ours and , we hope , will extend many years after we are all but memories and we hope that all of those years will be happy and fulfilling ones for these children and countless others who are new to this world maggie and henry , jet lagged on arrival in bangkok , thailand goodbye to jeanie 's wonderful and beautiful marmalade gypsy whom so many of us came to love through her blog of the same name hello , my precious hamish ! may you have a long , healthy and happy life goodbye to too many friends i knew and cherished who never had a chance to grow old hello , jay and linda i can so feel and understand the pain you 're experiencing right now and goodbye , dear alice ! you were a wonder and have left so many hearts sad at your passing and so very glad to have known you !
