the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the lord looketh on the heart sam yesterday was a really tough day for me as i explained earlier at one point of the day i called my sister who lives in georgia to cry and talk to her since i was feeling down when i got back from my initial visit with my new counselor , my neighbor stopped me in the driveway to give me a boquet of flowers that someone had delivered it is a beautiful full boquet of red roses with one white daisy sticking out the card said , be your own kind of beautiful ! i love you ! lisa just like the picture shows , i do n't have to be one of the roses to have my own unique beauty shine through it was a good reminder that i should n't care where other people think i should be its my life and no matter how people think i should behave or look or feel , it does n't matter i ca n't worry or care about the judgments that is the hardest lesson i will have to learn i know right now i still do care and thats what spawns my attacks it turned the rest of my day around it was nice to know that i had someone cheering me on and was supporting me not just making progress , but was there to support me when i did n't , when i went backwards today has been rough as well but in a different way i am back at work and struggling to get through the day with this constant nausea feeling in my stomach i have no appetite whatsoever but i am not going to push myself cause that will only make things worse the hardest thing about today is that i am back at square starting completely over i ca n't keep thinking about where i was cause it just gets me down so what if its pm and i have only taken in calories a few weeks ago i was in the range at the end of the day and thats how i was gaining weight , but i did n't start there i think i started at originally , and thats when i was feeling good so i will take it one step at a time , one day at a time , at my own pace positive affirmation alert i can take as small a step forward as i choose there 's no need to push myself this is the first time in my life where i completely understand that phrase , one day at a time you might also like why me ? humbling adversity but not alone my top anxiety tools and resources lessons learned patience and determination linkwithin
