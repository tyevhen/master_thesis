photo by filmsnotdead okay ben this posts for you i can understand the request for this post because if you confide in people about your anxiety , sometimes they do n't know how to act around you in an anxiety triggering situation the last thing i , or i am guessing anyone , would want is for the loved ones in our life to feel like they have to walk around on eggshells around us i can sense when people do that and it makes me feel handicapped so i want to share this blog so the people in my life or that have loved ones suffering with anxiety have a better idea of what helps in an anxious situation and what just makes things worse i appreciate the sensitivity shown by my family and friends it truly makes things a lot easier to know that i have someone that will understand my quirkiness and will still love me for it my sister for example , did n't want to put me in an awkward position around her so she wondered if she just should n't invite me out to lunch anymore on the surface that sounds great just avoid the situation altogether ! however thats not want i want , because that would actually be hurting my recovery by enabling me to avoid my fears which would only make the fear grow on the flip side , i do n't want her to invite me over to eat all the time to try to make me feel better about it that would just be a strain on our relationship if i was always stressing over it here 's what works best for me act the way you would if you did n't know i had anxiety i still want to be invited to social gatherings , even if its too much for me and i have to turn it down i still want the option to take the risk you can be sensitive by not bringing attention to my anxiety or any of my eating or driving habits if i am in a situation where i have to eat with a bunch of people , even getting the how are you doing ? you okay ? look in my direction has been enough to cause a panic attack , just because i knew someone else was focusing on it like i was i may be fine inside or really struggling , but for some reason if i think i'm the only one who knows i am struggling it makes it easier i do n't feel the need to get over my driving fears right now one phobia at a time ! i have no problem avoiding driving if i can and i still plan on doing so in the future i drive when i have to and thats good enough for me one step at a time so friends could offer to drive or offer to drive my car for me if i am driving , being a backseat driver is the worst thing you could do i have never had a full blown panic attack about driving , but my anxiety stress levels can get pretty high some times if i feel my driving is being critiqued so in summary , just treat me like a normal person and then love me even if i am not normal in return update since posting this post i have come across a website dedicated to family and freinds of loved ones suffering from a mental illness that is pretty cool it 's called www whatadifference org they have videos on tv that are pretty cool , here is one of them if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like when help is harmful a few quick tips for friends and why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? my story breaking the stigma linkwithin
