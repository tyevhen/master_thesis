as reported on furious seasons , it looks like joe biederman is getting attacked by psychiatrist lawrence diller , who goes pretty far in his accusations i m glad someone in psychiatry is questioning the child bipolar frenzy , though i do n't necessarily agree with diller entirely on a somewhat different note , daniel carlat urges caution before jumping on the biederman bashing free for all if carlat s writing is always going to contain as much sarcasm as appears in his most recent biederman post , i ll be one happy guy one snippet the study in which biederman played a key role was not even funded by industry , which is impressive for a department in which psychiatrists can barely find the water fountain without industry support my emphasis let the games continue
