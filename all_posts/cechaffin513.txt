it seems to me that earlier on the net workshop boards or participatory listservs were the favored method of rubbing shoulders with other poets i do n't know how the boards are doing now there are likely many poets entering the porthole of net poetry through their auspices still , i think i 've witnessed a migration of poets from boards to blogs i am one who came late to the idea , but here i am to where the next migration will be , i do n't know the direction i 'd prefer is that quality e zines became a coveted credit not only on the internet but in the dead tree world as well i got a head 's up on this today i had called ygdrasil an e zine in a letter to its editor , klaus gerken , and he corrected me , calling it a journal that distinction is important for him because he feels e zine is too dismissive a moniker for good electronic journals his attitude is admirable even more than self respect we need critics until we have a healthy amount of astute literary criticism on and about the net , we will not have the kind of baptism needed to validate our worth to the print world rob mackenzie and ron silliman are two bloggers who are also good critics of poetry , but neither is attached directly to a journal to my knowledge in between considerable househusband duties , i finished my preliminary organization of the majority of all poems i think worth preserving sorting out all the different versions over the years was tedious , but my goal is to have only one version of each poem when i'm done , while having deleted all poems i do n't think worth preserving here 's a poem with alternate endings i need your advice on which one to leave in the poem you do n't have to be a writer to give me your opinion ! at the lincoln memorial if i could save the union by freeing the slaves , i would if i could save the union by not freeing the slaves , i would up three tiers of steps your mammoth shoe at eye level gargantuan hands rest easy now folds of robes flow from your throne in static waterfall , a greek convention in american marble your face looks younger than the face from books the brochure explains the sculptor used your death mask your eyes , so often scored by laughter now stare grimly across the reflecting pool at that less human monument of washington , your father he the machine , you the christ embalmed in stone under cool portico , resurrected in cold recall first ending ah , honest abe , tell us a joke to humanize your face ! the one about grant and the whiskey would do i envy the sculptor who made you how good to carve a homely man made beautiful by suffering second ending ah , honest abe , tell us a joke to humanize your face ! the one about grant and the whiskey would do you would likely laugh at your marmoreal apotheosis besides , it seems unfair when , after black humor , justice was your strong suit published in one version in the adirondack review and the susquhenna quarterly the archive for adirondack is not available and the susquehanna quarterly i could n't find in the first references on google could this mean two more depublications ? how will the litnet garner any respect when journals do n't maintain archives ? i know you 'll all weigh in with your wisdom on the poem at kilorats , ce
