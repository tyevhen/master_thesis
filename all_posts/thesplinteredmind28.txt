i thought that being sick with an unknown virus for seven weeks in the summer was bad i was couch ridden , exhausted , dizzy , nauseous , and thoroughly miserable i would rally strength here and there to run an errand , then collapse again for days the sickness never ended the doctors couldn t help i saw two , there were no meds to take , and here i was with a book to finish and some freelance writing to do then i learned that i was doing it all wrong a few weeks ago , somebody put a price tag on my success apparently , it was a zero followed by a dot and two more zeroes that person felt that if i labeled my disability , i penned myself in by it that it defined me and limited me i argued that labels empowered me by defining my limitations , labels helped me find solutions i also tried to explain that i successfully managed my depression because i constantly fought it off the person then implied that since i was poor , i wasn t very successful as far as they were concerned , solutions needed to involve income , and since i didn t have much money , i hadn t solved anything at all of course , i m taking exaggerative liberties with the conversation , but that s the gist of it it s not the first time that i ve been told that i m limiting myself by my mental health labels , though putting a dollar value to all forms of success was a new one for me i feel that the stigma of mental health is so odious to some of these people that if i go ahead and embrace my problem openly , then they think there must be something wrong with me without any trace of irony in that thought they truly insist that all my problems would go away if i just stopped focusing on them head , meet sand i m a big boy i can handle opposing viewpoints in fact , i even welcome them having somebody challenge me intellectually and not be intimidated by me can be very refreshing where i erred that day was in believing that the conversation didn t bother me i stayed up all night afterwards troubled by it the truth is that i m very self conscious about my finances life has been a struggle since my divorce , and i haven t found my footing yet having somebody point my lack of fiscal success out to me even if they meant well turned me up inside when i get sick , my tic disorder gets worse when sickness lingers for weeks , the amount of work i get done dwindles like a campfire in a downpour is it any surprise that losing the entire month of july has left me discouraged ? is it so hard to accept that some people have weaker immunity systems than others ? like some people are born tall and beautiful , and some people are born that look like me ? that was a joke i'm dashing and handsome , and have you seen my hair ? gorgeous but one of my daughters did n't realize i was kidding and was hurt by that comment , so here is my disclaimer genetics is the roll of the dice at the moment we are conceived some of us can t fight off illness with the toss of the head and a chuckle some of us with clinical depression find our immunity systems impeded it s not make believe i m not sure why that is so hard to understand for some people oh , sickness ! my love and joy if you think i am discouraged because somebody criticized my life , you are being too hasty i get that sort of advice all the time everybody s an expert on my life they never call , they never write , but if i could just stop defending myself for a moment , they ll happily solve my problems for me on a brief moment they set aside for me i m sure you can relate frankly , i place seven weeks of viral hell a little heavier on the self worth scale than the tag team of condemnation disapproval after all , as ham fisted as people s advice is , they mean well viruses , on the other hand , just want to kill me what a miserable seven weeks i finally summoned up the energy to go on a bike ride in the middle of july , but gave myself an umbilical hernia for the effort yes , for real july has been a banner month i had large goals to achieve instead , i watched a large amount of tv in a lethargic lump of lazy illness so , yes , i am discouraged , but i am not defeated as penance for being a living summer resort for viruses , i have spent the past week working on my book soon i will be ready to prove my value to society you see , it is hard to sell a book to you if i keep it littered on my hard drive like a brilliant pile of leaves once my book is published , then i can let everybody know that i have real value all quantified by sales and bank balances maybe the price tag on my success will cover pizza for a night , or maybe it will amount to more who cares , as long as there s a dollar value ? after all , of what value is keeping your chin up and fighting disability when your disability is a figment of your imagination and there are pennies to count ? fortunately , i don t truly believe that way so here is proof that i am fighting my first blog since june i want you to know that just because somebody has a limited understanding of hardship doesn t mean that your struggle is imaginary keep that chin up , keep carving out positive moments in your life , and don t let depression succeed in putting you down where other people have failed
