as i 've aged ripened , mellowed , whatever i 've gotten more emotional and effusive at least i think so roy ? clinkshrink ? they 've known me for a while i used to hold it in reserve when i liked someone , and in recent years i 've been much more likely to tell people what i like about them , what wonderful friends they are , how much i treasure them it 's not the usual thing to do in psychotherapy , at least i did n't use to think so there 's that whole blank screen thing and the psychoanalytic influence that makes it a no no to say i like you we 're supposed to look at what the patient brings , and if they wonder how i feel about them , well , more grist for the mill , so to speak people come to therapy hurting , sometimes injured or even damaged , and often feeling badly about themselves they nitpick , they blow their faults up , they talk about their strengths with ambivalence oy and sometimes they 're right about their faults , but last time i checked , i could n't locate the perfect person and everyone has a few i'm told i talk too much so what , who cares ? so i talk too much and my hair frizzles it 's who i am psychotherapy is n't about fine tuning people into perfection , but sometimes it is about helping them to become more comfortable with the imperfect person they happen to be i 've taken to pointing out to patients some of their finer points i do n't usually tell people i like them , but i do sometimes tell people that they 're likable this means i like them or that they have a good personality sometimes i list their strengths you 're bright , creative , intuitive , thoughtful , considerate , you have high moral standards , a great sense of humor , and the list marches on i do n't lie and i do n't comment on peoples' physical appearances hmmm you 're a great person despite that wild head of frizzly hair i do n't think so ! people come to therapy feeling vulnerable i hope it helps to counter a negative focus with a some reality cues most people are n't all bad i also think people sit on the couch feeling pretty vulnerable , and it helps to know that a therapist does n't see them as a miserable creature most patients seem comfortable with this occasionally i have to be careful a compliment is heard a negation of someone 's feeling as though i do n't believe they are as bad as they want me to believe , as though i'm not really listening or i'm arguing i do my best i 'll stop talking now and if you want the music , try this
