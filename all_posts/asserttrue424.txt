not to keep harping on the amazing power of desktop omics tools , but i thought i 'd share a tip for those of you into genome mining the tip in a nutshell is that if you gang load a bunch of fasta sequences dna sequence data into the featview form at http genomevolution org , then click the rather inconspicuous button labeled phylogeny fr at the bottom left of the featview page , you 'll be taken automatically to http www phylogeny fr , where you 'll get a realtime generated phylogenetic tree based on the sequence data you provided in featview , with no effort on your part it 's truly a one click operation copy and paste dna sequences into featview , click one button , and seconds later a tree shows up on your screen , looking perhaps something like this the reason i made this tree is that i was n't satisfied with my knowledge of the relatedness of certain weird microorganisms i 've recently run into namely ralstonia which i mentioned yesterday , weird because it turns hydrogen gas and co into plastic bordetella , a bronchial infection agent weird because it turns out to be very similar , genetically , to ralstonia burkholderia , a soil organism and human and animal pathogen , weird because it has an unexpectedly large amount of genetic similarity to ralstonia and polynucleobacter polynucleobacter , a ditch water bacterium , weird because it can live as an intracellular parasite of freshwater ciliates or it can live independently in soil making it potentially a great study organism for determining the genetic bases of intracellular symbiosis thiomicrospira , a very tiny co and sulfur loving organism , weird because it can only be found near deep sea thermal vents see my previous writeup polaromonas , a relatively newly discovered and still poorly understood bacterium , weird because it is abundant in glacier ice on multiple continents plus it has an amazing and totally unexpected amount of genetic overlap with our good friend bordetella , the whooping cough bug if you 're not familiar with how bacterial classification works , let 's just say it 's a mess there 's a long historical tradition of classifying microorganisms based on a hodgepodge of ad hoc methods involving everything from physical appearance under the microscope especially after staining with crystal violet , to the habitat of the organism , to its ability to metabolize various substances , its ability to make spores , adaptation to oxygen or lack of oxygen , serological characteristics , etc it 's always been an error prone system , resulting in many misclassifications and later corrections , owing to its inconsistency and basic irrationality , to put it bluntly with the advent of molecular genetic techniques , it 's now possible to create accurate phylogenies based on little more than dna sequence differences , usually involving the s ribosomal rna more here freshwater ciliates like this euplotes are home for polynucleobacter endosymbionts as big an advance as ribosome based phylogeny is , it 's pretty far from ideal imho , mainly because it ignores phenotypes in fact it 's pretty far removed from anything at all having to do with an organism 's ecology , metabolism , mode of living , etc what are we really measuring when we measure relatedness according to a s ribosomal yardstick ? just the rate of random mutation accumulation in a pretty uninteresting cell artifact i 'd rather have a yardstick that 's tied to phenotypic reality than to a slow to change , highly conserved piece of cold dead scaffolding so to create my own family tree of two dozen or so microbes , i said to hell with s ribosomes and decided to use , as my yardstick , genetic variation in the groel gene , which codes for the kilodalton heat shock protein i chose this protein or rather , the gene for it as my phylo yardstick for a number of reasons first , the dna sequence is sizable , at about nucleotides making it somewhat bigger than the s rdna it 's important to have a large yardstick gene when looking for faint genetic signals secondly , this protein is essentially universal in prokaryotes it 's ubiquitous but not necessarily highly conserved , in the same sense that rrna is highly conserved highly conserved is not what you want think about it taken to the extreme , a highly conserved sequence is invariant it never changes and is therefore useless for phylogenetics thirdly , the groel heat shock protein has multiple intracellular touchpoints it 's known to interact with groes , aldh , and dihydrofolate reductase , and it 's involved in signal tranduction it 's induced not just by heat but by hydrogen peroxide not to overlook the obvious , but it is also a touchpoint protein for any enzyme that can be repaired by the kda heat shock protein that 's probably dozens if not hundreds of enzymes why is that important ? think about it a protein that is sensitive to the d conformational requirements of other proteins has to evolve in response to the needs of all the proteins it services a thermophile thermomicrospira is going to need a different heat shock repair system than a psychrophile polaromonas a salt lover needs a different one than a freshwater lover groel has to reflect , in its own structure , the many shifting requirements of the host proteome these considerations make groel a highly appropriate basis gene for phylogenetic analysis and frankly , i think the groel based phylo tree phylogeny fr spit out for me see illustration further above speaks for itself it 's a remarkably informative and accurate tree groel evolutionary differences not only accurately grouped endosymbionts together , soil organisms together , aquatic organisms , etc , it also correctly grouped the enteric alike erwinia with e coli and shigella , and it cannily put polaromonas with soil organisms rather than aquatics , which i think is correct , based on recent polaromonas isolates being found in soil rather than snow likewise , it 's good to see bdellovibrio a freshwater bug clustered with polynucleobacter which is symbiotic with a ciliate protozoan , with thiomicrospira the saltwater hydro vent organism a very nearby out node if you get an infection while in a hospital , pray it 's not clostridium difficile , which is often deadly a harder call to make is clostridium difficile , which is present in to of non ill people 's intestines is it an enteric a la e coli ? definitely not the clostridia botulism , tetanus , etc are spore forming soil bacteria their placement in the tree not far from the soil dwelling spore former , bacillus thuringensis , is thus eminently correct bacillus is a proximal out node relative to clostridium , which is understandable in that bacillus is aerobic whereas clostridia are strict anaerobes buchnera an aphid symbiont comes at an odd location , much further away from the insect dwelling wolbachia than i would have predicted , but then again buchnera 's host feeds on cold sap where wolbachia 's hosts typically feed on warm blood all the organisms around wolbachia in the tree are hemophiles our good friend bordetella of pertussis fame is placed firmly in the soil group i think that 's real and significant when you start to look at bordetella 's high dna sequence similarity with ralstonia and burkholderia , it would be surprising , actually , if it fell anywhere else in the tree honestly , when i took bacterial ecology in college , many years ago , it was under duress and i hated the experience but now , decades later , i'm starting to like it with tools like those available for free at http genomevolution org and http www phylogeny fr , what 's not to like ?
