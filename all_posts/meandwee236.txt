hi ! just checking in to let you know that we 're nearing the end of our rd day without tv or media ! monday was hard and horrible , but tuesday and today were great ! paige has n't even asked for tv today and she 's been more present , clear , playful and imaginative her eye contact is great and has lengthened and she 's been making up elaborate play schemes even making up different voices for the different characters she plays with she 's been much more chatty in the car and is able to answer my questions and tell me about things we just did score ! i'm much more tired at days' end , but it 's been worth it so far ! we 'll see how the next few days go i 'll be back tomorrow with a funny story from the other night it involves being out to eat at friendlys with paige and chris and the waitress who accidentally dumped all the drinks on me save you might also like the next step paige is sweet monday monday linkwithin
