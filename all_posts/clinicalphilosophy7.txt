psychotherapy is sometimes taught and conducted as an i it relationship between a therapist and a patient 's problems it goes like this patient presents with some problems therapist inquires into the presenting problems , uses history taking , and his or her psychological knowledge , to develop a linking formulation the formulation is applied by the therapist to the patient 's problems by way of explanation of them or by way of a guide to something called an 'intervention' now , if someone did that to me i 'd be furious with them ! there i was , hoping that i would be understood , and all we get is someone offering me a causal explanation of my problems jeez thanks ! what do we really want from therapy ? we want a relationship in which someone will treat us seriously as a person they will be able to call us out on our unwitting bullshit , show us love , show us understanding when we lose perspective , help extricate themselves and us from the unwitting internal and relational habits we fall into , and offer us a few words to help us put ourselves back on a trusting open self possessed footing sure , sometimes they may rely a little on hypothetically handled objective psychological knowledge of human subjects but really what we want is someone who 'knows people' , not someone who 'knows facts and theories , or who develops hypotheses , about people' what is it for someone to 'know people' ? it 's to know how to relate to the patient aptly and spontaneously , to listen and make room for the patient in his sui generic nature rather than project oneself into the patient 's shoes , to oneself be geared up and fortified in the requisite ethical and emotional and humane resources , to be able to receive and not be closed to the patient in his distress someone whose interaction is mediated by knowledge about people is , one imagines , perhaps not someone who really knows people at all ! just imagine if someone were to respond to what i 've written by saying 'well , perhaps that shows that this kind of clinical psychological psychotherapy is not for you ? ' ! 'richard i do n't like it when you punch me in the face ' 'psychologist perhaps being punched in the face is just not for you'
