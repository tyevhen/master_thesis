many of you may think that as a nurse , i did n't have to deliver bad news to patients or families very often , that it would be left to the mds and in an official capacity that may be true i worked on an oncology unit and got to know my patients and their families quite well some relationships lasted for years i cannot tell you the number of times i had a patient ask me if they were going to die , or a family member ask if they should move forward with an intervention for their family member or would it be futile or how long did they have left to live ? there is an official way to answer these questions , a therapeutic , unbiased , or what i call wishy washy manner in which to respond and i did that it was very rare that my answer would be completely straight forward and to the point , because really , does anyone ever know ? so i relied heavily on body language and eye contact to convey my message i know that my opinion was communicated very effectively this way , as was my compassion the staff and families had to wear masks all winter to protect patients against the flu about months of the year , our eyes were all they could see of us why is this relevant to my life right now ? stay with me here today was nathan 's month follow up evaluation with the school system of those months were home visits and for the last months , he has been in the aba program so this was a touch base , how is he progressing conversation thought i had steeled myself , wrong again in some ways nate is progressing quite nicely , more appropriate play , more purposeful use of objects , definitely comprehending more language still way behind in all of these areas , but progressing language though ahhhh language when nathan was initially evaluated , he was months old his language was at an month level today i was told that in these past months he has progressed to a month level sucker punch he is using more and go and a few others , but his case worker agreed with me regarding my recent concern about his use of i good boy he is not saying it because he knows what it means , he is not using words , he has memorized the sound i came to realize this in the past week as i noted him saying it more and more , and repeating it many times in a row , and out of context it 's more jargoning more purposeful jargoning , but jargoning so , i admit it , i did it i asked i said , is this what you would expect , is this normal for a child with these issues ? and i got the blanket response every child is different , some take off , some show no progress at all , yada yada but i saw it in her eyes she is as concerned as i am oh that hurts we got into a discussion about the next steps for nate i asked about several dan doctors and her experiences with them , as they often work together i asked her about the doctor closest to us and again thought i saw that covert communication working through her eye contact asked her about a couple others effusively complimented them then i looked at her , laughed and said , writing down , lynn does not like dr she cracked up and looked down and then said , ya got me just checking that 's what i thought in her eyes we will keep plugging along mr nate we are moving in the right direction , albeit more slowly that i had hoped i do n't trust too many people , but i trust nate 's pediatrician , and i have come to trust lynn his case worker with the school i can see her concern , but she is going to keep on working for you , and so are we
