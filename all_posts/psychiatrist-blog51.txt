first , let me send you to an article in the new york times w h o weighs dropping transgender identity from list of mental disorders there are lines we 've drawn in medicine a fever above a certain degree is not normal and indicates a pathological process a tumor that will spread and debilitate you is not normal and indicates a pathological process to be pervasively sad , uninterested in the things you enjoy , and want to kill yourself is not normal and indicates a pathological process and to hear voices and believe that someone is monitoring you when no voice or stalker or agency is there , is not normal and indicates a pathological process in psychiatry , the line gets blurry at times to be sad , fatigued , and uninterested is normal if you 're grieving and even with that tumor suddenly , as clinkshrink will tell you there is this funny question of whether doctors should remove your tumor or just kill you with physician assisted suicide in some cultures , those voices you hear , or those seizures you have , may not indicate pathology but visitations from god that hold you not as ill , but as superhuman and special you prefer your intimacy with little boys ? in ancient greece , it may have been fine , but in modern america , if you act on it you spend time in prison and get labeled , stigmatized , and restricted as a sex offender for life and homosexuality with a consenting adult who even notices anymore ? unless of course you live in saudi arabia or a variety of other middle eastern countries where they just execute you when i was in training oh , that was a while ago , gender identity disorder was considered rare and pathological even before that , i remember a lecture in my college abnormal psychology class the professor was martin seligman , well known for his book , learned helplessness , and in discussing gender disorders , he mentioned that he traveled a lot and when he woke up disoriented in strange hotel rooms he always knew two things where the bathroom was and that he was a man okay it was his introduction to his lecture on disorder of gender it 's not normal and you 're not supposed to feel like something you 're not i have no idea if dr seligman 's ideas have morphed with the decades in my clinical experience , it seems that gender identity issues came with a slew of distress people with these problems often have other issues as well problems regulating their mood , self injury , and a host of emotional and interpersonal issues are these issues part and parcel of gender identity disorder , or are they the result of societal disapproval ? if we just accept transgenderism is that a word ? it should be as being perfectly normal or at least not pathological would the distress that accompanies it just go away ? can we create a world where people choose their gender , or where they lie along a spectrum of male femaleness , and their parents and society are completely open to the idea that one can choose and this is fine ? at what age would we allow for hormonal treatments ? for irreversible surgeries ? does health insurance pay for these treatments if it 's not a disorder ? i have no answers for this , but i find it fascinating that illness and criminality are things of flux that change in time and with culture funny to grapple with in a world where we make such a big deal out of which bathroom you choose to use
