this is the should list that i wrote down on a sheet of notebook paper in the very midst of my depression in i believe i was trying to go by this list in my life as a christian in order to live well , but it was really killing me the should list i should be a better christian read my bible every day pray every day feel a connection with god have joy in worship not question god not doubt god go to church every week be a missionary live every moment to the best of my ability be making a difference for eternity be happy always be thankful always be a leader trust god through all circumstances talk openly about what god is doing in my life always be trying to be more like christ be helping people be doing something important be strong on my own get excited when others do missions be involved in a bible study have christian friends apply the bible to my life not be jealous of other people not judge other people eat healthy food exercise almost every day have close relationships with my family and friends be in a relationship do everything perfectly want to live not want to die i believed that i should be doing all these things in order to be a good christian somehow i thought that this would make god happier with me and that i would be happier myself and more at peace if i could do all of these things perfectly the problem was that i knew that i could n't do all the shoulds even if other people looked at me and thought that i was doing a good job , i knew in my heart that i was n't doing them and do n't tell , but i did n't even always want to do them therefore , i knew that i was a bad christian i was a fake i was a failure to myself and to god i could not be happy i could not feel peace as a christian , even though i should i knew that the blood of jesus covered my sins , but it took me a long time to realize that jesus' blood had covered even my inability to do the shoulds he knew the true me he knew i could n't do it jesus was saying to me , i 'll do it i have done it all for you on the cross i love you as you are you do n't need to should on yourself when god looks at you , he sees me in my perfection and is satisfied wow , what a relief that was ! god loved even the messy me , the me that was always falling short i could finally be ok with myself because god was ok with me i could be free from all the guilt and shame and striving and just rest in him i no longer had to worry about the shoulds because god was the one who would work in me to make me the beautiful person he wanted me to be he became my peace and rest and the source of a quiet happiness that continues on thank you jesus cindy
