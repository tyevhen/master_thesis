one message i have heard at my recovery meeting lately or that has caught my attention is that you can t think your way out of a problem during the past six months i ve learned a lot about recovery , but knowledge isn t enough applying the method is what really counts as dr low said , understanding alone will not help and has not helped any patient that has developed a long term nervous problem the only thing that will help the patient is training , persistent training this means moving the muscles for example , for a long time i feared that my car s lights headlights or dome light were on , so i would constantly look back after arriving at my destination to reassure myself that my battery was not being drained sure , i could have told myself that feelings are not facts , that anticipation is usually worse than realization , that a dead battery would be a triviality , but all of these tools wouldn t have done any good if i sabotaged my efforts by looking back at the car i needed to apply the method , not just think about it i ve struggled with doing this with insecure thoughts although i continually do things that make me anxious , the nervous feelings have not disappeared , despite my refusal to let anxiety drive my behavior i believe dr low would tell me that i m still associating danger with these activities , and as long as i do that i will continue to feel tense and thus have symptoms so i m still struggling with how to apply the method to decrease insecure thoughts while not trying to think myself out of this problem from what i ve learned about recovery so far , i think the answer is to continue to do the things i fear and hate to do , think of secure thoughts , and challenge myself to apply the method whenever possible and , of course , i should lower my expectations these problems did not develop overnight , and they won t go away that quickly either in fact , i do recognize the small gains and by taking the total view i see just how much my life has indeed improved since joining recovery this is an endorsable moment ! reference low aa manage your anger , manage your fears a psychiatrist speaks glencoe , ill willett publishing co
