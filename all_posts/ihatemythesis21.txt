the deadline for the next portion of my thesis is or was today i made a pretty good effort to meet it that is until one of my friends invited me to a local music festival yes , it s quite irresponsible to go to a music festival the day a paper is due and no , i never would have dreamed of doing such a thing in high school or even college but in an effort to be at least a little responsible , i did set my alarm for a m to finish before the festival i did wake up i did not finish i left my friend at the festival about an hour ago now , i m at the loneliest coffee shop in the world trying to pass the time and get a few lines of my thesis , not my blog written before going to a bar with another one of my friends the coffee man this is an indie place , so he is definitely not a barista has been watching the game with a sigh on his face then , when i wasn t paying attention , he muted it and put on an old stones cd the words , what a drag it is getting old blasted at me , the aging only customer in the shop the abrupt change in music had the effect of seeming like it was part of the game but then it kept going with its creepy minor key and tales of yellow pills , even after the play ended classsic rock is normally annoying in the over played way but tonight , alone in this desolate , hot , sticky coffee shop , it sounds new again and scary perhaps i should have heeded the hand written cash only signs that were never there before and hightailed it to the starbucks across the street instead i pulled out all the cash i had , tossed three ones on the bar and said , what can i get for two dollars ? i wanna tip you one coffee man filled up a mug of black coffee and here i am , alone with my thesis , the game , and the oddly terrifying sounds of mick jagger
