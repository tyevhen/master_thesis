generally speaking , saying yes provides more opportunity and better experiences because you 're doing something you do n't usually do of course the typical difficulty that you and i face , is that sometimes saying yes brings overwhelming fear which means we cannot physically do it , or we may face panic attacks and other struggles but , you can do it ! by saying yes , you will be undertaking exposure which is what many therapists ask you to do to reduce your anxiety for example , by saying yes to catching a bus , you are exposing yourself to the situation and ultimately reducing your anxiety in the long run the more you do it , the less your anxiety until you no longer have it for example , i can now leave the house , catch buses and ask for things with practically no anxiety but , there once was a time when i could n't even walk towards the door do you want to go clubbing ? , travelling ? , do you want to go to a party ? all of these things would provide anxiety for me , but you have to leave it behind as it will by doing these things , you 'd probably have a good time despite your haunting thoughts you have to try and go with your gut feeling and take a change perhaps try and set a goal and say you 'll say yes for a few days see how you feel , even if it may cause anxiety beforehand i guarantee , that the things you 've wanted to do , but have been scared to say yes to , will be fine of course there are priorities , and you may not be in your stage of recovery where you feel comfortable i have to say this was the biggest thing stopping me when my anxiety was quite severe i did n't feel anywhere near ready to be doing the things i am doing now so , it 's totally understandable if you ca n't say yes to everything right now do n't beat yourself up about it , i can totally sympathise and understand that mindset my anxiety still stops me from saying yes to things now , but as time is moving on for me , the more things i am able to say yes to , and i only feel this way because of the stage i am at it does take time to train your brain to battle the doubting thoughts , so try to be patient and keep going ! if you want to read more about this , you can click here for my life vs death post best wishes , amy xx
