i got the time wrong for salsa dancing whoops i swam half a mile this afternoon though i will be late if i go now maybe i am avoiding it i do n't know if i wait and go when i come back from indy in weeks i am more likely to be with the same people while i am learning i do n't know what to do i think i am making excuses i am nervous enough though without walking in late ! i will promise myself that i will go when i get back from indy my psycholgist saidi should not back out of things that i am anxious about doing because the relief of not doing it is a reward to yourself and it just reinforces the patterns i will go three weeks today ! ! ! ! ! i have ants in my flat , i went out this afternoon and got some ant powder , some stuff to stop my hair getting so frizzy and a light bulb for the kitchen i have cleaned the kitchen again today although i did it yesterday as i do n't want anyone to sy it is my fault they have got in as i donot keep the place clean enough my friend and her husband came around and gave me a sofa bed they were going to give it away on freecycle i feel bad about not going salsa dancing ! ! ! o i told my sister i intended to go but i will not tell her i missed it , she will be disapointed that i did not go i am already disapointed with myself
