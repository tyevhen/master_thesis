this post was written in my other blog on december , ugh things just are n't going so great in our journey to conceive a child i'm having another miscarriage right now my second miscarriage and third pregnancy loss all in a row the nurse who is working with me has suggested i see a fertility specialist a reproductive endocrinologist to figure out what might be wrong but , they typically wait until you have or more unexplained miscarriages and i 've only had so , we will try in the future one more time hopefully i wo n't need to see a specialist and it will work out that time but , i will expect the worst and hope for the best i need to remember how lucky i am that i can catch the egg now , i just need it to stay with me more than a few days we knew this one was coming because i was having blood tests every other day to make sure things looked alright we learned right away that we were doomed , so at least it was n't a surprise they tested my thyroid for problems this time around and nothing was out of the ordinary i know it will happen for us one day it 's just a hard journey where each loss feels so traumatic yet is old news to those around you i 'll keep you posted , of course , if any developments happen in that area of my life save you might also like flashback loss number one part two flashback loss number four flashback loss number two linkwithin
