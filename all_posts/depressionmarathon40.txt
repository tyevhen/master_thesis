this is hard those were three of the very few words i was able to utter to my psychiatrist a couple of days ago i saw her first thing in the morning i was slow , and quiet , and tearful i felt so heavy it was difficult to move literally it took maximum effort just to look her in the eyes depression , right now , is very hard yet , despite the heaviness and tears , and despite the lethargy and hopelessness , i somehow showered , got dressed , drove minutes , and went in to work just a few hours after my appointment i'm only allowed to complete overdue paperwork , so i was there just a couple of hours and mostly interacted with a computer , but how did i do that ? i felt like a liar and a fake as if watching myself from across the room , i wondered , who is that woman ? it was strange who was that woman interacting with coworkers , cordially , certainly not effervescently , but still a world away from how i 'd been feeling and functioning otherwise it was strange but necessary there is a time and place for everything , and i do n't think work is the appropriate place to fall apart or weep on shoulders i'm not looking for sympathy but sometimes i'm able to pull off an outward appearance which is so dichotomous to what 's actually going on , it 's quite amazing and i do n't know how i pull it off and is pulling it off a good thing ? i do n't know while i'm glad i was able to work , to defy this illness for a couple of hours , it did n't necessarily feel good it felt strange i felt disconnected from myself i felt like a liar and a fake and it absolutely zapped my precious energy when i left , by the time i got from my building into my vehicle , i was tearful and spent the aftermath of performing above and beyond how i was feeling was exhaustion i collapsed when i got home today my energy continues to be low , my mood lower but i did defy depression again today somehow i actually got out of my house and rode my elliptigo i figured , why not ? with no impact , i was able to strengthen my legs and expand my lungs for the first time in weeks and you know what ? it was hard it was very hard and dammit , i did n't care
