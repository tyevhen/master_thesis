the marathon is alluring , frightening , and dramatic training for and finishing a marathon is exhausting and exhilarating the distance is unique the possibility of finishing a mystery right up to the end perhaps that 's what makes it so alluring it is entirely unpredictable the distance creates the unpredictability no matter how fit you are , no matter how well you 've trained , and no matter how fast you can run , the marathon 's miles will keep you guessing whether it happens at two miles or miles , months , even years , of sweat and sacrifice may go down in flames at any point along the marathon 's lengthy path that is apparently what happened to the usa 's top hope , deena kastor , in the women 's olympic marathon today deena kastor dropped out of the marathon around the k mark after apparently suffering a foot injury she stopped , dropped to a knee , and after rubbing her foot attempted to walk it off , but to no avail i cannot imagine how disappointed and frustrated she must be it seems she 's been looking toward this race since placing rd in athens four years ago after watching her performance at the olympic trials in april , she looked unbeatable i ca n't imagine losing a dream this large in the blink of an eye damn so , so sorry , deena get well soon !
