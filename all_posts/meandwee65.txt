i finally got around to posting of my latest works a fun anniversary greeting card and a new england y landscape painting i did both paintings using gouache both are available in my shop ! i hope you like them as much as i enjoyed making them the landscape painting is of an antique house that was down the street from us where we used to live it had a huge row of lilac bushes in front of it that were quite spectacular in the spring i saw this view when i would walk by on my way to the post office i'm now entrenched in a new nursery decor painting that is filled with detail and i'm so excited with how it 's coming out so far hopefully i can show it soon ! save
