this weekend i got told by my friend and her boyfriend the worst thing to hear at a wedding is 'it 'll be you next' to which i replied no the worst thing to hear at a wedding is 'you need to get yourself a boyfriend' this single girl rant has probably been a long time coming my biggest issue when it comes to everyone else 's interest in my relationship status is why i have to justify my singleton ness to anyone other than myself ? to be blunt , what 's so bad about being single anyway ? i get to watch as much kardashian 's as i like , decorate my flat in all things floral and get to see my girlfriends when ever the hell i like as long as their boyfriends approve , obviously plus i get to fantasise about every guy i come across and wonder if he will be the one who i will fall madly in love with ok , so i try to keep this little bit of crazy just in my head i am , not this left on the shelf nonsense has got to stop i am not exaggerating here , i have heard this phrase on more than one occasion quite recently i suppose i aspire to be fiercely independent , after all i am a result of the girl power generation also , lets not forget i graduated with a st class honours in the study of sex and the city , getting exceptional grades in the importance of friendships over boys i think i have always been influenced by strong , female role models a big role model in my life is my mother , she is most definitely the head of our house hold she holds the purse strings , is very in control and still makes all of the important decisions including mine ! she follows other strong women in our family too her aunt was an uncharacteristically strong women for her time she was the main bread winner in her family unit and ran a workforce of seamstresses during the second world war in london i suppose i have always wanted to be a strong , independent , self sufficient female i love fending for myself , i love answering to no one but myself i love that i am not putting up with a mediocre relationship because i am too scared to be alone but it is important to note i am not exactly a loner i am lucky to have my family around me who really do support me in everything i do am i a feminist ? i'm not too sure but to be honest i bloody hope i am i admit that i do not know enough about feminism to say too much here , but what i believe the officially strapline to be is a women 's right to choice a women 's right to choose to be a stay at home housewife or not , to choose weather to have a family or not and to choose to be in a relationship or not and at the moment my choice is not it has crossed my mind recently if i ever will get married if i do n't get married it would n't be through not meeting a guy who wants to marry me have you read some of our saturday night antics ? ! , but simply through my choice of course i want to get married and have a family but i may not choose that path when it actually comes down to it to put it quite simply i have not yet met the man i deem worthy enough to remove myself from the market for i have been told recently by several people that i am too fussy well , what a lovely position to be in i think my teenage self would love to have been fussy about boys let 's hope i pick well
