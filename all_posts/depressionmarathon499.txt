one week from today , i 'll be toeing the starting line at the twin cities marathon although unseasonably warm weather is predicted for the upcoming week , the extended forecast has highs in the 's for marathon day that would be perfect , especially if it was overcast , too ! for the first time this year , i would n't have weather to worry about that would be a nice change i'm excited , anxious , and ready , i think , for the big day i 've certainly put in the training i should be ready since early july , i 've run five milers i 've done speedwork at paces i did n't think i could hit , and i 've completed long tempo runs which were n't always fun so i did my homework next sunday , we 'll see how well it pays off this is a marathon , after all , and marathons are known for screwing up the best laid plans anything can happen i hope everything falls into place on marathon day my friend , d , is running the chicago marathon the same day d is the old boyfriend we 're still talking about renewing our relationship well , i think we have renewed it , but it is at a much slower , more cautious pace than previously he 's still worried about the depression i'm still worried he 's going to disappear the next time i have a significant episode hence , the abundance of caution it 's good we 're moving along it 's cool that he 's running a marathon the same day , as we 've been able to commiserate during training and i'm really looking forward to talking with him after we 've both crossed our respective finish lines hopefully it will be a good day for both of us seven days and counting i 'll be relieved when the starting gun is finally fired
