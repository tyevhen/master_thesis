it 's a big day today not only is it my nephew 's th birthday , it is also the day , seven years ago , when i took my last drink i am seven years sober today i do n't remember that last drink there was nothing special about it it was not monumental , but thankfully it was my last apparently , i had finally had enough despite the notability of the day , there was nothing monumental about today either it was just another day in fact , i only thought about my sobriety anniversary a couple of times and perhaps that is just the way it should be , for living sober is just the way it is today i no longer struggle with sobriety as long as i keep working my recovery program , hopefully that will continue to be the case seven years ago the case was different getting sober was quite a struggle i do n't take my recovery for granted i know that i am only one unchecked thought and one sip away from my next drunk i know people who try and try but cannot seem to get this gift i know people who have died before the miracle happened , and getting sober is a miracle i do n't know why i got it when others did n't thankfully , i did get it i am very grateful to be sober today seven years wow
