i'm enjoying asking hypothetical questions these days ! okay , here 's a scenario , tell me what you think the shrink should do a patient comes for an evaluation he 's seen a psychiatrist before , but he stopped going because the psychiatrist diagnosed him wrong total idiot , that doc it 's clear this diagnosis is meaningful to the patient , and the meaning is very negative the patient is n't in a place to hear that this is the problem fill in the diagnostic blank however you 'd like the new shrink does a careful evaluation he listens to the symptoms , he listens to the course of illness , he gets info from any outside sources the patient wants him to consult he does n't call the last shrink because the patient does n't want him to the patient does n't want his diagnostic thoughts colored by information from that idiot , and the new shrink is okay with this however , the new psychiatrist , with the data he has , has come to a diagnosis the patient has what the idiot doc said he has if he tells the patient this , the patient will be gone yet another idiot shrink the psychiatrist may be right but what good is that if he ca n't help someone who wo n't come for treatment ? so what should the new psychiatrist tell the patient about his diagnosis ?
