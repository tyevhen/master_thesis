the other day i was going through our photo album pulling out pictures to send to my daughter during the process i started comparing pictures of me twenty years ago with recent ones what a shock ! this is not a vanity issue it was a realization of how the progression of the disease has changed me physically yes , i look in the mirror every morning and , yes , i know what i look like today yes , again , some of the change has to do with the normal aging process however , i never really looked at myself as i did when i had two photos of me side by side face the facial muscles have declined dramatically where i had temples twenty years ago , i now have indentations my mouth and smile were once level now , the mouth droops and the smile looks like a lopsided sneer my face s shape is now linear making me look much thinner than i am my neck can only be described as well pencil neck stands out as a good description hands the change in my hands is also very noticeable the left hand is far worse than the right between the index finger and thumb is a large cavern of skin limbs my arms and legs have lost almost all definition they are now long , thin bones with flesh and very little else hanging on them torso everything just hangs on my chest , stomach and hips i cannot find any muscle definition at all my dress clothes use to be tailored and fit very well today , shirts and pants , whether dress or casual , hang on me the reality of this comparison is that , yes , i have lost muscle mass and tone , but i am amazed at how much of a difference twenty years has made when thinking back on the dutasteride trial results and the loss of strength every year for the placebo group , i multiply x years and wow that is a lot of muscle loss this proves what i have been saying for some time the benefit and curse of kennedy s disease is that it is a slowly progressive disorder , but it never stops progressing
