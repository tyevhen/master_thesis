yesterday night , my mom asked me how i was feeling that day i had been thinking about it earlier , and i shared my realization that i actually had been feeling pretty okay , physically and emotionally and that that felt very weird because i'm so used to feeling like crap most , if not all , the time i remember having this moment that day where i thought , wait do people feel like this all the time ? is that why other people are happy and think depressed people are so weird ? is that why other people think it 's so weird and awful to consider hurting or killing yourself ? in that moment , it became even clearer to me that mental illness is an illness i know so many people doubt it , but now , having had a taste of what it 's like to feel normal , i am even more assured that what i feel the rest of the time is not normal people should n't have to feel hopeless , bleak , weak , and constantly hurt it is n't healthy and it 's a sign that a person is n't in good health there 's no shame in that , and it should be common sense that that person should get help and it is their right to get good quality , thorough , judgment free care
