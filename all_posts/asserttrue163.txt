it 's never too late to learn a foreign language that includes programming languages if you 've never coded before , and you want to get started ? cool good decision you can do this you should do this coding versus programming somehow , a notion has gotten started that coding means either programming in a language like javascript or c or writing html by hand to me , writing markup html by hand is not coding it 's an extremely valuable skill , and you definitely should pick up some raw html ability , but coding , to me , means being able to read , write , and debug scripts or programs some people take coding to mean , also , batch file creation linux shell programming or dos batch files shiver ! this is useful stuff , but not core to programming per se bypass it for now if you 're a beginner scripting versus compiled languages one choice you 'll need to make , up front , is whether you want to develop skills in an interpreted language a scripting language , like javascript , perl , or ruby , or a compiled language like c or java the key intuition here is that with a compiled language , you 'll create standalone programs that you double click to run , whereas with a scripted language , your code runs inside a special environment like a web browser so it depends what your goals are if you want to write a standalone program maybe the next photoshop , software that will process files and write stuff to a hard drive , generally speaking you 're looking at learning a language like c that produces standalone executables for almost everything else , you 're better off learning a scripting language the learning curve is arguably a bit lower for scripting languages what if you 're not sure ? carl cheo has produced an amazing infographic that leads you through the considerations attendant to choosing a programming language carl cheo 's magnificent how to choose a language flowchart click to be overwhelmed but please go to http carlcheo com startcoding to get additional details , including some great curated links to getting started resources really , you need to visit carl 's site i'm serious can i really teach myself programming ? absolutely yes yes yes over the years , i 've met many professional coders who were self taught , without any formal training in fact , one guy i'm thinking of not only never took programming courses in college , he could n't even go to college because of severe agoraphobia that kept him from leaving the house he started working as a pro coder in his teens i'm self taught i started with the c language , in the s , on dos computers pc clones within a couple years i was programming in think c on the mac plus , creating standalone programs as well as plug ins for photoshop , after effects , and acrobat i took a look at java when it first came out , then dropped it , then came back to it a few years later , when applets which everyone was sure would take off died , and java for enterprise which no one , initially , thought would be a big thing took off i picked up javascript somewhere along the line , never figuring it would become the backbone of the web i now consider javascript the most essential of my programming skills the thing you have to realize about programming is that all programming languages do the same sorts of things they all have variables , conditionals , looping constructs , subroutines , etc , and so , at a certain level , it really does n't mattter where you start you can start with c if you 're a sadist like me , or you can start with java , or you can start with ruby or javascript , or you name it you can start anywhere if you 're not sure where to start , start with javascript but is n't programming for genius geeks ? no no no programming is for everyone just like french is for everyone spanish is for everyone russian and hebrew and insert language here are for everyone you 're learning a language , okay ? let 's get that straight that means you should approach learning javascript or java or c or ruby the same way you 'd approach learning any foreign language , with many of the same expectations so for example , you do n't expect to learn russian in a week , right ? you expect that it will take a good long while to pick up even basic fluency that means putting in some time every day or at least every week trying to learn the basics with computer languages , as with any language , you spend about of your time , at first , memorizing basic rules , basic vocabulary , syntax conventions it 's rote , initially just accept that you 'll spend about of your time practicing usage speaking the language , trying it out prepare to feel clumsy , right ? it 's scary at first you 'll spend the remaining of your time learning the culture to learn a language whether it 's german or spanish or c , you have to pick up bits and pieces of the greater cultural context , including history and lore languages do n't exist in a vacuum wax on , wax off in learning any language , there 's a lot of wax on wax off you saw the karate kid , yes ? remember all the motions the kid had to go through to learn karate ? mr miyagi had the kid doing repetitive , menial drudgework like painting his fence , sanding his floor , and waxing his car , for what seemed like forever , and for what seemed like no purpose at all the kid was just about to lose patience and give up on miyagi , when he suddenly has the critical breakthrough he suddenly has the muscle memory , mental discipline , and reflex skills to begin doing karate for real this is what happens also with programming you do a lot of wax on , wax off , feeling like you 're learning a lot of gibberish for nothing , and then suddenly you put the elements together and bang ! it begins to make sense at that point , you realize you 're free to create , not just absorb it 's the same with learning any language you start with rote memorization of vocabulary and syntax rules you acquire a lot of useless junk in your head but once you 've internalized the rules of the language and some vocabulary words you realize you 're now free to construct sentences on your own , not just use and reuse sentences you learned by rote out of a textbook it will take a while to get to that point so be patient but i do n't have patience ! you say i suck massively at patience ! right , well , guess what ? welcome to the club no one has patience ! but this , again , is another reason to immerse yourself in learning to code you 'll learn something about that most difficult of life skills patience the rewards are immense , let me assure you it 's about patience , and payoff the two go together maybe you 've noticed ?
