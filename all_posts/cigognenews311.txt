there is a recent article titled , deep brain stimulation shows promise for patients with chronic treatment resistant anorexia nervosa sounds great but wait you mean they are going to drill holes in the brain ! ? well they say they have to because these people have suffered for years with no help science news , see http esciencenews com articles deep brain stimulation shows promise patients with chronic treatment resistant anorexia nervosa this is a canadian study university of toronto , a lozano , et al please see an article on this in lancet what they are doing is stimulating deep in the brain of the subcallosal , cingulate area why are they doing that ? because they have found structural and functional differences between those afflicted and normals make no mistake these are serious cases with multiple hospitalizations is it any surprise when there are deep imprints that can alter the circuits of the brain that there would be brain deviations ? not sure if they mean that these are genetic differences when you have pain registered deep in the brain there are bound to be alterations in neuronal circuits these circuits are compensating for the input of trauma maybe they should be there ? it would help to know if there were , indeed , early trauma , which is what we have found i treated one severe case of a young girl who lived with her mother and her mother s boyfriend forced her to perform oral sex every morning before school this went on until the mother threw him out but the child continued to vomit all of the time she was diagnosed by another clinic as anorexia nervosa her therapy went on for months before we learned the truth of her condition and that she was trying to get rid of his sperm by vomiting once she relived it the symptom went away this is a reminder to get information , lots of it , before we go drilling into our precious brains the problem is that we often cannot get the information we need verbally because the trauma may not be verbal , and only emerges after reliving other pains early on we need to do a therapy that may possibly unearth the origin of the symptom , slowly over time it may not come up deliberately but only after allowing access to deep brain imprints , those same brain structures that they want to probe and stimulate electrically and by the way , these people were also deeply depressive i had already written several times about the origins of depression , and am preparing a scientific paper on it again we are dealing with deep lying imprints that are not obvious to observers what they are trying to do is re regulate dysfunctional circuits i am not sure those circuits are dysfunctional maybe they are reacting normally to terrible input even while we are being carried in the womb so clearly , it cannot be easily detected by those surgeons carrying mothers ingesting alcohol , drugs or bad diet can begin the affliction of being affected by things the baby cannot eliminate we have seen this in a woman whose mother was a chain smoker during pregnancy she felt she had to get something out of her system she did not know what for a long time smokey rooms made her nauseous and needing to throw up so do we want to do brain drilling on her ? and of course the electrodes were implanted in areas of the brain dealing with emotion feelings not so surprising , they found that this also involved depression after nine months following surgery three of the six subjects had weight gain , and four of them had mood changes with better control over urges to binge and purge and then the doctors say , we are truly ushering in a new era of understanding of the brain and the role it can play in certain neurological disorders i am not sure first of all , it seems they are labeling this a brain disease or a brain malfunction , and just maybe it is not it is a psycho neurologic disease not caused by the brain but reacted to by the brain if you will , it is a primal disease with key imprints that change the brain s function and it happens so early that it is largely undetectable what they claim to do is by correcting the precise circuits in the brain associated with the symptoms in some of these conditions , we are finding additional options to treat illnesses it may be that they have it backwards yes , there are symptoms that are associated with these conditions but it all may stem from something epigenetic , and it is to there that we must look it is true that eating disorders must be treated because there is a high death rate involved if allowed to go on , but there is another way to treat it the problem is that with the success they have had , the doctors want to go on treating some many other maladies with brain surgery therein lies the rub , as shakespeare noted
