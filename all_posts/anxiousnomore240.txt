photo by cahrleskames the last few days i have been so busy that i haven t had time to write last night i was trying to think of what i should blog about and couldn t think of any ah ha ! moments that i have had recently or any major struggles that i haven t already blogged about sure i have had a few instances where i was anxious but they never elevated to anything past a so i started to think about how nice it is to have these few days of solitude , where even though work is getting busier and more stressful , my mind and body are cooperating with me so i am counting my blessings for the time being last night i was reading from the book of mormon and i read this now when our hearts were depressed , and we were about to turn back , behold , the lord comforted us , and said go amongst thy brethren and bear with patience thine afflictions , and i will give unto you success alma it struck me how important that direction was for me in my life sometimes it can be so frustrating and exhausting to constantly be worrying or thinking about anxiety and i just want to give up and say , well i tried i guess this is my lot in life and i should just accept my fate or i struggle with when when will i get over this ? when will i not be afraid ? when can i be considered cured ? but if there is any lesson to be learned in all of this it is patience and if i can be patient with my struggles and hurdles , eventually heavenly father will give me the success that i so desperately want in my life he knows better than i do my needs and he will see that i learn whatever it is i need to learn along the way because i am in a good state of mind lately it s easy to say to myself just be patient i m sure if this was a bad day i wouldn t appreciate the response to my when questions very much so i am thankful for the timing of this lesson and i hope that when things aren t so easy that i can recall this blog and maybe it will give me some strength to keep fighting , keep learning , and keep trying never give up you might also like dealing with unexpected anxiety setbacks you never know what others are struggling with tips for starting an anxiety reducing exercise program i'm being followed by a moon crater ! linkwithin
