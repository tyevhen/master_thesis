many months ago , psychiatrist extraordinairre drew ramsey , md of columbia university asked if i would be part of a group to present information in a workshop format at the american psychiatric association annual meeting in san francisco he submitted an abstract , rounded up a reputable mentor on the scientific advisory board and collected not only myself but also mala nimalasuriya , ms and roger mcintyre , md to present leagues spotlight i must admit i 've been a very bad academic up until this point i keep the tip of my little finger in the academic world by teaching the clinical section of the introduction to psychiatry course at harvard medical school and have given a few grand rounds and other cme talks around town , but i have n't published or done any research besides serving as a psychiatrist for a project in the first couple years after residency so for me , the opportunity to present at the largest annual meeting of psychiatrists in the world seemed , well , amazing i do try for the blog to be honest and based on common sense and evidence and practicality , but at the end of the day , it is just a blog , and there are probably , new blogs on the internet every single day writing articles for the blog entertains me , helps me to learn , and is a lot more fun than toning it down for the interminable language of scientific papers , which tend to be interesting yet hideous unless written by the best such as gabbard or rook i do admire those who do publish , like dr mcintyre , whose resume is about times as long as mine but i never look a gift horse in the mouth , and if they wanted me to present at the apa , i would help deliver drew began the presentation with a brief overview of some important brain nutrients and the concept of whole foods versus the ubiquitous bastardization of wholesome living food we call processed food drew 's example i went to the store to buy some ham , and it was advertised as 'gluten free ' when did gluten get into my ham ? he also reviewed some of the dietary pattern studies and elimination diet studies i 've mentioned on my blog from time to time drew is both an expert at the various nutrients in whole foods , but also anti nutritionism , highlighting the importance of combinations of nutrients and their availability in whole foods that is quite different from the stripped down nutrients replenished with salt , industrial fats , and synthetic vitamins so prevalent in processed foods drew is the author of the happiness diet and the upcoming shades of kale he did indeed order the kale salad at the split bread in san francisco i'm going to review the happiness diet soon , once i get a minute maya continued the talk with information from her master 's thesis on nutrition , the brain , and brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf bdnf is brain fertilizer that helps with neurogenesis and repair , and good nutrition is associated with goodly amounts of bdnf roger followed up with his vast body of work on obesity and mood disorders , noting the effects of weight loss , obesity , and active mood disorders on particular inflammatory cytokines he highlights the point that the success i see with some of my folks on a paleo style diet may be a result from an anti inflammatory state that comes along with weight loss rather than from any particular diet per se i was the closer for the presentation with a very brief overview of the evolutionary medicine hypothesis , its pluses and pitfalls , the commonalities of a paleo style diet and some evidence including the evidence on fructose malabsoprtion linking modern diets to poor mental health i gave a few case studies and my clinical pearls for helping introduce a whole foods diet to people as part of a holistic model for health care in addition to more traditional therapies i also discussed the theoretical applications of ketogenic diets in psychiatric disorders , the available evidence almost nil all pilot trials or case studies , and advised folks to keep an eye out for more research we had a number of questions and interest in the ideas of celiac disease masking as major mental illness , coconut and mct oil , tofu and the poor performance of so called modern diets in the dietary pattern studies and depression , and interesting tracks for research and some practical questions about implementing recommendations at the end we were approached by a number of psychiatrists wanting more information did i mention our room was completely packed with people sitting in the front and aisles and lined up out the door ? all in all , a great success the remainder of the apa was , as always , interesting , psychiatrists and the launch of the dsmv meant a continuous scientology protest outside , plus a number of men with bushy eyebrows and bow ties i attended a number of lectures , the most notable being a hour seminar on giving better lectures the apa attracts psychiatrists from all over the world , and i would estimate the number of international attendees at in the lectures i attended i happen to be friends with the son of a former president of the apa , and as such was able to finagle my way into the apa presidential reception at the palace hotel , which was great fun my friend 's father and his wife very kindly introduced me to everyone , and i ca n't express my appreciation enough it was also great to hang out with drew ramsey food minded and sensible psychiatrists are always a pleasure to talk to , crossing fingers we 'll be invited to the next apa , and i'm going to get his shades of kale to help me cope with the mountains of kale i get from my csa , which starts up next week
