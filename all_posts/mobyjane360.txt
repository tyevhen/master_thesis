there s a lot of misinformation still circulating from the s new age love yourself mandates and psychiatry s how are you feeling emphasis that , unfortunately , is making it more difficult to roust ourselves up out of our depression because we have been encouraged to self focus those very institutions of marriage and family that should be our help and support and keep us out of depression and loneliness are not significantly nourishing for us because we have focusing on ourselves instead of investing ourselves we have been looking at marriage and family to discover what we want to get out of them rather than what we want to put into them the misguided self esteem precept that we need to love ourselves first before we can do anything worthwhile probably devolved from the simple reality that what we really love about anything person , place , or thing is our own investment in them our own investment in something is what colors our warmer perception of it that s what sparks up our neurons our own thinking and action people wrongly believe that our interest in something comes first and then we make an investment nope ! our neurons don t start to really sparkle at any great depth until after we get busy one reason why so many marriages and families are falling apart is that we don t understand this if we want to love something or someone , if we want to feel bonded and connected , we need to start making an investment of our time and energy in them that s what bonding is that s why love is a verb we don t really love another person what we love is our interest in the other person as we expand our investment in them , we expand our interest in them , and we expand our love for them i caution people about paying their children an allowance for work they do around the house no , i caution children need to make an investment in their own family they need chores and responsibilities that s how they feel connected and bonded and part of their investment in the family not your investment in them of course your investment in them comes first , but then you should be teaching them how to invest themselves an allowance is for the purpose of teaching them money management we need to invest in someone or something before we can love love is our decision to invest ourselves in some specific other person by making them special to us we make people special to us by doing nice things for them by finding nice things about them to notice and to think about by politely averting our eyes during their ugly moments we all have them by showing forbearance for their grievous flaws we all have them and by putting their interests ahead of our own , whether we feel like it or not if we are not able to put someone s interests ahead of our own , the point is not that we do not love them the point is that if we do not put someone s interests ahead of our own , we cannot love them because we will not be able to develop , thereby , the neural capacity to love them the opposite is also true if we find we have developed an unchosen romantic interest because we have autonomically mind wandered into making an investment in the other woman , or the other man as the case may be , we can refuse to think thoughts about the person or situation we simply choose other thoughts , direct our energy elsewhere , and before long we will find that as our investment has lessened , the associated neural activity fades and our interest cools today 's children are suffering more and more from alienation and loneleness they need encouragement from the time they are or years old to invest themselves in their own families so that their families exist as more than just another free handout for which they feel they owe no debt or respect and to which they exhibit no gratitude by the time they are teenagers they should have some sense of family identity and connection and bondedness that they have important family duties they should have a good feeling that the family counts on them , and in putting in some hard work themselves , they will have more of a respect for the hard work their parents do on their behalf a b curtiss
