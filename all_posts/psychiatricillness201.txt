today has been a bit better , i had a good productive day at work everyone was very impressed with my tidy desk o i went through my old weight watchers book to get some meal ideas as i have not been eating well i also went shopping to get some healthy food i had a cod fillet , sweet corn and boiled new potatoes for dinner it is probably the first square meal i have had in two weeks and i really enjoyed it i am going to the psychiatrists on tuesday , i am going to discuss having some more cbt sessions i have been taken omega fish oil tablets yesterday and today maybe they will give me a boost ? i need to get an organiser thing with days of the week on for my tablets tonight i can not remeber if i took them earlier or not i have taken them again as i know i am not on maximum doses if i have taken too much i will just be really drowsy i feel like i have lost my grip a bit over the past few weeks i am going to try sorting myself out again ! ! ! this cycle of loosing my grip , getting very low , making changes , things start picking up , very content , relax a bit , loose my grip , get very low this is all very tiresome big yawn ! ! !
