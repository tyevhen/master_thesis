a new study concluded that the combination of sertraline zoloft and cognitive behavioral therapy cbt worked better than either treatment alone for children with anxiety disorders there was even a nonsignificant trend for zoloft to outperform cbt , which was quite surprising to me but that 's not really the point of this post the study can be read at the new england journal of medicine website i 'd like to commend the researchers on doing something that is exceedingly rare in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy trials they gave a detailed report of adverse events and we find that a greater percentage of kids showed suicidal ideation on cbt it was not a statistically significant difference , but it was nonetheless surprising zoloft , however , was related to significantly more disinhibition , irritability , restlessness , and poor concentration than cbt this may have been a fluke , but two participants on zoloft had homicidal ideation compared to none on cbt i have bitched several times about missing mysterious data on adverse events in psychiatric drug trials , and some have also complained that psychotherapy trials do a poor job of tabulating adverse event data again , kudos to the study authors for reporting adverse events imagine if reporting safety data in such a manner was commonly practiced source j t walkup , a m albano , j piacentini , b birmaher , s n compton , j t sherrill , g s ginsburg , m a rynn , j mccracken , b waslick , s iyengar , j s march , p c kendall cognitive behavioral therapy , sertraline , or a combination in childhood anxiety new england journal of medicine doi nejmoa
