i learned something new this morning the speedo goggles keeping the saltwater pool at bay worked just as effectively holding my salty tears inside their silicon gaskets guess what ? salt stings internally released or externally exposed , salt stings my eyes it 's hard to cry with goggles on it 's been another hours of my slow motion rollercoaster ride i hate when it gets like this this is when my brain feels other than my own , and sometimes my thoughts race or randomly skip about this is when senseless tears well at the back of my throat and sometimes surface in my eyes , but more often they stop and stalk , as if waiting for a moment only they know will never arrive this is when i can feel my heart heavy in my chest an added burden to lumber around this is when my legs get stiff , my shoulders sore , and my will weak this is when i can neither sleep enough nor wake up enough this makes me question my character , my motivation , my will , my fight this steals my sunshine and gratitude , replaces patience with irritability , and batters my worthiness to share anyone 's life this is depression it can be cyclical , or not predictable , or not stable , or not subtle , or not physically painful , or not psychotic , or not responsive to treatment , or not my depression has , at one time or another , been all of those things , some of those things , and none of those things ! i am back on my slow motion rollercoaster , but no matter how many times i repeat the ride , it seems the track my ride takes never repeats why ? this is me , today , on this ride , feeling this desperation , yet appearing exactly as i do on any other normal day as long as i do n't remove my goggles
