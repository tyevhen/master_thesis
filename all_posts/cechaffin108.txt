i ca n't make sense of readers' statistics posts i think interesting are often poorly attended , and others garner large numbers my best of has been a success , i expect because many are searching the web for help with their mood disorders then wednesday i posted a couple of poems and the meter went up again here 's what my blog says about itself ongoing personal narrative by c e chaffin m d , faafp , editor of the melic review widely published as a poet , critic and essayist , he began this blog as therapy but fears it has a larger audience than his other works as an unapologetic manic depressive bipolar , he also hopes his adventures in mood fluctuation may be of some benefit to others so afflicted the blurb implies poetry but does not outright state it my general audience divides into those interested in mood disorders and those in poetry that of name poets suffer manic depression blurs the borders between the two here 's a short list christopher marlowe , john clare , william blake , samuel coleridge , byron , keats , shelley , tennyson , hopkins , crane , plath , randall jarrell , robert lowell , theodore roethke , and john berryman the list is much more extensive , these are just from the top of my head but i have written a poem about this phenomenon for example i do not recommend geniuses as models coleridge the laudanum king , sylvia born too late for auschwitz , roethke the manic ballerina with the body of a bear , hart crane reciting to the cod , ernest sucking on a steel cigar , ginsberg hysterical naked procuring boys or pound blaming everything on the jews emily died a virgin without taking orders , sexton became the jesus of the housewives then killed herself to fill the hollow i do n't mean to devalue the drunkenness of berryman and bukowski or forget that dylan thomas drank himself to death because he found it easier than poetry no one wants to hear about a healthy genius , because the world needs to believe the great must suffer greatly , as if only icarus flew above those jealous eyes and daedelus never landed published in interface also in my new book i think the chief gift of a mood disorder for poets is loose associations , even dissociation , a certain liberty of the mind that issues in unseen connections between what we observe and experience it 's as if the normal mental filters that feed rational thought have been suspended for creative purposes you ca n't just grind a poem out by thinking about it it must be born , thrive , grow , and finally achieve adulthood the point at which further revision is pointless thus the dissociative tendencies issue later in applied craft , and voila ! a poem and what drives people to write poetry more often than not ? grief and loss the poetry of joy is neglected by comparison non poets attempt poetry because of love as well in other words , what drives folks to attempt poetry at all is deep feelings that some are better than others in expressing such feelings should come as no surprise that is merely the gift of language , and many can write passably what distinguishes a poet is the knack of saying something in a memorable way one of the best compliments i 've received as a poet is the statment , i felt like that but i could never have said it so well bingo ! what poets are supposed to do raw feeling expressed is not poetry wordsworth called poetry emotion recollected in tranquilty , but that does n't entirely wash sometimes poems are written in the grip of emotion and survive to excellence , but only because the poet was well exercised in his craft furthermore , to say something fresh requires a knowledge of what poetry went before , else cliche' will inevitably raise its hoary head in severe depression it 's difficult to write poetry at all , much less poetry that lasts , because the last chapter of despair is numbness the inability to feel at all , at least feel in proportion to circumstance , as the feedback loop of depression goes on autopilot and the whole personality is dominated by the disease here 's an attempt that was born from a depression , also in my new book for the record i am myself , even in the dark without mirrors or clues i may be as inconsequential as the point of a fading penlight but i am not this feeling of being buried alive if i fall through the ice i am not my hypothermia i am not my heart 's vacuum 's cruel absence of presence there are times this seems specious , as if i were a jesuit preaching in a sewer , hoping echoes could convince me but all i have is this distinction i hold it in a cup like christ 's blood as i fall through infinite separations i am still here i write this for the record to write during mania or hypomania is much easier , the words simply flow like water , good words , lots of them but mania may impair editing activity afterwards , as one becomes so enamored of one 's voice that it 's too much labor to take months to perfect the initial outburst i hope i have not turned off my audience by too much promoting my book thine at kilobunny , ce
