browser usage data from q to q , for visitors of this blog i was somewhat surprised as many people were to learn , earlier this month , that in terms of market share , google 's chrome browser has recently surpassed firefox in overall adoption i should n't have been surprised at all if i had taken the time to look carefully at my own blog 's analytics , i would 've seen this very result nine months ago readers of my blog tend to be developers , techies , and early adopters , and so internet explorer usage has never been high for people who visit this blog , whereas firefox usage has always been high in q of , for example trends like chrome overtaking firefox tend to show up early in my analytics my readers are trendsetters i completely did n't see the firefox death spiral coming , however i decided , finally , to sit down and sift through my analytics to find out exactly how browser usage has varied over time for visitors to this blog in the graph above , i 've plotted browser statistics quarter by quarter for the quarters going back to q the earliest date for which analytics were available note that data for the most recent quarter run only to mid december obviously for the total data set going back to q , we 're talking slightly more than half a million total visits the vertical scale tops out at percent firefox in blue starts at percent and ends , most recently , at percent chrome starts at percent and finishes at an impressive percent the curves crossed , for visitors to this blog , around nine months ago in early what can i say ? i do n't think these sorts of trends bode well for firefox in fact i think the future is looking pretty bad for firefox for a variety of reasons , and there 's probably not time to reinvent the product at this point in the meantime , if you work for a software or other company that currently supports firefox but not chrome , you 've got your priorities backwards ! get to work supporting chrome , asap , lest the market leave you behind
