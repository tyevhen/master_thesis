i last wrote here before work on monday now i'm in the midst of my morning routine , and it 's friday it 's been a really long week i have n't had the motivation or the words to write since monday my mood continues to challenge me to the fullest i'm not sure how i 've survived i did my best to travel the path god laid before me i made it to work i went to my meetings i met with and worked with my sponsee i took puck for his walks i even made it to the pool once for a swim but my mood did not respond despite participating in life to the best of my ability , my mood continues to be very dark there have been a lot of tears , a lot of hours lying motionless on the sofa , and a lot of moments of sheer , isolative misery it 's been tough i 've tried to combat the darkness by communicating with my treatment team yesterday i met with my social worker and doctor my doc increased one of my meds we all hope that will do the trick if not , i'm not sure what options lie ahead in the meantime , i need to work hard to keep myself safe and moving forward , i guess but honestly , that 's getting more and more difficult to do i'm praying for a reprieve
