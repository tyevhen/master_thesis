i have a driving urge to write , but i have no clue about what ! it 's a sunny , beautiful day outside , and as soon as someone either stumbles out of bed not to mention any names or arrives home from running some errands , i will drag them outside for a walk with my camera , this time ! but until then , i'm left with a mind full of clamouring thoughts and emotions and ideas and dreams one thing i 've been thinking about is community it 's something that 's been on my mind for a while now when i was young , we were involved in the local homeschooling community i made a couple friends , but i found relatively few people to connect with in the largely conservative christian , school at home group there were plenty of nice people , just not my people despite that , i enjoyed the company of the friends i had , and never really felt much of a lack then i reached my teens and most of the homeschoolers i knew , as they also reached their teens , headed to school , and we lost contact teen years can also be turbulent , especially in a society that is so unfriendly to teens , and i definitely felt that i became as much of a hermit as my family would let me be for a couple years i do n't remember much about my early teens , or where i was in my mind , to be honest , either good or bad when i was , my mother , trying to find some group activity where i could meet others my age my very social , extroverted , and outgoing sister made friends wherever she went , and so never really caused worry in that area for my parents ! , my mother came across the air cadets a department of defence funded youth program , based on military structure a big draw was that it was entirely free ! hey , why not , i thought so my sister and i both joined when i tell people now , in all my anarchist hippieness , that i was in cadets for three years , they look at me in shock ! to be honest , i find it rather surprising myself , at this point ! p but i learned a lot in those three years , and not any of it stuff you 'll find in brochures advertising the program there was so much bullying , so much dishonesty and bullshitting , so much sucking up to officers in charge , and treating lower ranked cadets like dirt it was stressful most of the time , fun occasionally i learned just how things shouldn't be ! just how people should n't interact it helped shape and solidify my opinions , so that when i finally decided i 'd had enough when i was and left , i was searching searching for the things i thought were right , the ways i thought people should live and be it was shortly after i left that i embraced unschooling , and started seriously looking into anarchy it still amazes me i lasted that long in cadets , and though it seems strange and rather silly to say , that time , though i do n't regret it , did hurt me in some ways i learned what it was like to be treated as lesser , to be made to feel shame for making mistakes , to function within a rigid structure of rules , to be constantly judged i actually did make one or two friends there , one of which is still a very good friend , who left cadets not long after i did , and is now a happy green party supporting pagan dude but i was left in pretty much the same place without a real community , and only a couple of friends i started my blog about that time , and started meeting unschoolers online in the nearly two years since then , i 've found a huge community online , one that is supportive and truly amazing seriously i love you guys ! i 've also made friends in person from across north america , really awesome people whom i want to get to know better , and whom i really wish lived closer i 've learned , unlike what i thought in my early to mid teens , that i'm not unlikeable , and there are plenty of people out there whom i get along with wonderfully but i'm still left , here where i live , with virtually no community a couple friends are about it so in recent times , i 've been trying to change that i 've been organizing unschooling meetings , getting to meet a bunch of lovely unschooling mamas , and even a few teens ! but i feel like that 's only a part of what i want , and maybe even need i 've sometimes seen people be accused of spending time only with those who share the same opinions and live the same ways , and sometimes i wonder if that 's what i'm trying to do , but i really do n't think it is what i care about is finding people who do n't judge me negatively for thinking and feeling and living the way i do people who will support my decisions and life choices and at least some people who understand and live the same or similar choices , because sometimes you just need someone who really gets it in my experience , the people most likely to do just that are unschoolers , anarchists , pagans , or anyone really who has chosen to make their own decisions , live their own lives , to not be part of the mainstream , at least on some levels i want people who get unschooling , but i also want people who share my other views a bunch of different people people who can talk about anti civ stuff with me , people who can talk about peaceful child raising , and about consensual living people who are into freedom , and animal rights , and truly sustainable living not just all this green crap i feel a real ache , a true lack of good , regular , in person contact with people who get me , and people who i get in return ! the unschooling group is a very good start now i just need to figure out the rest of it but right now , it 's beautifully sunny , and there are roads to walk and trees to hug and wind to listen to and buds to gently ever so gently touch , and pictures to take any more heavy thinking can wait for a while peace , idzie you might also like against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! the frustration of being that unschooled person life happening linkwithin
