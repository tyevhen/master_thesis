i ran out of sjw a few days ago and haven t noticed a thing but then i ve been really busy sometimes it seems that if i just keep active then i don t have the time to dwell on depressing thoughts i m behind with work but that pretty typical for me in fact i shouldn t be writing this right now i have way too much paid writing that i need to do but i m very distracted right now two reasons i recently noticed a gig for which i m particularly qualified its main draw is that it is quite different from most of the work i do all day so it will be a break from my normal routine that and another job means more money and i always need that so i contacted them yesterday and i can t focus on anything because i keep checking my inbox this is unusual i work for so many people and am always signing up for more work so this process is really rather routine i m not sure why this job is sitting larger in my mind than most i have to get my pictures made tomorrow i m sure it comes as no surprise that i hate looking at myself i don t think i m an attractive person and i ve gained a lot of weight add that to a big steaming pile of social anxiety and you get a lot of second guessing and self loathing i have to get the pictures made because i m at the point in my career that i need a site about me ugh ! my writing is all over the internet and i m starting to lecture i need a spot where everything is drawn together so editors and event organizers can see the whole package so i m not getting any work done because these things are keeping me anxious and distracted but at least i don t have time to for depression i can feel it waiting in the wings , though no doubt as soon as things slow back down it will come swooping in ok , i m off to order more sjw
