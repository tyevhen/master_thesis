in an italian neurophysiologist in parma was doing brain research using macaque monkeys they were specifically researching an area of the brain called f , located in the premotor cortex area f contains millions of neurons that specialize in coding for one specific motor behaviour actions of the hand , including grasping , holding , tearing and , most important , bringing objects food to the mouth as iacoboni explains for every macaque these actions are as basic and essential as they come we homo sapiens are grasping and manipulating objects from the moment we fumble for the snooze button in the morning until we adjust our pillows at bedtime all in all , we perform hundreds , if not thousands , of grasping actions every day that it why the rizzolati team chose area f for close investigation one day the neurophysiologist vittorio gallese was moving around the lab during a lull a monkey was sitting quietly in the chair suddenly as vittorio reached for something , he heard a burst of activity from the computer that was connected to the electrodes surgically implanted in the monkey s brain to an experienced neurophysiologist , this signalled a discharge from the pertinent cells in area f vittorio immediately thought that this was strange as the monkey was sitting quietly not grasping anything , yet the neurons affiliated with the grasping action had fired nevertheless through many other painstaking experiments , the neurophysiologist came to the discovery that , within the f motor area , there are dedicated neurons about that fire not when one performs an action but when one watches someone else performing an action e g grasping , bringing objects usually food to the mouth , kicking a ball , playing tennis , etc they even fire when one simply hears a word such as kick mirror neurons imitating a grasping action fire even when the object grasped is hidden from view behind a screen , but not if the monkey knows that there is no object crucially , mirror neurons are involved in predicting the meaning of a certain action this is essential in communicating and relating to others iacoboni says the action recognition process implemented by the mirror neurons is some sort of simulation or internal imitation of the observed action given that our own actions are almost invariably associated with specific intentions , the activation in my brain of the same neurons i use to perform my own actions may also allow me to understand the intentions of other people for example , if i watch someone grasping a cup soon after having an argument with that person , thanks to the mirror neurons , i know whether he or she is grasping the cup to get a drink or whether they are about to throw the cup at me quiet simply , mirror neurons differentiate between the same action associated with different intentions after years of experiments by many different neurophysiologists , mirror neurons are now thought to be involved in much more than imitating motor actions in one s brain when watching someone else performing a motor action they are now thought to be involved in emotional bonding , empathy and language it is now thought that mirror neurons play a role in empathy , the capacity to feel other people s emotions the brain area connecting mirror neurons to the limbic system responsible for our emotions is the insula in other words , we feel and understand the emotions of other people thanks to our own mirror neurons which are activated by the sight of someone s smiling , frowning , crying , etc thus , our mirror neurons fire when we see others expressing their emotions , as if we were making those facial expressions ourselves by means of this firing , the neurons also send signals to emotional brain centres in the limbic system to make us feel what other people feel essential to this empathy based on mirror neurons are other people s facial expressions that trigger the firing of our mirror neurons to james of the james lange theory of emotions , this phenomenon means that our mental life is knit up with our corporeal frame , in the strictest sense of the term incidentally , that is the connection between emotions and the po in chinese medicine mirror neurons also play a role in the development of a sense of self social context is critical in developing a sense of self isolation seems to inhibit the ability to develop a sense of self rich social context facilitates it the presence of others , the continuous relations and interactions one must have with others facilitates the development of our sense of self mirror neurons fire when we observe actions and when we perform those same actions there is a strong link between social environment and a sense of self and this link is at least partly due to mirror neurons there is now a mirror neuron hypothesis in relation to autism in autism there is an imitation deficit , i e the child is unable to translate from the perspective of another individual to one s own perspective it is now believed that the key neural deficit in autism is a dysfunction of mirror neurons as iacoboni says , a deeply felt mirroring that moves people closer to each other and makes emotional connectedness possible seems to be the main deficit of patients with autism what has all this to do with chinese medicine and , in particular , with shen and hun ? i think there are interesting connections between the role of shen and hun and mirror neurons shen and hun together are responsible for emotional empathy and relating to others consider the chinese ideogram for shen the right side of the ideogram is very interesting it is pronounced shen and it means to express , to explain , to stretch , to extend the last two meanings , to stretch and to extend , are crucial to an understanding of what the shen does it is responsible for extending towards others , for connecting with others , for emotional connection and empathy in other words , for the function of the mirror neurons however , the shen cannot perform that function alone it relies on the help of the hun and that is why ancient books say that shen and hun are related work in unison they are both yang in nature , as opposed to the relation between po and jing both yin in nature how does the hun help the shen ? the hun is responsible for a different type of consciousness than that of the shen it is responsible for intuition , planning , life dreams , ideas , inspiration and , incidentally , also artistic inspiration how does the hun perform these functions ? through its movement the hun is always moving in the sense of searching , exploring ideas , nurturing life dreams , etc without the input of the hun the shen would be an inert consciousness the input of the hun is therefore essential for the shen to perform its function of relating and connectedness with others again , this is the chinese medicine equivalent of the function of mirror neurons the movement of the hun has to be just right , not too much , not too little if the movement of the hun is deficient , the person may become depressed if the movement of the hun is excessive , the person may be slightly manic i relate autism in children to a deficient movement of the hun that leads to an impaired function of the shen in relating to others as we have seen , this has been related to a dysfunction of mirror neurons conversely , i relate hyperactivity in children to an excessive movement of the hun and , interestingly , hyperactive children are often artistic which is a function of the hun how does one stimulate the movement of the hun ? i use the gall bladder channel and especially gb qiuxu to restrain the movement of the hun , i use liv taichong other points that regulate the shen and hun and du shenting and gb benshen iacoboni m , mirroring people , picador , new york , , p ibid , p ibid , p calhoun c , solomon r , what is an emotion ? , oxford university press , , p iacoboni , mirroring
