this evening i prevented scurvy the old fashioned way hand squeezing lemonade it did n't seem ridiculous when i was doing it , but i guess it is and it did n't even turn out that good so here 's a little wake up call for all the annoying people who perpetuate that used up slogan life better give you more than lemon , cause one measly lemon does n't make much of anything except lots and lots of seeds lemonade needs so much sugar to make it palatable that you could substitute lemon juice with water and not only save lots of time but also make it healthier maybe procrastinators would be well served in investing in one of those juice squeezer things
