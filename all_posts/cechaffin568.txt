on the anthropic principle here at the spoke ends of our galaxy it is easy to forget the central axle moving insensibly slow , still the silvery white dispersion of stars soothes randomly until we impose a pattern , like the magi , like the greeks and despite the most accurate of calendars , dawn remains a wager until the great lion of the sun peers over the plains with a growl of heat and the day blooms and withers toward the violet hour where even wise men arrive as strangers because the arrangement is never the same as the latest layer of bones , can we ever appreciate how far the swan s neck stretched to uphold its head , how far the spider s strand thinned without snapping ? can we recall the dark alternatives dodged , any of which could have unmade us ? always there were detours where the river never creased the rock that never rose from the sea that never spawned a single fossil when light illumines the grand canyon in winter s slant at sundown , the stripes of ages burn with every visible color what is the color of a radio wave ? only a man asks that i had to used dashes because i could n't figure out how to html the spacing published in poetry now i m proud of today s poem in that my ambition in poetry has always been to combine philosophy with music , substance with form , and i thought this one turned out pretty well that i can say this may indicate my depression is not as severe if so i can only credit the addition of an antipsychotic drug two days ago in addition i m taking two mood stabilizers and two classes of antidepressants since this combination has not failed to eventually lift me out of the doldrums , and i say doldrums ironically , since the word sounds so harmless and normal it s not doldrums , it s a maelstrom what the antipsychotic seems to do , besides increase my appetite , cause weight gain , and other fun side effects , is to dull the inner fear , the apprehension that constantly accompanies depression i wanted to mention another symptom of depression , which you likely won t find in the textbooks i call it dysynchrony here s what it s like i go to make coffee i have trouble remembering how to do it , and anxiety pushes me forward in time or keeps me behind , so the feeling is that there is an ideal time , a synchronous time in which i might make coffee smoothly , but i can t drop into that stream of time instead i fall behind or clumsily speed ahead i m spooning coffee into the filter , for instance , but i spill because i m thinking of putting the water in then the grounds that fell out into the plastic cone have to be washed out , and i shudder at the extra task , fearing the detour will ruin my chances at making coffee it s as if the linear progression of a nearly automatic task has been fragmented into pieces , and i m trying to put them together in a row but they keep moving about when i finally succeed in making the coffee , it seems like a miracle and i wonder how i did it the worst experience of this , which i think i already mentioned in this blog , was when i was hospitalized for depression in i was trying to figure out how to tie my boots i stared and stared at the eyelets , i didn t know where to begin , or how to pull the laces diagonally across the tongue i thought i would never figure it out , that i might never wear shoes again or that i might have to go barefoot about the hospital i was too paralyzed to ask for help , but i finally managed it myself that depression , incidentally , lasted eleven months , and necessitated my going on disability since i have not had to work as a doctor i haven t been hospitalized again but i ve also become more skillful in managing my meds i don t want today s memo to sound too hopeful as i re read it , it sounds much too positive for my present state i m far from being out of the woods all for today , ce
