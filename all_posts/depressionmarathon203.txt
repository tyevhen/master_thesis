i'm home i actually left the hospital on wednesday , days ago , but i 've been struggling to do much of anything , including updating this blog , since arriving home i expected a dip in my mood when i left the hospital that 's pretty normal coming home is almost always a little overwhelming but the dip has turned into a deep ditch , and i'm lying at the bottom drowning in the muck and mud it 's impossible to breathe amidst the muck and mud my mood is low again despite continuing with outpatient ect treatments , i have not been able to maintain that initial bump to my mood i am now at a crossroad i need to do something to elevate my mood , which means i need to make a decision either to continue with additional short pulsed , unilateral ect which is what i 've been doing , or to change to the more cognitively impairing regular , bilateral ect something has to change there 's really little choice i cannot fathom putting myself through regular , bilateral ect again the last time we tried it , it did not elevate my mood , and i suffered such severe cognitive impairment i could barely follow a conversation i ca n't go there again that means i will try additional short pulsed , unilateral ect treatments , which means further delay in getting back to my life i was supposed to be done with my ect treatments as of yesterday and planned to return to work for a few hours on monday financial stress , a big trigger for my depression , is setting in i'm not sure how i will pay my bills this month having already missed two weeks worth of paychecks as an on call employee , i do not get paid if i am not physically at work making ends meet is a constant battle when things are going well and i am working there 's just no way to pay the bills if i do n't work i pride myself on self reliance and financial responsibility to be put in this position by this damn illness really sucks today i am feeling resentful i resent depression for all the challenges it forces upon me and all the changes it forces upon my plans i know i am fortunate in so many ways , but i hate this illness and the massive upheaval which accompanies it eventually i will get back to work , to exercise , to errands , to socializing , and to meetings somehow i will figure it all out i'm just not sure how or when yet
