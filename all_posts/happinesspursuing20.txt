i once asked if i was lazy or depressed i still ca n't answer that question completely but i think i have a better understanding of why it 's so tough to answer a great deal of my depression manifests in self doubt and often strong self hate any activity i engage in this blog , a good paying gig with a popular magazine , dinner with a friend , a big party i approach with fear and self doubt my depression tells me that there 's no way i 've got the stuff to pull of this activity without making a fool of myself i call it inertia because it builds on itself let 's talk about a party it starts with in invitation to , let 's say , an event built around my industry with important people attending at first i'm pleased to have been invited and excited about making new connections , seeing old friends and generally having a good time then some tiny little kernel of doubt creeps into my mind either it 's about my ever expanding waistline and how people i have n't seen in a long time will surely notice or it 's about an article i recently wrote which i sure somebody there will have read and found completely idiotic and ca n't wait to tell me why or any other of a thousand little quibbling bits of self doubt the kernel grows and grows in my mind until it 's all i can think about this is how i regularly cancel lunches , find excuses not to write articles even though i might need to the money , and generally prove myself completely unreliable and , in doing so , i create one more very real way to doubt myself now , when the next thing comes up , i 've got one more piece of evidence to show myself how i 'll fail at that , too it 's an inertial cycle of failure so , the easiest thing to do no , the only thing to do that wo n't further prove to me what i failure i am is nothing outwardly , i appear lazy but inwardly i'm very actively doing nothing right now i can point to three things that i'm very specifically not doing somehow , i thought that this argument would be clearer and more convincing having written it out , though , it still just seems like a very elaborate excuse for being lazy maybe i should take a nap
