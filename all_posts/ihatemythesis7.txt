now that my time as a miserable grad student is almost up , and soon i will return to the real world , i want to get the most out of the university experience too little , too late , you say ? you 're probably right but i bet you did n't know that my university offers wait for it drum roll please water aerobics ! ! ! ! ! and i bet yours does too ! for a mere i have bought myself the opportunity to enter the all you can aerobic buffet line as long as you do n't mind entering the university grounds in a swimsuit , it 's one hell of a deal i tried it this morning , and other than a case of chlorine skin , it was a blast and after i was done , i laid out on a pool chair and worked on my thesis stared at the hot , undergrad lifeguards it beats the library , trust me what 's the weirdest program you have joined at your university ? photo by tim ross
