last night our neighbors reminded me of how i 'd cavalierly spoken of suicide during my last visit , which they thought was well , harsh then they 're from malibu in any case i did n't remember , though no doubt i likely did make said remarks , since i think of suicide as part of life 's woof and warp and not a subject to be feared or avoided i answered the suicide question at age i do n't like to let the idea of it remain in my brain for very long since it is therefore of of no comfort , contrary to nietzsche 's cheerful prescription it is an old misnomer that people who really commit suicide do n't talk about it they do until those last hours or minutes when the thought goes on automatic , when it 's too late to call out because they 've already hopped the train unless otherwise proven , most cases of suicide are clearly the result of inadequately treated depression , which we have all around us yesterday was extremely stressful i was out in the world , and my mate keep asking me questions , like , do you need anything from the market ? in my depressed state the pressure of making decisions is fearful i finally blurted do n't ask me any more questions , please ! which , although it made kathleen angry , also gave me some protection from going daffy odo yodel hoo , if you get my drift later when she asked me if i wanted pepper or salt on my sandwich i made my own rather than respond to another query she was miffed by this as well so we avoided each other all night and i went to bed early , afraid of her coming up , afraid i might accidentally touch her when she got in bed , since i had been so clearly shoved away when she got into bed and put her hand on my wrist , i was afraid to touch her back , not knowing if it were better that i protected myself and allowed no connection , or to pretened that things were normal and reciprocate i finally touched her back , hesitantly , feeling no connection but hoping the behavior she expected might mollify her for the night i did something yesterday in my depression for which i deserve a medal i have n't been to a gym in years , but we 'd joined one here , and i had n't been yet in two months kathleen dropped me off i did my floor exercises , mild weight lifting , min at level on the stairmaster , and yards of swimming when depressed and forcing yourself to exercise like this , each stroke of the arm in the pool makes the next one more difficult to believe , but you persist , almost like a cartoon being drawn by another hand , and you get through it , though you ca n't believe it afterwards exercise in depression , something very hard to make oneself do , has this advantage no human contact necessary now , ironically , i get to paste in a happier poem than my present mood can tolerate , from sine wave part ii to the apogee and down again at the aquarium of the pacific i saw a brilliant angelfish whose tail and fins shimmered yellow until it turned and silver spread like an undercoat of fur when stroked against the nap , across its scales black as caviar and rimmed with gold , its eyes , though flat as dimes , looked deep as wells the clownfish cruising by above the shells , its idiotic smile painted bold , passed disinterested as if it d seen it all before maybe but i 've heard fish see only black and white , so why this purple puffer and iridescent green parrot fish and for whom ? it 's absurd to credit chance either for us or for the light pubished in niederngasse
