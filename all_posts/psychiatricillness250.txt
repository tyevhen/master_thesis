i went to see my psychiatrist this morning i am only going every three months at the moment , as i am considered stable we discussed changing my medication as i sleep too much i said i was nervous about making changes , as i am reasonably stable at the moment i do n't want to rock the boat ! i am just going to take them last thing at night rather than teatime , see if i can stay up a little later i also asked him about my mum 's theory that i had selective mutism as a child he supported this theory and we discussed how i have learned to cope i am an expert in avoiding having to speak to people although i do n't want to do this anymore it has become instinct it is not that bad others resort to alcohol i was more aware of it after my appointment this morning i tried not avoiding people and i really enjoyed it firstly when i went to the cafe for my afternoon can of coke and chocolate , i instinctively went to take it back to my desk but then decided to sit down and take a minute break instead of feeling everyone was watching me and thinking i was weird or bad for sitting on my own i just watched the social interactions going on around me i felt quite relaxed and a part of life rather than an on looker then my manager and a supervisor from another department came in , i went to get up to leave in case they talked to me i stopped myself and just sat there i carried on looking around and even looked towards them to make eye contact if they saw me i was sweating mins later but it was a big step forwards and i am going to go over there tomorrow afternoon too ! it is funny if i have a purpose to a conversation i will do it it is small chat and socialising i really struggle with ! i had a chat with my mum this evening about not wanting to go to cambridge when i get back from the us next week she took it really well so i told her about my appointment this morning it was nice to have someone who cared sometimes i feel so alone as no one understands i speak to my boss at work as he seems to care and is very supportive , he seems to genuinely be interested but if it was outside to and he was not being paid i wonder he seems nice and a genuine friend it is just your boss is not the ideal person to confide in ! that 's it for tonight it is pm and i am still awake o taking the meds earlier seems to be working !
