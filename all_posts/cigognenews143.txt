art , if any of your patiens ever got long term cured , i was one of them ! since cured has important components of time , evolution in reverse ! and duration i will add the following to make clear what i mean when i say that i am cured during years , since january , i have had primals if these primals , gradually , little by little , reliving a complex longlasting and horrific trauma in the birth channel had not happened over years they had turned into grand mal and petit mal seizures during the ies you participated in at least of my dramatic primals , one of which , with bruises reappearing all over my forhead , were filmed by french television after having decided to drop my career in the mid ies i quit all medications tegretol carbamazepine i spent satanical but revolutionary years when i entered my epilepsy and found myself in the borderland between grandmal seizures and primals that meant eventually less seizures and more primals finally primals became a habit and my few seizures had now the character of petit mal seizures i could not only lay back and feel the stab of anxiety and go into a primal when i was awake , but i could also have dramatic dreams when i could decide to go into a primal during such a primal i became awake , or rather there was , during the primal , no difference between dream and wakefulness over the last years i have only in few occasions had to go into a primal that has happened , for example , when a special , surpricing and dramatic event has brought up a repressed memory if my tensions and anxiety were channeled into primals there were no need for epileptic seizures during the last years my lifepattern has changed and my earlier neurotic drive faded away as i relived my imprint pain and i stopped working myself into impossible situations i could suddenly feel that i had limits and needed to rest and relax and allow myself to be lazy it seems that my epilepsy was an evolutionary quick way to save my brain and life my former employers considered me to be without inhibitions i went on fighting acting out until i fell read got epilepsy yes art , i am cured from epilepsy it has meant reliving pain which has lead to a modified lifepattern less struggling , more feelings i have less urge to do the impossible my main motivations to put it all together over years are easily identifiable to cure myself , the primal principle , your charisma and your unhesitating conviction , my daughter isabel and my childhood love eva compared to many patients i have been blessed by an identifiable problem i come from an economically and socially priotitized part of the world i have been able to function and develop an exciting career although my judgement has been neurotically driven , i ve been able to make good and important decisions i have had the crucial support of resource rich , knowledeable and sympathetic people including yourself last but not least , i had two parents who finally realized and admitted their wrongdoing even though i have cured my variant of epilepsy , it is a difficult , seemingly hopeless task to transfer my experience to other epileptics
