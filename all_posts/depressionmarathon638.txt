i spent another weekend away with my new friend , d , at his lake home we had a great time again we did pretty much the same stuff as last time we ate good food , ran together , biked together , saw family his and mine , went out on the boat , had coffee and conversation , and generally relaxed it continues to be nice when we are together , and i am really enjoying getting to know him i think we are both getting comfortable with each other it was such a nice weekend , i smiled the whole way home we both arrived friday evening we got up early saturday to run d is training for two half marathons , one each of the next two weekends , and my marathon is less than two weeks away i was hoping to do miles , but my left calf cramped around mile i ended up sending d on his way while i walked and slowly jogged back to the car i made it miles , but my calf is still sore today i was unable to run my speed workout today and had to swim instead i think it 's just cramped , and i expect it will be better soon that 's my hope anyway we spent saturday night with d 's family and some friends they made a delicious meal and built a big fire in their fire pit near the lake the weather was perfect and the company was delightful we sat around the fire and laughed at various comical life stories it was really fun we took my parents out on the boat on sunday and then had them over for dinner i got to go waterskiing , which was fun , although i did have a pretty spectacular wipe out ! my parents really like d , and he seems very comfortable with them we had a wonderful grilled salmon dinner d is actually quite a good cook i was impressed i do n't enjoy cooking , and i'm not good at it i'm a hell of a dish washer , though ! anyway , we all ate too much and went to bed happy it was a nice evening nice , fun , relaxing those were the general themes throughout the weekend i wish d and i were n't so far away from each other , but so far we seem to be making it work i'm happy
