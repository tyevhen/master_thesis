from i had planned upon our return from the trip to la to have refills of my most needed medications in the mail from canada , namely my antidepressant , cymbalta , and my pain medication , celebrex to my horror and surprise , neither had arrived , only an old telephone message that both had been back ordered from europe both ? i said , calling back solly , one was n't weady yet and dey do n't like to ship dem together cheap bastards , i thought i urged them to get them to me asap , whereupon the indian pharmacist said den you would accept generic ? of course , you bubble headed booby ! i thought i try to keep such thoughts to myself today , because uttering them does n't help anyone in private with kathleen these past two and a half weeks on the road , i have often sat in a motel bed and said , i hate everyone ! i hope they all die ! bite your tongue and ask for forgiveness , she would say , especially if i mentioned a family member by name so i would do what she asked , but the prayer always sounded disrespectful with the lisping effect of teeth on tongue nevertheless i did comfort myself with the knowledge that all would die , if not soon enough to suit me why these near nightly rages on the road , i do n't know they were not manic , just a feeling of general anger towards everything , cheap motels , fast food , ungrateful children and obtuse others , all the while suffering pain , emotional and physical , while on limited means on what seemed an interminable road trip to long beach , ca , even if no major snafus occurred i would n't have missed my baby 's graduation , but i would n't do it again , either i think my anger may have been warning me about my grief , particularly over the fortunes of my eldest daughter of late , whose care on the trip exhausted me but i 'll keep her secrets for now , even if she is fond of broadcasting them every time i think i have come to accept her as she is , she finds some new hot buttons to push she 's gifted that way yes , she 's the redhead in the picture at the top right of the blog back to the meds when i had no cymbalta for two days i sank into a depressive episode , weeping for half an hour , struggling not to let any verbal equivalents enter my brain , as in you 're worthless you suck you 've never done anything you despise your own children no , i did n't let the lies of the frontal cortex insinuate themselves into the vortex of my lizard brain , thus was proud i could recognize my depressive seizure as just that , an uncontrollable outpouring of emotion unrelated to any specific thing i also had the wherewithal to call my doctor for a short term supply until the cheaper meds from canada arrive i got these yesterday afternoon and then proceeded to twitch so badly i had to sleep apart from my wife this is an early side effect of some antidepressants , but thank god , it means they are starting to work i sometimes think that part of manic depression is a complete disconnect , in time , between the emotions one should naturally experience and a safe time to let them out so , for example , i could go tight lipped through a funeral and weep at a video arcade a month later once i even thought i had come closer to better integrating my emotions with regard to circumstances , but i fear for us bipolars this is a chimera it 's as if we build up mountains of rage and dig chasms of grief of which we are consciously unaware , and one day we smack into them and all hell breaks loose chemically , from the standpoint of the actual illness , this likely holds little scientific truth , but it is a useful metaphor for conceptualizing how the phenomenon sometimes feels in the end manic depression is really just bad genes and bad luck now it was n't entirely my fault that i was out of meds , but first a cautionary note if you respond to an antidepressant and go off of it , your chances of responding to it a second time are much reduced since cymbalta was the only thing i responded to after a year 's misery , even missing one day was inexcusable but that 's all i missed so whoever reads this post , remember to take your medications faithfully , especially if you suffer a mood disorder next post i obtained on tuesday , through tearful anxious phone calls , a refill on my antidepressant , cymbalta the substitution of prozac for two days was n't cutting it i switched back to my shrink 's recommended dose of cymbalta , twice normal , of mg tuesday afternoon soon after i began to experience akisthesia , a peculiar symptom where you ca n't become comfortable , where your body must constantly move , twitch where there is a supreme discomfort in stillness and you must keep moving your feet , your legs , something you ca n't watch tv or read you ca n't concentrate mostly you indulge in various irresistible writhings naturally this physical phenomenon drives kathleen crazy in bed so i had to sleep downstairs but i knew it was a sign that the antidepressant was working again , or about to work , unlike the thousands of psychiatrists who hear this symptom from their patients and think it means they ca n't tolerate the medication i find this ants in the pants feeling in my body almost always precedes an improvement in my mood , and have observed the same in countless patients although not confident wednesday , i did n't cry and thursday i worked out for hours at the gym today i was afflicted with a little melancholy but managed to get a lot of work done despite it so , gentle readers , i did n't mean to leave you hanging on my decompensation i'm doing better the downside is that the damn cymbalta capsules , of which i need two a day , cost about apiece here until the discounted meds arrive from canada that 's an expensive habit , especially when you combine it with lamictal , of which i must take two a day , when each tablet costs , even at costco until the patents expire on new medicines you need , you 're truly fucked without insurance , and as i have previously blogged , i ca n't obtain insurance , medical or life , because i am a bipolar bad risk the pharmaceutical companies have a limited window to recover their r d money , and i do n't see them as villains , more occasional saviors who must recoup r d costs on all the drugs that did n't work from ones that do accusing them of malfeasance is like attacking big oil wrong target i'm no republican it 's just so easy to blame the nearest elephant the reality is much more complicated i 've added another paying poetry publication to byline and and contrary now i just got a check from valerie polichar 's grasslimb for the gloaming since i quit writing poetry and started marketing it , i'm not doing half bad even more amazing , an original copy of my first and only book of poems , elementary , which sold as a paperback at in , is listed by one seller at amazon com for my eldest daughter told me this but i could n't believe it go figure did the rumor of my death exaggerate the price ? there are likely book speculators out there , some who are betting that i might be important someday or maybe it 's just a fluke curioser and curioser i 've never received a single royalty payment from the book this fact gives me hope that the same concern , mellen press , might consider publishing a second book of mine no , i checked that out like most smart publishers they do n't do poetry anymore in the spirit of marketing , i 'll close with a poem i wrote before i was an ex poet homo promo you who huddle under billboards happy in your anonymity , grateful to avoid the rain , how i pity you ! you should be up there above the freeway in a red bikini with a high end tequila in your happy fist don t you get it ? become a commodity hawking you hours a day be your own infomercial ! celebrity is the only currency and the dow is measured in air time ! the first human infomercial was muhammad ali , who became the most recognizable man on the globe to become your own spin doctor , wrap yourself up so tightly nothing hurts like rome , let every conversation lead to you although you were never loved the way you wanted to be loved , there 's always a chance if you please your audience ! always sell the product you are the product if marx and nietszche could see us now united in the strife which divided us at once worker and robber baron it 's hard to find good help anymore no longer alienated from the product nobody told me there 'd be days like these i 'd love to see the look on their bearded faces wish me luck as i perform solo at the lavender festival tomorrow i hope the wine tasting goes quickly to loosen up my audience i'm no james taylor or cat stevens , that 's for sure but i do alright thine at kilorat ,
