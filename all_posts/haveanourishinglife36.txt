hey , long time no blogging again i ve been so busy lately but it s not really because i have a lot to do , per se my first problem is that i have this big old to do list some things are important , other things are just why in the world do you want to do that or why is that on the list type of things i m chalking it up to nesting however , because of my outlandish , unrealistic , daily to do lists , i feel like i need to start the day bright and early and keep super busy of the time in order to help with pregnancy , and the impending delivery , most of the things on my list are things that i am trying to do routinely to keep my body and mind healthy every day , i want to walk , do those pregnancy stretches to help my poor hips , sit on the stability ball to help my core and back muscles , listen to relaxing music , practice hypno therapy , visual imagery and breathing techniques , read , knit , pray , clean , shower tangent does anyone else find that showers are not relaxing when you re pregnant ? they are becoming more and more like work the bigger i get it seems more of a chore to wash my hair and shave my legs by the time i m done , i m out of breath and irritated and let s not even talk about toe nails what did they do in the olden days ? did they just let them grow and cut them after the baby is born ? anyway back to my stressful , stress free life i have to take a step back and remember that i wanted to incorporate all of those things to help me keep a state of calm and peace recently , i ve been stressing about fitting all those things in everyday i ve fallen into the old perfectionism trap of trying to relax perfectly however , i don t feel more relaxed , on the contrary , i feel very anxious there are legit things on my to do list , like buy diapers , get a mattress for the cradle you know , things that actually need to get done before the baby comes checking those things off the list would ease my anxiety more than any of my relaxing techniques i m not saying that relaxing isn t important i am just realizing that it has to be , as with everything else , done in moderation and at the right time and place i think all my relaxation techniques will be very helpful in the long run i just don t have to do everything every single day that mentality feeds more into my ocd tendencies than a peaceful , stress free mind
