i finished off my fourth bottle of the mmthff whatever a couple of days ago apart from the first week which i chalk up to a placebo effect , i saw no change over the many weeks while i took it this does n't mean that it does n't work for anybody , jl and melanie have clearly benefited from the stuff it just happens to be that i do n't so , what now ? a reader asked that question back when i started trying the folic solution and i did n't have an answer i still do n't maybe i 'll look into jl 's meditation maybe i 'll give walking another try or , most likely , i 'll just sit here and keep self medicating with booze i really wish i could afford a therapist my father in law visited yesterday he lives miles away so it 's kind of a big deal when he stops in on the other hand , we see him two or three times a year so it 's kind of not a big deal anyway , we had lunch at a bbq place downtown i live in an old river town on the mississippi downtown is right on the river and is bisected by a railroad after we were done eating , we sat around and chatted i quite like this restaurant and even have a bit of a history with it but , yesterday they were blasting the worst of the ' 's and ' 's so , after a while , i just had to get out of there i left and wandered out in the street , aiming to sit on a quiet park bench near the railroad tracks as if on cue , a train came screaming up on me i could n't sit through that so i stood up , as if in some sort of respect after the engine passed with it 's blasting horn , i was confronted with what seemed to be miles and miles of train cars rumbling past with horrible , magnificent noise i could only stand and watch i wondered how hard it would be to time it to dive under the cars , between the wheels , and put my head on the tracks for a quick and , mostly , painless death i watched a rusty old car come rumbling up to me as it swayed back and forth on it 's unstable wheels and secretly hoped that it would tumble over and take me in short , i had one of the more suicidal moments that i 've had for some time and , i must say , it was a bit refreshing i actually feel better now for having had it
