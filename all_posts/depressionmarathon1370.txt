depression sucks because it makes me fat just back from a run with puck , my svelte black lab , and feeling the weight of me yes , i look fine , and i do n't have an eating disorder or body image disorder , but i am , that 's twenty pounds over my best racing weight thought it was the birth control pill started in october , by may , extra pounds , and losses to all the locals i used to beat when racing ! turns out , my psychiatrist and i just realized i also started a new anti depressant in october , i'm not going to say which anti depressant because i do n't want a bunch of people to throw away their meds so now what ? this med has made a huge difference i have been very stable and functional since starting it but , i am also a runner and a runner ca n't compete with extra pounds part of my identity is missing now what ?
