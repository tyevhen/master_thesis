i blew up the other day it was short and sweet , but for one brief moment , i lost my temper this was news because i do n't remember the last time i even raised my voice i live alone i keep things simple in my life and my relationships i try my hardest to live according to the principals of my recovery program , which is basically live and let live and i attempt to live a life in which i do n't have to apologize , especially for my behavior i do n't generally get into situations where raising my voice in anger is at all appropriate they say mothers know how to push our buttons because they installed them well , a couple of days ago , my mom pushed my buttons then she pushed them again , and again , and again finally , i felt myself blow like i said , i do n't remember the last time i felt such strong anger rise up within me fortunately , i did n't say or do anything inappropriate , but i definitely raised my voice boy , i was angry ! long story short , my mom and i have since patched things up , but that anger really messed me up for awhile i found myself surprised by the intensity of the emotion , and i worried almost immediately i questioned myself i got down on myself for getting angry what 's wrong with me , i wondered ? oh no , i must not be working a good recovery program ! i must not be spiritually fit , i thought in a nutshell , i questioned my integrity and worth as a human being just because i got angry ! fortunately , i have people to talk to i quickly consulted another recovering alcoholic she assured me i was okay but warned me to let go , of my anger and my negative thinking , so as not to annihilate my serenity i tried , but it took a good hours to accomplish that in the meantime , i tortured myself i also consulted a very close friend after she listened to my story and to the events leading up to my eruption , she validated my anger then she said exactly what i needed to hear it 's okay , she told me it was okay to have felt angry what a revelation ! actually , i knew that but when i was all jumbled up in my emotional mind , i forgot anger is just a feeling it 's a normal human emotion it 's not good or bad it 's just a feeling it only became bad when i attached all of my worries and judgments to it and did that help me at all ? nope it only made me feel worse it kept me all jumbled up and emotional it made an entire day much more difficult than it needed to be the good news is i'm un jumbled now i feel better and i am trying hard not to get down on myself for getting down on myself ! it was an uncomfortable situation , with uncomfortable emotions , which complicated my life for hours , but i 've come out the other side unscathed i am constantly learning how to live this life on life 's terms i'm not real fond of this latest lesson , but i learned from it , nonetheless
