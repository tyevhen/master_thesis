watershed pain ravages her face and makes her old i see new bags beneath her sea green eyes she stays in bed a lot , dreading the cold she goes for heating pads , never for ice i watch her wince when she exits the van it takes a while for her to straighten and stand her disks won t stabilize and nothing can restore their architecture to god s plan i love her desperately and she s in pain her pain is amplified within my head the helplessness i feel is the same all humans carry to love s watershed watershed makes rivers , even of tears , though grief remains after the water clears i have suffered degenerative disk disease for so long that it is a part of my life i endure without too much thought but a fresh disk impairment can be disabling chronic pain is always better than acute pain and kathleen , my wife , is suffering acute pain we all stand by helplessly so often when our loved ones suffer , but often there is nothing to do but stand by thus the genesis of today 's verse i hesitate to call it a poem ce
