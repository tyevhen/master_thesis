my bucket list has been calling after crossing off skydiving this past fall , i 've been thinking about my next adventure over the past to weeks i 've been spending an inordinate amount of time obsessing over two of the destinations on my bucket list i 've been spending hours upon hours drooling over various adventures to both antarctica and mount everest base camp both places have fascinated me for years ironically , i could run a marathon in each location , which is how my recent obsessive research began after the new york city marathon i was perusing a marathon website when i came across the antarctica marathon i watched a video that did it i was on board it 's more than just going and running a marathon , though it 's a two week journey which includes hiking , kayaking , and close encounters with penguins it looks amazing ! they are currently booked through , which is fine , as it will certainly take me at least that long to save the funds i 'd actually really like to work on antarctica for a season many years ago , i met a woman who worked down there twice , including one entire year , and she had nothing but positive things to say about the experience i 've been researching how to get hired , but there are no positions for physical therapists too bad , and i 've yet to find anything else for which i am qualified even the dishwasher positions require a food service certification i guess i should have been a researcher or marine biologist ! i have n't given up searching , yet , though as for mount everest , i 've been fascinated with the top of the world since jon krakauer wrote about the ill fated expedition for outside magazine his article later became the book , into thin air , and then became the basis for the movie , everest i'm pretty sure i 've read every everest book , seen every documentary and television series , attended every lecture within miles , and even met some of the characters from the expedition i ca n't wait until i can walk in the shadow of that mountain and briefly live among the people of nepal the everest trek i'm looking into is much less expensive than going to antarctica , but it will still require years of saving i think i 'll skip the marathon option in nepal , as i do n't think running a race which begins above , feet makes much sense for someone living in the flat , farming land of minnesota nevertheless , i will make it there , on foot , someday having these adventures to look forward to keeps me going it keeps me motivated many people say they 're going to do this or going to do that , but they never do it i do n't want to be one of those people i'm not wealthy , but that does n't mean i ca n't go where i wish to go if i do n't have the dream , i 'll never have the reality besides , the dream is half the fun ! and meeting the goal will make me ecstatic !
