do you ever feel like no matter how hard you try , you will never have what your heart truly desires ? and that it would be better to just give up on those things because your heart is broken and will never really be healed ? i had an experience today about this subject it 's bitterly cold here in western montana , but i decided to go for a hike anyway , because i could feel myself sinking into a depression and i knew exercise would make me feel better as i was coming down the hill at the end of the hike , i was feeling deep sorrow sorrow about not being loved , sorrow about not ever having a childhood , but mostly sorrow about never being loved the way i 've wanted to be loved my heart felt broken , and i felt a vast , empty weight press down on me just at that moment , the clock tower on campus struck pm and the bitter wind whipped up and rattled through the dead leaves still on the trees it was the most mournful , sorrowful , yet somehow darkly beautiful moment for that moment , i felt like a ghost walking the hillside , that the wind was blowing through me instead of around me it was a beautiful connection with my lost inner child fragments of words started forming in my mind , and this poem was what came out giving up on your dreams it 's not as easy as it seems broken splinters of your glass heart trapped inside , everywhere , nowhere and nothing squeezed , suffocated , smothered to death in a soundless scream that has no voice and no choice the emptiness that has no form the heartbreak that has no apparent cause the loneliness and isolation that persist despite friends , family , god , and pets the hopelessness that is everywhere , inside everything , and yet cannot be described or defined the world 's broken heart beneath its cheerful , smiling face i think morpheus says it best when speaking to neo in the matrix what you know you ca n't explain , but you feel it you 've felt it your entire life , that there 's something wrong with the world you do n't know what it is , but it 's there , like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad
