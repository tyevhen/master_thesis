the heat of last week finally broke over the weekend it was perfect timing , as i had miles scheduled for saturday morning and i did it ! i got up very early and was on the road before am the air was warm , but the humidity had broken and clouds covered the sun it was actually a rather pleasant and hours out there during my run , i had a low point around mile , which was exactly where i crashed at grandma 's marathon last month my legs were tired , my brain was negative , and all i wanted to do was give up but i did n't i forced myself to continue running i worked on reversing my negative thoughts , and the low moment passed i then felt stronger and stronger until the last miles of my run it was very good for my confidence and morale it turned out to be a great run i was a little worried about how i would recover after that effort , especially since it was my first long run since grandma 's and since recovering from pneumonia fortunately , i had nothing physically taxing to do afterward i was lucky to spend much of the rest of the day with friends , bill and cindy , socializing and relaxing on their patio i'm so grateful to have such unconditional , fabulous friends we never tire of spending time with each other later in the evening , i took puck for a mile walk , and my legs felt good i was pleased i was even more pleased on sunday when i was able to complete another fairly tough workout i rode my bike miles throughout the countryside i rode hard , but not all out i was pleasantly surprised with the strength in my legs i was expecting more fatigue than i encountered instead , i was able to enjoy the weather , the farm fields , and my freedom to ride it was another confidence boosting workout for me it 's nice to feel alive again first the pneumonia had me dragging then the heat kept me shut inside now i feel like i 've regained some strength and perspective i feel better about my training and more hopeful about achieving the goals i 've set but i'm not getting carried away yet i have a difficult speed workout scheduled tomorrow hopefully , the result will be three strong , positive workouts in a row i 'll be over the moon if that turns out to be the case !
