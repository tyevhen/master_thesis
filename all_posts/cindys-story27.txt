the following are sections of emails written to a friend in august this was at the beginning of my spiral into depression i know it is sad , but i include it on my blog to show that even christians who desire to be close to god can get depressed sometimes we ca n't get out of it on our own we need help from outside ourselves saturday , august , me me , i am still just here life continues what can i say ? i ca n't make sense of it right now sorry , i'm just trying not to think about some things god , this is hard why must it be this way ? p s i am okay most of the time it is just when i think about things that the weariness , ache , and fear grips me , and i have to turn away i do n't know how to do this sunday , august , so lost i'm sorry about my silence i do still need help and encouragement and good words at this time it is just that i do n't want anyone to have to go through the stuff that i put myself through sometimes it can be like a dark cloud floating in front of my eyes , or walking through a river upstream other times like last night it is more like a lightning bolt that strikes me , and i find myself collapsed on the bathroom floor in tears from the force after time , i know god brings me out the other side so i just wait i do n't know how god wants me to do this forgive me please monday , august , personality test weaknesses results my personality is melancholy my weaknesses include easily depressed i have a hard time realizing that i control others by my moods i tend to take everything too personally , and i frequently look for trouble i spend too much mental energy dwelling on negatives low self image because of my inborn negative inclinations , i focus my judgment most harshly upon myself procrastination because i am a perfectionist , i often refrain from starting certain projects because i am afraid i wo n't do them right put unrealistic demands on others because i have high standards i do everything to perfection , but when i impose my standards on others , this trait becomes a weakness tuesday , august , weakness results well , i guess now you understand a bit better some of the things that are a constant struggle for me i do n't know what answers i have other than to live my life the way i believe god wants me to , to try to live for god and other people so as to try to forget about myself maybe now you see why i try so hard and put myself through so much , and maybe you see how i do get frustrated with and depressed with life it is very hard not to i am just glad that my real home is not here , but in heaven otherwise , i could not live jesus is my hope once i began this spiral down into depression , the only way that i came out was through friends reaching in to help pull me out , medications to help my brain chemistry , counseling to talk through my fears , the prayers of my family to give me strength , and even a hospital stay now and then to rescue me from death or harm as a christian , i was ashamed but , it turns out that the illness that came over me in a mental and emotional way was not a struggle to be ashamed of it was a struggle that taught me what love is from god unconditionally and from his people who are in this struggle called life with me if you find yourself in this struggle of depression as a christian do not be ashamed reach out for the help that god has provided in friends , medications if necessary , professional therapy and talking , prayer from others , and even with emergency measures god loves you unconditionally your brothers and sisters in christ love you as well jesus is still our hope thank you jesus
