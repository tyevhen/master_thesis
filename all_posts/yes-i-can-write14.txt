the work i do , writing this blog for over eight years , and maintaining an active accompanying facebook page with , followers , means so much to me it 's challenging , and enjoyable , sometimes frustrating , but always rewarding it 's also work struggling to write a post that truly conveys what i'm trying to get across finding good things to share on the unschooling facebook page on a daily basis , and moderating the sometimes contentious discussions that spring from what i share even in the more fallow times , i'm still spending a lot of time thinking about what i want to write and share , making sure the facebook page never gets too quiet , and trying to get better emotionally so i can get back to writing , because my emotional wellness has a very direct impact on how much i'm writing and all of this ? it has n't felt really sustainable for a long time now i love what i do , and no matter what , i plan to continue for as long as i can , as much as a can but trying to support myself financially through writing , while also struggling with mental illness , has not been easy so after thinking long and hard about it , hemming and hawing and going back and forth on whether it would be a good idea , i decided to open a patreon account what is patreon , and why have i decided to use it , you ask ? here 's an excerpt from my very own patreon page patreon allows people like you readers and supporters to become patrons by pledging a recurring monthly donation in the amount of your choice , whether that 's , or or something in between your generosity can help ease my stress around finances , thus allowing more energy and time to be spent on doing the work i love it can help me seek out much needed healthcare that is n't covered under the public insurance i have and it can help me to find greater independence and security in my everyday life and i would n't want to ask for something for nothing , so i'm not i 've committed myself to writing two posts a month for i'm unschooled yes , i can write , and along with that , by becoming a patron you gain access to a bunch of perks like early access to those regular posts , as well as access to a patron exclusive monthly post on a topic voted on by you exclusive interviews audio , video , and written with my family , unschooled friends , and contacts with interesting things to share about self directed learning live q a 's with me behind the scenes peeks at what 's happening with my work exclusive access to the text of any speech i write and my endless gratitude ! i believe strongly that all supporters , no matter how much or how little they choose to contribute , are important and greatly deserving of my gratitude , so all perks will be available to all patrons , whether their pledge is or or you can also watch my welcome video , where i explain in brief who i am and how this all works do you like what i'm doing , and feel like you might want to support me in this way ? become a patron help me to continue doing what i do and know that whether you choose to become my patron or not , i am so incredibly grateful for your comments , shares , and all the other ways you show your support i would n't be here without you all ! this weeks schedule of special events today , september th , my patreon page launches ! the page will go live at am est , and i 'll be around all day to answer questions just message me on facebook , or post on my facebook wall wednesday , september th , i 'll be doing a live q a on facebook ask me about what it was like growing up unschooled , or being an unschooled adult about my writing about patreon about anything you want ! just head over to the page at pm est on the th and join in q a will run until pm , unless there are still lots of questions , in which case i 'll stick around for a while longer friday , september th , i 'll be sharing my first patron exclusive article , something i wrote a while back but that 's never been published before it 's about quitting , and why it can be a good thing so if you choose to support my work through patreon , at any pledge amount , you 'll be able to read it do n't worry if you choose not to become a patron i plan to be posting twice monthly on this blog , so there should be plenty to read here !
