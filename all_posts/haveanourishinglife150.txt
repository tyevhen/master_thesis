below you will find four common myths about taking anti depressant medication there are many more than what i have listed , but these are the reasons that kept me from taking the drugs in the beginning i wish someone would have told me these things years ago i might not have been so hesitant to take them anti depressants are not as bad as you think myth once i start taking anti depressants , i will be taking them for life typically , after the first major depressive episode , doctors suggest taking anti depressants treatments for months after a year , percent of patients fully recover and don t need meds ever again if the patient has a relapse , however , it is recommended to take the drugs for another year after the second try , percent more people enjoy full recovery so , out of all the people who seek treatment for their depression , only percent have to continue to use the anti depressant drugs through an extended period of time for health maintenance for percent of the treatment seeking population , anti depressants are not meant to be taken for life myth anti depressants are addictive in order to bust this myth , i have to talk about balanced treatment depression treatment is most effective if viewed as a tripod the first leg of the tripod is medication the second is counseling and the third is self help methods while taking an anti depressant , patients continue to go to therapy and continue to learn how to deal with the depression in a healthy way when it is time to taper off the medication , if the person has effectively gone through the recovery process , he she will be prepared and less likely to want to depend on the pills unlike other drugs , anti depressants do not have a chemically addictive quality so any medication dependency is only the result of a lack in the other two areas of the treatment tripod i shouldn t say only because , it is still a very big deal that is why , while taking medication , the person works with a doctor , a counselor , and his her support system to determine when it is time to start tapering off the medication if the patient is not ready to give them up , it is because they have not developed good coping skills or have not dealt with important issues during counseling myth anti depressants are a band aid and only cover up the symptoms this is only true for percent of people who seek treatment for depression as stated in myth for the other percent , anti depressants can actually help cure the depression disease when a person is suffering from depression , often times , it is really difficult to benefit from the other two components of recovery , counseling and coping skills , without the aid of anti depressants it is possible to do it without medication , but not encouraged anti depressants help bring the patient to a higher cognitive level , thus , allowing counseling and coping skills to work their magic in my own experience , i was going to counseling and trying to implement self help methods for several years before i started taking an anti depressant my emotional state , however , was often in the basement i made small steps in those years , but i could not get ahead one small step forward usually accompanied two giant steps backward everything that happened to me was a major catastrophe if it was raining outside , my life was over if i forgot to finish a task at work , i was not worthy of my life needless to say , it was a slow and painful process i am not saying i couldn t have done it without the drugs , and i am not saying that i could have i am just saying that before i started the medication , i was not making any notable progress and things were not looking so good after i started taking medication , i made leaps and bounds toward a healthier life the anti depressants helped balance out my emotions i was able to think through things rationally and without having a major breakdown i still had bad days , but i was able to use my coping skills to get me through the tough times i still struggled with uncontrolled emotions and feelings , but i was able to combat those negative thoughts with the tools i learned in counseling for me , depression medication worked like a remedy myth anti depressant will cause me to gain weight there are very few anti depressant medications anymore that have terrible side effects because of the scientific advances with medicine , most drugs are free of side effects often times , someone going through a severe depression will lose weight prior to receiving treatment because of the nature of the disease depression causes fatigue , feelings of worthlessness , and no desire to live eating is often one of the first things to go as far as self care is concerned until the person receives treatment , they could possibly lose vital nourishment needed for their body to function so , say that person starts taking anti depressants , goes to counseling , and works on developing healthy coping skills they start to feel better and start taking better care of themselves naturally , one would return to a healthy weight , if they had lost weight prior if they started off lower , then yes , taking an anti depressant kind of , sort of , allows for weight gain the doctors tell you that it could cause weight gain , but it s not in the way you think but is gaining weight such a bad thing anyway ? in my opinion , being alive and healthy is better than being on the verge of death and severely depressed stick thin and miserable ? or heavier but happier ? those four myths kept me from being open to medication in the beginning i was so hesitant to take it when i first realized that i needed help for my depression because , as i ve said before , it is so dang hard for me to take a pill in addition , i believed that taking drugs would mean i was weak i thought it would mean i was a bad person i couldn t heal myself the natural way so i thought i was a waste of a human being i must have not tried hard enough to get better i must have not eaten the right foods , exercised enough , or prayed enough i must be a failure at life one of the most notable steps in my recovery was finally believing that it is ok to take medication once i started the anti depressant medication , within days ! , i began to feel better and i continued to get better as the months went on i began to see that my life was worth something again i started taking better care of myself my obsessions with calories and weight started to fade away life was enjoyable again i started painting again i have a garden instead of mornings of fear and despair , i wake up and look forward to the day instead of routine crying spells multiple times a day , my routine consists of things like writing , helping others , teaching , or babysitting you may still think that anti depressants should never be the answer but , in my case , i am thankful that they helped me recover for me , it was a good day when i realized that it was more important to stay alive than to never take prescription drugs if you are fighting to take medication , remember that you are worth it you don t have to just survive , you can thrive ! you deserve to have a nourishing life
