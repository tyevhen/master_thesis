i am convinced that whatever a carrying mother puts into her body the results on the fetus baby will be deleterious there is a study reported in ethical human psychology vol , number , that when a pregnant mother takes ordinary tranquilizers such as prozac so paxil she could be harming her baby the investigators looked at mothers who took the serotonin enhancing tranquilizers and found that the offspring had serious brain and body changes it was linked to several afflictions , not the least of which were changes in the structure of the brain when depressed mothers took those pills the offspring suffered from pulmonary hypertension , meaning that the baby had a hard time catching her breath she could not get enough oxygen in her lungs the critical period was in the first trimester serotonin is very important in brain development , and what these pills do is interfere with that development , culminating in possible withdrawal symptoms in the new born pure muscle tone , poor sleep patterns , respiratory distress and other factors this is to say nothing of later effects on depression and suicidal ideation so it is not benign to take a seemingly banal drug while carrying what is important here is that it sets the stage for later addiction to drugs the gap between uterine life and later behavioral effects can be decades , which is why it is so hard to detect so a mother taking drugs to alleviate depression could be setting up depression and the need for uppers in the offspring the baby can be born depressed that is , she is low on alerting chemicals such as dopamine her whole system has been in suppress mode since entering planet earth science writer , bruce wilson , adds a quote from an article on the subject by peter breggin not only is the unborn baby trying to deal with a flood of maternal stress hormones transmitted to it through the placenta , but it also must deal with a drug that is affecting the very development of its stress response system and its brain ssris the tranquilizer acts to keep serotonin at the ready in the synapse , actually work on the whole stress response system , which includes a host of neurochemicals and hormones so on top of the onslaught of maternal stress , the fetus has its defense system knocked out before it has a fighting chance a fetus whose mother took antidepressants is more likely to be born with adhd the baby can t win it is depleted of what it needs to respond properly to stress and then goes to school and is blamed because he is hyperactive and cannot concentrate add and here is what is worse later to he goes to a shrink to find out what is wrong with him and they give him drugs again ay ay ay and he needs drugs because nowhere in the shrink s armamentarium is there room for a theory of gestational life , which would allow for a treatment without drugs with the knowledge that is out there about this it is almost criminal to not acknowledge this crucial time in our lives it deprives patients at any shot at health and stability any chance of good relationships , any chance that their heart will go on working into his nineties there is too much evidence now that drugs given to the pregnant mother produce later heart disease see robert whitaker the anatomy of an epidemic robert whitaker org
