? ? ? answer that s not time management , as you re not managing your time you re making too much time for a vast array of extracurriculars question being paid less than my female counterparts ? i work in a very busy department for a company this department is primarily women women and myself , a man we all work very hard , each of us having our own stronger points which helps bolster each others weaker points there is a hierarchy here i was at the bottom paid a measly k but have worked my way up over years we recently had to make a redundancy for one of the ladies as she was not coming to work due to relationship issues management decided we were able to incorporate her job into our already busy jobs we did so , and i received a wage increase to reflect my extra workload and a hike up the corporate ladder above me were my two other colleagues at this point one of them has been off sick for two years with stress , but has retained her k wage somehow and company car i cant climb much higher with her off ill my third colleague works extremely hard and is a real workhorse she knows the job backwards , but the cost of this diligence and excellence is she has hardly any life at all outside of work she is paid a reasonable wage , enough to buy a property , whereas i have been doing the same job for some months now on a year i have a degree and years of experience in a variety of roles , plus on top of doing the same role as my colleague i am also the it support technician here as i have lots of experience from other jobs in this , its been added to my job description and i have been told i must handle all incoming formal complaints as the complaints liaison for customers , again due to my experience in the past with high profile cases and complaints handling my third colleague has now left as she has decided to have a baby with her partner she says she will be back as her partner is on far less in terms of salary nd they cant afford it in the meantime , my managers have said they will pay me pro rata the same rate as my pregnant colleague as i am doing her and other peoples job , plus i get an assistant yet to arrive ! i know how much my colleague was paid as she told me the amount they are paying me is only more than my current wage , far less than i thought i was due the business is having a hard time financially with the current climate i d rather keep my job than demand more money but i am not happy any advice ? answer you need to post a resume online somewhere and start looking your job does not seem they are going to budge with the wage increase even if you tried but at least you have a job and can take your time at really looking to see what is available question a very difficult family situation ? okay , so i feel like my family is a hopeless slump i am years old , and right now i m still living at home because a i m currently choosing to in order to help out my mother and b my household would fall apart if i wasn t here plus , i ll go ahead and put c because it s a little easier for me and them , at the present time though i know that i need to live my own life , as well i m working full time , and in my younger years i started working on building my credit so now i have credit cards , about k in available credit which no , i m not planning on spending up , just using for example and i know as of recently that i have top tier credit scores for when i do want to get my own house at some point when i was years old , our father put a gun to his head in the other bedroom one morning , and that is what we woke up to my then widowed mother tried to raise us alone my grandmother my mom s mom i say that because i had grandmothers at one point saw this passing of my father who never wanted her to come around the house here when he was alive as a means to basically move in she s lived here ever since then for her , it was a place to go my grandmother spent most of her life doing idiot jobs like cutting grass for here and there , barely making it in life at one point she was sleeping in her car in a plaza parking lot when my father was alive so of course , she has lived with us now for about years now i have an older brother who is years older when he was about or , he moved out he never really helped out with much around the house , never did a thing to help my mother he s now , married and has a child he s also an air traffic controller in constant training he always wants help from my mother , who doesn t have anything , herself i know he s making a lot more money probably more than my entire household combined but because my brother and his wife can t tone down their high life , yes , they can barely make it i don t see him helping my mom in the future , either when he s making the said k a year he will still be having a rough time i m sure , and find some excuse not to help my mom my mom feels that she can t multitask like me and my brother i know that she seems to struggled with ocd very heavily i see her doing odd stuff around the house like re checking stuff tons of times most of her life , she has averaged about to an hour in the jobs that she was worked she has a k there s probably not over k to k in it she s heavily in debt with credit cards she has years of work experience and is now in her early s , but she s always been too scared to step up into a management position she has been at her current job for about years now , and the lowest level manager makes about twice or more what she makes she won t even try for it she doesn t want the stress i can t live at home forever , she knows that i want to have my own wife and family someday , she knows that but also is very nosey , scared of me having friends , socializing , etc my family is a hermit and basically has no life my grandmother is apparently a paranoid schizophrenic mom said they diagnosed her with that a couple of decades ago so granny makes up lies about the neighbors , twists stuff all around , thinks every woman is a man dressed up like a woman you get the picture she s batty i want to move up in my career positions i ve been doing pretty good , considering and i m always fighting to do better financially and to better my life in general the time will come when i will have to move out i know my mother looks to me as the head of the household yet at the same time wants to treat me like a child , and i oftentimes have to stand up for myself as an adult and remind her that i can do what i wish especially since i pay part of the bills while i m here she won t be able to make it without me , and my grandmother never held a job for very long literally my grandmother gets a social security check of about a month she pays my mom like a month for rent , which is dirt cheap because she s broke my grandmother is in her s , she ll never work again , probably will never drive again and will likely be hanging onto my mom until the day she dies my mother would then be alone and if i was married , obviously a wife doesn t want a mother in law moving in with her and her husband just because her husband s mother had no one else i m unsure what to think do in this situation my family freaking sucks , and i already know that i ve missed out on a lot in life growing up because i was taking care of my mom and helping out with stuff that my sorr answer speak to a professional counselor know that you will have to stand up for yourself , not necessarily defend your decisions make a plan that is financially sound for yourself , that you can afford good luck
