hi there ! i had a great run on saturday , a nice day at work and a swim on sunday , and i was overwhelmed at work today so things are about average around here i'm now relaxing in my chair , in front of a baseball game , trying to figure out what to write before heading off to bed i guess since i'm still decompressing , i 'll write about my hour work day today my brain shuts off well before the hour mark , so just the extended length of my day made today difficult but really taxing to my brain was the two and a half hour inservice we had in the middle of the day the inservice was meant to be a review of some treatment modalities , but much of the information was new to me i was totally overwhelmed ! there was too much information presented for the time allotted then we ran overtime , and i could n't pay attention because i was too worried about how far behind schedule this inservice was putting me it was very stressful unfortunately , i do n't feel like i can apply what was presented today , which is what 's expected i was overwhelmed by the material i felt like i needed more time and instruction to utilize the information correctly and i ended up way behind schedule , which forced me to stay at work for an extra hour and a half the stress created by the inservice really hindered my ability to learn i'm hoping to look through the information on my own tomorrow when i'm not feeling so stressed i'm glad i have tomorrow off fortunately , i did have a good weekend my miler saturday morning could not have gone much better i started before the sunrise the weather was amazing ! and i felt good the whole way i finished with gas in the tank i think i easily could have run several more miles it 's not often that i have long runs like that , so i enjoyed every moment i have a miler scheduled for this saturday i hope it goes just as well i'm so grateful god has given me the gift of running my run got my weekend off to a great start , and the endorphins carried me through the rest of saturday and sunday thanks , god what gifts has god given you ? think about it have a nice week , everyone !
