on monday , novell let it be known that it would be acquired by attachmate corporation in a deal worth billion meanwhile , in a form k filing with the sec , novell stated that it will sell to cptn all of novell 's right , title and interest in patents for million in cash cptn holdings llc is a consortium of technology companies organized by microsoft immediately , people began to speculate that the reason microsoft would bid such an enormous amount of money to obtain novell 's patent portfolio which , by the way , comes to only issued u s patents the figure represents applied for patents as well as issued patents is to get its hands on the intellectual property around unix novell acquired unix from at t in the s but it now appears that novell will not be selling unix patents as part of the cptn deal so the million question is what , exactly , is microsoft via cptn paying all that money for ? i 'll offer my own speculation disclosure in and , i was a member of novell 's inventions committee the company 's internal patent oversight board i do n't maintain special connections with the committee , however , nor do i pretend to speak for novell if you look at novell 's patent portfolio as a whole and in particular , if you look at the bulk of the work done in the past five years you ca n't help but notice that the single largest category of inventions has to do with security if you go to the uspto website and so a search on patents with security , trust , or authentication in the abstract , where novell is the assignee , you 'll come up with hits the search query i used was abst security or abst authentication or abst trust and an novell if you do a search on abst encryption , you 'll get another hits that 's hits out of granted patents roughly of the total having to do with encryption or security microsoft is well aware of its lagging reputation in matters involving security and the company well knows that the success of its initiatives in cloud computing , collaboration , and social networking will depend , in large measure , on whether it can present a credible security story to customers there 's a lot at stake to put it mildly compared to the size of the cloud computing , collab , and social markets , million is a pittance how good are novell 's security patents ? that 's another question many not all of them are genuinely clever exactly which ones microsoft has its eye on , though , is a secret probably only a few people in redmond know
