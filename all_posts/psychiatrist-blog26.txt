almost two weeks ago , it happened again a man with a history of psychiatric symptoms opened fire and killed people in the fort lauderdale airport in our book , committed , we have researched and written about mental illness and violence , guns , and specifically addressed the question of can forced psychiatric care prevent mass murders ? pete earley , on his blog , offers the idea that it would help to change the standard for involuntary care from dangerous to a need for treatment you can read pete 's blog , another mass murder with plenty of warning signs we need to address the dangerous criteria but clinkshrink does n't agree with pete that the issue is one of who we force into care she says we 'd be safer if we took guns from people who exhibit dangerous behaviors , not specific diagnoses pete 's always up for a good debate , so he asked her to write about her ideas and posted them on dr hanson offers a different view about mass murder and the dangerous criteria i have my own thoughts on all of this in clinical psychiatry news , i wrote an article directed to mental health professionals in analyses of fort lauderdale shooting need a reset and in the the baltimore sun , an op ed article tragedy again spotlights mental illness there have been so many articles by other people attributing mass murders to everything from terrorism to mental illness to guns to psychiatric medications one that stirred me was an article in the sun sentinel by congressman timothy murphy , who drafted the helping families in mental health crisis act now passed as the mental health reform act of as a response to the newtown tragedy of in his op ed piece , system failure not treating the mentally ill has consequences , murphy makes assumptions about the sequence of events in the fort lauderdale shooting that we just do n't know i responded to his article on psychology today in laws to force treatment are not the answer to mass murders so if you have n't had enough of us ! we were on a local npr radio affiliate this morning sheilah kast 's on the record talking about our book and you can listen on wypr 's website here last night we taped a segment for forward motion , a montgomery county , maryland television talk show with host karen allyn that will start airing at the very end of january and we 'll post a link when that is up and we are enjoying our minutes of fame , even if it 's on disturbing , but very important , topic as somber as this all is , one thing i do n't think we get across is that committed is about people and their stories , it 's not just research and facts , and the book is meant to be accessible and compelling to anyone interested in the topic , not just psychiatrists
