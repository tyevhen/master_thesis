winter kept us warm , covering earth in a forgetful snow , feeding a little life with dried tubers t s eliot these days in whitehorse , the sun rises at about am and sets just before pm that 's precious hours to cast a shadow and the sun does n't mess around true , the dawns and dusks seem more lengthy , but the darkness always wins i feel as though i am on a night shift , even though i have never worked one before the other morning , lying in bed , cocooned in a web of blankets and i thought about what changes i notice most about these colder days my sweet cottage is a tiny castle diminutive in size but large in charm i love that it has a slant cupboard doors swing open wildly , my studio chair is always wanting to roll away from the easel it reminds me of quaint little cottages in newfoundland it only has two rooms , plus a small bathroom it is all i need it does n't take you long in a small space to realise how much is superfluous you become discerning out of necessity dawn at fish lake a few weeks ago in the mornings , in the dark , there are few sounds outside of my cottage my bed is against two exterior walls , so it is quite refreshing when it is c i huddle under my hudson 's bay blanket and icelandic throw picked up in reykjavik i hear cars driving slowly down the lane way behind the cottage , the snow protesting in strange , dry squeaks my neighbour says foxes are fond of the lane way , which makes me happy , knowing they are out there padding around in their fluffy auburn raiment as i drove along robert service way paralleling the yukon river there other day i saw a fox cross up ahead of me thankfully he stood still and regarded me as i drove past this beautiful creature out in the freezing cold , just doing his thing lovely the windows of rose cottage have had a whole story of their own this past month as the cold has set in i have moisture in my cottage that is forming elaborate ice formations , almost stalactites , inside my storm windows , and in the case of my bedroom window , which does n't have a storm window , in my room it 's weird to see the ice there , not melting , even though my cottage is c outside the ice blooms into floral patterns , dancing horses , tendrils of icy , tiny leviathans , otherworldly plants watching them shift with the alternating temperature is like watching clouds pass overhead and forming them into stories when it gets below minus the cold starts to do crazy things everything becomes more brittle even the water in our bodies starts to slow down and freeze the pain of having exposed flesh sets in quickly i have already begun stocking my car with emergency supplies , even though i do n't want to drive too far out of town until i get snow tires layers of light at fish lake sasha 's coat is getting thicker by the day i love that he is on this journey with me , adapting and learning about life up here in the north the biggest bummer is the ice on the windows while beautiful , it is an impediment for him as he loves watching the world go by in a square cottage , he can use all of the activity he can find he is my constant companion , km driven together across this great country of canada i am proud of him a tiny trooper sasha fierce mist rising off of the yukon river at am last week the other day it was about c with the windchill i saw light and mist rising off of the yukon river in a few minutes i had snapped a photo of a sun dog my first ! it is a beautiful phenomenon that i believe is specific to cold environments it has to do with some sort of specific refraction of light i think it 's a bit of magic undeniably the darkness is pervasive this time of year it is new , and fun , and slightly intimidating but i realized the other morning with some momentary clarity when you are happy , no amount of darkness matters
