eric kandel , md nobel laureates do n't come to minnesota very often but they apparently come at least once a year to gustavus adolphus college and the annual nobel conference this year 's conference was particularly interesting to me because it starred the only modern psychiatrist to be a nobel laureate eric kandel he shared the podium with his wife and research collaborator denise kandel eric kandel is a giant in neuroscience and has continued to extend his research well into the time in life where most people have been retired for years in my addiction lectures , i use his well known paper psychotherapy and the single synapse published in and his recent work on nicotine exposure and the risk of cocaine use entitled a molecular basis for nicotine as a gateway drug published in as lecture references kandel has been a neuroscientist and a psychiatrist longer than i have been a psychiatrist the other aspect of kandel 's more accessible work is his ability to integrate basic neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience into a coherent story of possibilities the best example is the book the age of insight that i briefly reviewed on this blog it is clear from reading kandel that he has a lot on his mind and he is actively seeking answers and organizing his observations another feature that piqued my interest in this case was why he was presenting at an addiction conference in a state where many people believe that addiction treatment was invented i did not find out about the conference until it was too late to take time off of work to attend i was very pleased to find the presentations and q a sessions by eric kandel and denise kandel available online there are a total of videos and they will load and play in succession there may be more videos with the kandels but i only watched these four in the first session kandel discusses some of the early discoveries in brain systems and how the idea of localization of brain function played out for most physicians with a passing knowledge of aphasia and strokes it is a bit tedious eventually he gets to a discussion of memory localization and talks about implicit and explicit memory that allows him to look at different features , animal models and the molecular biology of these types of memory he goes on to look at age associated memory loss and alzheimer 's disease and the different brain substrates and mechanisms at that point some of his slides illustrate chromatin and transcription sites but he does not get bogged down in the details as he defers the chromatin issue to a later presentation and discusses rbap as a critical transcription factor in the formation of long term memories he showed a plausible mechanism for exercise leading to osteocalcin secretion from bones and improvement in memory as one possible humoral factor associated with vigorous exercise in terms of style points , he had great graphics especially the diagram of the dna strand wrapped around histone octamers and how the transcription process is affected by various molecules he was clearly there to present a lot of information to non molecular biologists he was a little hurried at times he makes a few misstatements and gets distracted like all of us do during presentations he interjects some humor along the way as the presentation continues it is clear that this is important information the q a session was focused primarily on the question is addiction a brain disease ? the other panelists and their biographical sketches can be viewed at this page i did not realize it until after i had viewed all of the sessions that the lectures were not a good fit in terms of answering that question the lectures were focused on the neurobiology of learning and how epigenetic changes due to nicotine exposure lead to other addictions they were not lectures on the neurobiology of addiction per se , but there were some partially suggested mechanisms related to kandel 's work on memory addiction being a brain disease was really not the point of the lectures it was obvious that the other panelists were at the minimum resistant to the idea but there was also open opposition if you read the biographical sketches one of the panelists has written a book on why addiction is not a disease if they really wanted to argue that point they could have brought me down for a neurobiology of addiction lecture and i could have dissected the arguments about addiction being a disease or not a much better idea would be to bring eric nestler in for the lecture the panelists seemed of the opinion that plastic changes in the brain were normal and therefore plastic changes in the brain caused by addictive compounds was not a sign of pathology some seemed not to be focused on the brain at all but cultural or social factors that they thought were important in at least one case , they seemed to suggest that addiction needs to occur in a certain context that all addictions are not created equal the example given was a wealthy white guy with a cocaine addiction could just jet off to the caribbean and go swimming as a way to deal with his addiction someone else would not have that opportunity kandel had a singular focus that all human behavior , that everything that we are occurs because of what is happening in the brain he kept going back to this idea and pointed out that alterations in brain plasticity certainly occur during addiction but they are negative and not positive changes he of course agrees that social and psychological processes are important intervening factors but all of the processing occurs at the level of the brain some of the panelists seemed uncomfortable with this basic idea and he got into it with one of them , but eventually summarized the problem as a lack of a common culture he extended that comment to include the idea that the panel is discussing these problems so that younger generations in the audience will not have to start at that contentious point to me it came back to the mismatch between the kandels' lectures on the epidemiology and molecular biology of nicotine as a gateway drug and the other panelists arguing that addiction was not a disease denise kandel began the third session reviewing the epidemiology of when people start using addictive substances and what the relationship is to nicotine in general , nicotine use is a strong predictor of cocaine use and ongoing cocaine use she analyzed three databases that are essentially cross sectional surveys of substance use including the nsduh national survey on drug use and health , mtf monitoring the future and nesarc the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions she discussed the concept of translational epidemiology or making population wide observations and then looking at models to explain the observations she had what i would call a critical observation on the observed drop in cocaine use and cocaine related mortality and cigarette use the recent drop in cocaine related mortality seems to correlate with a decrease in smoking eric kandel stepped in for the basic science section to elaborate on the mechanism of histone acetylation and how that occurs from nicotine exposure denise kandel returned to talk about the problems with e cigarettes as potentiating factors for the use of other drugs and also as probably not a good way to stop smoking if you had time to watch one of the videos i would recommend this one the final q a session was an interesting one one of the panelists talked about the sociological theories of drug use rather than a gateway involving a biological substance for example , the fact that you take a substance that makes you feel good , increases the likelihood that you will take additional compounds that will do the same and that you will associate with people who have common interests and they will encourage further drug use kandel had three comments during this session that i thought were very interesting the first involved the scientific rationale of a reductionist approach when you hear it explicitly stated rather than being used in a vague and rhetorical manner it makes a lot more sense the second had to do with a painting by gustav klimt called judith beheading holofernes judith i and the head of holofernes he tells the story about this biblical incident and discusses how this is a painting that combines elements of aggression and sensuality and how recent work by anderson has shown that there is a overlap between areas of the brain that govern aggressive behavior and areas that govern sexuality and reproductive behavior at one point kandel seemed frustrated by some other panel members and made a reference to reproducibility that may have startled a few of them denise kandel had previously alluded to the bias against reductionism in her discussion with the statement it 's a reductionist approach to which some members of this audience are going to object strenuously the videos were very affirming for me when i think about the lectures i give on kandel 's work and some of the posts on this blog i am confident that i have come to the same conclusions that he comes to about the brain and about reductionism of course it is easier for me , because he provides the conclusions and i merely teach them i do n't think that everybody has come to those conclusions either at a scientific or philosophical level it is too easy to get hung up on polarizing questions and political debates about science these days , especially using imprecise definitions like the word disease or claiming that reductionism is a fatal flaw rather than a good way to do science it is too easy to mistake journalism in many cases hatchet job journalism for science the other striking factor is that this is a brain centric view of the world and that seems like the only logical approach to me various critics will attack the brain centric view of neuroscience or psychiatry in ways that seem to miss the point much of the criticism comes down to the definitions of diseases or disorders and the idea that a biomedical approach to the brain means that only biomedical treatments are possible i think that it might be easier to reconcile the brain centric view if the ultimate result of that view is considered and that is tremendous computational power that results in billions of people with billions of unique conscious states that is the ultimate product of what dr kandel is talking about in terms of human learning how it affects the conscious state and the associated brain substrate that may have something to do with biomedical treatments , but it also applies to every other intervention that can be brought to bear to facilitate recovery to make an even more obvious argument the cure is in your head not out in the ether somewhere the corollary is that it is important to know what those mechanisms are if you have time , watch these videos it is a rare chance to see one of the brightest guys in psychiatry and neuroscience in action i would also encourage reading the age of insight it left me with the impression that this is a scientist at the top of his game and it is
