dear curtiss i do not know how to thank you because i cannot believe how happiness changed my life suddenly after the struggling thanks so much again r dear r you are welcome but remember , as the i ching counsels , there s no plain not followed by a slope you will always have ups and downs , highs and lows just anticipate that another low will come sooner or later and you won t have to be afraid because you are prepared , you know how to get out of it by the way i m intrigued with your out of the box exercise and have been using it sometimes for my own depression when it hits it is a great device for immediately accessing the neocortex and when you do that , the sense of hopelessness and futility seem to fade immediately probably because , since you are putting depression in a box , obviously you cannot be helpless the physical symptoms might continue for a while but the sense of hopelessness and futility are the most painful when they are gone , the other is more like a toothache instead the end of life as you know it a b curtiss
