welcome to the latest interview with a grown unschooler ! if you 'd like to participate in this project , go here , and if you 'd like to read other interviews with grown unschoolers , go here and now , meet cheyenne la vallee i am a skwxw mesh kwakwaka wakw youth from british columbia i have been raised in the skwxw mesh squamish community of xwmelch stn capilano in north vancouver , but my ancestry also comes from the kwakwaka wakw nation on northern vancouver island for the past year , i 've been working with my brother , sister and other community members to revive our culture , our language and traditions specifically the work i 've been doing involves urban agriculture , community gardens and traditional plant knowledge when did you become an unschooler ? i became an unschooler when i read grace llewelyn s the teenage liberation handbook at years old and then left school shortly after but honestly , everyone is born with the abilities an unschooler has , it just gets beaten out of us after a few years of schooling and consuming mainstream media everyone has it in themselves to be passionate and motivated how long have you unschooled did you unschool ? i ve been unschooling for years now how old are you now ? i m seventeen years old if you chose to leave school , can you talk a bit about what led to that decision , and how the actual process of leaving went how did your parents , friends , teachers , etc react ? what were the challenges you faced , and how did you overcome them ? around the time i left school , my mother became an elected official in our community and i was beginning to pay attention to the conversations that were going on around me , as well as in the world i began to become aware of the common ideas or notions i was being told throughout my life were not true at all , so when my brother handed me the teenage liberation handbook one afternoon , it was like another piece of the puzzle it was also the sanest idea i ever heard ! not everyone agreed , especially not my mom she gave me an ultimatum , back to school or get a job , which never came into effect i faced a lot of resistance from older family members and friends parents it was hectic in my relationships afterwards , which is understandable it was incredibly abnormal i was years old and no one could persuade , threaten , or bribe to go back to school i had a strong will and was choosing for myself what kind of life i wanted to live in retrospect , i probably would have approached people differently what do you think the best thing about unschooling is ? to unschool is to live that s it plain and simple it s to feel the fire in the belly and your mind explode it s to sit in the living room on a snowy night with a cup of tea while reading your favourite book until wee hours in the morning it s to wake up at am to watch the sun rise and then go back to bed it s having that stranger sitting beside you become your best friend for the next hour it s going on a crazy adventure to listen to your favourite author talk in the next city it s volunteering at the art gallery or anarchist bookstore its life anything you want it to be the canoe races this summer and a part of my canoe family what do you think the worst or most difficult thing about unschooling is ? in the beginning of my unschooling journey , i had many questions what , where , how and no tools to find the answers i also had very little support or understanding from the people i needed it most from being shut down after trying to bring up the idea really makes one feel hopeless , especially when i was doing it mostly alone what jobs ways of earning money do you , and have you , had ? my first job was an anti oppression , arts based employment training program , being offered by this youth run , arts media centre after that , i worked for a local community garden , mainly taking care of the garden , weeding and planting , but also asking questions whenever i could the last job i had been with a non profit , environmental youth alliance , as an intern for six months it was such a rewarding job there were roughly interns , including myself , taking care of three community gardens e y a managed in the downtown eastside i learned more about the city i live in , other ways of living and eating , gardening , and how valuable community places are have you found work that 's fulfilling and enjoyable ? i definitely have ! have you found that unschooling has had an impact on how hard or easy it is to get jobs or earn money ? i think it has made finding work easier for me i only apply for jobs that i have an interest in , or at least a reason for applying , like it helps me save up for a goal my enthusiasm comes out and i find it increases my likelihood of getting the job do you feel that unschooling has had an impact on what methods of earning money or jobs you 're drawn to ? the material i ve read found online , like grace llewelyn s the teenage liberation handbook , blake bole s college without high school and his website , zero tuition college as well as other unschooling blogs has helped me figure out different ways of doing things in general it also helped me understand getting a minimum wage job isn t the only option i have there are other ways of getting money to do cool things what impact do you feel unschooling has had on your life ? it has been an extremely positive one it has helped me cross that superficial realm in what it means to be an indigenous woman living in modern times before all i knew about who i was , where i come from , and what i wanted to be was driven by school and my peers , which is a pretty horrible place to figure out who you are the main goal of school and mainstream media , especially for first nations people , is to assimilate us into western society after leaving school , i started to become more involved in the community , participating in culture events , and taking an active step in learning my language , territory and politics my brother , sister and i if you could go back in time , is there anything about your learning educational journey that you 'd change ? no , there isn t anything i d change , i don t think i would have as much understanding of how life is without the mistakes and challenges i ve faced even if i might have missed an opportunity because of not doing anything seemingly productive , there is and will always be millions more to come if you were to have children , would you choose to unschool them ? without a doubt , i would never send my children to compulsory schools it goes against my entire life ! what advice would you give to teens looking to leave high school ? be gentle on yourself , but be courageous listen to the people who question whether you are doing something right or wrong and then move on only you can define your life
