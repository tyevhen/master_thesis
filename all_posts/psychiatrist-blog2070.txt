i woke up this morning in lake como hard to imagine it 's been a long day , including a delayed flight , a two hour drive on this end , and my son 's entire wardrobe is currently presumed to be somewhere in europe , hopefully headed home soon after ten days in tuscany , baltimore never looked more drab when i go on vacation , i always worry , even if just a little i have patients fortunately just a couple who fret for weeks in advance about my absence the funny thing is that the patients who worry most about my vacation tend to be the ones i worry about the least there is always at least one psychiatrist available for emergency coverage for this trip there were three doctors covering and i remain torn about whether to leave my contact information these are competent , experienced psychiatrists who can manage any emergencies just fine without me , but what if ? ? ? not to mention the fact that it 's rare that anyone actually calls my coverage for anything other than prescription refill authorization , and even then , folks usually have checked their supplied before i 've departed , or somehow they manage so , if i leave contact information and i hear nothing , i can assume everything is fine or if i call and check my voicemail , and there is nothing earth shattering , i can also figure everything is fine but if something is n't fine , if i'm checking my messages , calling people back , getting aggravated about the non urgent things people want oh , despite the i'm away and unavailable message , repeated demands that i call back as soon as i return because there is going to be an issue with the patient 's insurance next month not my idea of what needs my immediate attention upon re entry then am i really even on vacation ? i feel like one of seligman 's rats in a learned helplessness experiment the light is n't on , it 's safe , if the light is on , watch out here comes the shock really , though , doctor , it started in my professional childhood a newbie to private practice , i was off for just a few days , and having not yet figured out that they could live without me , i gave my contact information to the covering doc , also a newbie i left worrying about a patient who had uncharacteristically missed an appointment with me the morning before my departure as my husband packed the car , i made one more call to his house and left yet another message on his machine his mother , upon hearing my messages , called the covering doc who then called me to say he 'd been killed in a car accident there was nothing i could do , but i spent my short vacation second guessing myself was it really an accident ? could i have , should i have , done something different the accident was his fault , was there something i could have foreseen about his mental state that predisposed him to being in the wrong place at the wrong time ? i also spent my trip grieving the tragic loss of a promising young life , i was very fond of this gentleman if i had it to do over , would i have simply not wanted to know for a few more days ? even asking feels selfish i have n't found the right answer , nor am i really looking i do n't let myself check my voicemail , it tends to aggravate me it is , however , the first thing i do when the plane lands , while i'm waiting for the baggage to arrive or not , and i always feel a bit of relief when nothing too bad has happened no one i was worried about called there was however a message from a new referral asking that i call her back right away as she wanted to be seen within hours hmmm clinkshrink , do you see 'em that fast in prison ? ? and for this time , the answer was that the morning i left , i emailed the covering docs with a phone number for my international cell phone jet lagged , feeling like it 's am , on my twelfth or so it feels like it load of laundry , wishing for my tuscan hilltop , but mostly glad to be home and can you believe that neither clink nor roy posted any pics or cartoons while i was gone ? ? ?
