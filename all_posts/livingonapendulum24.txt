hello all happy new year i apologize for my time away , also for restricting my blog temporarily you see i have had very little to say in the last little while that was not a mere repetition of what i have previously already said there are just so many ways you can say the same thing without just becoming dull as , well what exactly is that dull ? i am going back to work soon and my return is already not going very smoothly also , the new year has not started very well either as my son 's laptop has broken i am due back at work on the th of january it scares me i am not sure i am quite ready but i have to face the music eventually i am to go back part time , which will pay about the same as when i was on employment insurance i hope to qualify for my insurance to pay the balance but i have yet to know if that will be the case there are no guaranties you see some limitations and accommodations are suggested for my return as i should not yet deal with difficult clients as i have yet to start my therapies these things take time if they cannot accommodate me then i may not be able to return as quickly , so the insurance will become paramount i am still not sleeping very well and the times i sleep best are in the morning unfortunately , it 's morning i am to work maybe i will be able to change it later if it 's not working we 'll see i am on medications and they are helping with my mood but i am still wrought with moments of anxiety and despair at times , so fearful of setting the house on fire needless to say i still struggle with my self esteem it 's unbelievable that i have already been off work for three months i have done so little time has flown i will let you know how things go once i am back at work thanks for reading you might also like health update a quick update ! depression , pain and sick leave linkwithin
