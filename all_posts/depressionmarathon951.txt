like so many inspirational stories before this one , the piece i just read includes a description of the author weaning herself from all anti depressant medication i loved the story it was very inspirational i generally love stories about people conquering any mental illness the author of this piece described how running keeps her mood elevated and prevents the return of depression 's darkness i get it as the author notes , and as i 've written about previously , exercise has been shown to improve mood in those with depression but why does every inspirational story seem to include an either or medication dilemma ? why do n't we highlight stories which include the use of medication as part of a successful treatment plan ? the author of this story never suggested that people should n't use meds she noted her negative side effects she pointed out that anti depressants often lose effectiveness over time , and for her they just did n't do the trick unfortunately , i fear people reading her story will conclude that meds are n't effective and or are n't necessary it 's nicer to believe that depression can be cured by thinking happy thoughts and exercising but meds are effective , and for many of us they are absolutely necessary like the author , i use running to cope with my depression however , running is not my sole therapy i believe i take fewer meds because i run , but without meds my depression takes over my depression requires medication , sobriety , and talk therapy to stay in check running is just one piece of a successful treatment plan i 'd like to read an inspirational story which includes medication , if only to dispel the myth that anti depressants are n't needed if one lives right and that 's the problem , the myth that anti depressants are n't necessary if you just fill in the blank with any of the following pray , laugh , smile , think happy thoughts , exercise but anti depressants , just like anti cancer drugs , do work for many of us taking meds does not indicate a moral failure or lack of effort on the part of the sufferer unfortunately , every time i read a great story about someone conquering depression , and part of the story describes weaning off medication , i fear the myths about combating this illness are reinforced what do you think ?
