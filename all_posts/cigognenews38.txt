in childhood i talked so fast that is was hard to understand me , and i never knew why then i had the key feeling my father was so anxious that he could not sit still and pay attention when i did have to ask him something , i sensed his impatience and hurried through it i talked fast he also never wanted to hear anything i said so he would find reasons to delay listening ca n't you see i am busy ? i got punished for asking because it was never at the right time he had no time for me in fact , he did n't want me around he never addressed me unless it was a criticism stand up straight , stop talking through your nose i had a constant running nose mostly , it was stop bothering me he had no time for me the fates got him at age with a giant heart attack i began crying at home on the way to the cemetery and my mother ran out screaming , he 's crying ! he 's crying ! the opposite of a compassionate mother she had no interest in acting maternal because she was a five year old and talked baby talk crying became an anathema it was nowhere in the family lexicon i never saw either parent show any feeling in my lifetime it was a robotic existence but my metabolism was set to churn at the pace of their indifference their whims became my destiny when they decided to move , there was no warning or explanation just pack and get going talking to me was a reminder that there was a job to do take care of me they wanted no reminder of that i slowed way down later on as i slipped into my feelings about how they had children but wanted nothing to do with them i was an orphan with a mommy and daddy
