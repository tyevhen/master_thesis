dad , happy father 's day ! i hope you do n't mind that i highjacked facebook photos of you folks , my dad is awesome he always played catch with me he taught me card poker as a little kid he took me fishing with him whenever i asked he even trusted me with an x acto whittling knife when i was when i did cut myself , he made me wait until i was at least until i got the knife back lol ! ! ! he used to let me jump off his shoulders into the lake over and over again at that he helped me learn to ride a bike he always listened to me when i shared stories about school i remember taking turns reading heidi aloud with him what a guy ! he used to let me cuddle up on his lap and i 'd fall asleep on his shoulder in the rocking chair usually on sunday nights when he watched minutes the sound of the stopwatch still makes me yawn being a mom now , i understand why he cried for me when i broke my toe awww when i got older , he 'd take me shopping for clothes knowing i needed encouragement to come out of my shell a bit i 'll never forget when he took me shopping for my prom dress it was so sweet and later on in life , he came with my mom to help me find my wedding dress he just did n't want to miss a moment , even if it was one that was n't traditionally men would want to be part of he 's a tough guy , a strong guy , a silly guy , a very social guy who is the first to talk to all the strangers in the room and make lame jokes that 's what i love most about my dad he 's never been shy to be himself he 's unapologetic about his idiosyncrasies nor should he be i'm very proud of him for that , and for many other things he 's lead a very colorful life filled with interesting stories many i still have n't heard i never tire of them his boyhood days living in a little tenement apartment , his time doing his part fighting for our country in vietnam , his crazy times in boston after the war , when he met my mom and so forth as a funny story example dad one day informed me that if i was ever taken prisoner i should take my sock off , fill it with sand , and pee on it to make a billy club then , i was to beat my captor in the head with it and when he was down , kill him by jamming a pencil through his ear into his brain i guess this was a tip he learned in the army if he were taken as a pow and figured i should know about it just in case i always wondered who carries a pencil around with them so diligently ? but that 's the kind of random information he liked to share with us and i now mull over my father has always made me feel so special and important he always listened to my every problem no matter how lame or large and offered his most caring and sincere advice even to this day he lends an unconditional ear and helps keep me on track dad , thank you for being you not only did you teach me about what makes a great father , you taught me what makes a great man because of you , i found that in chris your never ending love and support will always live in my heart and now my own chidren 's hearts too i am forever grateful for you , but moreso , forever will i love you happiest father 's day to you love , meg or the mega muffin as you 've always called me save
