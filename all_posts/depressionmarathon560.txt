how fragile am i ? that 's the question i 've been asking myself over the past few days i'm frustrated and angry because i 've been sliding a little bit it 's not a big drop in my mood , but it scares me nonetheless and i immediately want to know why why am i sliding ? what 's going on ? that 's where the fragility question comes in as i asked my treatment team in an e mail yesterday , can i not handle any stress in my life ? is the prospect of a new job with the possibility of increased hours that overwhelming ? can social security disability insurance really wreak this much havoc in my life ? am i that fragile ? the possibility of a new job and the ssdi nightmare those are the two things causing me stress right now those are the causes on which i think i can blame the slide but am i that fragile ? i am going to encounter stresses like this , or stresses worse than this , for the rest of my life how the hell will i handle life if these two current events are enough to send me tumbling ? this illness makes me feel so vulnerable whereas normal people have the luxury of seeing themselves securely carrying out their future plans , i'm never sure those plans will come to fruition i 'd like to look into the future with an air of certainty an air of certainty that it , and i , will be there , get there , live it i'm tired of not knowing if , or when , the other shoe is going to drop i'm tired of being vulnerable to the whims of this illness how fragile am i ? have my job interview and ssdi nightmare begun a slide without end ? will i handle the stress without falling off the cliff ? or is this the beginning of another end ? i do n't think so i hope not i do n't know that 's just it i do n't know i ca n't know i have to accept the vulnerability this illness forces upon me and i have to accept the fact that i may never be able to look into the future with an air of certainty
