i'm busy packing tonight , as i am leaving tomorrow for a long weekend at the lake my new friend , d , and i are spending some time together at his lake home i 'll also see my parents and hopefully get in a little fishing i 've been extremely busy at work i 've worked the last three days in a row , and we 've been swamped with patients the days have been crazy i ca n't really explain it things have just been a little off kilter the patients seem sicker and more debilitated , which means a lot more physical lifting and maneuvering , and the paperwork is never ending so far i'm handling it okay , but it is exhausting it would probably be less exhausting if i was n't getting up at am to run , swim , or otherwise work out but seems to be working for me i'm able to run outside and miss the heat of the day i'm able to get to the circuit training and spinning classes at the gym and then i'm able to relax at home and eat a leisurely breakfast before work or , like i did this morning , do some laundry ! i know i would n't work out or run if i left it to be done after work there just does n't seem to be enough time in the evenings , and like i said , work exhausts me anyway ! my training is going well i 'll run with d this weekend it will be our first run together , and i usually train alone , so i'm interested to see how it goes i only have miles scheduled saturday next week is my last miler before my taper begins it 's hard to believe i 've got another marathon just around the corner that 's all i 've got for now i 've got to get back to packing a long drive awaits me tomorrow , but there is a long weekend waiting once i arrive yippee ! i'm really looking forward to it i 'll let you know how it goes
