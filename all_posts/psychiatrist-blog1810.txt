i posted briefly about pay for performance pp efforts earlier , describing them as the next step in attempts to reduce health care costs while wrapping it up in a package to make it look like an attempt to improve quality i remain skeptical that this is the wrong approach insurance company bureaucrats will have us teaching to the test in the same way that primary education has gone and with the same disastrous outcomes , i fear kids can answer the questions , but can they think ? do we want doctors who just focus on keeping hemoglobin ac 's down , speeding up the time that you get the first antibiotic during abdominal surgery , and counting up the number of cardiac patients they have on beta blockers ? will we get lost in the forest , just tending to the trees ? harvard economist , michael e porter , in last week 's jama , addresses pp and broader health care delivery issues in a manner which i find very appealing it places physicians back at the table , while holding us and others accountable for adding value by collaboratively focusing on patient outcome not process to improve patient care while controlling costs in the article , how physicians can change the future of health care , he describes an approach to competitive , cost effective health care that places the patient back in the center is n't that what it 's all about ? , while teams of health care providers work together in parallel not serially to address each patient 's needs as a connected team , not as an assembly line product this is apparently what m d anderson and mayo have been doing for some time take a look at this article and see what you think if you ca n't get access to the whole document , email me at mythreeshrinksatgmaildotcom , and i could send you a few pertinent paragraphs for educational purposes only for the purpose of comment and criticism or , get his book
