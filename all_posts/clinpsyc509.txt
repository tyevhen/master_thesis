earlier this week , in response to a post about diabetes medications potentially helping in weight management for children taking atypical antipsychotics , the last psychiatrist chimed in with the following comment , which i reproduce in full below nejm study this week showing glucophage and avandia were both better than glyburide avandia worked slightly longer than glucophage about a year but avandia came with much more weight gain lbs vs a loss of lbs for glucophage and edema and glucophage has already been studied as a weight loss agent in non diabetic , non antipsychotic using obese teens and middle aged adults but the weight loss , again , is about lbs so it is n't surprising that glucophage caused weight loss , and i do not think it 's effect has any relation to inhibiting the weight gain of antipsychotics , per se the real question , of course , is why anyone would ever do this maneuver when there are so many other , simpler maneuvers you could do p s if you take glucophage , be careful of lactic acidosis dehydration , nsaids , kdiney problems , etc his comments have always been of the highest quality and have often added a great deal of educational value to the site you should be checking out his site regularly
