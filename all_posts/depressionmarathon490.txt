i'm feeling a bit sad tonight i 've been missing d all week for some reason it still feels like he just walked out the door , that fresh sadness it 's different for me to miss him like this we have a long distance relationship , after all if i miss him this much every time he goes , i'm in trouble on top of missing him , i'm missing my mom already although we will be spending days in new york together beginning next weekend , she just left minnesota for the winter she and my step dad go south for the winter months they wo n't be back until next may she had been around here for the past couple of weeks , and we spent a lot of time together it was nice i feel a little silly for missing her already i am grateful for the relationship we have today so i'm feeling a little sad tonight and even though i 've identified the cause of the sadness , feeling sad still makes me a bit uneasy sad feels a little too similar to depression for me to be totally comfortable with it but i do n't expect this sadness to morph into depression i think i'm just sad i 've not much more to say than that
