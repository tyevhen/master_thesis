everyone who tries to become better informed about the science behind psychiatric medications sooner or later has to deal with a rather large and frustrating problem , which is that the published scientific literature on commercial drugs is spotty in quality and of dubious reliability i 've mentioned before the excellent paper on plos called why most published research findings are false , by dr john p a ioannidis interested readers will also want to consult a atlantic article called lies , damned lies , and medical science , and this recent and extensive british analysis of bias in the scientific literature these works mostly deal with publication bias selective publication of studies and results , but the problems with medical research go much deeper than that some of the problems have to do with things like study design , but there are also deep ethical issues around ghostwriting and guest authorship , undisclosed conflicts of interest , and other issues that generally are n't issues in other realms of science , such as say theoretical physics it helps , when reading papers , to have degrees in science which i do , but even then it can be tricky to tell a reliable paper from a not so reliable paper which is why i'm glad i stumbled across gartlehner g , et al , second generation antidepressants in the pharmacologic treatment of adult depression an update of the comparative effectiveness review , rockville md agency for healthcare research and quality us dec comparative effectiveness reviews , no in appendix d of this page book there 's a detailed listing , prepared by the report 's authors on behalf of the u s dept of health and human services , of scientific papers all having to do with second generation antidepressants that were found to be of poor quality i 've reproduced that listing here full references are given further below item in the list of references is a paper on how poor quality is determined papers through are the actual scientific papers that were found to be of poor quality i decided to reproduce the list here as a kind of note to self that i can refer back to later , when i'm reading some of the papers , but also as a reminder to myself and others that the literature surrounding many of the latest drugs for the treatment of depression is basically not to be taken at face value all scientific literature in all fields needs to be viewed critically that 's not the issue the issue is that the scientific literature surrounding psychiatric drugs is particularly treacherous which drugs do the papers talk about ? they all refer to one or more of the medications shown in this table generic name u s trade name bupropion wellbutrin wellbutrin sr wellbutrin xl citalopram celexa desvenlafaxine pristiq duloxetine cymbalta escitalopram lexapro fluoxetine prozac prozac weekly fluvoxamine luvox mirtazapine remeron remeron sol tab nefazodone serzone paroxetine paxil paxil cr sertraline zoloft trazodone desyrel venlafaxine effexor effexor xr these drugs represent some of the most popular medications in america today all of these drugs are approved for use in treatment of depression except for luvox , which is widely prescribed off label for depression the only approved use of luvox is for ocd in the table immediately below , itt refers to intention to treat analysis ltf refers to loss to followup bias
