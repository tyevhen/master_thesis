we 're having a beautiful blizzard today ! the snow is fluffy and deep it 's a perfect day to hunker down in pajamas , sip some warm cocoa , and then take a long nap , which is what i plan to do as soon as i finish my laundry unfortunately , i guess this beautiful snow is to be followed by near record low temperatures i'm not so fond of those i had intended to do my long run outside this morning , but the depth of the snow meant i could n't keep a decent pace so i headed to the gym and galloped on the treadmill for minutes yuck my effort always feels greater when i run on the treadmill and my legs were tired today i'm sure i'm still feeling the effects of the marathon i'm still glowing from the marathon , too i'm going to hang onto that glow for as long as it will carry me why not , right ? i'm glowing so brightly i ca n't wait to do it again ! austin ca n't get here soon enough i just hope i can do most of my training outside life is running along quite smoothly , and i like that days like these make depression feel like a distant memory i like that , too it 's funny , because i 've been discussing my depression a lot lately whether it 's been reconnecting with old friends , meeting new people , or just ending up in discussions about mental illness , my depression has been a hot topic i find it hard to impress upon people how debilitating depression is when i'm feeling so well , but i 'll take that dilemma over feeling like crap any day of the week ! would n't you ? he is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not , but rejoices for those which he has epictetus
