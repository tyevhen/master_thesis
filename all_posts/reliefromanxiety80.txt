mental illness is a horrible disease it kills , it destroys people 's lives and it does n't have concern for who it attacks next i can safely say that during darkest depths of my depression , suicidal thoughts and anxiety , it was hell on earth and even to this day i can still struggle but in a strange way , i feel it has made me who i am i feel perhaps without this challenge in my life , i might not have achieved all of the things that anxiety has made me do i feel if i had n't been on this journey , then i would n't have gotten to the level of strength that i have today i do n't think i would have ever gotten out of my comfort zone and i reckon i would still be super shy with no driving license , without voluntary work and with never travelling by myself although this condition is so very detrimental , without the challenges that i had to overcome to live my life , i think i would still be doing very little and i think a lot of experiences i would have missed too , so in this way i am grateful i think it 's important to see what your journey has brought you even with all the hell that you have been through , looking to see if there has been any miraculous times during struggle , might help you i think you will surprised as to what you might find be proud , amy xx
