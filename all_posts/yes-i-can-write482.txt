my marvelous little friends july i learned that a guy i used to know when i was young has skin cancer he 's a couple of years younger than me , and has the worst type of skin cancer you can get , melanoma i spent that day comforting a friend of mine who still knows him well , and researching the disease quite educational , but very grim i wish him all the best and just hope that everything turns out fine july we already have a friend staying over this week pictured above , and a friend of hers also in above picture came over he 's awesome i 've been enjoying their company greatly july the cool dude slept over do i have the most awesome parents or what ? but sadly had to be brought home this evening his dad owns a hot sauce store , and he was telling us a bit about that also interesting about this guy , he 's an emo scene kid , which brings up all sorts of stuff about how teens have a need to fit in or rebel , how looks and style affects the way other people see you , etc quite fascinating really you might also like how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and the value in writing for an audience , not a grade life happening linkwithin
