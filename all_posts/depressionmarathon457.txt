it 's been really chilly and gray here i think it 's getting to me i saw my psychiatrist this morning and told her i was doing okay , which is true , but that 's it i'm not good i'm not bad i'm just okay my mood seems to be in a holding pattern , a slightly lower than normal holding pattern i guess i match the recent weather i'm gray gray is actually quite tiring i'm so tired ! i'm lacking motivation and spunk i feel like i'm walking through molasses in a fog i do n't like that feeling it 's a feeling i usually associate with being quite low , so of course it makes me nervous i'm hoping it passes before the other shoe drops today was a particularly slow , tired day i had things to do , but i could n't get off the sofa most of the day when i finally did get up , i took jet for a walk , and then feeling like i was on a roll , i decided to run maybe that was n't the best decision , because right now i can barely move ! my run was horrible my legs were dead weight my pace was slow my lungs could n't seem to take in enough air i even had to walk in the middle of a mile loop ! the combination of low motivation and poor physical response was too much to overcome i was frustrated , and i could n't wait to be done now i'm sitting here in sweats , barely maintaining my upright position , ready to hit the sofa once again i guess it 's just one of those days it 's one of those days i periodically experience , as i live with this illness of depression tomorrow will hopefully bring some energy and relief until then , my friends
