ok , i 'll admit the following story ai n't all that surprising unless your head has been firmly planted in the sand for the past several years that being said , i'm sure glad somebody reported it there is growing criticism of big pharma for failing to disclose results of clinical studies especially studies that provide information about the safety or effectiveness of medicines being taken by consumers take the case of gsk and two trials of valtrex vs famvir , in genital herpes the trials finished in , but the were only published last month the lead researcher for the studies complained she was never given a satisfactory explanation , and noted the drugmaker responsible for the delay also owns the medicine that fared poorly i was given all sorts of reasons , said anna wald , a professor of medicine at the university of washington , whose work comparing the two drugs was recently published in the journal sexually transmitted diseases it took years to receive any material , she said they should have moved faster to gain an edge , smithklinebeecham funded a pair of comparative studies such clinical trials are known as head to head studies , but are rarely undertaken voluntarily by drugmakers due to the expense and , in particular , the possibility that results will be unflattering in effect , smithklinebeecham took a gamble in hopes of goosing sales there was good reason in , the drugs were in a dead heat valtrex sales totaled million on million prescriptions , while famvir rang up million in revenue on million prescriptions , according to verispan , a market research firm a team of researchers led by wald conducted the studies in and , but smithklinebeecham never shared the results , even though wald said she repeatedly asked for the data as a result , wald said she had no way of knowing smithklinebeecham 's famvir compared unfavorably with valtrex in other words , smithklinebeecham lost its bet in , glaxo and smithkline merged , complicating the tale the combined company promptly sold famvir to novartis to satisfy anti trust concerns a glaxo spokeswoman said there was no information available about how the study data were handled at that time or why the data were n't given to wald by then , glaxo 's valtrex had taken the lead in , valtrex generated million in sales on million prescriptions famvir rang up million in sales on million prescriptions , according to verispan after the merger , wald said she began asking novartis for the study data , but did n't receive anything until early last year , when the drug maker sent what she described as an enormous box of papers she said novartis personnel insisted the data could n't be located there are two possible interpretations , said wald , who is also a consultant to novartis either the data got lost as part of the transfer from one company to another the other is that novartis did n't want to share the data be cause it was n't favorable to famvir , which might hurt the sales i do n't know which it is the novartis spokeswoman also explained famvir data were stored among , boxes sent by glaxo , and that talks began with wald in january but she could n't explain the delay between and late , when wald finally received the data hat tip the always ecellent pharmagossip p s do n't worry drug companies do n't have to share data with researchers just ask this guy
