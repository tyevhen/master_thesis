in october of last year , a paper was published on the findings of patients with kennedy 's disease here in the united states it is somewhat different in scope than the natural history of sbma report i discussed in may the information provided in this report was obtained during the last nih clinical trial the title of this report is clinical features of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy in today 's article i will highlight certain findings that i found interesting i would recommend that if you are interested , please follow the link above and read the entire paper this report also concluded that the longer the cag repeat length number , the earlier the onset it also commented that the longer the cag repeat length , the greater the abnormalities in motor and sensory nerve conduction to of the patients had some sensory problems they reported that there was a significant difference in the mune motor unit number estimation between sbma subjects and the control healthy group this sensory nerve issue nerve conduction has been one that has bothered many of us with kennedy 's disease for some time the tingling or numbness in the feet , hands or other parts of the body has been frustrating , because it had not been reported as a symptom until recently table reviewed the results of this study it also explained that the androgen receptor is a nuclear receptor that normally regulates gene expression and ligand binding normally testosterone and dihydrotestosterone recent studies indicate that these bindings are important in the development of kennedy 's disease it concluded that kennedy 's disease manifestations are primarily due to a ligand dependent toxic gain of function in the mutant androgen receptor whew what a mouthful they gave several examples of observations that promote this hypothesis the most affected adl activities of daily living were walking , falling , swallowing , speech , and handwriting only nine patients reported no difficulty with falling oh , to be so lucky the report had several charts and graphs amplifying the clinical findings and i encourage you to review them i will emphasize some of the interesting information below the average age of the first muscle weakness was range of to the mean average from time of noticing muscle weakness to clinical diagnosis was years the average age of diagnosis was years of the patients reported being misdiagnosed initially the average cag repeat length was range of to the most common initial symptom was muscle cramps followed by tremors and leg weakness half of the patients reported initial weakness in the legs while another third reported bulbar symptoms of the patients knew of other family members with kennedy 's disease of the patients had elevated creatine kinase the strength in muscle groups ranged from to of the healthy control group table was interesting to me the weakness was asymmetric in of the patients with having more weakness in the dominant side of the patients used assistive devices such as canes , walkers , or ankle foot orthoses one of the most interesting conclusions was in development of a treatment for sbma , early intervention may also be important to affect disease progression we , old codgers , lose out again another finding was interesting our finding that higher , not lower , testosterone levels are associated with better muscle strength and function indicates that it may be necessary to balance the anabolic strengthening effects of androgen receptors against any potential deleterious effects harmful , often in an unexpected way of androgen activated mutant androgen receptor toxicity another whew i need to determine what this actually means we know that testosterone is like poison to our defective mutant androgen receptor we also know that the ohio state trial of testosterone injections in the late s did not work yet , this study reflects that patients with higher testosterone levels had better muscle strength and that makes sense except that the higher the testosterone the greater damage to the muscles and motor neurons because the androgen receptor cannot do its day job nothing is every easy well , i hope you find this report as interesting as i did let me know your thoughts and conclusions if you have a chance
