often i keep my depression at bay with a heavy dose of silliness you may have noticed i realize that i take a hit in the respect department , but it 's my life and it works and it 's a whole heckuvva lot better than moping about wanting to die this is probably why i 've been enjoying playing around over at dailybooth com it 's a veritable logan 's run where i am the antediluvian aberration in a very young arena , but the community is so creative with their self portraits that i find it uplifting as well as inspiring i could write a blog like other depressives i 've come across sadness can in point of fact feed the muse if i were to give in to such urges , it might sound like this friday , february , am blackness envelops me with it 's comforting embrace shirts , pants , socks all dark as night i paint my eyes with the color of my anger die , world ! die ! i hate you all grawlix , i need my meds fortunately , i decided long ago that i 'd rather just take a goofy picture and move on that 's not to say that i do n't struggle some days can be harder than others take the last dozen or so the ticking has been out of control consequently , my productivity has been disasterous i alluded to it the other day however , i choose to keep upbeat as best i can there 's not really anything i can do about it , is there ? besides , as new reader kat pointed out i would bet that if you looked at your really important goals kids fed taxi 'd , homeschool done you 'd find you really did get a lot done this month she was right i had forgotten the biggest goal i had accomplished this month turning my sleep schedule around i had also discounted all the little things i do each day , such as tending to the girls , feeding them , putting out their fires , etc funny how we do that when we have our eyes set on the prize still , staying positive is often a difficult task when depression settles in , such as today i began the day in high hopes this was the day my wife was going to watch the kids so i could make a heroic stab at finishing my writing goals for the month i 'd leave the house and go to a caf somewhere and get busy but there was a discussion , and , after i was ready for the day , there was a two and a half hour errand finally , devoid of dinner filling my jiggly bits , i settled in to work at the local barnes noble feeling not a little bit dejected now i can finally dive into the picture book manuscript i 've been rewriting and fix the problems i think are preventing the story from getting published and hey , it 's only pm ! whoohoo ! but there i go sounding negative again time for a another silly picture like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe ! posted on the go with iblogger from my lifesaving iphone
