i'm not quite sure what to write about but i wanted to write a post ! so i 've been thinking a lot about unschooling lately thinking a lot about how much so many people seem to hate school and i 've been trying to figure out how i can promote unschooling , how i can help to let it be better known as an option for all the kids stuck in high school i have a few copies of the teenage liberation handbook left over from when i was using them as a fundraiser to get to camp , and i was thinking i could attempt to sell them outside a high school i mean hey , i need to sell them somewhere ! problem with that is , i really do n't want to do that alone knowing too many high school kids , it could get pretty rough verbally , and i do n't want to be the only one there to deal with things ! but emi does n't seem interested , and i do n't know anyone else who supports unschooling that i could drag along so i'm feeling mildly forlorn i'm doing some stuff , but i want to be doing more stuff and if i had more ideas of things to do in the first place , that might help sighs ideas , anyone ? please ? peace , idzie you might also like review of the teenage liberation handbook a trip to grandma 's , much conversation , and some good old tlh letter writing and grandma 's once again ! unschooling is forever part the teenage years linkwithin
