this could be a dangerous time i'm feeling a little bored i think i'm lost without something to direct my energy toward i 've done just a little exercise this week , not because i could n't , but because i 've not been motivated i'm feeling lazy and very heavy like i said , this could be a dangerous time i 've got to make some decisions about what to do next i'm planning on running a marathon in november again this year , so should i start focusing on running ? or should i keep up with the triathlon training and make a plan to do another ? do i have enough courage to try another triathlon ? that 's another story for a another time , i think the point is , i think i need to focus my energy soon the heavier and lazier i feel the heavier and lazier i tend to get i enjoy the triathlon training a lot it keeps me fresher i have n't had any nagging injuries despite months of continuous training i 've not been able to report that when i 've focused solely on running but i do n't like the way i 've been feeling when running racing lately my legs are n't as running strong and my endurance not as great as when i 've focused my training on running so i'm not sure what to do i think i 'd like to do another triathlon , but i'm certainly not feeling passionate about it i'm a bit leery i have several running races coming up on which i could focus regardless of what i decide to do likely triathlon training with a greater focus on running i need to get back to it soon this is a dangerous time boredom and heaviness are not good places for me to be
