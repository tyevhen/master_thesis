there is a story in today s paper about an overeater and how they are going to treat him and i thought , do they know why people overeat ? for the same reason that they overdrink and overdrug and overbuy and overtravel and over and over so when anyone does more than is normal it means they are filling old needs as well as current ones that is , there is the current need which triggers off the old need and makes for over now why do that ? because there are order levels of needs that correspond to levels of consciousness the first line deep brain level has the urgency of life and death it is not necessarily the need to eat but perhaps the need to live , the need for adequate oxygen and nutrients but that need stays open and unfulfilled when there is a current need , say , for food it can trigger off the old need and it drives the over the same on the second line when a child was not fed enough or perhaps fed too much based on the anxiety of the parent it is still an unfulfilled proper need and that can drive the later over ok , so there are levels of need , and as we descend down the chain of consciousness those needs get far more urgent because they often involve life and death events so when the fattie sees food he goes crazy with urgency because the old need for survival is driving it he eats for today , yesterday and the day before the same for alcohol one drinks now to be sociable but drinking ten drinks is no longer social , it is pathologic so let us not try to treat all this with current techniques when it is the past we must address somehow that has eluded all the drug and alcohol abuse centers it is not a lifestyle we need to change it is one s whole history , his physiology and brain function that is a bit more difficult when tiger woods sees breasts he sees pussy because if you see his mother , that hard bitten emotionless face , we see why he needs a woman s love now called sex he needs one after another is he that sexual ? his drive for oversex is old and new , but it is the old urgent unfulfilled need for love that makes it frantic in the present now does anyone think his rehab is going to work ? and by the way , what is a sex addiction i know sex but addiction ? if you like it as we all should , is it addicting ? only when it is inordinate most of us are not born with an inordinate sex drive but it becomes so when lack of fulfillment over years now drives sex it could have driven food or money , but here it is sex we need and have found a way to dip into the remote past that drives so many overs and eliminate compulsive eating , drinking and drugging what woods should have said is that it is no one s business with what i do with my peepee i did it cause my mother never loved me and that is that i got it elsewhere it was huge because my leftover need was huge
