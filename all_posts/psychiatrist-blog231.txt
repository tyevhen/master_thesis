happy holidays , everyone blogging has been a little slow here at shrink rap as the shrink rappers overdose on cookies and get caught up in all the usual holiday stresses that get to everyone i 've heard rumors that in the coming legislative session in maryland a bill may be proposed to make assisted outpatient treatment aot part of the landscape as it stands now , we are one of the few states that does not have aot , or forced treatment , for outpatients , outside of the forensic system for those on conditional release after having committed a crime often a violent crime since maryland does n't have aot , i have no experience with it perhaps it 's a good idea i do n't believe it 's humane to leave people living in the filth and cold on the streets if they have a psychotic illness that could be treated but i'm also well aware that treatment has side effects for some , and limited efficacy for others , and i worry that forcing people to get care in an already strained system is not the same as forcing them to get thoughtful , individualized care , with a spectrum of treatments being offered so i'm staying out of the discussion at this point , as all i can say is that i do n't know what the right thing is to do i do know that people have strong opinions if you live in a state with assisted outpatient treatment , and you 've been a part of the program , then i d love to hear your comments if you have a family member who gets aot , or are a doctor involved with such treatment , then i 'd love to hear your opinion as if you 've never personally been involved with forced outpatient care , even if you 've been involved with forced hospitalization , then i 'd like to ask you to hold your opinions for now i really would like to hear from the direct recipients of these treatments thanks so much !
