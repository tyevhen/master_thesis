hi there ! paige wanted to show you a few of the images we took from our walk today there is finally a bite to the air and the peak foliage is over this morning we were playing and playing and she began fussing and fussing sigh i feel like each day is starting to be the same thing over and over she must think so too how many exciting things can you do with a month old ? i'm running out of tricks up my sleeve i guess that 's why i decided we needed to go for a nice long walk around our side of town the sights kept us both entertained and now we 're ready to face the rest of the day refreshed any other mamas care to comment on the little activities they do with their babes ? paige spends a lot of time in her jumperoo , then she spends time on the blanket rolling around the floor and grabbing at her toys , then maybe we 'll read a short book and look at the pictures and we 'll walk around the house looking at all the things as she learns about what they are lately she 's been practicing sitting up alone and standing up while i hold her hands sometimes i 'll sing itsy bitsy spider while doing all the hand motions which she loves i'm now out of ideas ! p s paige went to her month checkup the other day and she now weighs lbs and oz she is inches tall still a tall lady ! save
