we moved in this house in when we moved in this house , our landlord had the bathtub changed they forgot to seal the overflow drain so we moved in and with my love of baths , i took my usual extra full soaks after a few , we noticed that water was leaking in the basement the bathtub was on the first level when i took my bath we realized that then that the overflow was not sealed and the water was flowing into the walls , down the main floor to the basement the wall it flowed down was the wall joining the kitchen with the living room we contacted the landlord and even though workers came to do some repairs , the bathtub was not sealed tired of waiting , we eventually sealed the overflow drain ourselves a few months later around xmas we noticed that there was mold on the wall and ceiling in the kitchen again we contacted the landlord to mention a list of things needing repairs workers came and did some weather stripping but did not look into the mold in the walls we asked a few times then gave up as some of you know , i recently bought a house , so i will be moving shortly i mentioned that i hope the landlord would finally fix the mold issue before renting to new tenants a friend mentioned that it was not wonder i was sick if i had been living with mold for several years so i decided to look into this whole mold thing regarding the symptoms of black mold poisoning , you do not have to have all of them , if you 've been exposed to toxic black mold you may have just one or two symptoms most people with significant exposure to toxic mold have more than two or three symptoms they usually have to ! muscle pain , cramps , burning , unusual shooting ice pick like pains headaches fatigue , weakness , flu like symptoms , fever , chills shortness of breath , cough abdominal pain , diarrhea chronic sinusitis , sore throat burning eyes , red eyes , sensitivity to light difficulty with thought processes , memory loss , loss of concentration , confusion , disorientation , brain fog dizziness , balance problems metallic taste in mouth numbness and tingling night sweats temperature regulation problems excessive thirst and urination rash excessive menstrual bleeding mylar flush face flushing i had this people thought i looked healthy because of it chest pains iga nephropathy kidney disease increased infections less common symptoms of black mold poisoning the sensation that you are going to pass out panic attacks tremors attention deficit disorder vision problems swollen lymph nodes anxiety , depression difficulty losing weight in detoxifier types ringing in the ears hearing loss chronic fatigue multiple chemical sensitivity stachybotrys and chaetomium nose bleeds and pulmonary hemorrhaging stachybotrys bruising , hives infertility , miscarriage fibromyalgia chronic fatigue multiple sclerosis like symptoms dirt like taste in mouth cancer hair loss joint pains irregular heart beat heart attack seizure muscle twitching anaphylaxis on re exposure to toxic molds air hunger , can t get a deep breath child development delays lateness apathy difficulty handling any kind of stress mood swings , irritability frequent upper respiratory infections sensitivity to sound nausea , vomiting new food allergies jaundice yellowing of the skin or eyes poor insight into illness stomach ulcers now as you all know , i have cfs and fms it started getting bad about a year after i had moved into this home so about a year after exposure to this mold ? and has gotten progressively worst i think if you read some of my past posts , you will see that i have many of the symptoms above i do n't know if i mentioned i am always out of breath but definitely another to add to the list i have noticed that both of my kids are always tired and low energy , i have often wondered if what i have was not somehow genetic , and if so , why were they already affected , when i really only got hit in my 's they also are both prone to dizzy spells and especially my daughter my daughter also has chronic sinusitis dizziness and balance problems almost passes out temperature regulation problems increased infections chronic headaches nose bleeds mood swings new food allergies nausea my son dizziness and balance problems temperature regulation problems chronic headaches mood swings anxiety developmental delays chest pains just to name a few of the symptoms that have appeared in the last years so now i ca n't help but wonder maybe the mold should be tested i have asked for a city inspector 's opinion what do you think ? thanks for reading
