paige 's cousin gave her some cool new boots , which are a hit ! hi friends ! well , we 've been sick with colds again here as per usual it seems ! ! ! it 's been an exhausting start to the new year ! what with colds , appointments , plans and errands no rest for the weary ! i 've been reading up on lots of blogs exploring what resolutions everyone is deciding to tackle and whatnot i never can get on board with resolutions because they usually equal pressure and we all know i hate that anyway , chris and i have been wanting to have date nights more regularly i ca n't remember when our last one was ? and schedule them twice per month if we can so , we 've just booked two nights out of this month with our lovely babysitter and we 're so excited to make plans to get out we want to go to the movies and we 'd like to luxuriate in a meal that we do n't have to rush through we spend a lot of quality time together as a family , but i think it 's important to reconnect as a couple to remember we 're more than parents once the month is over , we 'll sit down with a calendar and figure out our days for february that way i have a jump on contacting the babysitter well in advance it 's more likely to happen if you book it far in advance , right ? it 's just as important as a doctor , dentist , or other appointment we all tend to make sure and keep if not more so so , that 's our resolution for this year and i'm excited about it in other news , paige seems to finally be starting to pick up some words here and there she 's a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to talking but it 's better late than never , eh ? we 've recently found out that she needs a lot of specific sensory motor play in order to focus and pay attention better and we already see a big difference in her speech development to aid in her focus , we 've continued to keep the tv off , and now gulp the radio , and super gulp the internet chris and i indulge in those things after p is in bed again , these measures are seemingly making a big impact in her development in just a short amount of time we 're excited for her life is easier when there 's some communicating going on ! perhaps i 'll share some of our fun sensory games here in this space from time to time ? i'm all about sharing , as you know feel free to share some of your ideas with me too ! well , i can hear her mumbling now from her crib which signals the end of nap and my internet time ! be well , and i hope to post more frequently here in this new year but we wo n't call that a resolution , ok ? save
