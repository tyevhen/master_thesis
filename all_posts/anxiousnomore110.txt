because she was always the go to person at wvu , she was constantly in demand and busy lillian waugh says playing the cello is a mindfulness technique she practices i was a multitasker at work , she said waugh 's job was so stressful it started to affect her health so when the university began a study on how to handle stress at work , she jumped at the chance to participate the study included participants half were given written instructions on how to handle stress at work the others , including waugh , were taught techniques to cultivate mindfulness , such as yoga poses , breathing methods , stretches and meditation all designed to help workers cope with too many e mails , ringing phones and the occasional nasty co worker lead investigator kimberly williams said the goal was to relieve stress mindfulness means to pay full attention to what you are doing , moment by moment , she said we taught them how to recognize sources of stress , how stress impacts them , and then what they could do to come out of the vicious cycle of stress reactivity the program lasted eight weeks and participants were followed for an additional three months williams said they found those who received the mindfulness training had significantly less daily hassles , psychological distress and significantly fewer medical symptoms like lower blood pressure and fewer aches and pains than those

everything i was doing at the moment , she said dr gupta watch more on the benefits of mindfulness training mindfulness is not new it goes back to the time of buddha , who believed that the mind should always be fully in the present not looking back at the past or anticipating the future being mindful of the here and now , buddha said , reduces stress and brings inner peace today , mindfulness training involves learning to become aware of mind , body and emotions yoga , tai chi , and meditation all teach mindfulness williams said the popularity of mindfulness techniques is a positive development , because when done correctly , the methods have been shown to actually lift stress from your body numerous studies have shown that stress can take its toll on the human body

to neck pain , back pain , digestive disorders , sleeplessness and many people deal with those problems by overeating , drinking or smoking the mindfulness exercises in the wvu study included deep tasting , where participants spent time eating a raisin they looked at it , smelled it , and took small bites to savor the taste it brings an awareness to the body that normally is always being rushed , said williams , who emphasized the need to slow down if you give all of your attention to something , you get deeply touched by that experience , she said we all know what it 's like to eat our favorite food we slow down , we savor it , we take our time and that is what makes it so enjoyable study participants were also taught to breathe by taking deep breaths through the nose , feeling the air fill their lungs and exhaling fully williams said that with a couple of those breaths , not only does your blood pressure go down , and you stay calm , but you can better handle annoying colleagues or situations you often can bring out the best in people if you stay calm and loving along with the breathing techniques , participants were also taught how to meditate even at their desks they were told to find a comfortable time , free of distractions , and quiet their mind according to the study , even minutes of meditation can help meditation can take the anxiety out of a stressful workday , said williams west virginia university is not the first or only institution in the country that has tested the effects of mindfulness techniques on stress ucla completed a study a few years
