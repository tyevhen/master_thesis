the following is from a survey i filled out for the mental illness happy hour i did not come up with the word awfulsome myself , but is n't it a good word ? survey share an awfulsome moment from your life something that was awful and dark , but had an element that was awesomely ironic , sickly funny or bizarre a moment that makes you want to cry and laugh at the same time me for a few years i had a job as a caregiver at an adult foster care home that was in a family 's home usually when i was taking care of the three developmentally disabled men in the home , there was still someone from the family that lived there in the back rooms , and i could call them if something went wrong the family wanted to go out for a nice night together so for the first time i was left alone with the guys i put the three guys to bed for the night , then finished making a sack lunch for them for the next day suddenly one of the guys came storming out of his room upset that i was making his lunch he grabbed the lunch and threw it at me along with the soda that was inside then he ran after me in rage as i ran , i picked up a wooden kitchen chair and held it up between us he was a big man , and he grabbed the chair and pushed me into a corner of the room there was a narrow staircase directly behind me with a door at the top step i thought i could escape , but then remembered that tonight the family had locked the door to that room , so now i had no way out i lifted the chair up with him holding on to it , then ducked under it , dropped it , and started running away but i was not fast enough he turned around and grabbed me by the neck with both his large hands i had just finished a class through the state of oregon that taught us how to deal with behaviors of people who are developmentally disabled who may misbehave or become violent luckily i remembered what i learned and ducked my head under his arm and spiraled around so that he lost his grip on my neck and fell forward onto the floor i ran a few feet away and grabbed the phone i pointed down at the lb guy now laying on the floor , and said sternly , if you move a muscle i am calling the police i tried calling the owners of the house to have them come home , while he mumbled to himself on the floor mentally this man was probably around six years old even though he had the grown body of a year old nobody answered the call i made so i just stood there holding the phone while he calmed down when it seemed like he had sufficiently calmed down , i asked him if he was going to be nice he mumbled a yes i went over to him , helped him off the floor , and led him back to bed it was n't until he was tucked in and i was out of his room that i realized i had blood running down my face from a deep cut above my eye so there i was with blood running down my face after being attacked and almost strangled , realizing that i had just led my attacker back to his bed as i would a little child while speaking comforting things to him and tucking him in for sleep cindy
