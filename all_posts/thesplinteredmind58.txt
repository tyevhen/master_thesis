sunday entry day one positive aspect of my recent and ongoing bout with illness has been a renewed appreciation for the vast amount of time i actually have available to me another aspect has been the refining of my personal drive onto one project to spend that vast amount of time on i wake up thinking about my current depression book now and how much work i have left on it this is such a difference from the usual nightly routine where i remember to work on the book when i m suppose to be going to sleep the shame is that i am finally starting to feel better , but i have the kids now and am having a very difficult time managing my time properly so all i am accomplishing towards my book goal is waking up thinking about my book , but not really working on it this is more than frustrating of course , i ve only had the children for three days and i should cut myself some slack juggling personal projects with work and single parenthood is difficult on the best of days , never mind when handicapped by the flu bronchitis however , the sickness has been so long lasting that frustration is the only constant in my life i live in fear that the clarity i have will evaporate as soon as i m healthy enough to allow adhd free whimsical rein to piddle away my precious time on pointless but very interesting pursuits you might also like and so began my day words a day is child 's play it 's been that kinda day in which i write and then make a spectacle of myself for linkwithin
