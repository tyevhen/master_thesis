reading is not , in my opinion , a luxury , but a necessity when we are young , it is our gateway to everything we are about to learn during our school days as we reach our teens , it often becomes an escape from the schedules and demands then we grow up and time takes over , life becomes so busy and reading slides down the to do list faster than that first glass of chardonnay on a friday night for many people , this isn t the case , and reading is still a huge part of their lives i am one of these people not having a book in my hand is unthinkable but a few years ago i couldn t find any comfort in reading stress and anxiety had its hold over me , and i couldn t sit still long enough to focus on the words many of my clients , who suffered from depression , told me how impossible it was for them to read they couldn t concentrate on the written word they would get jittery if sitting still trying to concentrate for a period of time , on anything at all was exhausting fortunately , with the help of their gp , many of them have been able to control their symptoms and return to reading for pleasure walking away from a physically and emotionally abusive marriage left me with a host of health issues and i spent many years on the road to recovery it was a long journey , but i knew i had the strength to see it through i was the sole carer of three young children , and they needed me reading had always been a comfort to me and an escape my passion for fantasy and science fiction was never more present than when i was trying to forget my pain but when i needed to heal it was another genre that i turned to mind , body and spirit there are thousands of self help books out there , on numerous topics when i needed guidance , i would let my hand trail across the shelves and pick the book that pulled at me without fail , i would choose the perfect title for how i was feeling at that moment the books listed below are some of the titles that helped me to shape my new life , change my thought patterns and grow in strength i have read each of them over and over , whenever i needed a boost or some motivation i recommend them to everyone i meet , and i am honoured to be able to write for this genre myself adding my lessons and hopefully helping others just as i was helped the list is in no particular order feel the fear and do it anyway by susan jeffers some self help books are full of long words and complicated terms this isn t one of them susan has a talent for telling it how it is in a very level headed manner this book looks at why we feel the way we do and how to use certain tools to cope with these feelings my copy is littered with notes i ve written in the margin insights and quotes that susan shares throughout are displayed on my noticeboard and in my diary when you suffer from anxiety , the smallest thing can be overwhelming susan understands this and includes simple exercises to help us cope with our fears , however big or small how to do everything and be happy by peter jones a book for ordinary people , with ordinary lives when i read anything by peter , i feel like i m chatting with an old friend he has an incredible talent for making you feel as if you can do anything even be happy !

yes , i ve snuck my book in at the end ! i didn t do this as a sales pitch but as an honest account of what it meant to produce this book starting my blog and embarking on the twelve challenges i set myself , was only possible because of the strength and motivation i took from each of the books i ve listed there have been many more self help books that taught me valuable lessons , but for fear of boring my readers i ve kept the list short i will add other titles in another post i had to re build my life and start over this was the hardest thing i ve ever done , but it made me who i am today writing this book was my way of showing others how anything is possible if you believe in yourself i would love to hear about a book that motivated you , or one that changed your life please share your thoughts in the comments below or join us on facebook http www facebook com resolutionchallenge
