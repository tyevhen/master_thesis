i left the hospital mid day friday my mother picked me up i ended up getting the blessing of my psychiatrist , especially after she became aware my mother would be with me most of the weekend my mom and i did spend most of the past couple of days together , which was intermittently wonderful and irritating i really appreciate quiet , and my mom was a bit chatty but i should n't complain it was very nice to have her here i would n't have felt comfortable coming home to an empty house on friday my mom was actually incredible i'm so grateful she was here for me she was so supportive she took days out of her life to live at my house , take care of my dog , spend her own money on and worry about me for the last hours , i thanked her every chance i got and despite typically not saying so , i had no trouble telling her i loved her when i dropped her off at the airport today she smiled , told me she loved me , too , and we parted ways i have to say i am a little sad being home alone i battled familiar , negative , dark thoughts this afternoon shortly after returning home that was discouraging i felt so low at one point i sobbed jet , my dog , did n't care for that he immediately arrived at my side and licked the tears from my face such a good boy , he really did comfort me the rest of the afternoon has been tough as well i 've struggled with sadness , hopelessness , and despair it is discouraging to feel the familiar , sometimes frightening feelings i thought were behind me i'm attempting to let them pass through me without weighing me down and i'm trying to remember healing is not always a linear process but i want to feel better i do n't want to fail i want so badly to just be okay i'm praying for less struggle and more harmony from this point forward
