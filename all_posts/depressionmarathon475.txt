i passed a dubious anniversary recently maybe some of you noticed in the introduction to my blog , where it used to say eleven years , it now says twelve it 's now been years in which i 've been suffering from , fighting against , surviving despite , and living with depression twelve years this life altering journey began in november , the depth of my illness , alcoholic drinking , and ect have robbed me of much of my memory of the last years , especially those early years maybe that 's for the best memories can be a double edged sword but while i do n't remember many details of this battle , i do vividly remember the person i was prior to this long journey and while i 'd like to retrieve a lot of pre illness things , which i lost along the way , i do not miss that lost person this illness stole much from me , but i 'd rather not focus on that today depression also gave me an opportunity to grow it challenged my perseverance , my toughness , and my character it taught me acceptance and humility it changed me from a self centered , controlling , stressed , know it all to a more open , get along person who has come to know some serenity and peace today i can see beyond the boundaries of me and put myself in an other 's shoes i 've grown i'm grateful for that do n't misunderstand me depression is not something i 'd wish on my worst enemy the stigma alone is more than most can bear this illness debilitates bodies , clouds minds , and steals souls it is a challenge nobody deserves i hate it these last twelve years were full of challenges which felt too overwhelming to overcome but overcome i did my survival was often ugly and usually painful depression took me to the edge of life more than once but i'm still here stronger kinder better on this dubious anniversary , at least i can celebrate that
