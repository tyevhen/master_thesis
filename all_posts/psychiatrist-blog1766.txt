first , i feel like as bloggers , we 're becoming oddly linked in blogging rhythm we 've all got springtime blogging mania and the posts seem to come in bursts scroll down for podcast , by the lovely clinkster fat doctor feeds her kid dog biscuits , by yours truely clink 's thoughts on altruism in because it feels good dinah 's review of reign on me as you order salad like a shrink roy 's thoughts on shrinks on call in er call and finally , both roy and clink did a synopsis of the shrink rappers' venture out in their dueling posts on human sacrifice in moche culture will i ever get these folks out for crabcakes and beer ? and that was all in the last hours , we 're a very busy blog ! okay , okay , this post is called i do n't charge enough and it was inspired by the fact that a patient told me today she was glad to see i 'd raised my rates , i undervalue my services yes , she was serious , and if that was n't enough , i came home to a blog comment by sophizo telling me i do n't charge enough , and a shrink she knows gets hour i do n't charge hour okay , so i left residency and in addition to a job i got , which i think paid hour this was a while ago , i joined a private group practice my fee was set by the group , it was about hour over going rates , but there were secretaries who submitted directly to insurance , the patient only made the co pay , and in a fit of total ignorance , i joined the blue cross network , not realizing that by doing so i was discounting my fee by roughly session , often to people who could well afford to pay full fee i stayed with the group for years , during which time my fee did n't change i left to go out on my own , solo , no secretary , and i opted out of blue cross , did n't take insurance , and my patients were left to pay full fee and struggle by themselves with their insurance companies my fee was now on the low side , but with this new burden on my patients , i could n't raise my fees , i just could n't time passed , i still could n't raise my fees more time passed , i was having an issue my rent went up , everything else went up somewhere in there , i changed my other job and made more money at that my husband 's career was going well we wanted for nothing so years later , and my fee was exactly what it was when i started my private practice , i was embarrased when other shrinks asked what i charged , more embarrased when i saw the look on their face and heard how much more they were charging i had an issue on the one hand , the i do n't take your insurance policy scares a lot of patients away but , it does n't mean that i see only rich people i have patients who struggle , who enjoy few of the luxuries in life , who rarely go to an extravagent restaurant , never purchase new cars , never go on vacation they pay out of pocket , and this is their choice there are cheaper places to get treatment and i work at some of those cheaper places for those who want psychotherapy with a psychiatrist , however , out of pocket is often the only way to get it some of my patients have no health insurance and foot the whole bill they come as they can , i do n't make demands that everyone come at a certain frequency , but for those who come weekly , or even bi weekly , psychotherapy is expensive let 's see , at sophizo 's suggested session , let 's say the average patient comes times a year given their vacations , my vacations , holidays , sickness , snow , whatever , yr , up front and hope your insurance sends you back session if they 're generous sorry , sophizo , i might be richer , but this is n't reasonable to ask from anyone even at my undervalued fee , psychotherapy is a large , regular expense , it 's hard for me to ask that of struggling people who are suffering as is , my fee is hard for some patients , they are giving up something else to be my patient i hope it 's worth it on the other hand , there is this funny message that i undervalue my work , i do n't want to think and i do n't want anyone else to think , that i'm worth less than the guy down the hall by definition , i am my patients tell me everyone else 's fee , i believe i'm the cheapest on the hall and while i 've finally caught up to the standard fees , i still charge on the low end so after years of grappling with this , i'm left to say that it 's fine that i charge on the low end i have lower overhead than a lot of docs who pay secretaries and have large offices , my fees are discounted only by medicare and i do n't have many medicare patients , i want for nothing and i wish that i could do this for free enough that i take an occasional pro bono case and recently started volunteering a couple hours a week for a great organization that serves the neediest of the needy is that altruism , per clink ? it makes me feel good , it 's my way of giving back to a world that educated me with scholarships and low interest student loans , to a world where i 've spent more time helping the suffering than being the sufferer , and something about it makes my life richer not altruism in all honesty , perhaps a funny mix of gratitude and guilt that 's okay to admit , right ? and did i really just write a post trying to justify why i do n't charge more ?
