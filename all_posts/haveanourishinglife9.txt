recently , someone said something to me that really stuck you know who you are thank you for your wise words a person being on medication for depression is no different than a person being on medication for high blood pressure or diabetes or anything you can tell yourself something over and over and over then someone else says it and you 're like ah ha ! ya know ? you are no less a person if you take medicine for depression or anxiety or any other mental health problem why is there is so much guilt shame that comes with taking antidepressant medication ? to admit you have depression requires you almost to admit that you are a failure , that you are weak , and that you ca n't handle pain depression , itself , is a disease in your brain that makes you feel this way then , in order to accept help , you have to look it , depression , in the face and say , yes , you are right , stupid depression i am not good enough , i am not worthy , and i am not the way i wish i was i admit that i can not do this thing called 'living' anymore on my own yet , stupid depression , i do not care what you are telling me despite all the negative things you are making me believe about myself , i choose to try this medicine because i have hope for a better life because i have hope that i'm meant for more than misery because i have hope that all those things i believe about myself are not true there was once a time before antibiotics we take them for granted now , but they are a modern invention to help people live longer and better lives antidepressants are also a medical advancement to help people live longer and better lives it 's different , yet also the same a person is a person no matter how small a person is a person no matter if they are born or unborn a person is a person no matter what they do a person is a person no matter if they have a job or not a person is a person no matter if they have a terminal illness a person is a person no matter what medication they are taking
