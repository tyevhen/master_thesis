it feels like it 's been a long time since i cried over a novel and i am , as some would say , rather emotionally sensitive but when a book or movie is good , or even if it 's simply good at capturing that one moment , i genuinely believe in the characters to me , at least for that moment , they 're real and so i feel the story as if it was happening to friends of mine , people i know and care about the book i just finished is called nation , and it 's by terry pratchett now terry pratchett is one of my , if not my absolute , favorite authors his books are marvelous , funny , and almost all of them leave you really thinking now nation is a bit different from his usual fare it 's still marvelous , funny , and makes you think of course , but unlike most of his books the discworld series especially , the humor is far more toned down and subtle , and it truly has you pondering life throughout the book a coming of age story in it 's most beautiful form , nation tells the the story of mau and daphne , two young people who survive when all those around them perish in a tidal wave , and must together make a new world it certainly is funny in places , the writing style is slightly quirky with the unmistakle prachett esque touch his fans know so well , with even quirkier characters , but the overall tone is one of grief , questioning , doubting , seeking answers and as in most good books , books you truly believe in , there are no happy ever afters i absolutely loved the character of mau , and my heart aches for him , as well as daphne , even now that i 've finished the book i'm tired , and i hope i'm making sense , but just in case i'm not i 'll summarize nation is a great book read it peace , idzie you might also like hope ways to help someone love reading childrens books ways to help someone hate reading linkwithin
