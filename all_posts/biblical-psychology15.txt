this is a brief overview analysis of the associated use of the words roo' ach and nephesh in the hebrew bible this was carried out using strong s hebrew concordance in order to illuminate the hebrew concepts in relation to what they contribute to human existence moreover whether they are separate or distinct concepts from the physical body spirit is usually the default translation for the hebrew word roo akh which can also mean breath , wind , and mind as in gen jesus likening a person born of the spirit to the wind comes to mind here strong 's concordance has a notation that the use of spirit is applied only to a rational being , however you will find that there are few exceptions to this where the word is rendered 'breath' , for instance gen the concept rendered 'spirit' can also be used to describe an evil spirit usually action oriented and wilful e g kings a spirit is perceived as something proceeding from god for example , the spirit of wisdom , prophecy , jealousy e g judges on gideon the word is also used to describe spiritual states , such as grief , contrition , brokenness , and vexation the word soul is usually the default translation of the hebrew nephesh the undisputed use encompassing soul , living being a living body by implication creature including animals , life , person , and less commonly rendered as appetite , desire , emotion , and passion strong s concordance note that nephesh can be used to denote a whole creature a visible distinction is also observed here in the application of nephesh to living creatures in general not just man it should however be noted that nephesh and roo akh are closely related in hebrew , as in other semitic languages such as arabic both for instance denote the concepts of wind and breath note however , that in genesis , into man 's nostrils alone does god breathe the breath of life 'neshama' gen the term is also used in job the spirit of god hath made me , and the breath 'neshama' of the almighty hath given me life in job , elihu points out but there is a spirit 'neshama' in man and the inspiration of the almighty gives them understanding again , proverbs reads the spirit 'neshama' of man is the lamp of the lord , searching all the inward parts of the belly notes the exception is found in ecclesiastes who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ? given the varying views on how to appraise this verse , caution is warranted in taking it as a doctrinal statement reymond outlines the one context where some expositors contend that the nesh a m h , is identified with animals as well is genesis , but a careful reading of the text will disclose that the nes a m h , of has for its referent mankind at the very end of , but a careful reading of the text will disclose that the nes a m h , of has for its referent mankind at the very end of , that is to say that the verses should be read and all mankind all on dry land which excludes the occupants of the ark in whose nostrils was the nes a m h , of life died reference reymond , robert l a new systematic theology of the christian faith nashville , tenn thomas nelson publishers ,
