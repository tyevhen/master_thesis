the kda forum had an interesting discussion on tracing your family tree to determine when and where spinal bulbar muscular atrophy aka kennedy s disease first showed up in your family dan , a forum member , provided the link below concerning tracing the linage of the defective gene he also did a nice job of summarizing the study for us turns out there is something called a founder effect where they can prove everyone with sbma in a certain nation is related to a single ancestor for example , they showed sbma patients they found in norway , sweden , and finland were all related to a common ancestor but patients they found in japan must have had two different ancestors they determine that result by examining tiny similarities and differences in the chromosomes the researchers also found that the united states and canada tend to have a greater number of founders , probably due to the history of immigration into those two nations over the centuries as for how the sbma mutation gets started , sometimes it is just a random error in the chromosome copying process other times it could be related to certain events such as exposure to radiation or certain toxic mutagenic chemicals definition of haplotype the genetic makeup of a single chromosome from the european journal of human genetics multiple founder effects in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , kennedy disease around the world abstract sbma spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy , also called kennedy disease , is an x chromosomal recessive adult onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by death of the spinal and bulbar motor neurones and dorsal root ganglia patients may also show signs of partial androgen insensitivity sbma is caused by a cag repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor ar gene on the x chromosome our previous study suggested that all the nordic patients with sbma originated from an ancient nordic founder mutation , but the new intragenic snp marker ard revealed that the danish patients derive their disease chromosome from another ancestor in search of relationships between patients from different countries , we haplotyped altogether sbma families from different parts of the world for two intragenic markers and microsatellites spanning cm around the ar gene the fact that different sbma founder haplotypes were found in patients from around the world implies that the cag repeat expansion mutation has not been a unique event no expansion prone haplotype could be detected trinucleotide diseases often show correlation between the repeat length and the severity and earlier onset of the disease the longer the repeat , the more severe the symptoms are and the onset of the disease is earlier a negative correlation between the cag repeat length and the age of onset was found in the sbma patients with defined ages at onset european journal of human genetics ,
