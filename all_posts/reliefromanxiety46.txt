today begins a new series on my blog i want to share with you what living with mental illness is really like i know i have over the years , but this time i also want to share snippets from my journals , to show you the depth that mental illness can go to of course , not all of my journal entries will be published because it is very private however i will be sharing the entries i feel comfortable in doing so , albeit somewhat altered if necessary today 's journal entry is from , when i was years old and still struggling to get to sixth form on a daily basis please do n't read if you feel it may be triggering a time when my anxiety , depression and suicidal tendencies were extremely severe th november i 've recently read a quote that said write until it stops hurting , so here goes today was a bad day however , god listened to me and got rid of my bad throat to help me to get to school unfortunately , today i could n't make it but i was ever so close i broke down and mum had to restrain me i just could n't get out of the car i picture my classmates and teachers , especially the teachers anticipating my entry in school their faces of disappointment breaks my heart because i know they search for me and are delighted when they know i 've made it even though it creates so much pain , i still struggle i ca n't bare to let these people down because i know how much they care my mum is in so much distress over this and it 's not fair on her i would do anything to take this pain away i hate that other people can just go to school i am missing out on memories , friends and education this is what i regret because i will never get the time back all of that laughter and learning i cannot access because i'm stuck in my room because i'm burdened with this curse i would do anything , go through any other torture to be free from this i want my life back i know i have lost myself and i hope that someday i can be reunited , so i can be happy like any other year old i am not an year old now i feel i have lost all control and it angers me because i ca n't be like the rest i want to get a job and join a club , but i am incapable because the forces are too strong i do n't even have the power to progress with the responsibilities that i'm supposed to have i 've been left to crawl out of the mud , whilst others run too far ahead to ever be seen i just want to wake up happy i do n't want to feel ill every day i do n't want to have such dread that my brain ca n't comprehend it i do n't want to think that the only way to cure this , is to die this is not what i want , but it 's hard to see an end i look back at this entry and i look at how far i have come i'm now , and am at a stage where my anxiety and depression is under control for the majority of the time i was writing from a place of hopelessness , but if reading this tells you anything , it 's that you can get from the darkest of times and live a happy life once more i and many others are the proof of this keep fighting best wishes , amy xx
