i wrote this poem during high school when i felt sad and alone i had so much confusion and sadness inside of me , and i did n't know why i was afraid i was a fraud and a bad person for feeling the way i did so i kept it inside of me i really wanted to trust someone with my struggles , but was so afraid alone in my room by cindy boersma alone in my room my face wet with tears i long for a friend to tell all my fears i try to look cheerful as i go through my day but sometimes those sad feelings get their own way you can tell something is wrong you say you listen well i hurts to keep it in but i ca n't bring myself to tell i want to spill my soul and let my feelings out and i would tell you if it was n't for this doubt can i trust you my friend with these secrets i guard will you keep it between us or will that be too hard i know i am not the only teen that has felt this way in confusion and sadness , desperately wanting someone who might understand what i was going through now i wonder how someone might have gained my trust ? what might they have done to reach within my sadness ? how would i have learned to trust and share ?
