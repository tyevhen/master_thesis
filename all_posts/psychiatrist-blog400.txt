maryland psychiatrist mark komrad has recently written a book called you need help ! the title says it all the book is about how to get help for someone who does n't want help , or does n't believe they need it so i thought i 'd bring our readers into the discussion here if you 're a mental health clinician and one of your friends or patients starts to talk about someone they believe needs help , what suggestions have you made in your professional capacity that have proved to be helpful ? if you are the friend or relative of someone who needs help , but has resisted getting it , what have you done or said to propel that individual into treatment ? and finally , and perhaps most importantly if you 're someone who did n't think you needed help , what got you into treatment ? start commenting and dr komrad has told me he will check in and converse with our readers in the comment section !
