had a professional setback on monday i do n't completely understand the connection between life events and my depression but they are most certainly intertwined when i get hit with something like this it can trigger a low point which is where i am just now but it also does n't take external stimuli to send me spiraling i'm sucking down the sjw religiously but i'm having trouble climbing out right now things seem pretty bleak i may look back later and decide that this was just another run of the mill trough but it does n't feel that way right now suicide has been much on my mind i did an odd thing this afternoon sleeping pills really knock me out more so , i think , than most people half a dose hits me hard and keeps me down all night around p yesterday i took a full dose when my wife got home at her usual time i was out cold and did n't wake until i did n't have any reason for doing this except that it just felt like the thing to do as i was fading to sleep i wondered if it was a suicide trial run but now i'm awake and it 's one thirty my sleep 's going to be fucked up for days now three reasons i do n't kill myself i'm a coward i do n't want to leave my wife alone with the debt we have i'm still curious to see what 's going to happen next how long will these hold true ?
