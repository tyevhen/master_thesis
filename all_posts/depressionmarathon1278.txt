hey garrison it was a surreal day here in lake wobegon my mood 's been a bit low since the whole intrusive thinking episode a couple days ago barely made it out for a run yesterday , and when i finally did , it was a shortened version of the planned whole today , not much different eight long miles looming over my head looming even blogging has become a struggle what do i have to say today that i have n't already said ? or that somebody else has n't already said ? blankly clicking through my blog , i solemnly contemplate this conundrum and then i get a comment that i think is spam , but it is n't , and they like my writing , and want to hire me to do more of it , which , of course , was the original goal and a lifelong dream , to be a professional writer , that is , and to educate others about mental illness , and now on a day when i feel low , the dream comes true ? and just so you know , that sentence was meant to be a run on sentence like that , in case any agents , editors , or people with money who want to pay me to write are reading this right now and thinking , boy , i do n't think she can write too well after all so all that happiness and excitement plum wore me out , as usual , and i had to take a nap i awoke and jumped into my running clothes before i could think twice i only had about minutes , and since i am far from a minute miler , the entire mile run was out of the question i ran miles too fast i finished those miles around pm wearing only shorts and a sports bra , sweating profusely , and in desperate need of a quick , cool shower why am i telling you this , keillor ? because this is the part you just ca n't make up ! two hours later two hours i started my remaining mile segment wearing tights , jacket , and a hat , and was painfully sorry i had n't worn gloves , too ! by the time i got home , my hands were fire engine red and needed to be thawed ! only in wobegon , minnesota , garrison where right now it just happens to be snowing i guess mother nature is a bit discombobulated today , too
