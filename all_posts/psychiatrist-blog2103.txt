i do n't go to apa every year by any means i last went in nyc two years ago so here is my take on it it was too cold in toronto , especially on monday as of tuesday , there were , people registered in nyc , i believe there were , registered i always ask it seemed like there was less of everything , though maybe it 's similar to how the playground slide gets smaller as one gets older some sessions were still extremely crowded , and i went to hear glen gabbard talk he was terrific , but it was like hearing a talk on crowded nyc subway with the body parts of assorted strangers being jammed into me the quality of the sessions varied , but that is n't new it seemed there were many more non members than usual , and what felt like huge numbers of people from other countries around the world while this is always the case , it was more striking , and a drug rep told me that of attendees were from other countries by 'other' i mean not canada or the us lots of folks from turkey and the netherlands most notably the toys were not good the freebie drug company giveaways pens , squishy brains were all but absent apparently the laws in canada are stricter about such things , though i wondered if part of it was also due to all the fuss in the press here about drug companies influencing docs the lack of toys meant the exhibit halls where i often bump into long lost people from my past lives were fairly empty fun things i made it to steve sharfstein 's presidential farewell bash and had dinner at susur an event in its own right susur does only a tasting menu , probably the most interesting meal i 've ever eaten out , definately the most expensive the food was delicious we flew into buffalo and pit stopped enroute for buffalo wings and to see niagra falls funniest moment leaving the country , i handed my passport and boarding pass to the immigration officer he asked why i was in canada and was i a psychiatrist when i said i was , he moaned and said , at least your not as disorganized as the rest of them
