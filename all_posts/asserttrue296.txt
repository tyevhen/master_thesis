few bacterial species have had as great an impact on humankind as the members of the mycobacterium family , which encompass the causative agents of among other ailments leprosy , tuberculosis , and crohn 's disease in humans , and johne 's disease in farm animals leprosy is known from antiquity and continues to strike , or more people each year worldwide tuberculosis , which affects subclinically one in three persons worldwide , continues to kill well over a million people a year and has caused a billion deaths in the last two centuries , more than all the wars and genocides of history combined the association of m avium subspecies paratuberculosis map with crohn 's disease is still considered controversial by some , but if in fact koch 's criteria have already been met , map adds millions more to the toll of human misery caused by mycobacterial infection colonies of mycobacterium have a characteristically waxy consistency shown here colonies of m tuberculosis what are these bacteria ? where did they come from ? how have they managed to be so successful in causing death and disease ? the prefix myco means fungal , but these are not fungi we 're talking about mycobacteria are soil and water borne bacteria that produce an extraordinarily complex cell wall containing not only the usual for bacteria peptidoglycans but also arabinogalactan mycolic acids lipoarabinomannan extractable lipids including glycolipids , phenolic glycolipids pgl , glycopeptidolipids gpl , waxes , acylated trehaloses , and sulfolipids in contrast to most cell wall fatty acids which contain carbon carbon double bonds susceptible to oxidation , mycolic acids are cyclopropanated and resistant to oxidation , not to mention extremely hydrophobic the mycobacterial cell wall thus presents a formidable physical barrier to antibiotics , and it was with considerable dismay that physicians realized , early on , that penicillin would have no benefit in treating tuberculosis when an antibiotic that could attack m tuberculosis was finally discovered streptomycin , it resulted in a nobel prize for ukrainian american selman waksman although in reality the discovery was made by a post doc in waksman 's lab , albert schatz the mycobacterial cell wall is famously complex , but it also has the curious habit of disappearing entirely , under nutrient starvation conditions like many other bacteria , mycobacteria can , under certain conditions , shed their cell walls and take on a so called l form morphology , in which cells bounded only by a thin and osmotically vulnerable cell membrane containing just of the usual amount of peptidoglycan exist as protoplasts which are nonetheless able to reproduce and thrive , producing distinctive colonies on solid media and giving rise , in vivo , to tiny spherules that are often confused with russell bodies in cancer biopsies the medical significance of the mysterious l forms is still debated , after more than years the very small red filaments here are cells of mycobacterium avium living inside lymph node macrophages in an immunocompromised individual one thing most mycobacterial species have in common is slow growth cultures of m tuberculosis and map often require weeks to develop , and m leprae which ca n't be grown in pure culture at all it can be lab grown only in the footpads of mice or armadillos has the longest known generation time of any bacterium , at two weeks ironically , pathogenic strains of mycobacterium seem to have evolved slow growth as a survival strategy this certainly makes them hard to treat with antibiotics most antibiotics are effective only in disrupting the growth of actively growing cells the lack of dna mismatch repair enzyme systems muts , mutl , and muth may be an outcome of the fact that slow dna replication in these organisms , in and of itself , ensures reasonably high fidelity replication on the other hand , lack of a mismatch repair system could be why pseudogenes genes inactivated due to frameshifts or other errors abound in mycobacterial species m leprae famously has over pseudogenes m smegmatis strain js harbors over pseudogenes m canettii strain cipt and m rhodesiae strain nbb both have over for a good review of mycobacterial dna repair systems , see this paper unlike yersinia pestis , the plague organism , which may be less than , years old very young in bacterial species time , m tuberculosis , as a species , appears to be at least million years old , although this number should probably be considered a minimum age , subject to upward revision the species was thought to be only , years old as late as , before a more detailed genetic analysis established the million year estimate of its age the numbers should be viewed with caution , however , since they 're based on mutation rate assumptions derived from data for e coli the question of how m tuberculosis has managed to achieve its distinctive pathogenic profile is a matter of active ongoing research , and likely will be for a long time a recent review article reminds us the complete genome sequence of the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis strain hrv has been available for over a decade , but the biology of the pathogen remains poorly understood miscellaneous links list of famous t b victims bront family , balzac , kafka , thoreau , kant , chekhov , orwell , schr dinger , vivien leigh , arline feynman wife of the famous physicist , the list goes on tuberculosis in literature and the arts the t b blues jimmie rodgers , this song , famously covered by leon redbone among others , was written by rodgers after he contracted the disease at age he died eight years later world health organization tb stats landing page the tuberculosis systems biology program
