everyone who suffers from depression struggles with anger to some degree it may be focused or unfocused , or be primarily directed at depression s symptoms as well as towards our own mind and body for ruining our life by never ceasing to manufacture those symptoms month after month focused anger can be towards whatever or whoever caused the depression , towards god for allowing this thing to befall us , or even towards the enemy my sister in christ , sherry castellucio , has kindly granted me permission to reprint here an article she wrote called , fighting depression she shares her testimony of her life long battle with depression and its accompanying anger fighting depression , by sherry castelluccio the best way i ve heard depression described is anger turned inward it can be a real vicious anger , depending on the week it s a debilitating , mean spirited , cruel monster with little regard for the rest of the world it doesn t matter if you re a stay at home mom or if you re a teenager just trying to survive you could be an old lady , living at home by yourself with all of your family away in other parts of the country , or you could be a widower who just lost the love of your life it s no respecter of persons and doesn t care about age , race , or religion if you are human , you are susceptible if you ve had it before you re even more of a target over the years , i ve found the simplest way to fight it is just to accept it yes , i have depression but no , i m not going to allow it to rule my life the biggest help i ve ever given myself was to figure out what parts of it i can control and what parts i need help with i can t control the fact that it s genetic and sometimes appears , regardless of how hard i fight to contain it after the birth of my child , it buried me suddenly i was enmeshed in things i had no control over and my body literally shut down like a computer hard drive there was simply too much information to process i remember feeling so incredibly angry but had not the foggiest idea why surrounded by in laws , an intrusive mother , and a newborn became too much to handle all at once i had to learn how to function as a person and learn how to keep the voices at bay , and eventually disappear i had to accept that for a while the only elixir was medication the parts i can control are a bit trickier i know what i have to do to make this better , but i have to decide what i m going to do about it i have to choose within myself how i m going to live today , being bitter and angry or choosing to come out of it , albeit ever so slowly i have to know what makes me feel good and even if i have no desire to participate in those things , i know i must if i am to make it out alive and able to be the person my family needs me to be it s much easier to admit i can t live this way when there are people at home that need me still , there are those days when i would much rather curl myself up into the foetal position and sleep the day away , forgetting everything and everyone in my life shirking my responsibilities and ignoring my needs are tempting , but not realistic it s my responsibility to make this home run smoothly and raise my child the best way i know how it s impossible to be productive when i m zonked out in bed the lord has been so faithful in pulling me out he never fails to reveal himself in those dark times when i feel so empty , so lifeless he is there reminding me that if i just give a little bit , try just a tiny fraction , he ll bless me for it it is work but i give in to him because i know that he is right it isn t worth it to indulge in myself because i get nothing out of it giving in to myself is the last great mistake what words of comfort can i give to someone who struggles as i do ?
