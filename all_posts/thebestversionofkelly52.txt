my cfs story officially started in july however i suspect it was a long time in the making it floored me at first however after a lot of reading up on the condition and much trial and error i have found some tips that help me manage the condition better after a very stressful and emotional year i found myself in the summer of feeling completely worn out i went away for a week to a cottage in norfolk with my husband , children and in laws i remember thinking this is exactly what i need , i ll come back feeling all better the week wasn t great weather wise so we only ventured out for half days and that left a lot of time to relax in the cottage i had many afternoon naps and lots of early nights however , when we got home on the friday i didn t feel at all refreshed i spent the whole weekend in bed , sleeping for out the hours each day by tuesday i was due to go to work but knew i wouldn t even manage the drive i found myself at the doctors being issued with a two week sick note for stress i d never been signed off in my life but knew i had no choice i was sure two weeks of rest would be all it took to get me back on track sadly , it wasn t i won t bore you with the whole story basically , i ended up back at work after a few weeks and managed to struggle on until april by which point i knew something had to give so reluctantly accepted i needed more time off i had been diagnosed by my gp with cfs in october and this was confirmed by an occupational physician in february after the diagnosis , i read a lot on the internet about the condition i realised cfs affected some people more severely than others , my case was mild compared to those confined to bed or a wheelchair my greatest fear in this was and is getting worse so , when i took the time off in april i wanted to use it effectively i decided to overhaul my diet and embarked on the candida diet , i will do a separate post on this by july i was back at work and noticing some improvements in my health sadly , august and september were very emotionally challenging months for me and extremely stressful and i lost all my progress by october i needed more time off work and i remain off now i feel marginally better being off but i haven t yet made back the progress i had made last year i intend to do the diet again , it s just hard to imagine going through that again as it was the hardest thing i ever did i am also having gym based physio to start to improve my fitness exercise is a contentious subject when it comes to cfs with some believing it helps and others believing it worsens your symptoms i m yet to know how it will affect me as it s early days but i m too young to let my physical fitness go complexly so i must try and common sense suggests a basic level of fitness must be a good thing managing my sleep helps i try to avoid daytime naps sometimes they are unavoidable but i fight the urge wherever possible and i stick to a set bed time of and sleep until child dependant !
