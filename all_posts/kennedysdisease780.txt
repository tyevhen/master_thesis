in june , i noticed my pinky finger on the left hand felt numb i tried several exercises , but the sensation was still there about a month later , i noticed the right pinky finger was a little more numb it was not as pronounced as the left , but still noticeable for several years , the bottoms of my feet and toes have been numb or tingly i tried different techniques to stimulate the nerves , but nothing seemed to work in early august , the feet were particularly bad one evening , i used my hands to massage my feet the feet were more sensitive than i thought they would be when i performed a deep tissue massage at times , it was slightly painful yet , they felt better afterward i kept up the evening massages and noticed a positive pronounced difference in regards to sensations the tingling and numb feeling is barely noticeable the toes also have more feeling by the end of august , something else became apparent i no longer had the numb feeling in the pinky fingers on both hands it is mid september and the bottoms of my feet and my toes are remarkably better i have not experienced the numbness in my fingers for at least three weeks i will continue my evening massages and let you know if anything changes but , for now , i like the results photo modernreflexology com
