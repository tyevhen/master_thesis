note this post , about how i do twitter , is obsolete now , in that i currently have well over , followers , not k , and i 've learned a lot about twitter in the four years since this post was written see this post for more up to date info note if you came here wanting to know what k means in a tweet , it refers to klout com kred points if you came here to learn what the 'k' means in k , it means thousand lots of people google it , apparently somebody on twitter asked me over the weekend what it means to have k twitter followers since most people learn in grade school that 'k' used in a numeric context means thousand , i have to assume that the person 's question was rhetorical in nature rather than numerical either that , or he failed th grade still , let me make it perfectly clear having k twitter followers means just one thing it means you have ten times more than k twitter followers it 's important for me to have an audience , because by profession i'm a person who transfers knowledge and influences opinion if i have a larger audience , i'm more effective at what i do that 's fundamentally why i went about the six month long task of trying to attract and keep ten thousand twitter followers , a goal i reached on sunday of course , it does n't help to have followers if they are all robots , nut cases , and mouthbreathers quality counts unfortunately , twitter attracts its share of hucksters , scammers , lamers , and marketing hangers on , and many of them spend their days and nights trying to follow people in hopes of a pingback of some kind i have some of those people in my k , but not so many as to make the remainder not worth having in fact , i count the quality of my follower list to be extremely high , and i 'll explain why i think that and just how i got to the k mark , incidentally tomorrow for more on this subject , see my cent e book
