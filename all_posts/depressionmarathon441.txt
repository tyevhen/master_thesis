the fatigue and lethargy saga continues i did talk things over with my doctor , via e mail , a couple days ago she did order some blood work , which i had drawn today i do n't yet know the results of course , i hope i'm fine , and nothing major shows up in the results , but i have to admit , it would be kind of relieving to find out i'm anemic if that were the case , i 'd at least have an easily fixable reason behind the fatigue and terrible running fixable that 's what i'm really looking for i'm actually feeling a tiny bit better i had a decent run on sunday it was a miler i started slowly , but i was able to speed up to a good pace for the middle miles prior to slowing down again over the final mile i did n't feel perfect i was n't totally back , but it was so much better than saturday 's run , i felt encouraged unfortunately tonight 's run brought my enthusiasm down a frustrating notch once again today 's schedule called for a relaxed miler i left the house in a hopeful mood hope turned to frustration when i developed serious , bilateral side stitches within blocks of my home ! the cramping brought me to a halt times in the first mile i must have looked pretty funny doubled over on the side of the road , as i tried to stretch and relax the cramping away i succeeded in relieving the left side stitch , but the right side would not unknot itself for the remainder of my run i slowly struggled through the first three miles and was preparing to bag the entire effort when i felt some relief though the cramp never left , i was able to hold a more decent pace for awhile , and i finished my run i'm happy about that i figure this fatigue has to end at some point in time maybe it 's already starting to improve after all , i was actually able to run today , even if it was n't the most comfortable experience , and that 's better than i could muster last tuesday i leave the house with positive expectations every time i run i 've been through similar episodes in the past , and ultimately they 've all resolved as mysteriously as they first appeared so i'm hopeful either the blood work will indicate a solution , or time will heal all i just have to wait and see
