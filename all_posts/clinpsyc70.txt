from an excellent piece at bloomberg the doctor 's thinking that he does not see a schizophrenic or bipolar patient , '' zyprexa brand manager bandick said in a december internal e mail to the marketing department but he probably does see patients with symptoms of behavior , mood and thought disturbances , '' he wrote even if the doctor does not have diagnosis , he should treat anyway '' adding more fuel to the fire i discussed in february the document discussed in this post is called the zyprexa primary care presentation it appears to be a transcript of a speech mike bandick , the zyprexa brand manager , gave at the eli lilly national sales meeting on march , it is important to note that zyprexa is only fda approved for use in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder the document appears to indicate that bandick was encouraging salespeople to market zyprexa for treating more than just these two conditions bandick said we intend , quite simply , to redefine the way pcps treat mood , thought and behavioral disturbances we will continue to focus on symptoms and behaviors that pcps see every day later he said , referencing zyprexa broad symptom efficacy in mood , thought , and behavioral disturbances it seems curious that lilly states they did not market zyprexa for off label purposes , yet the term mood , thought , and behavioral disturbances seems a fair amount broader than schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in addition , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder especially bipolar i , which is the much more severe form of bipolar in comparison to bipolar ii are uncommon disorders it is highly unlikely that primary care physicians would see patients with such conditions every day however , it is certainly possible that a pcp may run across individuals who are manifesting much less severe disturbances , and it may well have been that it was this group , the patients who exhibited mild mood , thought , or behavioral symptoms , for whom zyprexa was being marketed but do n't worry lilly will tell you that they do n't promote off label do keep in mind that i'm not singling out lilly , as this kind of thing seems to be par for the course as for risks of zyprexa , well , according to bloomberg lilly added a warning to its packaging in october saying that more than half of patients in studies gained an average of pounds after taking the drug for less than a year it said zyprexa was more associated with higher blood sugar levels , a risk factor for diabetes , than similar medications before the october label change , lilly did n't instruct its sales force to say zyprexa 's diabetes rates were higher , former marketing director david noesges said in a january deposition we will not proactively address the diabetes concern , '' the zyprexa sales force was advised in , the documents show the competition wins if we are distracted into talking about diabetes the bloomberg article is a must read
