my current life is like sh t , i just want to flush it down the toilet i am holding out for my hoidays in january i will use this time to reflect and decide what i really want from life and work out how to change change is going to be so hard but i think no change will be even harder i keep thinking what if i took that job ? would things have been any better ? is this just a tough phase which will pass or have the good times been and gone ? the fact is i am fed up with this stage of my life and ready to move on to the next i have no one to move on with tho' , everyone else is already there i have a caffiene problem , i have a dependence on it i guess it is a lot better than illegal drugs or alcohol but the mood crashes and headaches are awful maybe i will try and give up diet coke , i have said this a few times but i get so low and it really picks me up for a couple of hours it is only temporary tho' and i crash again in the evenings i use the coke to get me through the day at work i also eat far too much and i am rapidly putting on weight ! something has to change ! !
