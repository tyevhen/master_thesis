there is something we must immediately add to the theoretical mix epigenetics how very early events in the womb and at birth can alter the genetic unfolding one genotype , a single genetic predisposition , can give rise to many phenotypes depending on what happens to those genes during gestation so what we might imagine is genetic , is genetic plus what happens to us in the womb i was so surprised early on in my therapy when long term patients reported that their wisdom teeth descended now i understand it better the genetic unraveling toward its destination was deferred due to repression in the early nineteenth century , a french scientist named jean baptiste lamarck decided that we acquired characteristics from experiences that our parents underwent russian communists applied this to agriculture but , no matter , it was a widely discredited theory until recently now this avowed marxist position may have been resurrected a bit there is a new field called epigenetics that states pretty much what lamarck believed so what is the evidence ? and what exactly is it ? what lamarck said was that individuals acquire characteristics as a result of their environment , and now , these characteristics can be passed on to the offspring much of the work in epigenetics has to do with diet a mother s diet influences the offspring s physiology epigenetics has to do with how genes are regulated and influenced by the experience of the baby i believe it has more to do with the fetus who resides in the womb that his experience is influenced forevermore by the mother s diet but also by her moods has the genetic switch been delayed or was it premature ? this can happen without making a radical change in the gene itself but rather in how it is expressed , whether it is shut off or on what we are discussing is how a mother s interaction with her environment can pass this on to her offspring i think we need to understand that a fetus in the womb is always trying to adapt to his environment and that his genes will evolve and be expressed depending on that adaptation for example , a mother who is very unhappy from her own childhood pain , and who has depleted much of her serotonin supplies cannot fulfill the young fetal need for his own serotonin supplies his own supply does not kick in until somewhere around the half way mark he may well grow up deficient in inhibitory or repressive capacity and be an anxiety impulsive case forevermore this can evolve into attention deficit in his youth this will happen when the fetal set points are readjusted because of events during womb life there may be a continued inability to have a cohesive cognitive ability to focus and concentrate i think it is important that all this occurs while the fetal brain is rapidly developing and needs proper input to evolve normally an anxious mother is so agitated that the neuronal input into the baby she is carrying is so extreme that he cannot adapt and integrate this input thereafter , this is the kind of person who cannot accept too much stimulation because the internal input is so great that anything from the outside , such as two term papers due immediately , can be overwhelming to get an idea of how early all this may begin , there is a study by the university of miami school of medicine that states that a review on maternal prenatal depression effects on the fetus and newborn suggests that fetal activity is elevated , growth is delayed , low birth weight common it begins a lot earlier than we previously thought as if to underscore this position , there is a study from scientific american mind , fetal recall january that is seeking out when consciousness actually begins and they are quoted as stating that it begins in the womb they introduced sharp sounds to the pregnant mother a honking device placed on her abdomen as they did it the fetus reacted significantly but after a time the fetus stopped responding to it squirming heart rate stopped speeding up he became habituated , got used to it , and it remained , therefore , as only a memory he learned that the noise was no longer dangerous and the memory endured newborns of a depressed mother show a profile that mimics the mother s prenatal state , including her physiologic state this includes higher stress hormone levels , lower levels of dopamine and serotonin , and greater right frontal brain activity what i think this means is that the right feeling brain is forced to be hyperactive to deal with emotional push it is , after all , the right prefrontal brain orbitofrontal area that maintains a history of our feelings and has a more internal focus to summarize higher resting levels of stress hormones in the carrying mother can already have an effect on the later life of the offspring it already presages the constant need for tranquilizers because the early imprint has lowered levels permanently then with even minor setbacks later on , the resonance factor can compound the pain level so that taking painkillers is a matter of urgency the concept of epigenetics has import for diagnosis for example , one of my patients was told that she had a genetic vulnerability , very much like her mother had it led to a diagnosis of a very serious autoimmune disease if it were seriously genetic , as the doctors believed , then any chance to change her state would be close to nil what this does is prevent us from seeing or investigating beyond the inheritance to factors that may have been equally important what happened to the baby while being carried ? further , if there were something that altered the immune state while in gestation , perhaps one can relive and connect to it , thus affecting that imprint thus , it may be as a result of an experiencerather than inheritance that is ultimately significant this patient did relive her traumatic birth , and , perhaps , that helped her make some progress against the disease this happens , again , because in reliving , it is possible to gather up associated feelings and sensations that lie even below the later trauma but which may be related to it through frequency resonance reliving later events will usually bring up the earlier events and feelings that it resonates triggers off with earlier imprints will be re represented on higher levels as the brain develops even though we are reliving something at the age of sixteen we are also dealing with the earlier part of the related feeling that is why there is hope when we relive we can attack imprints during gestational life so when a feeling event brings up severe anxiety with it , it can mean that we are basically dealing with preverbal events where and when anxiety terror is installed the importance of differentiating between genetics and epigenetics is that we may be dealing with a reversible disease , not one that is inherited and cannot change and indeed this is already being tested in a paper by m szyf , dept of psychiatry , mcgill university , quebec the epigenetic impact of early life adversity he reported on the reversibility of the epigenomes in animals using chemical agents they were able to reverse the changes caused by epigenetic events this has great import for disease today for certainly there may be genetic factors which only become manifest when certain traumas occur , but even after they occur we may be able to go back and change it hence reverse disease terribly important researchers at karolinska medical center , sweden , have found that cesarean births can result in increased allergies , diabetes and leukemia risk mikael norman states our theory is that altered birth conditions could cause a genetic imprint in the immunecells that could play a role in later life their work , as is that of others , indicates that stress around birth affects the genes the assumption is that the fetus is not prepared for an unnatural birth it is different from a vaginal birth where the stress gradually builds and can be adapted to there are experiments with pregnant primates as a result of stress during pregnancy there is an adverse effect on the hippocampus dealing with memory it seems to shrink and , as i have mentioned elsewhere , one has to wonder if this kind of stressful gestation can play a role in later alzheimer s there is new evidence on this point a study by brigham young university found that the size of the hippocampus was reduced when trauma occurred neuroscience , aug see also , trauma , ptsd , followed by reduction of the brain involved with memory science daily , aug , it took a long time to discover this because there was no immediate damage only after a long period did the damage show up more importantly , again , there is no taking into account the unobserved trauma in the womb and at birth which , in my opinion , does permanent damage to the memory centers it is not just an assumption there is new research to demonstrate this in a paper reported in science news , jan , acute stress leaves epigenetic marks on the hippocapus , there is more and more evidence of this a single trauma in rats can produce changes in their brains , and these changes are reflected in the memory centers such as the hippocampus the changes that occur can also affect whether or not our genes are turned on or off it is so difficult to differentiate between nature and nurture as causes because they are so intertwined as we mature a corollary of this is that as stress increases so does the mother s level of cortisol that , in turn , affects the brain structures the investigators indicated if there is anything we all agree on it s that the fetus is incredibly vulnerable and fragile , and that even subtle perturbations in the mother s mood can have measureable effects on the fetus that last for years one additional finding stress while being carried , later lowers iq , as well as anxiety , add and depression the thalamo cortical circuits are finally established very late in gestation thalamus to cortex and back when amygdala cortical circuits are in place it is then possible to have a mental appreciation of the pain we are in it is before thalamic and amygdaloid circuits are mature that we can experience pain without acknowledging it thus pain can be laid down in a completely unconscious way , and most certainly there are no words to clarify or explain it can one imagine getting a patient to explain a gestational trauma ? but he can describe a sensation of butterflies in the stomach , pressure on the chest and a churning sensation in the belly we call it amorphous anxiety but these are part of the overall experience of fear and terror while we are being carried each is a fragment of a gestalt experience there was a study reported in the british journal , nature they noted that when the baby is under threat the amygdala signals to the prefrontal cortex triggering the expression of that fear in behavior the cortex becomes the decider what the investigators did was to train mice with a tone accompanied with a shock when that was administered there was commensurate brain activity in the prefrontal area of the mice but when the amygdala was surgically removed there was no longer any prefrontal activity it could no longer signal fear to the top level the same is true when we drug that structure or tranquilize it it diminishes the force that mounts in the prefrontal area we see from this research why so many of us have trouble sleeping either falling asleep or staying asleep and why some individuals cannot get into feeling lower level imprints voyaging or meandering upwards and forwards keep the person from traveling to a lower level of brain function it literally jolts the person who has lain down for a few minutes trying to relax , into a hypervigilant state there is too much going in that deeper level to permit entry lower level imprints are stimulating the frontal thinking ruminating neurons to get busy thus in quieting the lower levels there is a sense of calm in the thinking area a false sense , i might add but the person reports feeling calmer so much for subjective reports so when can a fetus feel pain ? a better question might be when can it signify pain ? after the circuits are in place neuroscientist j k s anand explains this when he placed a needle probe into a fetus for amniocentesus the fetus grimaced in pain and its stress hormone levels rose dramatically the baby suffered not only that but from our point of view , that suffering can be coded and registered in the memory system , thereafter lying in storage waiting its chance for connection and this is what we in feeling therapy are about connection there are some serious diseases out there that have been considered only in the domain of inheritance muscular dystrophy is one of many perhaps the cures for these afflictions have been slow in coming because our emphasis has been on inherited factors rather than experience if we don t look at gestation as critical , our diagnoses are bound to be skewed there is a study by a canadian group from the douglas mental health university that found when child abuse exists there is a change in a gene nrc that affects how the child will deal with abuse that gene was much lower in abuse victims who eventually took their lives it would seem that childhood abuse had changed the structure of the gene so that it was less active and these changes endured throughout their lives it changed the way the whole stress apparatus functioned the hpa mcgowan implies that the changes are stable and that they alter the gene s activity leading to later illness and suicidal tendencies when that gene is ineffective it cannot produce the kind of alerting , galvanizing chemicals that help one fight through things glucocorticoid hormones so the body behaves as though it were constantly under stress when there is none apparent it is reacting to the imprint what this research group believes is that mothers can affect the fate of their children even before they are born the epigenetic changes could force the children to be depressed and suicidal later on it will look like genetics but it will be more than that and to make matters worse , there is a study that indicates that a mother who is been stressed before she gets pregnant can also affect the life of her offspring this was a rat study by the israeli m lesham those rats who underwent stress before pregnancy had offspring who were hyperactive the females displayed symptoms of anxiety and were generally more nervous in general a nervous mother is not providing a good soil for having children we then say she is just like her mother it is inherited no it is not it is what that mother does to her baby just by who she is every day there is new information and research on this subject a new study by alberto bucay of the research center , halabe and darwich , mexico , is now suggesting that when parents are happy it can change the germ cells egg and sperm that will affect the offspring he writes in bioscience hypotheses , reported in science news , that parent s psychology and emotional state before conception can affect the child s genes for now this proposal is mostly polemical but it is intriguing it is for all these reasons that epigenetics will soon be a very important area of study , something that did not exist when i was coming up in psychology i discuss research into anise later on infant behavior development july , pgs prenatal depression effects on the fetus and newborn healthday news july vivette glover imperial college , london royal society summer science exhibition july , see stress during pregnancy may lower baby s iq british research reported in the globe canada zosia bielski neuro developmental changes of fetal pain semin perinatol , oct , nov , science daily may , trauma experienced by a mother even before pregnancy will influence her offspring s behavior can happiness be inherited ?
