so much gloominess in my blog lately , i thought i 'd add at least one smiling photo from grandma 's marathon this was taken by my brother around mile , i think my two nephews ages and made me smile with their homemade signs that said , go auntie ! faster , faster ! ! i saw them more times over the course of the race it was great having their support they were definitely the bright spot of an otherwise disappointing day
