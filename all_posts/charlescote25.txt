my friend steve who teaches english in a pittsburgh high school asked me several years ago to read catcher in the rye from a clinical perspective i presented the following assessment to his students to give them a psychological profile of holden caufield 's character the process was fascinating and increased my appreciation for j d sallinger 's classic novel of course this is a highly speculative assessment and i hope it provokes some debate psychosocial history family patient is a year old male , the nd of four children from a wealthy family in nyc his younger brother allie died at the age of on july , from leukemia when holden was age an older brother named db is a screenwriter and lives in hollywood the younger sister pheobe is now age and lives at home with both parents in an apartment

from three prior boarding schools for similar reasons , saying , i did n't exactly flunk out or anything i just quit , sort of prior to his most recent expulsion , he described an incident where he lost the fencing team 's equipment , resulting in significant social ostracization this may have triggered traumatic memories about an incident that occurred when he attended elkton hills , when a

describes himself as a sort of atheist psychiatric holden describes several incidents in the past month that appear to be instances of derealization he reports , i felt like i was sort of disappearing he says he often acts as if he 's years old , about the age when his younger brother allie died , and imagines talking with him , idealizing this brother as times as intelligent as himself and the nicest member of the family he considers himself the only dumb one in the family , and idealizes all of his siblings holden had an emotional breakdown the night his brother died , breaking all the windows in the garage , resulting in a brief hospital stay to treat his wounds his parents wanted him to receive psychoanalysis at that time but did not follow through thinking about his brother 's baseball mitt gives holden pleasure and he wrote a composition about it for his roommate however , the roommate rejected the paper and holden tore it up out of anger because everything always stayed right where it was , holden likes museums , suggesting a possible struggle with accepting the significant changes in his life certain things they should stay the way they are , he says you ought to be about to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone saying he does n't see much point to the way most people live their lives , holden shows signs of low motivation and despair he often fantasizes about running away to a place where no one knows him , where he wo n't have to interact with people ironically , he seems very interested in engaging people in conversation

on life he continually says things are very depressing and terrible he reports decreased appetite often lying to relieve boredom , holden says , once i get started , i can go on for hours if i feel
