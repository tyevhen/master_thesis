would you trust a chief of staff named scooter libby ? sounds like a minor character from the andy griffith show and his last name is the first name of my first wife , ecch ! to more serious matters , if i can seriously engage you in a serious discussion about seriousness , which should be taken seriously and by no means should be subjected to any superficial dismissals of its abiding importance , which i herewith most seriously aver , confirm , and opine to speak seriously is to speak from the mind and heart and balls , but as i am incapable of matthew arnold 's high seriousness which is why milton and wordsworth bore me , i shall likely remain a very minor poet with a very good sense of humor , however dark my humor may be which may mean i should be taken seriously for my dark humor how dark is my humor ? i find death exceedingly funny though a christian i even mock god why ? because the bible says , be not deceived , for god is not mocked if god cannot be mocked i cannot mock him , therefore am committing no sin my chief complaint of god is that he has much too much faith in us , as if he 's gambling our fate on drawing to an inside straight my poor hypochondriacal daughter , rachel , used to ask me when growing up what this or that bump or pain meant as a doctor , and with a straight face , i would say i think it 's cancer , dear afterward she 'd yell at me so i afflicted my very own spawn with my dark humor seriously , while some rise by their gravity i seeme to sink by my levity i stole that line from a curate standing futilely under the miter tree now , if you 'll just bear with me , i 'll come up with some truly serious comments as a challenge to my basic flippancy on iraq we cannot leave iraq now or the future troops who die will be robbed of the honor of not dying in vain , like the heroic halliburton chess pieces that have gone before how could we deprive them of this honor ? it 's simply unpatriotic we must stay the course in order that more may die to prove others did not die in vain , though i have not come up with a precise number yet i leave that to the pentagon i stole this basic idea from doonesbury nevertheless , i did write a serious poem about the vietnam memorial , which i 'll paste in below to prove i can be serious to all serious doubters of my seriousness at the vietnam war memorial black granite stretches its harsh , tapering wings up to pedestrian level grass but sucks me down , here , at the intersection of names i forgive , i must , though i wish something could heal this gash in the earth behold , all theorists , the price of theory extreme unction by napalm and blood , buried whole or in pieces the va grants prostheses but not minds free of horror in jungles tumescent , through villages of straw , by the mekong where catfish sleep in mud heaven , we tramped , disarmed mines and flushed tunnels , shot women and children for potential collaboration , smoked thai stick until stuporous and still the sound of charlie played on every frond beat against this polished rock , america , this vast projective surface for your sins , wear your heart out it 's not how many died but that they died in vain , achieving nothing except our grief for them it 's said you cannot write a good poem until recollected in tranquility let this be a bad poem , bad as the war , dividing author from reader and reader from page let it drive a wedge between fathers and sons let fathers mistake rebellion for disloyalty , let sons mistake honor for stupidity , let senators mistake appropriation for commitment , let mothers confuse waste with sacrifice , let sisters turn to prostitution to forget , let teachers suicide in public in partial recompense , let preachers castrate themselves for passive assent , let everything in america that breathes hang its head in irrefragable shame here is the legacy of your assumptions , here the necropolis of your dark suited wisdom a city set in a pit cannot be hid published in the adirondack review now go have a drink and consider writing a letter to your congressman to get the hell out of iraq and let the civil war begin until another strongman restores order does n't anybody at foggy bottom read history ? i guess they 're more interested in writing it seriously thine , c e chaffin
