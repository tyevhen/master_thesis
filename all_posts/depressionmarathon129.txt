i think i need to get away i'm feeling cooped up and restless before major depression cleaned out my bank accounts and limited my future earning potential , i used to travel whenever i could i enjoyed getting away i love to travel nothing extravagant , i actually prefer to wander off the beaten path even if i find myself in a major tourist destination , i like to learn from the locals and see the things they find interesting or important i like to eat at local diners rather than tourist filled restaurants i do n't think i 've ever hailed a cab if i do n't rent my own vehicle , i prefer to walk or use public transportation again , it brings me closer to the local daily life i like to learn maybe that 's the problem maybe i need to learn something new i do n't know though suddenly , that sounds overwhelming i think i just need to get away , to see something new and different , to do something new and different i 've been focused on daily tasks lately since i'm feeling like my mood may be on shaky ground , i 've been concentrating on taking the next right action , and then the next , and the next i 've been staying on top of things and getting things done i'm getting through my days , but i'm flat i'm working when i need to work i'm exercising when i need to exercise i'm completing chores when they need to be done i'm even socializing more than usual but i'm restless i'm lacking excitement i'm usually totally happy with my pleasantly boring life , but today i guess i need a bit more i better start making some plans i 've been spending a lot of time online researching some pretty fantastic far away places , but those , out of necessity , are long range tentative plans i think i need to find something more immediate than that maybe jet and i should go for a hike this weekend i'm sure i can find a minnesota state park i have yet to visit will that be enough ? i do n't know , but it 's worth a shot at least i 'll be away
