this is how far i have sunk people really far twas the night before iep 's and all through the house not a creature was stirring , well , except mama the papers were stacked by the front door with care because mama knew that iep day soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds with visions of zip lines zooming through their heads and me with my coffee and my highlighter out tried to discern what these goals were really about out of trials independently they said ? they want jack to learn to stand on his head ? he would benefit from all of these things they declare but when i look at interventions , well , none of them are there ! additional adult support is the key i used to think that that person could have beeen me a scribe will assist my little boy with his testing he can think more effectively with his little hands resting break down his assignments into smaller units how the heck will his teacher do this with other students ? not to mention the behavior chart with rewards they suggest to encourage my boy to always do his best a slant board , weighted pencil , wiggle seat and lap pad at school my son looks like he 's starting a new fad make jack repeat the information he heard do n't you get it ? he really wants to talk about a bird ! ! ! in the frustration mommy feels she is n't alone the staff wants to help but resources are dry as a bone so i fight , and they fight and we hope for the best knowing the battle for more funding will be the true test when i feel like screaming , i let the advocate do the talking because if i said what i wanted , they might send me walking i try to stay calm , after all this is n't my first time my kids are and and this is iep meeting number ! we 'll make it through this day and move on from this meeting and pray that my son excels with preferential seating as a mom of a special needs kid this is the dance working your butt off to give your amazing child a chance so sleep will elude me tonight there 's no doubt i 'll dress up in the morning even whip the makeup out i 'll advocate for my son and when it 's all over i 'll pass out in my latte then get under the covers on friday we 'll start to implement all of these plans as i constantly remind myself that my baby is in really good hands yep , i went there
