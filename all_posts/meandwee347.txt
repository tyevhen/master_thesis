this is the quote that got me through the hard times when we had all of our miscarriages , fertility issues and wishing so much for a baby of our own i spent a lot of time in a dark place a sad place a place filled with fear and doubt i started to believe that nothing was going to work out for me the pit i was in felt deeper and wider with each day it was hellish then , i discovered the power of positive thinking not as a magic pill , but as a way to make myself feel better while waiting for the great things to come my way they say that sending out positive thoughts and energy will bring positive things back to you tenfold i 'd tried everything else , so i figured this was worth a shot it took a lot of practice , but i forced myself to try and turn every negative thought into a positive one over time , i began to find myself thinking in positive ways from the start i felt so much better ! life felt full of possibility ! and having this quote to stare at every day really helped in our darkest hours we cannot see it , but there is a lot going on behind the scenes in our favor we have to have faith that our dreams are coming to fruition and they are simmering there that the stars are aligning just right to bring us our dreams we have to believe that there is a host of wonderful treasures just waiting for us around the corner assume it is so and let the powers that be do their work it takes time to create your miracle this quote continues to help me and i wanted to share it with everyone else so , i designed this piece of art so that it could be hung up proudly it 's x , but i could also make it in x if you 'd like would you like a print of your own ? you can get one here save you might also like reading corner toy area art corner linkwithin
