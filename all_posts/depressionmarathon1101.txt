i'm thinking this morning of us mentally ill , like me mental illness a unique affliction , dreaded difficult debilitating stereotyped scary stigmatizing no hallmark or flowers no visitors or gifts no casserole or hotdish ! are you the black sheep in your family , too ? are the whispers you hear always about you ? our invisible pain more painful still , as nobody asks , hey , how are you ? please allow me how are you ? how are you ? on this day of blessings , may each of you know peace , grace , and serenity for this , i will pray merry christmas , everyone
