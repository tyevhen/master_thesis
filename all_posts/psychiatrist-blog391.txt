today , i live tweeted psychiatry grand rounds from johns hopkins on traumatic brain injury i 've tried to do this before , but i got paged out after just a few tweets today , i made it through the whole lecture i did n't tweet the patient presentation , just the lecture part i did n't have my laptop , or wifi access , so i did it from my iphone on the touch screen where my fat fingers sometimes hit the wrong key and while the speaker was excellent , she spoke really , really fast , and i missed a bit i did my best you can check it out at jhhgr my tweets are a bit disorganized and fragmented , but it 's not really the venue for precision next week , the maryland psychiatric society will be holding a seminar on how to do the new cpt coding and i'm hoping i can live tweet that again , no wifi , and it will be my fingers flying as fast as they can on my phone the seminar is much longer than the talk i tweeted today maybe the speaker will talk a little slower so tune in , and if i can , i 'll be tweeting the seminar at pm on using hashtag cpt
