jesse was reading my novel , home inspection , a story told through the psychotherapy of two patients i was reading the chapter where tom talks about decorating his new home , and i thought , 'no patient has ever talked to me in that kind of detail about such things ' really ? people tell me stories in a lot of detail , at least some do i started to think about it , do people talk to me in that detail maybe not then my next two patients came in one talked about a favorite food that was on special at a grocery store and how they only stock it for certain seasons the next talked about the seating arrangements chair by chair for a party she is organizing yes , people talk to me in that kind of detail it left jesse and i to wonder if there is some difference about our styles that people talk to us about a different degree of detail , or if people talk to female psychiatrists about different things than they talk to male psychiatrists about what do you think ?
