maybe that second cup of coffee made the difference this morning on a perfectly gorgeous day , i ended up running miles today rather than the i was fretting about see previous post i had scheduled for next weekend , but i'm doing a half marathon next weekend , so i was already fretting about completing the eighteen all week i thought about switching today 's with next week 's , but i did n't want to put pressure on myself my tentative plan for next saturday was to warm up with a couple miles and then run more at the end of the race , but i also knew that would suck that plan , and the thought that it would just be easier to run today , was in the back of my mind for the first miles when i got to , i felt pretty good , so i said , what the hell ! and i went for it fourteen miles came up pretty quickly , but those last four miles were particularly tough i had a difficult schedule this week including a mile tempo run just two days ago i really felt the cumulative effect during those last four miles today but , hey , i finished ! i maintained my pace , too , despite the hurt it must have been that second cup
