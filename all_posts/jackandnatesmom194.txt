thought i would share some really fun videos of the boys' progress in ot jack has been with the same ot for close to years now , and i will be sitting in the waiting room and bing i will get a video of one of the boys doing something awesome i used to go back to watch when it was just jack , but natey gets really really mad if i come back to watch something and then leave again thus the videos which is really preferred , b c i can watch them over and over again ! first jack seat drops on the trampoline ! hanging out this is a huge improvement in strength for him and last but not least , natey and the zip line i want ot ! ! trampoline ? zip line ? it 's like rolly pollies ! except it really is very challenging for these guys , and i have seen both of them make tremendous progress they both tolerate so much more movement than they used to , and both have great improvement in strength the sensory benefits are also huge enjoy !
