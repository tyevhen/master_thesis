dear ms curtiss , i have been wanting to write you for many years to thank you for your book depression is a choice it has helped me to transform my life i am a year old woman , mother of two of teenagers i have always had a tendency towards depression , especially after i started my first period , but my family and friends , sports and the beauty of the canadian west coast always kept me so busy i had no time for it to settle in it was n't till after my daughters birth at the age of , being married , and on the other side of the country after my husband had completed degrees and was starting his university career , that i fell into a deep postpartum depression several factors contributed to its depths an emotionally absent husband , severe dieting and exercise while still nursing , as well as a lack of a network of friends and family after moving to a new city so there i was , , uneducated with a new baby and one day as i sat on the couch nursing her , the walls seemed to close in on me and i knew i could n't continue my life this way i went to the doctor and because i was nursing i did n't want to take meds so i took out every book on postpartum depression in the library and began the struggle to pull myself out of the depression i felt hopeless and thoughts of death swirled around me constantly i would go to a workout class and all i saw were a bunch of woman fighting their mortality but despite all this i went back to work in my retail job , went back to university to restart the degree i had abandoned at the age of , and continued to care for my children and run the household while my husband worked non stop to get tenure by the time my daughter was i knew the marriage was over i was no longer depressed but was a nervous wreck from our constant fighting , and i was now going out partying dancing and drinking with a new friend i had met at the gym i grew up always being the good girl , listening to my parents , church and husband , but now i yearned for the excitement of the bars and meeting new people and looking very young for my age of i loved the attention of the men that i met when i went out i left my husband when i was and hooked up with a guy who i thought was mr wonderful , but who proceeded to constantly cheat on me i stayed with him for years and by this time i had gone through a round of medication and had proceeded to become wilder and more anxiety ridden within years i was diagnosed as bipolar and started on lithium and shortly after , di valproic acid as the relationship with my boyfriend was dissolving i decided to go back to school i had completed the course i had taken years earlier with an a despite the turmoil in my life at that time , and i decided that even if i did n't feel like i could do it i was going to because nothing up this point in my life was working anyways so now , alone again , i started full time at university while still working and taking care of my kids at this point i was still very manic my doctor was trying to find the right dose , and i often left the studio in tears because i could n't focus i was still partying and drinking as much as i could on the days the kids were with their dad , and i would often work on projects in the middle of the night on a manic high after the first year despite all my self destructive behavior i came away with almost all a 's and high b , and i knew i had to stop spinning my wheels but it is hard to stop the momentum of destructive behavior , and by now on a sexual rampage that was as much sexual exploration as payback for the abuse and neglect i felt i had suffered from , first my husband , and then my boyfriend i used men for sex and comfort to feed my sense of inadequacy and lack of self esteem however , school began to give me a sense of self worth and i continued to do well , making the dean 's honor roll in my second year i made awesome friendships with people half my age who continue to be my friends , and i had incredible professors who supported and encouraged me one in particular , who had made me cry the first year several times turned out to be my mentor , and eventually shared with me that she was also bipolar and had suffered a postpartum depression and the break up of her marriage as well yet she was accomplished and never allowed me to feel sorry for myself , but taught me to work despite the pain after making the honors role again in my third year i was beginning to slow down on my partying , and was now dating guys instead of just sleeping with them a friend of mine who was also bipolar had also told me about a bipolar support group meeting she had gone to where the speaker had talked about omega i began to do research online about it also realized that during my 's when i had been very stable and successful in my job on the west coast , my diet had been very healthy because of training for long distance runs but , in particular , the diet had included at least meals with salmon every week i had always wondered what was the key to my lack of mood swings at that time and through my research i discovered a book called the natural way to beat depression by dr basant k puri and hilary boyd and i began to follow their recommendations for doses of vitamins and minerals as well as the high doses of epa by the end of the summer i was feeling calmer one day when i took my kids to an outdoor pool to swim , i had taken a book to read , and i got totally wrapped up in it and read for hours straight as the kids swam and played what struck me was that for the first time since my daughter s birth , i was able to sit and read a book for longer than an hour immediately after her birth i had not been able to focus on any reading at all and for six months could n't even pick up a newspaper any reading i did was in fits and starts which made doing research papers a challenge and then it hit me something was different i was now doing my honors year and continued to feel more focused than i had been for years but still felt the overwhelming hopelessness that had plagued me for years and countered it by continued manic behavior one day in early january i went to this book warehouse with a friend , and found your book , and bought it my friend laughed at me because i was constantly looking for answers and would often get excited about some new solution but after buying your book and reading it i knew i was on the right path i knew you understood that my depression was n't something that i had made up , but that i also could fight it counselors were often amazed at my stubborness and ability to come up with my own strategies to deal with my depression but through your book i began to also be able to control my manic behavior i was beginning to make the right choices instead of allowing myself to spiral out of control i became more and more focused on my honors project staying home on nights i did n't have the kids instead of going out partying up till then if i was alone for long periods my mind would start racing and i would become agitated but now i focused instead on my project or got movies and kept my mind occupied instead of allowing myself to fall into my hopeless and lonely thoughts by the spring i had my honors exhibit i had completed my degree with a first class standing and i knew it was time to wean myself of the di valproic acid i knew the key to controlling my manic behavior lay in my own mind and not in drugs as i had been just as reckless and manic on meds anyways after a month of slowly cutting my dose i finally got up my nerve to go to my doctor to tell her what i was doing though alarmed and concerned , she instructed me on the proper method to wean myself off and within a month i was off completely since then i have hads ups and downs but i am continuing to feel stronger and stronger close friends of mine have also noticed this strength in me i have been able to end unhealthy relationships quicker , and have also noticed my sexual boundaries with men have returned for which i am so relieved i no longer feel like a victim of this disease and feel i have the tools to control it i have been teaching my daughter who suffers from a lot of anxiety how to mood bust , and this year she seems more happy and well adjusted last night i shared your book with a young friend who has struggled with depression for years and she now wants to get a copy too i am not where i want to be yet , i am still struggling with my financial situation and with what direction to take in my life , but it no longer overwhelms me i allow myself my feelings but do n't let them rule me i have shared my story with you because i want you to know that your book has really helped me day by day i am becoming the person i want to be day by day i am finding the person i lost thank you a r dear a r thank you for your letter you have come on the same long journey that many of us have to take who were not blessed with wise parenting as children , and therefore wandered into some bad coping mechanisms to make our way congratulations on your success if you have any questions , i will be glad to answer them a b curtiss
