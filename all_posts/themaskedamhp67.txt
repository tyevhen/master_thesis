i was at a committee meeting of the mental health faculty of the college of social work the other week , and we were discussing the new draft code of practice with representatives from the department of health as you do , and making suggestions for changes one of the suggestions related to the length of time it takes for patients appeals and referrals to the tribunal following a sec , as it can often be months before an appeal is heard it was suggested that the new code should include guidance to the tribunal to hear these appeals much more quickly while we were talking about this , i suddenly wondered why detention for treatment under sec lasts for a whole six months in the first place this got me thinking being the masked amhp , i just love mental health law i wrote a blog post a while ago about the lunatic asylums act , one of the predecessors of the mental health act there were clear references even that far back of legislation that eventually evolved into sec , sec , sec and even the police powers of sec the history of mental health legislation tends to reflect , and be enacted in response to , changes in the approach to the treatment of mental disorder in victorian times , there were no treatments at all for mental illness , and therefore legislation was about the humane containment of lunatics until they eventually spontaneously recovered , if ever the lunacy act laid down the duration for reception orders for admitting and detaining lunatics the first spell lasted for one year if renewal was required , this would last for years a further renewal would last for years after that , the order could be extended for year periods and judging by the records of lunatic asylums from the period , people could often be incarcerated for their entire adult lives however , by the time the mental treatment act was enacted in , the concept of treatment was even being reflected in the name of the legislation although parts of the older lunacy act still remained , the mental treatment act introduced the concept of voluntary patients , people who recognised that they were unwell , and who were agreeable to receiving some form of treatment in a psychiatric hospital there was also a category for temporary patients these were people deemed to have mental illness by two medical practitioners , but who were not prepared to reside in a hospital on a voluntary basis the first period of detention would last for months , and this could be extended , in three month increments , up to a maximum of months after that , the patient would have to be certified in writing by the medical officer under the lunacy act both of these acts were repealed by the mental health act even the name of this act contained the implication that parliament was convinced that a state of mental health could be achievable sec , the forerunner of the act s sec , introduced a strict time limit of days for assessment it could not be extended sec , the forerunner of sec , for treatment , then lasted for up to months it could be extended for a further months , and after that for years at a time the legislators of the mental health act clearly thought that an order for detention lasting months was out of order cough , so reduced the duration to months , with a further month renewal , and months thereafter but the act , which amended the act , left the lengths of time for sec unchanged additionally , when introducing community treatment orders , they used the same timescales as regular readers of this blog will know , i am so incredibly ancient that i was actually a mental welfare officer under the act , and used this act to detain several people under both sec and sec back then , it was not unusual for mental patients to spend many years in hospital , either informally , or detained there were large long stay hospitals all over the country there was very little in the way of treatment in the community but the drive since then has been to change the entire approach to the care and treatment of people with mental disorder from being centred around a hospital base , to being centred in the community , with admission to hospital being the exception rather than the norm this has undoubtedly been helped by new antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics it is now very rare for patients to be detained under sec for as long as months in fact , when i inform patients i have assessed that i am detaining them under sec , and that this will last for up to months , i always hastily add the proviso but it s very rare for someone to be detained for that long usually , people are not detained for more than two or three months so taking into account that treatment and practice now means that it is unusual for a patient to be detained for a full six months , why was this not addressed back in ? since there has been a steady reduction in legal lengths of detention over the last century or so , why was the length of detention under sec not shortened further to reflect modern practice ? there is a case for arguing that these timescales contravene the human rights act i would therefore like to suggest that sec should last for no more than three months , with renewals lasting only for another three months at a time cto s should perhaps have a similar time scale i know that this cannot be addressed by a code of practice , and would require a change in primary legislation but how about it ?
