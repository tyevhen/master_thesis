the screenplay draft is complete it ended up at pages rather than boo hoo here 's some of what i 've learned so far the books all say that screenwriting is hard and it is imho , it 's harder than poetry makes writing a novel seem like a stroll on the beach screenwriting is a lot like a stroll on the beach omaha beach in his book on writing a fine book , btw , stephen king talks about how he develops stories basically , he creates interesting characters , puts them in a dramatic situation , and lets them figure it out there is no conscious attempt to plot or create subplots the characters do what they must , inevitably given their proclivities and their situation do king merely transcribes he gets all the way through a novel this way following the headlights all the way to the destination , so to speak it works for king because he 's a master at what he does , and the form the novel allows it screenwriting is so constraint intensive , there is precious little room although there is some for organic story growth you almost have to come at it with a complete structure in mind screenwriter matt bird has a story structure checklist encompassing character development and all sorts of other things that 's items long you 're not going to hit even a third of the points in that list using an unprepared structure it as you go approach if you can , well , congratulations maybe you 're channeling robert towne in which case please accept my unworthy bow as i exit stage left alien would work well as a silent movie the dialog augments the story you 'll run out of room guaranteed budget pages for act i and you 'll go sailing through that mark like a drunk through a stop sign set an absolute page limit of and you 'll be at before you know it therefore the best advice i can give you is enlarge all margins and tab limits at the start , just a smidge , so you 'll get fewer words per page you 'll gladly kill any number of grandmothers later to widen them out again another tip that may keep you from busting your page count one day when you 're thoroughly blocked , write the ending write the final two scenes more , if you can of the script , complete behold your active writing area is now bookended by the already written beginning and the already in place ending you have less surface area in which to work , and the paint dries faster , forcing you to up the pace which you were wanting to do anyway , right ? thirty pages seems like a lot in the beginning but when you 've got just thirty pages left to write , it 's never enough let actions and situations do the talking whenever possible let characters speak only if and when they must , and even then , let subtext , not the actual words , tell the story never forget one thing watching a movie is an act of voyeurism hence , all dialog is overheard hence , no conversation needs to begin at the beginning think of the times you 've overheard a conversation whether at a bar , a social function , standing in line , or whatever in real life did you ever hear the actual start of the conversation ? chances are you came along in the middle yet within a few seconds , you figured out the essentials of the conversation who , what , where , when , why from context that 's how all movie dialog works the film viewer is an eavesdropper , not a court stenographer take a scene , any scene cut the first line of dialog does the scene still work ? yes ? then why did you ever think you needed that line of dialog ? more often than not , dialog is about subtext , backstory , misdirection , and or foreshadowing , not just what 's going on at the moment we can see what 's going on at the moment dialog , properly done , wears a hairpiece it 's never bald it helps to know something about stage magic and its crazy stepsister , comedy both are all about misdirection would your script still make for a good moviegoing experience with the sound off ? alien would play damn well as a silent movie my dinner with andre would not look at your script with dialog turned off in your head , at least which did you write ? alien , or my dinner with andre ? i was fortunate , with the script i just wrote , to have a multinational story , with lots of non english speaking characters but zero subtitles , thanks try it sometime write a scene that involves foreign nationals , speaking their native tongues , using no subtitles , with the idea that the scene has to be understandable to anyone , of any language see how far you can take it can you still make the scene work ? why or why not ? there 's more to tell suffice it to say , the screenplay writing process has taught me a lot and i thought i already knew a thing or two i was right , as it turns out i knew a thing maybe two at the most if you 'd like to see my wga registered screenplay , drop me a line my hushmail dot com address is kasthomas inquiries held in strictest confidence please mention your twitter handle if applicable
