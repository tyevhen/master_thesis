here is her new play apron made from vintage 's fabric i got it from etsy seller gagie pagie pudding pie appropriately named i think ! ! you can see it on her in the photo below the text in this post hi there ! i thought i 'd take this chance to show you the new play kitchen that paige 's grandparents gifted her for christmas most of her gifts from us were kitchen related she 's a little young yet to fully do the whole pretend thing , but she 's starting i figure she will keep growing into it for now , she likes to lift the sink out and throw toys down underneath to hide them she also will stir her imagined soup in the pot she keeps pushing the burner buttons on and off while also pouring with her little metal tea kettle this particular play kitchen is from ikea and seemed to be the most affordable option out there and i also happened to aesthetically like it the best it has everything i thought a play kitchen should including little burners that light up there 's plenty of storage and the simple design matches many decors another cool thing is that the legs adjust and it can raise up even higher when she is older yay ! as you can see , i added hooks to the sides to store cleaning implements and her apron kitchen cloth i wanted to install actual metal fixtures for this , but it felt like overkill when the time came to set it up the simple hooks are functional and easy and are also removable since they are that sticky pull off material as my bloggie friend lor mentioned in the comments in an earlier post , the magnets that hold the cabinets shut are very strong paige has a hard time opening them so a few layers of masking tape over them allows for the magnets to work much more gently when she 's older i can just remove the tape easy peasy ! so , that 's the play kitchen review we love it ! save
