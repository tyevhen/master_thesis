this year , one of my big projects is to read the bible cover to cover everyone is welcome to watch my progress or read along with me sign up and schedule post is here several people have approached me about the pros and cons of reading the bible cover to cover instead of reading it in assigned excerpts in programs designed by professionals lots of people get bogged down in the genealogies , my friends say , and they quit my answer to this is that cover to cover is not a great way to read the bible for spiritual or historical approaches , but for a literary approach it makes sense to read each book as one literary unit that way we can appreciate the style and story progression of each book many people think that reading the bible as literature betrays a liberal bias , that it 's foreign to the original intent , or that it implies the bible is fiction and not divinely inspired i say that the bible is , by nature , a literary work without literary form , no content can exist we can not extract the moral or theological meaning of a story without first assimilating the plot , setting , and characters of the story thus a literary reading is a good place for anyone , conservative or liberal , antiquated or modern , theological or non religious , to start one very important starting point to reading the bible as literature is to recognize that the bible is a meta narrative it 's an anthology of books written over many eras by people of different cultures and languages but the overall structure of the biblical narrative has a u shape it tells an overall story , starting with paradise for the innocent eden , flowing through depths of sin and deprivation , and then ending in paradise for the faithful revelations the biblical anthology has many genres including the narrative hero story , gospel , epic , tragedy , comedy , and parable and poetic lyric , lament , psalm , love poem , nature poem , wedding poem of these , the far most common is narrative over the next two weeks , i'm going to read the book of genesis , which is an epic narrative ryken ryken in their introduction to the literary study bible
