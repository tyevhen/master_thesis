for my family , and most of my friends , this title may bring back memories , maybe even illicit some giggles i have many many serious things i could be updating you on right now iep meetings called , letters written to the school by therapists and physicians , new medications , more shots , first weeks at school , but tonight i choose funny after a trying week , i decided that tonight would be the night we would put up christmas decorations we have nate 's birthday party next weekend , so we needed to get it done anyway we had some drama with our tree , ended up with a new artificial one , as getting a real tree is not an option in your house when your three year old is obsessed with pine needles and twirling them we would have no tree left in a week 's time anyway , so there i am getting out the decorations , including my nativity set , which i adore jack started talking about it right away , about the angel gabriel , about jesus coming again , i am really impressed by all that he has absorbed then it happened he started in again anyone remember last year ? for those of you who only know me through the blog , this is a bit awkward my five year old son , with asperger 's , likes to pretend he 's baby jesus sweet in some ways right ? well the problem with this situation is that as with all of his interests obsessions , jack takes this to the extreme remember how when he is being a baby airplane i can call him nothing else at any time ? the exact same way with baby jesus as in mommy , tell me , baby jesus , that it 's time for a snack or , i'm baby jesus my best friend is santa or tell me , baby jesus , stop knocking the ornaments off the tree i am worried that he will continue with this and that it will progress to the level that it did last year i found it really really difficult last winter to tell jack baby jesus , go make a poop or we 're not going to the movie however , he would respond to nothing else or , baby jesus , stop saying bad words , santa is watching or baby jesus , it 's time to go upstairs to your room , you 're in time out i mean i was raised catholic it just feels wrong to tell baby jesus what to do ! ! ! ! so far it 's been pretty mild , i 've only really had to serve baby jesus hot cocoa while he decorated the tree of course john loves that jack is baby jesus , because that makes him baby jesus' dad sigh sorry honey , it does n't work that way welcome to our holiday season
