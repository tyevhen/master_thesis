i think depression is unique among illnesses depression is so gray there is no signature cough , no tell tale physical pain , no excessive bleeding , and no abnormal blood test it leads someone like me to question whether or not i am truly ill is this a relapse , or am i just sad ? is depression rearing its ugly head , or do i just have a defective character ? is this me or my illness dragging me down ? in the midst of feeling so low , these are horribly tormenting questions running through my head would n't it be nice if there was a lab test which proved when depression was active ? i feel bad , i go to the doctor , the doctor orders the test , and yup , there it is in black and white i 've got another case of depression , or i 've had a relapse of my illness it would be as clear as day there would be no shades of gray there would be no stigma , no questioning , no shaming , no guilt what would be would be , and we 'd treat it accordingly would n't that be nice ?
