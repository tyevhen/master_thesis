i ll admit it i am a perfectionist i like to be number , to have everything work just right , to be at the top of the class , to be at the front of the line , to be the highest performer the problem is that trying to be perfect is exhausting and taxing on my mental health recently i turned in an assignment for a class afterward i agonized over whether my submission would meet all of the grading criteria more specifically , i was worried i would not receive a perfect score i had trouble sleeping , talked up the paper with friends , and felt nervous and tense finally a friend reminded me that this is a triviality that the earth won t stop spinning if i receive a less than perfect grade ! i realized that i was violating recovery s principle of being average by trying to be exceptional i allowed my imagination to be on fire after this experience , i felt a bit guilty for not practicing my recovery training better however , dr low reminds us to endorse for the effort , not the outcome , and before recovery i would not have stopped this vicious cycle and would have continued to worry after all , we are not to try to practice recovery perfectly , but rather as an average person
