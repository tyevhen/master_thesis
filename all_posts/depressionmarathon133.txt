i'm in a weird space my mood is fine , but i do n't feel like doing anything nothing and this has been going on for days now in fact , i 'd been planning to write in this blog for straight days , and i 've got several ideas swirling about my head , but each time i sat down to write , i quickly quit no mojo just did n't feel like it this feeling of not wanting to do anything has begun each day at sun up and lasted until sun down i 've had tremendous difficulty getting out of bed for the last days i 've had trouble waking up that 's not typical i even contemplated calling in late to work once or twice just so i could stay in bed that 's not like me i 've worked my scheduled shifts , but even there , i 've wanted to cut corners i have n't cut corners , but it concerns me that i wanted to unusual i 've forced myself to exercise most days , but i totally skipped it a couple of days ago did n't feel like it i knew i should go , but i could n't overcome the inertia , so i did n't go i skipped one of my regular meetings earlier this week did n't want to bother instead , i snoozed in my chair i never fall asleep sitting up ! weird and do n't get me started on all of the chores i'm letting slide my neighbors may call the authorities if i do n't mow my yard soon oh well i'm not used to feeling so consistently unmotivated not when i'm otherwise feeling well , that is it 's fairly normal to have low motivation when my mood is suffering , but it 's not typical when i'm feeling okay i'm not sure what 's going on i'm not thrilled with it either i do n't like feeling unproductive i do n't like leaving things for tomorrow , and tomorrow , and then tomorrow again it 's frustrating and strange i do n't know why i'm feeling like this , but i also know i do n't need to figure it out thank god , because i do n't have the motivation to do that either ! this too shall pass , i hope
