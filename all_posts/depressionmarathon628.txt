it 's the end of a long weekend with d he 's on his way home he left hours ago , so he 's probably getting close to home now i miss him i feel a little silly saying that , but it 's the truth i miss him my house feels empty i think puck 's even a little sad we 're missing part of the pack it 's funny this is the first time he 's come here , rather than me going there , and this is the first time i 've felt sad when we 've parted usually , i 've felt pleasantly tired and happy today i'm pleasantly tired and sad weird my friend cindy says it means i'm falling in love d and i had a great time together this weekend he seemed more relaxed it 's probably because he did n't have to worry about what we were going to do next this time that was my worry the weekend went by so quickly , i did n't have much time to worry though it was a busy weekend actually , friday was relaxing , but saturday was quite busy my sponsor and her husband treated us to a minnesota twins game yesterday after working out , we left home early for the game , which took up most of the day the twins lost , but we had a lot of fun after returning home , we had about minutes to relax before going out for dinner with my sponsor , her husband , and friends , bill and cindy dinner took up the rest of the day we were whipped by the time we got home for bed today was a little more relaxed , but it was too short we worked out this morning , had coffee with bill and cindy , and watched a little football before he had to head home we basically had just over hours together i'm not complaining , but i ca n't wait until we can spend more time together hmmm i just got off the phone with d maybe my friend cindy is right
