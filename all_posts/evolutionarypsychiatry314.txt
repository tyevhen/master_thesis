found two more studies measuring diet pattern and mood disorders ! the first one is dietary pattern and depressive symptoms in middle age from the british journal of psychiatry in free full text , go take a look ! this paper is part of the large whitehall ii epidemiological study , where some , people were screened at baseline phase for all sorts of demographic characteristics , stress levels , health , lifestyle factors , blood pressure , and some labwork every years or so , the study subjects received a postal questionnaire to fill out phases , , , , and every years a questionnaire and a clinical examination were done phases , , in this paper , the data was taken from white european participants with data on dietary patterns and all covariates at phase and depression at phase the black and asian participants were excluded due to differences in eating patterns ! ! ! dietary pattern was determined by a food frequency questionnaire based on the one used in the nurses health study but changed up to include british sorts of foods like bangers and mash , or crisps , or yorkshire pudding here 's a good write up addressing the actually rather rigorous , but still hopeless validity of the ffq used in the nurses health study food items were rated according to how often they were consumed never or less than once per month up to six or more times per day the items were divided into groups , and dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis of the groups , and statisticians gleefully addressed the data with graphs and scree plots and tweaks and nudges until a score pops out about each person 's diet , falling into whole foods or the processed foods patterns whole foods were diets consisting of vegetables , fruits and fish processed foods were diets consisting of high consumption of sweetened desserts , chocolates , fried food , processed meat , pies , refined grains , high fat dairy products , and condiments depression measures were determined by a question center for epidemiologic studies depression scale people with a score higher than were considered depressed then the statisticians got a whack at the data again , adjusting for covariates such as age , gender , marital status , employment grade , education , smoking , physical activity , health status based on clinical findings such as a high hemoglobin ac a measure of average blood glucose , blood pressure , being on antidepressants , etc , a second ghq depression subscale , and a cognitive score based on question test ready for the results yet ? what do you think will turn out ? patients with the highest intake of whole foods were less likely to be depressed and this association was n't affected much , actually , by adjusting for all the covariates , which is interesting suggesting that the association with diet could be as important or more important than all those other covariates patients with a high intake of processed food were much more likely to be depressed there is another interesting thing about this study see , from just the above data , you do n't know whether depressed people are too blue to do anything but sit around gorging on meat pies , sugar , and refined grains , or if the diet actually leads to the depression the depression measures were repeated at phase and phase , and when the participants who were depressed at stage were excluded , the data showed that the same people who had crappy diets but were not depressed yet at phase were more likely to be depressed at phase in addition , the researchers went back to the phase data , and found no evidence that the dietary patterns in phase were worse for the participants who were depressed at phase these are clues that crappy diet precedes depressive symptoms , not the other way around all in all , a rather cool study , considering the limitations of epidemiology the second study is hot off the presses diet quality in bipolar disorder in a population based sample of women from the journal of affective disorders i think this is the november issue these are the corrected proofs available online before print the subjects used were women from the australian geelong osteoporosis study i blogged about them back in june women randomly recruited from compulsory voting roles volunteered for this particular piece of the study each of the women were given the gold standard interview for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders the scid non patient edition patients with depression or anxiety were excluded , allowing for patients with bipolar disorder to be compared to those with no current or lifetime psychopathology once again , a food frequency questionnaire was used , and the diets were broken up into traditional vegetables , fruit , beef , lamb , fish , whole grains , western meat pies , processed meats , pizza , chips , hamburgers , white bread , sugar , flavored milk drinks , and beer , and modern fruits , salads , fish , yogurt , nuts , beans , tofu , and red wine blah blah blah logistic regression analyses and exposure variables were studiously applied and accounted for can you tell i'm not an epidemiologist ? here 's an interesting tidbit that i do n't remember from the previous paper i blogged about in june the researchers note that it was the absolute amount of western style foods that seemed to be related to the risk of depression rather than the amount as a proportion of overall energy consumption therefore , the researchers examined the data in this grouping as both absolute amounts , percentage of energy , and covariate confounding whew bipolar disorder is less common than depressive or anxiety disorders , so only women in the whole study qualified for the diagnosis there were with depression or anxiety and therefore excluded from this analysis , and without depressive or anxiety disorders participants with bipolar disorder were younger and had higher average daily energy intake , though there was no difference in education , bmi , alcohol intake , education , socioeconomic status , smoking , and physical activity compared to those with no psychopathology interesting bipolar disorder and substance abuse are highly correlated so it is something to keep in mind that these bipolar ladies did n't seem to smoke or drink more than the normals now the diet results ! individuals with a modern pattern were more likely to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , as were individuals with a western pattern , before and after adjustments for energy intake a traditional dietary pattern was protective these data held even when accounting for age as in the previous study which i addressed in the comments in my previous blog post , the diets were also given a total dqs or dietary quality score , associated with how close the diets came to the national recommendations for good diets similar to the usda recommendations dqs score of diets had no correlation with bipolar disorder , protective or not protective overall , the authors noted as i do now ! that the association with depressive , anxiety , and bipolar disorders are similar a traditional diet being protective , and modern and western diets being similarly dismal my theory is that an individual 's response to diet would be based on genetic risk , so the inflammation level related to similar dietary choices would come out as different psychopathology depending on your genes the authors of the second study make note of the results of the first study i mentioned above they think diet is causative , not a choice as a result of specific psychiatric illness they note systemic inflammation , oxidative stress , and neurotrophin levels as potential explanations of the demonstrated associations between dietary quality and bipolar disorder i agree wholeheartedly eat real food , folks it wo n't hurt and maybe it will help
