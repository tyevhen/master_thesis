don t look now , but i ve had at least three good days in a row somebody call guiness i m not sure who gets the credit my talk therapist or my massage therapist ? i went into the spa a few days ago with heavy shoulders and a sore back as those who suffer from depression know , it s not just an in your head problem depression hurts physically as i always do , i emerged from the spa feeling like a bear that just awoke from hibernation rested , rejuvenated and hungry hungrier for life too while massage may not be a cure for depression or anxiety , it sure does help manage the symptoms it s expensive , yes but can we put a price tag on our mental health ? while the science doesn t suggest massage is a miracle cure for depression , there are studies like this one that show it sure helps i always go in with heavy shoulders but come out feeling like a champ they say our thoughts control our feelings , but that s easier said than done for many of us i ve found that when my body feels better , say from depression or exercise , it s easier to tame the torturous negative thoughts that sometimes push me to the edge of sanity and bring on bouts of depression i d love to hear from you if you ve found massage to be helpful if you ve tried it and it didn t help , i d suggest a new massage therapist so give it a shot massage away that nagging anxiety even if only for a little while
