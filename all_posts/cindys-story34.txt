for a year , i rode my bicycle to and from work every day i was always very careful to wear my helmet , use lights at night , wear bright clothing , ride on roads with bike lanes , and watch out for crazy and un alert drivers i was as safe as i could be i worked at a clinic in a hospital i left work around pm one tuesday night and was riding my bike along road i had only gone one block when suddenly , a guy in a parked car opened his car door directly into my shoulder i was knocked off my bike into the middle of the road luckily no cars were coming , but i had blood running down my leg and a huge bruising knot on my shoulder the guy in the car was very shocked and apologizing i ended up just walking home with my bike , happy that my bike or i had at least left a mark on his car door the awfulsome thing is that the next day when i was walking in to the hospital to go to work , i saw a flyer on the door giving directions to the room for the driver safety class on tuesday nights at pm ! i do n't think the guy that hit me had learned very much in his class yet !
