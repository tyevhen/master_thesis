it 's a beautiful day , and i just got done running , mile intervals i did n't get out the door until after pm , as i just could n't get going this morning i actually had to go back to bed after breakfast , and i slept for more hours interestingly , i worked the last two days , sunday and monday my fatigue makes sense in light of that fact , i guess anyway , as i was saying , it was tough to get out the door and run today i was miles into my run , facing by mile intervals , and i still did n't feel like being out there but i began anyway i ran the first couple intervals way too fast , which made the next few way more difficult i was running back and forth between two bridges on a local bike path they just happen to be exactly mile apart there was a homeless man enjoying his afternoon beverage sitting on a bench observing me we chatted a bit , which helped me keep going you see , i told him several times how many intervals i had left , which made me accountable to someone i wanted to stop after and again after , , , , and ! it took over an hour , but i persevered and finished all intervals ! boy are my legs tired ! i was thinking about perseverance while i ran back and forth i wondered if perseverance in running translated to life , and specifically to depression somewhere around interval , i came to the conclusion that it did i think being able to put one foot in front of the other when i am physically suffering and do n't want to be where i'm at , whether during a speed workout or a miler , does translate to surviving life with depression i think back to january i'm still a bit traumatized by the depth of depression i experienced in january i think back to the hospital i did n't want to be there i did n't want to do ect i was in so much pain i did n't think i could or would survive another day but i did i put one foot in front of the other and did the next thing in front of me , in the hospital and at home , to survive a very difficult time that does n't make me some kind of hero i'm just thinking i wonder if i did n't have the running experiences i 've had i wonder if the results would have been the same i do n't know , but i think my running experience helped
