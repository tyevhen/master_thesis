august leading from my research into anarcho primitivism the previous day , i did some research on various groups and organizations that seek to save the planet the most extreme , and also most fascinating , of these is the earth liberation front , or elf deemed by the us government as one of the top american based homeland security threats despite that , they have yet to cause a single death , or even injury they have , however , destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property , in the name of saving the environment some targets have been mansions that put wetlands in danger , a ski resort that planed to cut down hundreds more trees , and similar things although i'm in no way in favour of blowing stuff up , i can understand with the world we live in how easy it is to get discouraged , and to feel that bringing it all down , piece by piece , is the only way left to go in other news , i also wrote a piece on unschooling , entitled what is unschooling ? here it is introduction what is unschooling ? that s always the first question asked when i tell people that i m unschooled blank looks and curiosity homeschooling has now become , if not mainstream , at least well known , with high profile stories of homeschoolers and harvard unschooling , however , although wide spread , is still relatively unknown even among some homeschoolers ! so what is it you ask ? well , it is a form of homeschooling i suppose , in the sense that unschoolers do not go to school , but whereas homeschooling tends to imply a school at home type setup , unschooling is completely different the unschooling child or teenager directs their own education yes , you read that right unschooling versus traditional schools unschooling works on the principle that people are born with the desire to learn , and will therefore have quite enough motivation to learn about anything and everything they want to we taught ourselves to speak , didn t we ? why would we be unable to teach ourselves anything else we re interested in ? schools , however , seem to think that we as human beings are born dumb , incapable of using common sense or making our own way in the world instead , schools seek to control the child s teens life completely , to hold their hands and guide , nay shove , them in all the right directions schools teach obedience , conformity , and many useless facts something few people are aware of is that originally , our school system was designed to educate the lower class , teach absolute obedience to authority , and give the minimum education needed for them to be good factory workers our noble , and narrow , views of education are rooted in nothing more than control dispelling some common myths about homeschooling and unschooling or what does an unschooler do ? as an unschooler , the parents are not teachers they are there to help as facilitators , helping the child to discover resources and those knowledgeable in different subjects although many people equate homeschooling with staying at home and becoming little more than a hermit , most unschoolers spend quite a bit , or even most of , their time outside of the home volunteering , working , participating in apprenticeships , getting involved in activism , visiting museums and libraries when actually in the home or at a library , or a caf , or sitting on the grass in a pleasant field , many unschoolers devour books there are amazing non fiction and fiction books on any subject you choose , whether your interests lie in poetry , space shuttle construction , shoe making or calculus the possibilities are endless , and the unschooler finds themselves unhindered in their learning and growing by the time consuming , creativity squashing school system will your average unschooler end up flipping burgers all their life ? absolutely not unschoolers regularly score above average on sat and or ged tests , or have extremely impressive portfolios of work if they choose not to take tests due to their beliefs on the folly of standardized testing they get into colleges and universities , some quite prestigious ones , if they so choose they also quite often decide not to do any formal schooling , and instead pursue their dreams of starting a ballet or circus company , opening a retail store , becoming an organic farmer , starting a home business fixing computers the opportunities are truly endless in conclusion am i biased ? obviously but i do not regret the years i ve spent in free exploration , in learning everything that i want to learn , not what my government believes i should learn is it for everyone ? perhaps not but it certainly is a viable option , one that will let you or your kids grow naturally , freely , and follow your dreams , to think outside the box , not the narrow range of college dreams deemed acceptable by the schooling system , and sadly , society in general let your love of learning fly as high as the clouds , not get trampled into the polluted muck below i do n't think it 's all that good personally , but the editor of the homeschooling magazine i write for wants me to re work it into a longer article including my experiences at not back to school camp and publish it go figure on a similar not , i'm so freaking looking forward to that camp ! ! only a month away you might also like not back to school camp nbtsc unschooling another view of unschooling linkwithin
