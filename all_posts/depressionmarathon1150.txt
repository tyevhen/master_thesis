i was so anxious about my miler today , i woke up at am ! i relaxed and went back to sleep , but i was out on the road by six 'clock the morning could not have been more beautiful i started in the dark and quiet of a city still asleep the first miles were a little tough i could n't catch my breath and was winded despite a slow , relaxed pace i took a break and downed an energy gel at miles it was like a new day after that i guess i needed that energy the rest of the way went by without much difficulty a little lag here and there , and of course the last two miles are always long , but after hours of actual running , i was done even my sore right leg fared well today i purchased a compression sleeve for it yesterday , but i was quite surprised it felt as good as it did once done , i got into my ice bath , watched some football , and here i am i'm feeling good running always surprises me days i think are going to be terrific sometimes are n't days i expect to be brutal are often a breeze it is such a strange sport that way or perhaps it 's just me i 've had a tendency to do well when the odds have been stacked against me and to fall flat when the odds were in my favor hmmm that 's an interesting revelation is that a corollary of my life with vs without depression ? damn , i'm going to have to do some deep thinking about that one maybe on my next run
