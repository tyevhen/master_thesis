good question the present invention enables the monetizing of unsold inventory , google 's inventors chad and ryan steelberg explain , adding that the invention provides a system and method for accurately and timely identifying where and when a radio advertisement or radio program is broadcast the present invention may provide a communication environment configured to monitor , track , and report on radio verification of broadcast information related to a specific advertisement or program this broadcast information may be transmitted via a network accessible server and formatted for retrieval over a network the present invention may be designed to permit a reporting service subscriber to connect , such as via a network , to a server and request a report , which may be based on the verification of broadcast information , for a selected advertising campaign or radio program if that 's clear as mud , you may want to try grokking u s patent no , , , dynamic selection and scheduling of radio frequency communications , granted february , the abstract says a manager for playing of broadcast specific information is disclosed the manager for playing of broadcast specific information includes a managing node that is at least partially resident at a radio broadcast point , wherein the managing node includes a plurality of inputs for receipt of the broadcast specific information from at least two sources , wherein the hub records the broadcast specific information entering at least two of the plurality of inputs for eventual broadcast from the radio broadcast point , and at least one broadcast non specific information input associated with the managing node , wherein at least one of a format , play time , and play type of the broadcast specific information are varied in accordance with the broadcast non specific information , and wherein the varied broadcast specific information is broadcast from the radio broadcast point and then there 's u s patent no , , , method and apparatus using geographical position to provide authenticated , secure , radio frequency communication between a gaming host and a remote gaming device , which is concerned with the field of radio frequency communications in , more particularly , to a management and distribution network connecting radio frequency broadcast centers for the purpose of delivering data to rf enabled remote devices and an rf enabled remote device with gps capability for secure off site gaming applications finally , there 's u s patent no , , , dynamic data delivery apparatus and method for same , which describes a system for providing enhanced radio content to a remote user according to the abstract the system includes at least one input that receives non radio input and , at least one output interconnected to the at least one input via a hub , wherein the at least one output receives the enhanced radio content via the hub after at least one manipulation of the non radio input by the hub to form the enhanced radio content , wherein the at least one manipulation is in accordance with the at least one non radio input the patent goes on to explain the present invention may enable small and mid sized radio groups to aggregate advertising inventory with other stations to create a national advertising network this technology may enable an intelligent cost effective national ad network entities who join a network may be able to capture a greater portion of the national radio advertising market that currently is not captured at all or by the entity incremental revenue gain , by capturing national ad buys more efficiently , may permit radio stations to offer additional barter inventory to a company according to an aspect of the present invention , and based on the installed base , the option may exist to provide national advertisers with access to , stations to run national radio advertising campaigns moreover preferred embodiments utilize am and fm sub carrier bands , tv , satellite , and cellular bands so there you have it in case you 're not getting enough google tailored ad content in the margins of your gmail , start expecting it in the remnant slots of your am and fm radio stations and maybe your favorite cable channels as well
