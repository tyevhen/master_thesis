hi friends ! well , i'm headed off soon for my next nst non stress test i'm sure all will be well since little p has been rockin' and rollin' no more little pokes and prods she 's into fully moving around in there with every little body part it feels like she alternates between boxing and gymnastics all inside a balloon it 's fun to watch my stomach make odd shapes as it conforms to her newest stretch some new observations this week include my wedding ring sadly will not fit all the way on my finger but my engagement ring still works i 'd wondered when this would happen and now i have my answer my toes are starting to swell by the end of the day i 'd also wondered when this would start the other day my feet looked purplish , so i just put them up and that did the trick no purple feet since but little sausage toes are appearing much more often i'm officially waddling and groaning with every move i groan when i get out of a chair , out of bed , out of the car pretty much whenever i have to disembark something i also follow that up with a heaving sigh of relief when i sit anywhere and settle down in a chair , in bed , in a car , etc the same goes for conquering a flight of stairs sweat beading on my brow it 's as if i 'd climbed the matterhorn and must be rewarded instead , i let out a heaving sigh and waddle on my way i guess it makes sense when you are basically carrying a cinder block strapped to the front of you a cute and snuggly cinder block that loves her dad 's voice she 's going to continue to get heavier and i will gratefully heave a million or trillion sighs of relief and groans of pain if it means she will get here safely save you might also like weeks weeks weeks linkwithin
