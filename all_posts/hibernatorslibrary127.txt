the rolling stones , by robert a heinlein narrated by tom weiner teenaged twins castor and pollux stone cajole their father into buying a space ship , and the entire family goes on a trip around the galaxy but castor and pollux repeatedly end up in trouble with their schemes to make a fortune on distant planets this is a hard book for me to review , so i 'll keep it short i 've only read one other book by heinlein , a stranger in a strange land , and that was as a teenager , so i expected something a bit more serious and meaningful in this book is this what pulp is ? i 've only read one pulp fiction book , a princess of mars , by edgar rice burroughs , so i'm very inexperienced with the genre it took me a while to get over the cheese but i recognize that when you 're reading a book that was written in a style foreign to you , it 's better to view the book within its context rather than comparing it to your usual type and after i approached the book from this perspective , i began to really enjoy the humor and even became emotionally invested in the characters i would n't say i highly recommend this book , but i enjoyed my second pulp experience
