as we say up north , uff da , we 've been getting dumped on it 's been raining for at least hours , i think , and there are no signs of it stopping basements are filling up rivers are swollen beyond their banks major highways are closed due to flooding there is water everywhere ! fortunately , my basement is dry ! that k i spent on the waterproofing system apparently was well spent this has definitely been the biggest test my basement has had since i fixed it after it flooded years ago so far , so good i'm so relieved it 's so dry down there , i even spent time painting it today ! i would have been devastated if it had flooded again ! the weather forced me indoors for my run today yuck ! i hate running on treadmills treadmills feel so much harder than running outdoors i know some people find them easier , but not me i always feel more tired on a treadmill nevertheless , it was raining so hard and so consistently , i could n't stand the thought of doing miles outdoors i ran my tempo run on the treadmill instead the good thing about the treadmill was i did n't have to worry about maintaining tempo pace mile i set the treadmill speed , after a mile warm up , and took off i did have to bargain with myself all the way through the run , though feeling tired , i told myself i could stop after miles , and then miles , and then i made the entire on pace whew ! i was pooped but of course i felt good physically and mentally after i finished that 's the beauty of exercise for me even if i do n't enjoy it in the moment , i know i 'll feel better when i'm done i felt so energized after my run that i began painting again now i'm sitting here waiting for the paint to dry so i can continue on my basement renovation journey it 's still raining it 's gloomy outside but it was another good day , and life moves on god gave you a gift of , seconds today have you used one to say thank you ? william a ward
