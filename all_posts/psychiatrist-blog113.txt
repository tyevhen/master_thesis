i wanted to share this wonderful essay with you it 's by mark vonnegut , and you may remember the review i wrote and how i loved his memoir , just like someone without mental illness , only more so this is an essay posted on kevinmd , a doctor shares his story about overcoming mental illness and do surf over to read the whole thing i promise you 'll be moved here 's a part of dr vonnegut 's writing in my career as a mental patient , i started with schizophrenia , worked my way up through manic depression , and have now settled at bipolar disorder i can joke about it because i recovered sufficiently to get into and through medical school , internship , and residency , and have had the enormous honor and privilege of being trusted by parents to help them and their children i make no bones about it i make mistakes just like everyone else , but am very proud of how well i do my job i m also very aware of how easily i could have ended up otherwise a suicide statistic or just another broken young man who never got well enough to have a life the diagnosis doesn t matter much what they think you have can give doctors a clue about what to do or not do , but for the person who is suffering , and for those who love him or her , wanting the pain and trouble to stop is enough knowing that others have recovered is very helpful most patients , including myself , have diagnosed themselves as hopeless more than once he goes on the reverse is also true just because you don t hear voices , doesn t make you a model of mental health one of the problems with mental health diagnosis is how reassuring the process is to so called normal people the sub text to me having a thinking disorder is that your thinking is fine i freely admit that i have an affective disorder , and find the idea that my feelings are more than a little off base a huge relief but to jump from my affective disorder to the conclusion that your feelings make perfect sense is just illogical there are all kinds of statistics , but the bottom line is that no one among us is percent crazy , and no one is percent sane the chance that you or someone you love won t need help at some point with what we broadly call mental illness is and finally there ain t no difference between them and us we re all here to help each other through this , whatever it is there s almost always something positive you can do the problem is believing in that possibility , and letting others help you figure out what it is
