i have n't been feeling my best , this past week and i'm not quite sure what to do about it i think sometimes it 's a matter of accepting the darker , less pleasant feelings sadness , depression , frustration , fear accepting those emotions for being there , being real , being valid , and then sitting with them for a bit , instead of pushing them away , trying to pretend they have no right to be there , pretending they do n't exist yet at the same time , i feel like i'm using depression as a safety net thinking that because i'm feeling down , i do n't have to do the things that frighten or frustrate me letting that keep me in my safe little bubble so i do n't trust these feelings , because i do n't know how honest they are , and how honest i'm being with myself ! i do n't know if i should be accepting and working through these emotions , or simply giving myself a kick in the ass and telling myself to stop whining it 's a bit of a dilemma , really peace , idzie you might also like life happening against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of unschooling helped me to remain confident in myself linkwithin
