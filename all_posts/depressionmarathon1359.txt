still rough today still wiped out from my ill fated research yesterday hardly able to move eating too much sleeping too much not exercising at all day , and counting all of which makes me feel worse rather than better ! ! yet , i ca n't seem to do anything different i 've had this illness so long i no longer know what 's normal specifically , is my heavy heart hangover , sloth like immobility , and debilitating despair which i am sure will turn into at least days of desperation and hopelessness is this normal ? or is this depression ? part of me wants it to be depression it feels so big , so debilitating , so overwhelming it must be abnormal but another piece of me wants it to be normal , something everyone would experience given the same circumstances it would be nice to share some experiences with normal people once in awhile it gets frustrating talking with normies about how i'm doing when i'm talking about depression and they 're talking about feelings right now , the readers with depression are nodding , yes ! and the normies are looking confused and thinking , huh ? the bottom line is i am tired and sad my body is tired and sad my brain is tired and sad i am tired and sad i am sad i am sad i am sad could be depression could be life
