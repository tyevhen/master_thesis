my first day of work has come and gone , and i am scared to go back ! oh my god ! i was so overwhelmed yesterday i had to hold back tears more than once there was tons of new information being thrown at me from multiple directions , and i could n't keep track of it all i could n't seem to take it in the instructions instead , i felt like the information was bouncing off of me picture words flying through the air , pinging off my head , and falling to the floor at my feet that 's what seemed to be happening i wanted to bend over , scoop up the words , and run home there i could sort them out and study them in silence unfortunately , that was n't possible besides , by the time i made it home , all i could do was sleep throughout the day i reminded myself to relax i tried to stay calm , and i think i did i think i kept the turmoil successfully hidden inside but i was so uncomfortable and so worried there 's so much to learn i have to go back tomorrow , but i do n't want to i'm worried i wo n't be able to handle it i'm worried it wo n't be any easier i'm just worried and i know it will get easier and i know i can probably handle it and i know i 'll likely get comfortable eventually i just wish it did n't feel so damn overwhelming in the meantime
