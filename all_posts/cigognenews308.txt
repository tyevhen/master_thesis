i have written many times about critical period the time when key needs must be met , and at no other time in other words you cannot make up for that loss no matter how much you may want to this was brought home to me in a study about food deprivation , march , j of child psychology and psychiatry j galler and p costa see http www sciencenews org view generic id description early malnutrition bodes ill for adult personality what they found was that malnutrition in the first year of life , even when followed by an adequate diet , predisposes those to troubled personality even at the age of forty compared with those who had a normal diet they showed chronic stress , mistrust , anger and depression notice , the food deprivation was not limited later on to food problems it created a complete problem in personality development in short , key deprivation of need even during our life in the womb , has global consequences so if you ask someone why are they so nervous ? , they will unlikely answer , because of my food deprivation at six months of womb life this all occurred long before the person had a comprehending neo cortex and its effect may last for a lifetime this early food deprivation also resulted in lack of curiosity and risk taking , as well as diminished emotional warmth all that because the baby could not eat properly ? let s transfer this now to lack of love and touch right after birth it has to be then and at no time later on the critical period is measured in brief spurts , not long continuous time periods when the baby comes onto earth all alone , in a strange environment and is left alone even for several minutes there can be deprivation and it will last the point about the research on food is that it underlines the critical period one has to ask why a very good eating regime soon after does not change things ? it is because fulfillment has a timeframe , usually a short one so when daddy leaves home for a few months to go on tour and comes home and loves and hugs his child , it is helpful but not reversing of the damage already done that is why when a mother s love is missing early on , if she is seriously ill , for example , there is a need gap and what does this do ? it can remain hidden for years and suddenly in adolescence there are homosexual tendencies no knows where it came from but there was deprivation very early in life that could not have been seen this is a form of act out we always try to fulfill those deprivations , even years later , depending on the circumstances if food in the home was prized perhaps eating will take the form of an obsession but the need for love is still waiting its turn all of us who were deprived seek out one kind of fulfillment or another fulfillment is primordial and not to be denied no matter what the criticism or exhortations by others it is so subtle because the parent can be a good person seriously concerned about the welfare the child but never touched her that need will force fulfillment elsewhere it will force the act out and it will be called neurotic because it is symbolic of what was missing getting approval from someone can never fulfill the person as the mother s kindness and approval would have done it is symbolic , never really fulfilling and becomes obsessional just because it is symbolic and only skin deep and diabolically , if we bring back the mother and ask her to be kind and approving to the young lady now adult , it would change nothing it is still symbolic because the critical period is over the pain can be softened through current love but the gap remains we cannot be fully fulfilled now no matter how hard we try and no matter how others may want to make up for a bad childhood that is the sad truth the article goes on to say that early bad nutrition leads to delinquency and suspiciousness in the child how could that be ? it means very early deprivation as overall systemic effects , not confined to food to be loved we need fulfillment of all of our needs not just a few of them to be hugged and touched , to be listened to and approved , to be adored and praised , etc our needs are biologic and are human , if we want to be complete human beings take the overeater he is eating for now and then eating for then is symbolic and therefore never ending it becomes the stuff of obsessions and compulsions he is wary because literally , he never knows where his next meal is coming from above all , those who were deprived were most often in the anxious category lack of fulfillment stamped in fear and insecurity , feelings that endure for a lifetime
