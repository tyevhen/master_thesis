i did n't really like my old bio anymore i just did n't really feel that it reflected me , as who i am now , as well as it could have so i wrote a new bio i'm not sure how much i like this one yet , and i may end up changing it , but for now this is what now shows up on my profile , which can be found on the sidebar of this blog i hate the fact that blogger does n't have that nifty 'about me' tab at the top of the blog the way wordpress does i m a passionate unschooler , unapologetic green anarchist anti civilizationist , good and healthy ! food loving vegetarian , earth feeling animist , and proud hippie i love to talk about the coming insurrection , living on little or no money dumstering , garbage hunting , thrifting , consensual and community living radical unschooling , collective decision making , intentional communities , communes and similar co housing arrangements , skill sharing , gift economies , anarchy , meaningful relationships , honesty , questioning everything , truly following your own path , staying whole , life , love , and many other things that i m sure you can think of i love being around people who play music , people who burst out in spontaneous song , who hug each other , who listen , who know how to have both incredibly deep conversations , and incredibly funny and silly ones , any people really i love people and i love my family above all else i also treasure the connections i make with others , and strive to always follow the path that i want to in life , not the path that anyone else thinks i should be following ! peace , idzie you might also like new bio , updated about me page making transitions and following passions trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! new bio linkwithin
