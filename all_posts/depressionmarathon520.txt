i made my mom cry she does n't read my blog my choice , but i sent her my last post in an e mail she said it made her so happy , she cried apparently , my step dad cried too i was n't expecting that my mom said it was the best birthday present i could have given her i'm glad she liked it it was a bit of a risk for me to send it , but now i'm glad i did in other news , my running is going well again after struggling through my two weekday runs last week , i had a really good miler on saturday i had to leave early in the morning again in order to avoid the heat and humidity i had a couple slow miles as i wiped the sleep from my eyes and worked out the kinks in my muscles , but then i settled into a nice rhythm i ran a steady pace the rest of the way , and i felt good doing it it 's nice to finish a long run knowing i could have run another couple of miles if i had wanted work is also going well i'm settling in , but i still lack the confidence i 'd like to possess nonetheless , i think i'm doing an okay job i like my co workers a lot , and they facility is nice that certainly has helped me feel more comfortable so far , it 's a good fit lastly , i'm doing well with my thinking and mood a couple weeks ago , i wrote about my screwed up , intrusive thoughts well , shortly after writing about them , they disappeared i had one recurrence last week while walking puck , but otherwise my brain has been quiet that makes me happy likewise , i'm thrilled my mood continues to be stable i feel good , and i'm enjoying feeling good i sure could get used to this
