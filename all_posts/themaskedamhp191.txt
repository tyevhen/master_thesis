people often ask me if i run the masked amhp blog all on my own well , blogs don t maintain themselves as well as having to write the actual posts , there are all sorts of things that have to be undertaken behind the scenes in order to keep the blog running smoothly , and it wouldn t be possible without my dedicated staff , all of whom are too modest to want a name check on the blog so , as a special treat , here are just a few glimpses behind the scenes at the blog installing awards on the blog takes more work than you may imagine here s a snap of two of my staff erecting the recent award from mental nurse the recent inclement weather hasn t helped , and it has often taken valiant efforts to keep all the links open to the different posts blog staff looking for traces of irony in a forthcoming post the masked amhp and tonto , his faithful amhp student , debriefing a recent mental health act assessment section or section ? it 's sometimes too close to call well , that 's all for now a happy new year normal service will be resumed next post
