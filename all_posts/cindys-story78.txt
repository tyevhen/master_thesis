the following is a poem that i wrote sometime in my junior or senior year of high school during a time when i found myself sad and crying a lot i had to rework the last verse a bit tonight because it did n't flow quite right , but otherwise the rest is my original work from that time maybe there has been a time in your life when you could relate , or maybe it is now do you cry with me i'm crying my tears , they 're blocking my sight and i'm stumbling though i'm holding on with all my might i'm still slipping and my wings just wo n't take flight i keep falling , falling and i'm crying do you cry with me ? which is wrong and which is right ? my head 's spinning will things turn out to be all right ? i keep doubting how long can i keep up this fight ? i feel like quitting , quitting and i'm crying do you cry with me ? though it 's day it feels like night my heart 's hurting darkness shuts out all the light no use searching what once was peace has turned to fright i ca n't stop trembling , trembling and i'm crying do you cry with me ? when my tears flow as i hide you cry with me all emotions kept inside you still truly see me you 'll always stay right by my side you just love me when i'm crying and i'm crying and you cry with me thank you jesus cindy
