jama neurology published the following article in another person living with kennedy s disease recommended the article to me the paper does a good job of explaining the condition to the layperson molecularpathophysiology and disease modifying therapies for spinal and bulbar muscularatrophy masahisa katsuno , md , phd haruhiko banno , md , phd keisuke suzuki , md , phd hiroaki adachi , md , phd fumiaki tanaka , md , phd gen sobue , md , phd spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , or kennedy disease , is an adult onset lower motor neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy the disease is caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide cag repeat encoding a polyglutamine tract within the first exon of the androgen receptor ar gene during the decades since the discovery of the ar gene mutation in sbma , basic and clinical research have deepened our understanding of the disease phenotype and pathophysiology spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy exclusively affects men , whereas women homozygous for the ar mutation do not fully develop the disease the ligand dependent nuclear accumulation of pathogenic ar protein is central to the pathogenesis , although additional steps , eg , dna binding and interdomain interactions of ar , are required for toxicity downstream molecular events , eg , transcriptional dysregulation , axonal transport disruption , and mitochondrial dysfunction , are implicated in the neurodegeneration in sbma pathogenic ar induced myopathy also contributes to the degeneration of motor neurons several potential therapies , including hormonal manipulation , have emerged from animal studies , some of which have been tested in clinical trials follow the title 's link to the full article
