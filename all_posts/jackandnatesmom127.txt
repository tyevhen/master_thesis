ok , ok , i know that could sound bad , but it s not what you might think any type of progress in terms of insurance coverage is a sign of hope for me like yesterday , i went to pick up my birth control and i whipped out my debit card to pay the copay the pharmacy technician told me to have a good day after i signed the hipaa thing i said , i m sorry , but i haven t paid yet her response it s free http www politico com story obamacare birth control coverage policy html i m out of touch apparently and didn t know this had actually gone through while i disagree with quite a few aspects of obamacare , this is a good call i know that some feel like it s the government s way of trying to control population growth , but until they are forcing birth control down your throat or holding you down to make you take depo shots , that s simply not true unwanted pregnancy prevention is a good thing for both mom and potential baby as a nurse who has worked in the inner city , trust me when i say this it is not an opinion , it is fact so let s take a little journey through the history of contraception coverage when i was a teenager , my ob gyn wanted to put me on birth control pills due to some issues i was having she told me at the time that she had to label it as such diagnosis wise for insurance purposes , otherwise they would not cover it in other words , there was no coverage for birth control when used as birth control , only when used to regulate a cycle when i was in my twenties , i could go to the student health center and purchase it for a cheaper price , in my late twenties , when the copays were still very high for birth control , if there was coverage at all , i went to planned parenthood , because i would rather give my money to a cause that is helping young girls prevent pregnancy than to the insurance company i know that many individuals who are pro life would disagree with this decision , but once again , it is the practical , experienced nurse side of me that sees the necessity of this organization and for the past years or so , birth control has had the same copay as any other prescription , which frankly was fine with me so now it s free the parallel to autism is fairly obvious right now , almost no medical intervention is covered for the diagnosis of autism , right ? it s not acknowledged by the government as the public health issue that it has come to be it s not recognized for the medical problem that it is it s still considered a behavioral issue only and thus insurance coverage for medical intervention is not mandated , as it should be for interventions such as occupational therapy , speech therapy , physical therapy , feeding therapy , etc , most professionals are careful to use a diagnosis of developmental delay , speech delay , dysphagia , etc because if the diagnosis of autism is used , it will not be covered even if these services are covered under developmental delay , the number of allotted sessions is often inadequate , as the coverage is not tailored to the needs of a person with autism it is not being acknowledged that these are effective and medically necessary treatments for autism my hope , and prayer is that autism coverage will follow a similar trajectory more rapid preferably and that in the future , when a parent faces a diagnosis of autism they will have the comfort of knowing they can obtain help for their child unfortunately , the issue is complex , and i fear that it will be a long road anyway , this instance does give me hope that the changes that are needed are possible
