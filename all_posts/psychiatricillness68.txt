i overcame the problem myself as i grew up , but to the day i left university aged i was still unable to speak up in a class setting i was offered counselling when i was but it was a bit late by then and when i moved into the sixth form the head of sixth insisted i could not have any unless i asked for it myself the problem was i could n't ask so i never received any help after a complete psychotic breakdown , aged about i was finally diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar disorder the whole world changed when i realised i was sick and not naughty , that was also very scary ! i came so close to attempting suicide but i did n't ! i'm looking forward to seeing how the next generation are getting help i think the bbc earn their money with things like this , i hope they do not dissapoint i have a 'date' with someone years older than me tonight , a 'suger daddy' still men my own age always give up on me it 's a first date , i 'll try and tell him i suffer from depression if i get the opportunity if he reacts ok to that i may agree to a second date the rest can come out if and when it ever needs to
