yesterday s kda chat room topic was a town hall meeting on dutasteride we had a good discussion on the subject and it helped me to make a decision several individuals on the chat , as well as three others not on the chat that i had talked with earlier , had taken dutasteride during the trial and some continue to take it today i found it interesting that one man stopped taking it after the trial and for the next six months experienced several falls he went back on dutasteride and feels better again another went off the drug after the trial because he did not see an significant benefit still another that takes it feels like he has more energy a younger man not on the chat commented to me that he stopped taking it and started having more muscle twitches fasciculations since stopping and plans to go back on it another retired man says it has helped his strength and continues to take it no one mentioned any negative side effects dr fischbeck mentioned in an earlier email on the subject the dutasteride trial did not show a significant effect on the progression of muscle weakness and , in an earlier nih report the following was mentioned those patients on a placebo lost , on average , of their strength per year two year study patients on dutasteride showed a slight increase in strength , but statistically the difference was not significant dr fischbeck surmised that the trial needed to be longer at least three years to better determine any benefits a few patients on dutasteride did show significant improvement , while others did not dr fischbeck felt that this could mean that the drug reacts differently in certain patients the key words above to me are did not show a significant effect that does not mean none in fact there was some minor benefits shown in many cases reacts differently in certain patients this appears to be another chance it might help me placebo group lost an average of of their strength per year that is what i am living with today dutasteride patients showed a slight increase in strength a slight improvement is better than a decline wouldn t that be nice for once even though i had been leaning towards this decision , yesterday s chat really helped me decide i will be calling my doctor this week and asking him to prescribe dutasteride for me mg i figure i have very little to lose and a lot to gain wish me luck !
