on valentine 's day feb , i posted something here that arguably went viral , although in truth , , , views can hardly be considered viral real virality would be , say , k page views let 's put it this way there was an element of virality involved why do i say that ? because blog traffic was up by an order of magnitude that counts as unusual i like to go over what happened after an unusual traffic day so i can understand it better to do this requires digging through the analytics data but the analytics are mysterious in their own way see below note that the following numbers were collected on the morning of feb , about hours after publication of the blog in question some of the numbers come from twitter analytics the rest come from blogspot analytics , not google analytics traffic hourly visits are plotted in this graph the interesting thing here is that the long tail is quite fat the initial spike was not very spikey i 've had viral posts before , and in almost every case , the initial spike is extremely spikey , with traffic falling back down to nothing in just a few hours in this case , the long hang time speaks to the possibility that the story was largely shared via e mail and or flipboard the twitter response see curve further below died out comparatively quickly the story lived on via e mail , text , flipboard , etc , for quite some time traffic by source here , blogspot tells us , unhelpfully , where about of total traffic came from i do n't know why , but blogspot numbers in the referring urls view never add up to anywhere near total traffic as reported in other views here , the numbers add up to , visits from the top referring urls , yet there were over , visits total maybe links shared by e mail do n't show up in the above chart ? is that what 's going on ? you tell me i'm asking the takeaway from this chart , in any case , is that this was a twitter event , pretty much sure , there were other traffic sources , but the top source twitter dominates the rest the tweet this above was the valentine 's day tweet that started everything it got rts the engagement numbers are as follows click to enlarge the interesting thing here is not so much total impressions being k which is more than double what i usually see on a tweet , as of feb but the link clicks number , that 's way above normal and who knew you could get profile clicks from a single tweet ? total engagement clicks of all kinds came to , which is unusually high traffic by browser the numbers for traffic by browser show a surprising stat around half of views were in zite , which is essentially flipboard flipboard bought zite , a mobile news aggregator , in march unhelpfully , blogspot shows mobile as the browser for of traffic , the second biggest slice of the pie it 's clear most views were on mobile devices we know , for example , chrome was used by of people , yet android which is mostly chrome brought of traffic see os section , below , hence probably half of chrome views were on android zite is predominantly a mobile platform browser pageviews zite mobile chrome safari firefox internet explorer os fbsv mobile safari crios traffic by operating system the numbers for traffic by os show a surprising to me dominance of apple platforms , at of total traffic , with windows users coming in at only of the total , a little more than android at who knew i had so many apple users ? os pageviews iphone ipad macintosh windows android linux other unix bb ipod touch i'm open to other interpretations of the data , but it feels to me very much as though a huge amount of traffic came via mobile , which should n't be a surprise , i guess , given that this was a twitter driven event , plain and simple aftermath the sudden rush of traffic , total site visits in two days , about , more than normal had some side benefits links to author zone com and my book site hackyourdepression com got clicked , providing an extra hits a day for each of those sites , and i got an extra newsletter signups in less than hours , which is a signup rate of in not very efficient , but that agrees well with what i 've noticed before , which is that when you have a viral rush , newsletter signups do n't spike as much as you 'd think and hope they would the reason the efficiency is poor is that you 're seeing walk in business from total strangers who do n't know you and did n't arrive at your site out of any kind of organic interest or attraction you ca n't expect the signup rate to be high with that kind of audience it would be the same if you tricked , people to visit your web site by putting flyers under a million windshield wipers at walmart 's parking lot those people do n't know you they 're not going to magically become lifelong customers of yours after one visit the post why did it work ? why did the post google layoffs inevitable resonate with people ? your guess is as good as mine obviously , twitter users do use google a lot and tend to be interested in what the company 's up to , but why should so many people care about possible layoffs unless you work for google ? maybe the story got circulated amongst google employees ? maybe lots of people on twitter know google employees ? maybe it 's just morbid curiosity ? what 's funny is that it was one of those posts i almost did n't write i had already written two google related posts yes , blogging is dead and why google is the new yahoo in the prior few days , and i was loathe to revisit google again but i was so happy about dan mccrum mentioning me in a financial times story , i just had to share the news then , once i started writing , the writing took over for the post , and for the tweet , i chose a photo of the large hangar at moffett field that google decided to pay over a billion dollars to lease for ten years the hangar , to me , is iconic , a symbol of aviation 's past the hangar was originally built to house the uss macon see below the navy 's uss macon at moffett field in the s dirigibles flew trans atlantic air service from to the graf zeppelin , in fact , flew well over round trips in that time frame customers paid about each way and the us navy operated a number of dirigibles as observation aircraft until the hindenberg disaster , dirigibles were the jumbo jets of their era they were the high tech of their day until suddenly they were n't if i were larry page or sergey brin , it would freak me out to walk around in that big hangar , knowing that the technology it was built for dirigibles , once thought to be a permanent fixture of the aviation landscape disappeared virtually overnight i say the place is cursed please sign up for the newsletter if you have n't already and visit hackyourdepression com to see what my books are about thanks ! hey listen , please follow these great tweeps who retweeted me yesterday these folks really do retweet , so follow them
