we all make mistakes during our lives , some are tiny and others monumental but the key to recovering is to learn from the lessons these mistakes provide now we all know i have a flawless reputation no , sorry i just could n't finish that without laughing i 've made plenty of mistakes over the years disastrous marriage aside but i never thought that one simple indiscretion could inspire a blog post but here we are i hold my hands up 'it 's a fair cop' as they say this week i attended a speed awareness course not because my jogging career is taking off in a big way but because i was caught by a mobile speed camera doing mph in a mph zone my options were three points on my license and a fine or i could attend a four hour course and only pay i opted for the course lesson number one consequences i am self employed so i lost half a days earning i was not alone out of the twenty five people on the course , had either taken a days holiday or lost earnings we must have looked a sorry bunch , with glum faces and arms crossed in a 'i do n't want to be here' pose , however four hours later i was astonished at how much i learnt , how wrong i had been and how much fun i 'd had the course is run by ttc who are a national driver training organisation and our hosts for the day , paul and chris were a well trained double act , they were warm and friendly and did n't point a finger or slap any wrists we began with a simple quiz it was at this point i realised with absolute horror how much i 'd forgotten about my highway code lesson number two complacency as a holistic health practitioner i have to keep up to date with my cpd , why is driving any different ? i was amazed at just how much information i had forgotten since my driving test many years ago here are a few questions for you to try what is a 'repeater' sign ? for a car , what is the national speed limit on a single carriageway ? how would you know where a mph , or mph speed limit applies ? answers on a postcard please ! lesson number three speeding is a waste of time during the course we looked at some of our 'excuses' for speeding the most popular was being late q you are late for a meeting or getting the kids to school so you speed on a local road you may do mph instead of mph how much faster would you get to your meeting school ? a can you believe that all that stress and rushing around only gains you seconds ! if you did mph instead of mph on the motorway you would only gain seconds but more shockingly perhaps is that you would have used more fuel lesson number four changing bad habits and managing speed we were given another quiz at this point to fill in the blanks take a look and see if you can work out what the letters could stand for c o a s t any idea ? it 's concentration , observation , anticipation , space and time i was quite shocked to discover that in the space of minutes driving time we only concentrate on the act of driving for minutes where on earth is our brain for the other minutes ? we were taught a really great trick to help with our observation as you drive around town say aloud what you see around you , for example car , road sign , cyclist , junction , dog , school etc my kids thought i 'd gone mad when i started doing this but in the end they joined in and it was quite a fun game , the surprising thing for me was as i was concentrating and observing my environment and anticipating what was ahead , i lifted my foot off the gas and slowed down without even thinking about it try it for yourself , it works lesson number five recognising speed limits this topic was an eye opener for many of us and i was amazed at how much i got wrong about speed limits on varying roads we discussed motorways , rural and urban and looked at single and dual carriageways in fact i began to wonder how i ever managed to pass my test in the first place we were given yet another top tip on how to remember and i'm going to share this with you nb the course applies to uk roads is the road you are on a motorway ? yes then it 's mph if not then follow these rules does it have street lights ? yes then its no national speed limit applies if it 's a , , , there will be a sign to tell you take a moment to reflect on your own driving consider where , when and why you normally speed and how you could change it in the future on my way home from the course i took my time , shouted out everything i could see and stopped at least a car length from the car in front at the traffic lights i do believe i even shook my head and gave a little tut tut when someone sped past me as i happily trundled along at mph stress free , enjoying the view and grinning from ear to ear i never remember my school detentions being so much fun ! ttc aim to work with individuals and road safety professionals to minimise road crashes and casualties there contact details are , email train ttc uk com why not keep up to date with your highway code online happy motoring !
