i panicked ! tuesday night , i swam in open water for the first time with about other newbies despite being a strong swimmer in the pool , i could n't keep up with others whose strokes looked no better than mine in fact , on our last drill , an actual swim in deep water around some buoys , i panicked and had to stop needless to say , i 've been bitterly disappointed and a bit distraught since then i was working on sighting that 's where you lift your head out of the water to see where you 're going it 's quite difficult it goes against everything i 've been taught about proper swim technique , and it 's very inefficient about one quarter of the way through , i lifted my head and took in a big gulp of water unfortunately , the water did n't go to my stomach , it went directly down my windpipe , and i could n't breathe i tread water and gasped , loudly , for air finally after multiple loud , squealing gasps , i caught my breath but it was too late , panic had set in i tried to swim again , but i could n't i had to flip over onto my back and slowly cut across the course to shore i was done the instructors all said nice things the other swimmers who initially came to rescue me that 's how desperate my gasping was said nice things i think they were worried i was embarrassed but i was n't really embarrassed i was disappointed and scared ! how was i going to do this long triathlon for which i had trained so hard ? in those few seconds of distress , my fear of deep water was reinforced ten fold ! now i ca n't get the scene out of my head i 've spoken to my therapist about it like you , she 's been following my progress toward this goal , and she 's a swimmer she 's helped me re frame the situation a little bit , but i'm still so , so disappointed and anxious i'm afraid i 've bitten off more than i can chew i'm having dreams about drowning it 's terrible i have a minute swim scheduled today , and i'm going back to the scene of the drama to try again for now , i think i 'll stay in water which is not over my head but the triathlon course goes out into the middle of this very deep lake twice ! i'm going to have to get over this , or i wo n't be able to cross triathlon off my bucket list any suggestions i'm all ears !
