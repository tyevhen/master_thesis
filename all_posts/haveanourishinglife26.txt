gossip i 've noticed that the number one cause of an eating disorder relapse is gossip whether or not i'm participating in it , and whether or not it 's weight looks related , i am still affected where two or three are gathered , gossip lurks look at what she is wearing ? wait , who is looking at me and saying the same thing ? she is so beautiful ! i wish i was worthy enough for that kind of compliment ! i do n't know how she finds the time to get everything done ! when was the last time i took a shower ? can you believe she said that ? i know for a fact there are things i should n't have said i guess my point and the reminder i am giving myself is that gossip is destructive to more than just the one gossiped about after participating in , or idly standing by , conversations about other people , i am more likely to scrutinize myself when i harshly analyze myself , i'm certain to find flaws i'm unhappy about when i get too down , i tend to try and make myself feel better with destructive behavior synchronizing how i feel on the inside with how i act on the outside considering my emotions , if i feel empty and worthless , it makes sense to me to not eat or not eat that much so that , physically , i feel empty and worthless as well if i feel happy and content and full of love , then i tend to feed myself appropriately obviously , this thinking is wrong i have to find a way to treat myself with respect no matter what i feel on the inside when it comes down to it , feelings are just feelings i am not reduced to the sum of what i feel my actions are what determine my fate with christmas parties approaching and ample time to spend in potentially awkward interactions , i am going to make a commitment not to use gossip in conversation
