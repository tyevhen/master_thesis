a study in the december issue of the archives of general psychiatry concluded that almost half of college aged americans suffered from a dsm iv disorder over a one year timeframe yes , i am behind the curve on this one furious seasons was all over this last month , rather than rant about the very odd idea that half of young adults are suffering from a mental disorder , i want to start by mentioning one aspect of the study perhaps the most important one let 's look at how the diagnoses were assigned to quote from the study all of the diagnoses were made according to dsm iv criteria using the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism alcohol use disorder and associated disabilities interview schedule dsm iv version , a valid and reliable fully structured diagnostic interview designed for use by professional interviewers who are not clinicians if the interviewers are not clinicians , on what basis are they trained to understand what makes for truly significant distress that might justify a mental health diagnosis versus someone who is suffering from more mild symptoms that do not comprise a mental disorder ? here 's some information from a different study that used a different slice of the same overall dataset on which the december study was based approximately lay interviewers from the us bureau of the census administered the nesarc using laptop computer assisted software that included built in skip , logic , and consistency checks on average , the interviewers had years experience working on census and other health related national surveys the interviewers completed days of training this was standardized through centralized training sessions under the direction of niaaa and census headquarters staff so the figures that will be trotted out in the media ad infinitum about the shoddy mental health of american youth are based on laptop assisted interviews conducted by people who apparently have no formal training in mental health maybe mental health and related disability are really so easy to assess that we do n't need experienced , formally trained interviewers if that 's the case , maybe we should just have census bureau interviewers provide initial mental health assessments in clinical care settings after all , if they are such good mental disorder detectors , could n't we just train a bunch of interviewers rather than spend millions of dollars training and paying mental health professionals ? think of the savings ! i mean no disrespect toward the census bureau interviewers they are performing important work that in many instances helps us to better understand the health of the nation all i'm saying is that we might want to avoid uncritically accepting judgments of our nation 's mental health based on interviewers who lack mental health training and experience
