another very gray , cold , rainy day around here running is tough in this kind of junk actually , i'm finding accomplishing anything to be a chore what i would n't do to see a ray of sunshine right now ! but alas , only gray and rain outside my door i had to run a mile speed workout today , part of which included by mile at per mile my energy has been particularly low gray , just like the weather in fact , i got dressed to go running this morning and then went back to bed , in my running clothes , for another two hours ! i finally forced myself out of bed and out the door soaked and cold , i dropped puck at home after my two mile warm up he 's too old for speed workouts now it was everything i could do just to go back out the door not only was the weather crummy , it was one of those days where my running reflected my mood rather than smooth and flowing , i felt like i was fighting myself with every step i was barely a half mile into my first repeat when i contemplated giving up i did n't give up my mind went to work instead i thought , i can do anything for one mile , and i pushed on sucking wind , and still battling to find my form , i gratefully finished mile one i thought about quitting then , but i figured i could probably struggle through one more i made a deal with myself to only run two repeats instead of four the second repeat was n't much prettier than the first my legs felt like they belonged to someone else , icy rain pelted my face , and my lungs refused to let any more air in it was ugly yet , halfway through the mile , my brain was wheeling and dealing again i walked through part of the recovery interval and decided one more fast mile could n't be much worse so i ran my third repeat directly toward home this brain of mine , it does n't give up too easily despite finishing my third mile within spitting distance of my house , i decided to walk run my recovery interval in the exact opposite direction and since i was then far away from home , why not run interval number four ? tricky brain ! interval number four commenced at that point something intriguing occurred i began to flow whereas running on miles felt like solo boxing , running for interval felt like ballet finally , after almost an hour of running my body gave in i do n't know why it happened or how it happened , but happen it did and i was extremely grateful interval number four saved my run i was thinking a lot while i was out there battling today taking one mile at a time , biting off small chunks of what otherwise would have been an overwhelming whole , parallels my life with depression it is how i survive on bad days , gray days , i cannot think beyond today i cannot think about any part of tomorrow i must only think about my next moments i must only focus on one project , chore , or errand at a time if i do n't , i become overwhelmed and nonfunctional really quick taking one moment at a time allows me to live with a modicum of grace even when days , or moods , are gray i wonder did i learn that from running ? or is it the other way around ?
