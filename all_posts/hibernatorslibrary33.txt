a few months ago , i challenged people to read some or all of the books to understand trump 's win from the new york times article we will read the first book of this series , the unwinding by george packer , in january and february it 's not necessary , but it would be fun if you 'd comment below to let me know if you 're reading the book so i can be sure to follow your blog ! the unwinding is separated into parts , and i will have discussion questions for each part you do not have to read at the same pace as me but if you 're interested , you can make a blog post of your thoughts , or just write your thoughts in my comments section for each discussion post part discussion post january rd part discussion post february th part discussion post february th would people be interested in starting a google doc discussion as well ? if so , i can set that up
