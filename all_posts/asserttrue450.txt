in a previous post i predicted that u s life expectancies will peak soon and begin to go down by this process has already begun , for u s women a report this month in health affairs offered this chilling announcement we examined trends in male and female mortality rates from to in , us counties we found that female mortality rates increased in percent of counties , while male mortality rates increased in only percent this is not the first study of its kind to report such a result the new york times devoted a story to the decline in female life expectancies last september wherein it quoted from an august health affairs piece , and in june a far more extensive report appeared in population health metrics , with similar findings even before that , a plos report by researchers from harvard , u c san francisco , and the university of washington found life expectancy for u s women began to level off or even decline in the s for percent of men and percent of women bottom line , this is a process that started many years ago , and it has been verified repeatedly by different teams of researchers counties in which female life expectancy is heading down are shown in red some of the decline in life expectancy has been linked to educational level in , the difference in life expectancy between the most educated white females and the least educated was about years now it 's years no one has explained why lack of education should be deadlier today than in it 's true that less educated women smoke more tobacco than better educated women , but that was true in as well and anyway , in order to explain a life expectancy delta of years , one hundred percent of less educated women would have to smoke , and one hundred percent of educated women would have to be lifetime non smokers which is pretty far from the case some experts have tried to pin the blame on rising obesity , but this is likely a red herring as well for example , obesity rates for women barely changed from to it 's interesting to note , too , that obesity is more prevalent among hispanic women than non hispanic white women by a solid margin and yet life expectancy for hispanic u s females is years cdc data , far higher than the national average for u s women of years what 's changed for women in the last years ? in a macro sense , the biggest change is that they 've entered the workforce in huge numbers female participation in the labor force went from under in to just over in where it 's stayed ever since it stands to reason that if you acquire the lifestyle habits of men such as working outside the home every day , you 'll perhaps be exposed to the same stressors that men are exposed to and acquire some of the same mortality risks especially if you 're working harder , for less money also , a variety of sources say that women suffer depression at twice the rate of men why is this important ? because mental illness is associated with higher mortality finally , many people consider access to health care a women 's issue for example , women earn less than men yet pay more for health care if women have poorer access to health care than men , this could partly explain the deterioration in female life expectancy there are no doubt other factors to consider the greater question is whether the number of counties in which female life expectancy is on the decline will continue to grow until it includes nearly every county in the u s , or whether the current trend represents a demographic split of some kind between the well educated and the low educated , or between high earners and low earners it also remains to be seen whether male life expectancies will also soon start to go down across the country i suspect we 'll see some interesting demographic trends soon , showing white americans to be doing particularly poorly compared to non whites blacks and hispanics are still making strong life expectancy gains time will tell
