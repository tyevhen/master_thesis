shada doctor who , the lost adventure by douglas adams and gareth roberts narrated by lalla ward and john leeson shada is a novel tie in to the popular tv series doctor who specifically , it is based on the screenplay written by douglas adams of an unbroadcast eighth doctor story arc the doctor , romana , and k go to visit an old friend , professor chronotis , after receiving a distress signal it turns out that chronotis had stolen a dangerous book the worshipful and ancient law of gallifrey all the time lords have heard of this book , but none of them quite seem to remember what it 's for when the book is accidentally borrowed by a post doc , the doctor and romana must find the book and keep it out of the hands of skagra , an evil genius bent on becoming the universe important distinction here he 's not taking over the universe he 's becoming it this is the first time i 've ever read a novel tie in to a show or movie my opinion has always been that books can become movies but movies should n't become books you have to add in so much information for a tv novelization to be a good book when i read a book , i'm not just looking for a story , i'm looking for beauty for art for characterization these are things that this book did not particularly have you knew who the characters were , after all why develop them ? you knew about the world in which this story was taking place no need for world building so , in that way , the book is n't what i'm generally looking for in a book that said , this book did have humor , excitement , and familiar friends going through wild adventures it was doctor who , after all , how could i not like it ? the book was well read narrated by the actress who played romana in the tv show k 's voice was john leeson , as well so that was a very nice touch this is my first time listening to a dramatization with sound effects i 've heard multiple reader dramatizations , but never with footsteps , creaking doors , etc it was kind of fun maybe i 'll try something like this out again i'm going to have to give this book snowflakes because i prefer books that have more characterization and world building but i also recognize that this is not what tv novelizations are meant to have
