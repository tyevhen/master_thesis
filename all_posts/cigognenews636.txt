here is what i need help on we know about the reptilian brain , the mammalian brain , etc that means that the remnants of those animals still reside in our heads isn t that strange ? and in sleep and in primals we go back and meet those animals but why ? why in deep sleep and in first line primals do we have to visit our reptilian brain ? and also , when we discuss whether man is basically this or that , good or bad , we need to find out which brain we are discussing but the reptile still runs our energy , lightening fast responses , terror and impulsiveness if we want to understand us humans we also have to understand that reptile and then the reptile has to talk to the chimp brain which then has to communicate with that human brain , the neocortex so complicated
