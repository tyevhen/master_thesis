heredity turned on its head let s make sure we understand this notion of epigenetics because in the coming years it will likely be one of most important areas of scientific research as i ve mentioned , one reason for its preeminence is that many of the serious diseases we think are genetic are actually epigenetic and , therefore , environmentally caused , and possibly treatable that is now an established fact in human development however , early discoveries in the field a short decade ago were so startling that they even surprised the scientific world the power of epigenetics was demonstrated early on in an experiment at duke university that study showed that when female mice were fed a diet rich in methyl it completely altered the fur pigment of the offspring in other words , it acted like a genetic inheritance when it was not it was the result of experience , something totally unexpected in the field of genetics until then as a result of this study , two leading scientists from canada , michael meaney and moshe szyf , thought if that is true why shouldn t it be true of other experiences such as bad mothering or negligent parenting ? well , it was , and epigenetic research exploded think of that traumatic events in very early childhood leave a mark or tag on a gene that affects us just about forever that is what i refer to as the imprint , the psychological stamp engraved by harmful events during gestation and early infancy , and burned into the system for life we now understand that the imprint is aided and abetted by the process of methylation , in which the chemical methyl group is added to the genome to restrict its expression in other words , the imprint is laid down , in part , by a change in the cell , as certain chemical reactions are taking place hydrogen removal , methyl infusion , and so on methylation leaves a heritable imprint , one that can be passed down even from grandparents to their grandchildren , as research has shown so what we always thought was genetic may well be the result of very early experience diverting the genetic legacy in short , the experiences of our forbearers can endure and be passed down the epigenetic chain the inheritance of acquired characteristics this is something science thought impossible not long ago in another key experiment , the mcgill genetics researchers compared two groups of rats one group consisted of the offspring of normal mothers who frequently licked their babies but had subjected the offspring to stress during pregnancy , with a second group of pups who were also under stress but experienced no licking meaney , aitken , bodnoff , iny , sapolsky , not surprisingly , those babies who were heavily licked turned out to be the most normal and well adjusted what is a surprise , however , is how much womb life counts what the scientists found is that the right amount of licking and grooming early on , left offspring less responsive to stress hormones as adults it is what we all know that early love makes us stronger and less anxious but it turns out that if the mothers were licked and groomed early on in their lives , that experience could be passed on too the stress hormone genes of their offspring could be modified by the methyl group and also other chemicals in a beneficial way good history in the mother , good childhood for the children the more loving by the mother , the less methylation in the child as we will see shortly , loving in the womb means receiving proper nutrients , being calm and not furiously running here and there , avoiding dangerous or unhealthy situations i know of someone who did extreme heat massage therapy while pregnant , never realizing the possible harm to the baby almost every animal form that is loved and licked has grown up pretty healthy with no serious disease and in my therapeutic experience , those children who had bad and traumatic births with unhealthy gestations are the ones who suffer the most as adults too often , catastrophic early life equals catastrophic disease later in life to make sure that these changes in the rat pups resulted from experience and not heredity , the researchers let normally stable rat pups raised by attentive mothers be raised by neurotic negligent mothers and the result was still the same unstressed babies these babies had birth mothers who had normal amounts of methylation in their genomes thus rats raised by loving mothers could pass it onto offspring even when the adopted mother was not loving the genes for stress hormone output had minimal methylation in other words love was passed down the genetic chain so normal babies raised by negligent and inattentive mothers still had low methyl levels in their hippocampus the babies started life one leg up a good start in life despite a bad childhood for animal mothers , licking is tantamount to hugging and caressing in humans and , just as we see in the rats , a woman who is unhappy or depressed while carrying can influence that child for a lifetime , even if she later normalizes and feels better i believe that changes in the genes , methylation and acetylation , must occur very early as the whole neuronal system is evolving so before we can state what causes depression or anxiety , we need to observe the early epigenetics at work again , pups born to bad mothers but reared by loving mothers still seemed to be normal and relatively un methylated here is one more reason this research is important the scientists found that unloving mothers of rodents caused methylation of the estrogen receptors in female offspring then , when they had offspring of their own , the offspring were deficient in estrogen , which made them less attentive and loving to their own babies we as yet do not know how many key chemical processes can be affected by lack of early love , and more , we have no idea how many hormones are changed in neurotic heavily methylated mothers , and how that affects myriad adult behaviors nowadays , there seem to be constant breakthroughs in epigenetics research as i stated at the start , researchers have established that epigenetics is at work not just in animals but among humans as well in the aforementioned study of holocaust survivors , published in august in biological psychiatry , an international team of researchers led by rachel yehuda , professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the mount sinai hospital in new york , examined the genes of jewish subjects who had suffered some level of trauma during world war ii they were either held in concentration camps , tortured or forced into hiding researchers also examined the genes of adult children of these traumatized survivors the results were then compared with a control group of jewish families eight parents and nine offspring who were living outside of europe during the war investigators focused on a specific gene , fkbp , which is known to regulate the stress hormone system and determines how well a person handles stress , according to elisabeth binder , director at the max planck institute of psychiatry in munich , who directed the molecular analyses the study found that the war trauma had altered the methylation levels of a specific site within that gene bin site in both the holocaust survivors and their offspring the methylation levels at that site were higher in holocaust survivors compared to the control subjects in the survivors adult offspring , paradoxically , the methylation levels at that same site were lower , compared to controls still , researchers determined that methylation levels for exposed parents and their offspring were significantly correlated the research has quickly led to a practical , real world application in august , around the same time the study was released , london s guardian newspaper reported that jewish activists in scotland had launched an effort to help the grandchildren of holocaust survivors suffering from depression , anxiety , addiction and eating disorders the article makes note of epigenetics studies that document the intergenerational effects of the holocaust by showing that the atrocities altered the dna of victims descendants armed with that knowledge , activists called for a mental health provision to treat inherited trauma although critics say the number of subjects in this study is too small reflecting the small number of holocaust survivors still alive the connection is clear the gene changes in the children did not appear to be mediated by adversity experienced during their own childhood but could only be attributed to holocaust exposure in the parents , said yehuda , in a statement from the max planck institute environmental influences such as stress , smoking or diet can affect the genes of our children in other words , even before a baby is conceived , his genetic destiny is being determined , at least in part , by the life experiences of his parents , not just their existing genetic code that is epigenetics in action hoag , h , summer are your genes your destiny ? not if your mom has anything to say about it retrieved from http publications mcgill ca
