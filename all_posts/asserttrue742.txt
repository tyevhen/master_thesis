in prior lives , as a hiring manager , i 've interviewed scores of job applicants and in the course of interviews , i 've seen how shall i say ? certain recurrent antipatterns of behavior that are usually a pretty good tipoff that the person in question is n't right for the job here are seven things i do n't want to see during an interview committing only one or two of these transgressions might not cost you the job , but if a pattern starts to emerge , believe me , i 'll notice it and you wo n't be asked back be late this indicates lack of commitment to deadlines arriving to minutes ahead of time is at least a small clue that you know how to underpromise and overdeliver if you got stuck in traffic , that 's fine , it does n't penalize you especially if you call ahead to let someone know you 'll be late otherwise ? do n't waste your hiring manager 's time do n't be late be unprepared did you leave samples of prior work at home ? yes , i can look them up online , but it 's a nice courtesy to be offered hard copies of previous work , whether printed or on cd , dvd , flash drive , etc did you forget to bring an extra copy of your resume ? again , these sorts of small details are n't going to be a showstopper in and of themselves , but taken together with other items in this list , it can reveal a pattern of inattention to little things sustained inattention to little things kills a business do n't act like you do n't know that avoid eye direct eye contact if you ca n't look me in the eye when answering questions , i'm going to get the impression , subconsciously at least , that you 're hiding something , or that you 're ashamed of something , anxious to leave , easily distracted by your surroundings , etc or that you just do n't like me stay focused i'm your center of attention look me in the eye say bad things about a previous employer , or be unable to explain why you left a previous job if i'm interviewing you , rest assured , i am going to ask you about your previous work experience that means i 'll definitely ask why you left your previous jobs yes , all of them be careful how you answer if you left a job because a previous employer treated people poorly , provide concrete details explain the exact circumstances but be careful if you say something negative about a previous job , a previous manager , or a company , i 'll assume that you may someday say something negative about me or my company i 'll question your loyalty before you even begin working that 's not good fail to ask good questions about the job if you 're seriously interested in the job , you 'll have questions by all means , ask ! i want to know what 's important to you work conditions ? people ? hours ? pay ? the quality and nature of the assignments ? , and i 'll get some indication of that in the kind of questions you choose to ask plus , asking questions shows that you 're inquisitive , thoughtful , and not merely interested in superficial matters or just being employed again ask a lot of questions about flextime , days off , bonus plan , stock options , and job perks and show concerns around how much overtime you might need to work i need somebody who 's a hard worker and committed to helping a team meet difficult deadlines do n't make me think you 're focused on not working hard it 's okay to ask questions about perks and benefits it 's expected , actually , but save them until the end and for gosh sakes , do n't make it look like perks , benefits , and compensation are near the top of your list of priorities i 'll wonder about your work ethic come to the interview not having gone to the company 's web site and not knowing a thing about the company before coming to an interview , do a little homework visit the company web site be prepared to critique it later , if asked , learn the company 's history , and try to understand the company 's positioning in the market and current strategies i want to know that you 're self motivated , able to do a little research on your own , and keenly interested in this particular job , at this particular company if you come to the interview not knowing what the company does , it shows me you do n't care about the big picture maybe you do n't care about anything maybe you 're just plain lazy next there are plenty more ways to show an interviewer that you are n't the right person for the job , but these are a few of my favorites and yes , i 've interviewed candidates who flunked on all counts it 's amazing how many job candidates come to an interview well dressed but unprepared , unaware of what the company does , unable to ask questions that are n't related to perks and benefits , and unable to say good things about prior employers i want to know that you 're a hard worker and a highly focused , self motivated individual who is detail oriented , yet also tries to understand the big picture is that so much to ask ?
