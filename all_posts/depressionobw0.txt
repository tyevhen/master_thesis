the art of suicide notes origami by samantha lou walker this story starts with me but you can still see the scars on my skin tell the story for me it was n't long ago that i lost myself like a curious child in a busy store but i was deaf to anyone paging for me i was a lost wallet with no id even if i was found i had nowhere to be returned to i'm not sure i even wanted to be found i was a broken thing i feared if anyone saw the condition i was really in that i would be left out with the trash on the curb i felt like a price of candy found on the floor the parent scolding drop that , it s dirty i felt lost and unwanted when you feel so discarded it s easy to lose hope easier still to quit looking for it like a ring swallowed by the sands of a beach why bother even trying you know you 'll never find it why not just quit life like you quit your crappy college job why not just give up sign your resignation in blood i was hurting lost only think of myself i was n't thinking as i carved up my arm i was really carving out the hearts of those who love me as i recklessly planned my end i did n't think about the consequences it would have for the people in my life i never imagined my baby brother would find me i never meant to lay this burden on his young shoulders i selfishly wrote a suicide note that he found i did n't think it was possible to hurt any worse than i did i had no idea that th under rock bottom was the look in a year olds eyes as he realized why i held a knife to my arm i did n't know that depth of pain even existed it was a moment of clarity do sharp it pierced my very soul in a way no sunday sermon or self help book could in the months and years nothing else could reach me the calm , clear words of a child it is okay , sammy , no matter what is going on in your life that made you feel like you had to do this , gods got it it 's been a year since that fateful night i went back a read the note baffled at how i ever felt so worthless and i took that suicide note folded it in to an origami crane something i would n't be here to do , without my little guardian angel by the grace of god i was able to take that note from the darkest time in my life and turn it in to a symbol of hope healing
