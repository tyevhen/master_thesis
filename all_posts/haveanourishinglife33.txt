i wonder if every new mom to be experiences moments of panic before her baby is born can i do this ? what was i thinking ? i don t want to be a mature adult ! what if i can t handle being a mom ? even thinking about the word mom freaks me out my mom is a mom my sister is mom i am not a mom i ve got about a week countdown to my due date however , i feel like i could use another several months to mentally prepare recently , i ve been having a lot of anxiety and a lot of down days i ve been frustrated with myself for not coping with it well considering my life is about to change forever , i should cut myself some slack i am good at dealing with the everyday anxiety and depression that has been a part of my life for the past several years i have good routines , good coping skills , and good , healthy habits for the most part but , now , i m not able to overcome my fear of the future i have absolutely no idea how i am going to handle life with a newborn baby i realize that i m not always going to be able to deal with my anxiety and depression in the same ways i have been i can t just go for a walk whenever i want to i can t just take a shower whenever i feel like it i can t just sleep whenever i need to the fear of not being able to cope with all the changes scares me so much i ve always been afraid of things that i don t have control over the future holds a lot of changes , probably the most i ve ever had to experience , and that terrifies me there are so many what ifs running through my head during the day and night i m afraid of forgetting to do something or get something important before the baby comes it s like i m afraid i m suddenly going to forget how to think like a rational adult i am also afraid of things not being perfect i want to be perfectly prepared , i want to have the perfect labor and delivery , i want to be the perfect post partum mom , i want to have the perfect nursing experience , i want to perfectly lose all the baby weight , and i want to perfectly take care of this new child not to mention , i want to be able to handle every situation perfectly and take care of myself perfectly i know in my head that this perfectionism is recipe for disaster , but i can t help but think this way it 's more difficult to overcome because i'm not just thinking about myself anymore there is another human being involved i m afraid i m going to have to start back at square one after i have the baby learning how to deal with stress , anxiety , fear , perfectionism , and depression all over again just the thought of putting all that work into recovering again is exhausting i don t want to fall apart , but i m falling apart because i m afraid i m going to fall apart
