i'm going to look like this soon if my hair loss keeps up i read that during pregnancy your scalp retains the hair so you do n't shed very much each day like normal then , once the baby comes , you supposedly lose the hair you would have shed during the nine months but it all happens generally at the same time so , weeks ago when paige was weeks my great hair shedding started holy geez , my hair comes out in clumps as i brush ! then , my hands pull out even more and it 's every day ! ! ! i'm just glad i 'd read about this , otherwise i 'd be having a coniption it seems like it might be finally slowing down now , but i'm not sure once glance at my bathroom floor would say otherwise sometimes i even find one or two in paige 's little fist like a little prize my hair is showing up everywhere ! i wonder if i can pull off a bald look ? save you might also like hair before and now happy paige linkwithin
