yes , give up hope all ye who enter here i persist in my depression that began three weeks ago , give or take a few mixed states i have settled into my negative personality i imagine explanations for every blow of kathleen 's criticism , though it rarely comes i am nevertheless prepared for that iron rain everyone ignores me , i am invisible i sit on the deck and read keats by the redwoods and wish to become insensate in their towering excellence , their ramrod straight striving for the sun without apology love keats' ode to melancholy , one of the best poems i know that tries to make sense out of manic depression ode to a nightingale and ode to a grecian urn skirt the same subject but not so personally kathleen is happy she tells me i am negative and boring i wholeheartedly agree while in this state i am grateful for her company but have no right to expect anything more than a grudging tolerance for my existence she tells me she loves me but i know better that 's the transparent habit of compassion she 's developed for a nobody of no consequence i am too tired to catch her in the lie after all , what difference does it make if i cannot imagine being loved , much less feel love ? it 's amazing how very bad keats was until the last years of his life the transformation is quick and unforeseen beforehand i would never have imagined him becoming a first rate poet , rather relegated as a minor romantic hack only five of all his belabored sonnets are worth saving then come st agnes and the incredible odes go figure dead at lucky bastard i see my last twenty years going by in a poof of forgettable gray negatives of nothing some fools might mistake for a life so much for the happy ramblings of the depressed note none of the above should be construed as strictly true or even what the writer believes , rather a sour exhalation of melancholic vapors thine in despondency , anonymous
