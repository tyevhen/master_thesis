i'm unhappy to report my mood has taken a bit of a hit this week the primary reason for the downturn is my injury i injured my right achilles tendon toward the end of a mile run while on vacation about days ago i have not been able to run since in fact , walking has even been challenging at times i think things are very slowly improving , but the lack of major improvement worries me i'm worried i might have more than just some tendinitis i could possibly have a partial tear , and that would require a lot of healing time right now i do n't have that time if i want to keep my training on track i was not able to run my half marathon two days ago my miler , scheduled for this weekend , looks doubtful i was hoping to run the med city marathon on may th and of course , grandma 's marathon in mid june those dates are fast approaching , while my injury is too slowly healing i'm also frustrated by this injury because i was just getting back to the point where running was feeling easy and joyful again coming back from hip surgery required work , and that 's what running felt like for several months , hard work over the last few weeks , i felt the flow returning now i'm faced with possibly having to begin all over again that is , if this ever heals ! of course , i know the tendon will eventually heal it 's just not going to be on my timetable , which would have been yesterday ! patience may be a virtue , but it 's not necessarily one of my virtuous characteristics when it comes to running i'm so anxious to get back to training , it 's difficult to see others out running around the neighborhood kind of silly , but that 's where i'm at interrupted training is not my only concern my mood has definitely been knocked down by this injury when i ca n't run my mood is not well protected i'm susceptible to emergence of depression symptoms i know this and i'm doing my best to combat it but my mood has taken a hit i feel it slowly creeping downward i need to keep working hard to stay afloat and that 's what i 've been doing , working hard even though i 've yet to find a suitable substitute for running , i have been exercising vigorously daily i need to keep the endorphins flowing , or i know i 'll soon be dealing with more than just an achilles injury since i injured myself , i 've biked for at least an hour several times i swam a few days ago and today i ordered some inline skates i'm hoping i can achieve similar cardiovascular and emotional benefits by substituting skating for running hopefully i wo n't break my neck in the meantime i 'll let you know how the story continues
