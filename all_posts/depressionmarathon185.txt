i had emergency oral surgery yesterday you might think this is related to my last post , in which i described my oral surgery last week , but that would be too easy no , this oral surgery was for an entirely unrelated problem , on the other side of my mouth , that cropped up late last week i apparently fractured tooth , a molar on the left side of my mouth , when i bit down on something that fracture led to a massive infection by thursday night , i could n't even touch that tooth with my tongue the pain was that severe i had to live with that pain all weekend , as there was no way to get the tooth pulled until yesterday and i'm not done yet now i'm swollen , and miserable , and in pain as a result of the surgery i have unhealed holes where teeth are supposed to be on both sides of my mouth now the pain pills barely help i'm frazzled , and tired , and overwhelmed i'm doing my best to stay strong and hang in there , but it 's hard not to worry about what 's coming next
