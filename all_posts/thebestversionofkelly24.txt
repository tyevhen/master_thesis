welcome to week ten of my diary series , starting monday th may if you ve not read one of my diaries before , they are where i update you on my life , my blog and my journey to improve my health naturally and become the best version of kelly see previous diary posts here all things blog another quiet week blog wise i m disappointed in myself as my aim this week was to upload some mental health posts as it was mental health awareness week sadly , it just didn t work out for me when i started the blog , i was aiming to post three times a week and on the whole i was managing that as you will have noticed though i have slowed down over the past few weeks i don t want to beat myself up over that though as it defeats the object of the blog this is a positive journey ! from now on i will post when i feel like it it will be more fun for me that way and should be an improvement for you too as i m sure my posts will be better because of it life i had a quiet start to the week on wednesday i met a friend for lunch they helped me take some pictures to use on the blog in a packed pub , it was difficult not to feel a little self conscious yet i did extremely well in not letting it worry me too much this picture is for use in a serious post and i couldn t stop giggling ! people must wonder why some woman is having a picture taken of her reading the paper ? ! all will become clear in a future post on friday , another friend came around for a cuppa i had forgotten she was coming ! thank god , i was in in the past and even now on occasion this would have sent me into a mad panic yet again i handled it well and enjoyed the time with her i m doing so well this may start to be boring for you all soon ! i am making a real effort to keep up with my friends since writing my post about how hard i find it to make friends friday ended badly ! i take the kids to their swimming lessons on fridays this week we managed to forget freddie s bag , luckily , he had his swimsuit on under his clothes so i decided he and annie would have to share a hat , goggles and towel they swim one after the other so it s possible the panic about what to do about the forgotten bag threw us and there wasn t time to go to the shop for sweets like we often do so , i took annie down to the shop whilst freddie swam , it s only next door anyway the problem is that annie is going through a phase of struggling to make decisions and regretting those she does make does anyone else have a child around the age of who does this ? she regretted her sweet choice and when we got back to the pool refused to eat them and had a meltdown about the whole thing i managed to get her into her swimsuit and got the hat and goggles off freddie and onto her but she refused to get into the pool and wouldn t stop crying i needed to calm her down but also had freddie to help dry and change ! i was running between the girls and boys changing rooms annie refused to come into the boys once annie was dressed again she then wouldn t stop crying as she regretted not getting in the pool give me strength she then wanted her sweets too ! i didn t give them to her during these situations , i am always torn between how best to handle it i get so embarrassed if it s in public for a start mainly though i wonder if the behaviour warrants punishment or not ? i did punish her , she didn t get her sweets , was told off and knew she was wrong however , part of me also just wanted to give her hug as i am sure a lot of it is just her struggling to handle her emotions rather than being badly behaved and i don t want her to think it s wrong to show negative emotion any ideas advice on this would be gratefully received on sunday i did the pretty mudder version of the race for life i first mentioned my plan to do it in this post here it was a huge challenge for me as my cfs has meant my fitness has been at an all time low in addition to that i was hugely anxious about the whole thing i intend to do a post all about the experience so keep an eye out for that soon health because of the build up to the race , a difficult meeting i had to attend and annie s meltdown on friday it has been quite an up and down week emotionally and i have felt the effects of that on my health i suffered with more than one severe headache as well as an increase in my normal cfs symptoms i slept for eleven hours friday night and still had two hour long naps on saturday as well as more than nine more hours sleep that night my body just doesn t handle stress anymore not any type or any amount i am sure i must be suffering with adrenal fatigue after years of emotional stresses and strains another thing to try and cure on this journey food i treated myself this week i needed it ! i also have decided to start the candida diet again from monday not because i think i have candida but because it is a great detox and i feel i need it i will do another post all about this on saturday as a final treat we went out for afternoon tea to dobbie s they do a lovely tea for adults and a special for children which is so fun and such a treat ! exercise i had my gym based physio and did the race i ached after both i am pleased i managed them though and see it as a real positive thank you for reading kelly x
