nine days ago i noticed that my legs did not feel quite as strong my left knee was also in a lot of pain when performing the standing exercises i immediately associated the problem with the dutasteride i am taking what was going on ? was it not working ? the body was telling me something upon further analysis , however , i realized that i needed to follow my own advice and listen to my body every month since starting the dutasteride i had added reps and additional exercises to my daily routine and , whenever i added something , they were easy to perform last week while performing my light day leg exercises my knee was killing me i stopped immediately i know understand what happened i had increased my long routine by minutes longer and my short routine by i had finally max d out pushed too far and needed to cut back a little i also realized the arthritis in my left knee had not been a problem until i added too many reps i decided to experiment a little i cut back on my light routine to the original reps within a few days my knee was a lot better yes , the exercises seemed very easy , but that s okay the intent of the light exercise program is to keep the motor neurons firing not to build muscle results monday s long exercise was minutes and today s was minutes both were performed without a problem or any pain my short exercise program is back to the original one and it is easy and also performed without pain best of all , i feel better and stronger again is this another case of , do as i say , not as i do ? i guess i am not mighty mouse and kryptonite still flows through my genes but , i m listening again and am much better as a result perhaps i need hearing aids !
