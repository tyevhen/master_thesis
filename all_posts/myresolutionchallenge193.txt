i am still recovering from the shock of my recent weigh in at the first weight watchers meeting for ! luckily there was a paramedic at the class who brought me round very quickly ! ! my leader , andrea , is a huge inspiration and once the initial shock had subsided i began to feel very upbeat and eager to get cracking of course my first task was to empty the fridge of anything that could be a temptation i personally could n't see anything wrong with the contents of my fridge but andrea assured me it was time to change ! armed with my new weight watchers folder , shiny new cook book and a food journal i set about planning my meal 's for the week ahead the kids contributed and added in their favourite recipes , luckily for me they love their veggies ! we have chicken chasseur , tuna pasta bake , spaghetti bolognese , ham and mushroom carbonara the list goes on all reduced fat recipes with loads of flavour i'm quite excited now ! i am also happy to report that my fridge is now a much more respectable place to pop along to for a quick snack target for week to lose lb ! ! ! ! !
