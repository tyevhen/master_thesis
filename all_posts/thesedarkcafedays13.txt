the past several days , i 've been dealt some heavy blows that have left me reeling i 've taken trips back to some of the darker parts of my thoughts and emotions , which has left me feeling pretty unmotivated to do schoolwork or exist really my counselor had to stop coming to my school 's campus because of how busy her life has gotten , so i 've been therapist less for over a month before , i was doing pretty well and figured i should start learning to stand on my own two feet anyways , so i did n't bother to try and start with a new counselor i guess i also dreaded the whole getting to know you process , which can be tedious and at times even demeaning , especially with counselors who are n't as good at what they do teaching someone about your entire background can take several sessions in itself and they might still not understand where you 're coming from , so i figured i 'd be okay without anyways , since my last post , i found out that because of a series of mistakes on my school 's part , i ca n't graduate next month , and the guy i liked is even crappier of a person than i thought , so now i definitely ca n't like him two big things that have been driving me through all the stress and busyness of this semester have been the knowledge that i'm finally graduating , and the excitement of liking someone , talking about them , trying to talk to them , and anticipating the possibility of dating them i think i had honestly convinced myself that i would finally get the chance to have a romantic relationship by the time summer rolled around , and i was so excited by that prospect that it propelled me through all the assignments and late nights i like most of my schoolwork this semester , i love creative projects , but nothing motivates and excites me the way having a crush does i do n't know why that is , but it 's just the truth unfortunately , the reverse is that nothing breaks me the way that losing that person does usually i realize they just are n't interested in me , though sometimes , like in this case , i have to come to the cold , hard acceptance that they are n't the person for me , even though i really , really admire them i really love caring about people , admiring them , looking for the best in them , so turning myself against someone i 've grown to adore is heartbreaking i guess that 's why i and many others often turn to hating and talking smack about that person it seems like the only way to channel such strong feelings into something besides admiration sometimes i'm still as obsessed with the person as before , just this time i want to berate them or hear others tear them down or have lengthy discussions wondering why on earth they were n't interested in being in a relationship with me ultimately , these two blows robbed me of my two big dreams and sources of excitement and motivation now i feel stuck time inches along whereas before it felt like it was zooming by at the speed of light i still have major assignments due almost every day , however , and i really do n't want to let this growing darkness get the best of me , so i'm struggling to fight it but my brain feels like it 's off in neverland never going to find love , never going to be happy , never going to escape depression ruining things for me , never going to be desired i chase my tail in a prison of anxiety and angst today was especially bad it 's been rainy for days , which does n't help , and on thursday i had a particularly frustrating interaction with the guy i liked we actually had some good banter and he even told me he had heard about my not being able to graduate and was really sorry more than the majority of my girl friends have even done but later in class i heard him talking about drugs and realized we really lead completely different lifestyles i gave a big presentation that afternoon , which was publicized in the class we 're both in , and he missed it because he was off getting high somewhere flashback to all the other times i 've hoped guys would come to events and support me and they did n't show anyways , i went through a period of shock as i wrestled with my admiration for this guy 's good qualities with the growing amount of information i was receiving from a friend of mine as well as my own interaction about this guy 's seriously immature traits and his interest in other women i did n't want to let go , but i slowly realized i had to , for my own protection naturally , being the lovesick young thing that i am , i turned back to a former crush of mine someone i really , really liked and subsequently had to really hate to try and get over him i do n't know what made me go back to him except that he really has seemed like one of the most compatible people i 've liked and i had very strong feelings for him only problem is , to get over him , i cut off all communication with him , including unfriending him on social media , so i had no non awkward way of getting back in touch of course , i began to obsess about the situation and ask myself whether he really is compatible with me and rack my brain for a way to get back in touch with him subsequently , i 've been miserable from the anxiety of obsessing , but also from the shame of admitting to people who i 've ranted about how awfully he treated me that i'm actually interested in him again i was afraid of their judgment , but i hate bottling things like that up i decided , impulsively , to try and reach out to some of our mutual acquaintances from my old school and ask about him , but this led me down the dark hole of , well , interacting with those people and remembering what shitty friends they were are i got even more upset and frustrated and lonely , feeling like nobody really cared or understood me my friends would rarely ask about me and their answers were condescending or overly brief nobody asked me if i was graduating i started recalling how the same people did n't respond when i said i would n't be coming back to that school how they did n't check in to see if i was doing okay how tempting coldness like that made ending it all seem i want so badly to love people and invest in friendships because i love showing people kindness and thoughtfulness , but i get tired of how little people invest in relationships or appreciate other people 's lives i felt tempted to stop investing in relationships at all , but that 's a depressing prospect too ultimately , today has been really tough and i'm scared to think of what tomorrow is going to be like , but i realized that i need to be the one who embraces myself i felt so embarrassed today for being interested in this guy who i previously ranted about , but at the end of the day , i 'd rather be somebody who is honest about going back and forth than someone who denies they were ever on a different side than they are on now at one point , when i was driving to class , i decided to just accept that i flip flop a lot on things it is part of my personality and the way i process i do n't think it 's necessarily wrong , though i understand why it might frustrate people i would rather be open minded about things than be someone who makes a snap judgment and never reconsiders people and situations are constantly changing , so it 's oftentimes worth reevaluating your opinion i 've changed so much in life , and i firmly believe most of it has been for the better i also accept that i am who i am i want to be the person who is in my corner obviously , i'm not going to get the validation and acceptance i'm seeking from other people i either get torn up because those people disappoint me in their friendship , or i do experience validation via grades or applause or the occasional positive interaction and still feel unsatisfied i guess i need to accept myself because even if i do get what i really crave a relationship where the other person is really invested in and excited about me and vice versa i will need a firm grounding in who i am so i do n't get lost in that other person and so i can survive if the relationship does n't work out so i'm not perfect in any way i'm sure anyone could read this post and pick it apart to identify a host of character flaws and psychological issues but i'm trying really hard to be a better person , to love others , to improve my own methods of dealing with tough times and i choose to accept that i am still growing and that 's just the way life works we ca n't get it all right at once or maybe , like , ever
