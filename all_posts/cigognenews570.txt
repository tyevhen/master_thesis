we have found that circuits from feeling centers to the top level cortex are stronger and more numerous than the circuits leading down from the neocortex the implications are that language and thoughts do not change feelings so much , but that feelings do change ideas a lot thus the premise for so many insight therapies contradicts how the brain actually works and explains why those who have undergone insight therapy in all of its ramifications have been self deluded into thinking they are much better the whole point is that the brain figures out a way to be self deluded too much imprinted pain sets this in motion and so thoughts go off in the direction of the feelings if we feel like a loser then we give up trying to go to college or to study , in general or don t try to get the girl or guy of our dreams after all , who would be interested in me ? we have to think , why would the brain grow itself in a certain direction a direction that evolves to repress feelings ? how is that a survival mechanism ? think suppressing feelings helps survival it has to do with blocking menace , the danger from terribly painful feelings , and then we have to wonder where do those powerful feelings come from and what are they like ? they are mostly imprinted from our womb life and birth and are memories of what we had to do to survive those behaviors become fixed and drive our lives when a fetus , for example , is probed in amniocentesis he withdraws and he shows signs of withdrawal he grimaces as if in great pain , which he is and his pain chemicals , stress hormones , rise radically he is learning what to do in times of danger withdrawal , removing himself from the scene , is one approach because the experience is life threatening the system remembers it as a heuristic experience setting guidelines for future behavior in short , there is a flight to the head , to the intellect a flight away from feelings and toward something that will reduce the danger and what is that ? ideas and beliefs it is the last in evolution and is our most precious defense we can rationalize and theorize we can project blame and mentally escape from the danger of terror that lies below so much intellectuality so in a strange paradox we flee to our heads to escape feelings and that flight is what becomes dangerous we live in our heads or take drugs for further suppression , or we drink to help sequester our feelings , but no matter what the feelings never go away , grinding away inside , wearing down the system they are treated as alien forces by the system the enemy who must not be allowed to attack us from inside hence we take blocking medication to keep the attack from inside from happening the drugs slow down or block the message from rising to the level of conscious awareness so we can think we are fine because we have blocked out of awareness of the painful feelings language is the last evolutionary weapon we have against ourselves ! isn t that strange ? we develop something that can combat our own experience and shunt it aside and which allows us to pretend it never existed and instead of feeling bad because of it we have the tools to make ourselves feel good a self deluded state that we all can share that is what is universal , repression and denial wonderful now how is that we evolved a thinking brain that anesthetizes pain ? when we think about that too much we get into theology i prefer science we first impress pain into the system we register code and store it for the future and then we develop a system to block it from conscious awareness we smother it with thoughts and you thought they were a wonderful new addition to the human being they are , and they are also this pharmacy of painkillers which is also wonderful the system knew it could not go on under a terrible load of pain and find love and avoid danger so it pushed it aside in order to remain stable and functional those who could not set pain aside are the ones who are dysfunctional and what are those terrible pains ? lack of love , by my definition , of lack of fulfillment of basic need so it must follow that we need love more than anything we need it for life , for survival , for sanity we need it to maintain the basic physical and physiologic structure otherwise , we don t grow properly and our organs do not evolve correctly think of it we manufacture chemicals that block the experience of pain they do not block pain that is another matter , although scientists are now close to removing the biochemical elements that build into pain but most of us will settle for not knowing about it repression is the original denial it denies reality , a reality that lives on a different level of brain function on a different level of consciousness look a the cult leaders they hypnotize us with their promises of fulfillment , if not in this world then in another of their choosing and it is indeed hypnosis grabbing our need and twisting it so that we no longer are conscious we follow blindly we obey without question and we do so in psychotherapy they lull our critical capacities so that they are rendered useless , and then they move in to control and manipulate us one of the crimes of the century , not including the holocaust and other disasters , is the psychotherapy of denial for that is what nearly every therapy extant practices it makes patients more repressed , hence sicker it helps bury reality , through medications which are designed for that , and through insights and beliefs that shut out the truth of our existence i mean just a bit of neurology will tell us that the prefrontal area has a major role in blocking feelings how on earth can we enlist it for change ? we are putting the mask of anesthesia over the brains of our patients and we are calling it therapy let s stop the crime !
