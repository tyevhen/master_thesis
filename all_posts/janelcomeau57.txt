dear america , yes , you i want to buy your shit seriously that 's it i want to take the canadian dollars i have earned from my long , hard hours of hunting moose and applying avril lavigne 's eyeliner , and exchange them for beautiful , cheap american goods it 's consumerism at its finest , and oh boy , do i want to partake just look how happy this woman is in her cheap american nirvana there 's just one problem i ca n't you wo n't let me and i have no idea why is it our money ? because i 'll be the first to admit that our canadian currency is a little strange yes , we make our money in rainbow brite colours , and not the aggressively monochromatic green you insist on and yes , it 's weird and plastic and it has a purposeless see through window in it that you can peer through when you want the world to look shiny and distorted but you do n't have the money for drugs and yeah , okay , we got rid of our and bills and traded them in for ridiculous coins with birds and polar bears on them but really , deep down , our money is n't so different it 's a little , flat bendy thing with a number and a picture of a grumpy white man on it that derives its value from words and magic and if i'm giving you currency with some kind of value , does it really matter if it 's an american dollar or a medieval ducat ? i swear , this is real money besides , it 's the year canadians speak english , french , and the international language of mastercard if your store is set up to handle credit cards or paypal , it should n't matter if i live in los angeles or the nation of mauritania and , in fairness to you , it does n't you 're perfectly willing to take my sweet , sweet digital canadian money you just wo n't ship me my item the true north may be strong , but it sure as hell is n't free yeah let me say that again you will happily accept my filthy , maple syrup stained money , presumably out of the goodness of your heart you 'll do that , just for me what you will not do is put my item in a box , slap on some postage and stick it in the mail apparently , that 's just far more than you can possibly handle you 've also gone to the trouble of making sure that there 's absolutely no way for canadians to get around your shipping restrictions , since you wo n't ship to post boxes fucking why ? are you taking the moral high ground over paranoid , tin foil hatted lunatics who wo n't give out their home addresses ? is there a nike black market out there that only operates through the use of the noble p o box ? are you attempting to bolster canadian american relations by forcing canucks to befriend americans for the sole purpose of exploiting their sweet , sweet shippable addresses ? this is you and what makes this especially baffling is the fact that other , tinier retailers have figured out how to successfully do business with the great white north i can jump on etsy , right now , and have a toothless woman from rural nebraska send me a vial of human placenta why ca n't a multinational corporation send me a pair of shoes ? to make things worse , you all offer shipping to the various american territories , which means you 've apparently decided that it 's more trouble to send a truck to alberta than it is to strap a package to the back of a dolphin and send that sucker to the virgin islands your international shipping team , i presume but let me illustrate my frustrations with a real world example a little while ago , i tried to buy my younger brother a pair of pants for his birthday these pants , to be exact for the uninitiated and or fat people among you , those are a pair of white running tights apparently they make running better somehow i do n't understand it either in any case , my brother had wanted the nike version of these pants , and they absolutely had to be white he needed them to wear underneath his white football pants , and football teams are notoriously unreceptive to players making changes to the uniform well , most of the time there was just one problem after a long , hard day of throwing pennies at the rd world orphans who manufacture his sneakers , the ceo of nike had apparently decided that these particular pants would only be available to canadians in black well , no matter , i thought i 'll go on the internet and find what i need it 'll be easy easy all i needed was those pants , in that colour , in an extra large so i checked ebay nope checked canada 's adorable little version of amazon of course not checked the manufacturer website ha , no shipping to canada checked the websites of every major sports retailer i could find if they had it in stock , they sure as hell did n't ship to canada the closest i came to finding these pants was a dubious chinese website that promised to send them to me for per pair , so long as i put in a minimum order of , just slightly more than i need just before i had resigned myself to sewing my own pair out of women 's nylons and a shower curtain , i managed to find a pair of similar underarmour pants on an american sporting goods website that had all the tacky s charm of a year old girl 's myspace page , and immediately decided to trust them with my credit card number to my slight surprise , the pants actually showed up three weeks later so all 's well that ends well my brother can play football in the least practical colour imaginable , and an american retailer out there is ever so slightly richer because i'm serious , america you 've got some great shit so let me buy it
