here i want to set down my understanding of martin heidegger 's understanding of how angst is essential to philosophy take a traditional philosophical problem how do i know other minds the external world ? sceptically phrased how do i even know they exist ? heidegger 's idea is that this question will only seem intelligible to someone mired in forgetfulness and taking for granted ness his thought is we 've become inured to the contingency and vulnerability and dependency of our lives of our sanity of our bodily continuity of our capacity to think and when we are forgetful in these ways we tend to imagine that we are not dependent creatures and then we think that we can , all out of our ownmost noddles , raise what are actually insoluble but thankfully also misguided questions about the obtaining of an external world and other minds the tacit move is having forgotten how dependent what 's in our noddles is on a world this world of language , communication , embodiment , friends , teachers , tools , culture , history , society how dependent the intelligibility and purport of our discourse is discourse including our philosophical questions themselves we imagine that we can take for granted the intelligibility of unanchored , free floating philosophical questions about an 'external world' or 'other minds' we take our philosophical questions too seriously because we 've narcissistically overlooked our dependency if we had n't lost sight of our essential en world ed ness , it would n't have occurred to us to try to raise questions about 'how' or 'that' at such an essential juncture the questions would rightly look both dumb and pretentious put it this way if our contingency and dependency and embeddedness is grasped as a condition of possibility of our having intelligible thought , then the idea of asking such philosophical questions will come to seem like an absurd scandal yet it 's really not easy for us to hold on to the fact of our dependency we like to think of ourselves as self contained and invulnerable we like to imagine we can guarantee our sanity or knowing from within , from an invulnerable procedure of 'pure reason' or from the self ratification of cartesian self presence we do n't like the fact of our dependency because it makes us angsty this , then , is the value of angst it keeps us on our existential toes angst discloses the fundamental condition of personhood as dasein the condition to put it gnomically of being here which is being there we philosophers like to think we are bravely asking about intelligibility , about how to secure it , how to achieve it , how to ground it and all along what we 're doing is presupposing that the mind which questions intelligibility can quite happily and intelligibly ask its own philosophical questions we arrogate to ourselves an extraordinary and utterly unrealistic degree of intellectual sensibleness we are humpty dumpties imagining that our words mean just whatever we want them to mean what hubris ! acknowledging our contingent enworldedness is both terrifying and wonderful we wake to wonder as we acknowledge our smallness , vulnerability , mortality we wake to gratitude when we acknowledge our dependency we come to an apt humility , but also to an apt platform one resting in the midst of our historical bodily social lives rather than on a fantasy of a ground beyond them for exercising in a real , rather than phantastic , and responsible way the power we actually do have angst , i believe , is the flip side of narcissism neither , it seems to me , is necessary here i depart from many an existentialist , but both are fairly inevitable in living our lives we tend to unwittingly accrue comforting yet delusional narcissistic certainties but their smugness keeps out not only the darkness but also the light hence the move to humility and wonder , to love and meaning , and to the inevitable angst that comes from relinquishing the narcissistic phantasy
