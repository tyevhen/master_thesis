i was shocked this morning to hear of the death of a local musician whom i liked very much musically and personally he was a past member of my church he was also familiar with several of the topics covered in this blog i am purposefully being vague , as i do n't know how open he was about his personal life according to news reports , he was found dead in his home over the weekend one may speculate , but at this point it is unclear how he died he was only years old talented , gentle , kind yet , from what i knew , a bit of a tortured soul hopefully , his soul is now resting peacefully
