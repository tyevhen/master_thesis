when i first heard about adobe 's pixel bender technology , i became very excited an actionscript based pixel shader api ? what could be more fun that than ? by now you know what my social life must be like when i saw that pb was a flash only technology , my enthusiasm got tamped down a bit later , i learned that pb would be supported in after effects , which had me scratching my chin again i 've written ae plug ins before it 's much less punishing than writing photoshop plug ins now it turns out there will be a pixel bender plug in for the next version of photoshop according to adobe 's john nack , pixel bender wo n't be supported in the box in the next version of photoshop , but we plan to offer a pb plug in as a free download when cs ships therefore it 's effectively part of the release this is great news for those of us who like to peek and poke pixels but ca n't be bothered to use the byzantine c based photoshop sdk in case you 're wondering what you can do with pixel bender , some nice sample images and scripts can be found here the image shown above was created with this line script nice
