filmmaker matt palko , who are renting my los angeles area childhood home from my brother mike , who now lives with his family in bangkok , thailand mary kate and matt , our wonderful hosts it was a chance to spend time in familiar territory a house that my parents bought when i was months old and where my brother mike and sister tai lived from birth , experiencing both love and terror as the children of a sometimes violent , sometimes nurturing alcoholic father and an always loving , but often terrified mother it was a chance to spend the holiday with another family comprised of some very special people mary kate , one of my favorite adult children of dear friends , her dad and my close friend tim , who was flying from chicago for the occasion and mary kate 's wonderful sister eliza , traveling with her husband chris from colorado to celebrate the holiday it was a chance to give up control of a holiday i hosted for years and to just enjoy being a guest with only a brief stint in the kitchen making the dressing it was lovely imagine crossing a threshold you had toddled over and stormed past , walked through in hope and in sorrow , and now with happy anticipation , to be enveloped in loving arms and words i'm so glad to see you how wonderful to meet you i'm so happy you 're here i love you , dearest friend and to hear yourself saying the same imagine feeling an instant ease without a trace of awkwardness not only with long time friends but also with the significant others in their lives whom you 're meeting for the first time imagine the delight of finding that the innate eccentricity of a place you once called home lives on in its current residents matt , who counts tomahawk and knife throwing among his many interests , has set up a target in the backyard and before dinner there was a lively contest where an assortment of young people chris , chris' brother tim and his soon to be bride kristen , ryan , bob 's grown up little brother whom we call our surrogate son all trying to master the skill that matt makes look easy pre dinner tomahawk lesson with matt palko , tim yarbrough and ryan grady tomahawk throw wind up from left , tim y and

glow of a backyard firepit where we settled , wrapped in blankets and holiday cheer , to continue talking and laughing together for hours after dinner imagine a late night dessert by candlelight and being stunned that it 's nearly midnight when it seems the holiday just began an hour or two before late night candlelit dessert imagine the seamless passage of time when a few of us found ourselves the elders , surrounded by lively thirtysomethings with growing careers and families mary kate 's friend lacy was there with her husband and baby son jackson whom my friend tim entertained through the evening with songs and stories and countless hugs partly a warm up exercise for being a grandfather when eliza and chris' baby girl is born in april and when his grandson , thanks to eldest daughter laura , arrives in march and partly pure joy at meeting and spending time with this delightful little boy my dear friend tim schellhardt with his new little friend jackson imagine the wonder of spending time with some young people like ryan whom i'm seen grow up at close range since he was a droll little nine year old to the fine young man and psychotherapist he has become and with some young adults like mary kate , with whom i enjoyed some time together when we both lived in los angeles , and with her sister eliza , whom i watched grow up and came to love in a lovely series of christmas pictures over the years the real life eliza , filled with intelligence , wit and warmth , and her equally wonderful sister , the beautiful and ebullient mary kate , were a joy to be with and to watch as they enjoyed each other , joining forces to whip up culinary delights in the kitchen and later on sitting , knee to knee , talking with great enthusiasm and love chris and matt , so welcoming and kind and quick to share a warm hug and fascinating story , added joy and fun to the magic of the day and evening with two of my favorite men , ryan l and tim imagine a quiet celebration of a long time loving friendship tim and i enjoyed time together , celebrating and rediscovering all the elements that have built our nearly year friendship i have always enjoyed his intelligence , his kindness , his warmth and fierce loyalty , but i had forgotten , as we 've aged , just how wonderfully uninhibited , silly and funny he can be in the company of people he loves watching him sing , joke and reach out with warmth to ryan , whom he was meeting for the first time , took me back through the years to our college days and what it meant to me to meet a man , a journalism classmate , who was both brilliant and kind , ambitious and generous of spirit and what a blessing it has been to be his friend over the years tim and me , celebrating a year friendship imagine an acceptance of the cycle of life and of aging sitting on the porch where i celebrated my second birthday , now , all these years later , celebrating with friends both old and new tim c with daughters eliza and her husband chris yarbrough and mary kate r with boyfriend matt palko imagine falling in love with an entire family that so exudes love and resilience , tolerance , humility despite a myriad of professional achievements among them and genuine joy in being together it was , indeed , a holiday for the ages !
