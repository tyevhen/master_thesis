okay , so i sat down to write a funny post about how i will never be able to make money from this blog because i am so messed up in the head , but it did n't really turn out like i thought it would it started out a little funny then actually got a little serious but i'm posting it anyway because i am feeling irrational right now here goes i think i may have mentioned several times how i do n't have a job and i have been getting a lot of feedback from you guys via comments and email saying duh , allie why do n't you make blogging your job and that way you can make money and also keep entertaining all of us and yes , that would pretty much be the most awesome thing ever but here 's the problem i am paralyzed by confusion , doubt and the complete inability to ask anyone for anything for example last night , i went out to eat at a cafe where they sell cheap burgers that are probably made out of cat meat but i do n't want to think about it after i ate my cat burger , i was really thirsty but my water was gone it was late , so the waitress was not busy in fact , she was sitting there doing nothing about feet from me but did i ask her for water ? no i got up to go fill my cup from the bathroom sink luckily the waitress saw me getting up and asked me if i needed anything at which point i felt huge relief for not having to drink bathroom water but still had trouble croaking out could i get more water , please ? because i am psychologically broken being broken like i am , it is very hard for me to ask you guys for anything i feel like it is my job to write stuff and just sit here and hope that someday some guy in a zoot suit he will definitely be wearing a zoot suit because people do that sometimes will walk up to me and say i will pay you one million dollars to write your blog even though you are already doing it for free and then i would say oh , you do n't have to do that because i am weak and stupid and i ca n't even accept gifts in my own damn fantasy because i am more worried about being liked by the imaginary man in the zoot suit than i am about being able to afford real heat or a real bed or real food i mean , i can ask people to do joke y stuff for me , like propagate the mandatory sex party thing , but as soon as it comes to asking for something real and serious , like helping to promote me or donating or any of the other possible crap i could potentially ask you guys to do if i was braver and less unsure of myself i completely shut down and will not do it i just start worrying too much about how i do n't deserve it and how i look stupid for ever thinking i would be worthy of something like that is that bad ? probably at any rate , i would love nothing more than to do this for a living if i could just get my head around the fact that people actually like reading what i write and i am actually a good blogger and plenty of other bloggers get paid to do what i do for free but will i be able to make myself understand that ? probably not i will probably end up sitting in a corner , shaking from self doubt because i wrote an honest post about how i want to make money from blogging and i think that people will look at it and think who the hell does she think she is ? she is not nearly good enough to be a professional blogger ! i could write posts about mandatory sex parties in my sleep even if i was retarded and wearing chinese finger traps on all of my fingers and even though no one actually said that or thought that i will start crying because maybe someone thought that and i believe it is true even though i made it up and i probably should have stayed in therapy long enough to work on some of my self esteem issues but i did n't yes you heard that correctly i will become emotionally distraught over an imaginary scenario that has no bearing in reality and i will believe this fabrication over the real world evidence presented by my statcounter that says at least , unique people like me every day i will pass that off by saying oh , most of those people probably got here on accident and then thought i was lame so they left and then i will focus on the part in this post where i said i would love nothing more than to do this for a living if i could just get my head around the fact that people actually like reading what i write and i am actually a good blogger and plenty of other bloggers get paid to do what i do for free and i will begin to question whether there is any validity to that statement whatsoever because now i am sure that people hate me and think i'm lame and why did i even write that ? and then i will continue to spiral into a self esteem crisis just like every other time i put myself out there and risk sounding stupid this is really how my mind works i am sorry this post was n't funnier i had to get it off my chest i promise i 'll write something funny when i am done being all pessimistic and self critical thank you for reading and making me feel good about myself every day even if i never make a cent from this blog , i will still love doing it
