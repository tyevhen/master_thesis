in case you 're having any trouble finding us over on shrink rap news , clinkshrink is talking about the unpredictability of patient violence it is not at all clear to me why the patients she described were in a youtube video over on shrink rap today , roy is talking about his favorite palindrome madam i'm xanax ? over on the johns hopkins department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences website , i'm pleased to report that shrink rap three psychiatrists explain their work is the featured faculty book ! and finally , over on moviedoc 's blog , he has a post up about the shrink rap movie sadly , the movie has absolutely nothing to do with us , but i do like the name and roy watched it and attended a twitter event held by moviedoc
