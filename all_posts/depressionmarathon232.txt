i'm not a big fan of cleaning who is ? but i'm even less a fan of a dirty environment i find my mood suffers if i let my surroundings get too messy so i 've been doing my spring cleaning today i went outside it 's sunny and crisp here , a perfect day to do some yard work if you own a dog in a northern climate you know what that means when the snow melts a full winter of potty breaks is left behind it 's not pretty after a couple of hours i had filled more than one bag with dead grass , leaves , and jet 's doggy deposits my yard is now clean jet and i are both happy speaking of happy , i'm still feeling well it 's been two weeks since i asked and my doctor agreed to lower one of my medications i think i'm well enough to be on the lower dose , and i'm pretty sure the med was keeping me from losing the extra weight i gained during my layoff from running i'm happy to report i got on the scale this morning , and i have indeed lost one pound one pound is not a lot , but it 's a start i 've been working very hard to eat well , stay away from sweets which i love , and running or exercising consistently it 's nice to see the work paying off i 've been running consistently over the last couple weeks i'm getting back on track i'm scheduled to run long tomorrow morning how long i go has yet to be determined my schedule calls for miles , but i'm not back up to that level yet i ran last weekend , so i think miles might be doable that 's what i'm going to shoot for , but i 'll let my body be my guide i had dead legs during my run yesterday they feel better today i'm being cautiously optimistic that i 'll continue to feel strong and be able to run longer tomorrow
