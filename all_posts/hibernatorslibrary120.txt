the war of the worlds , by h g wells narrated by greg wagland spoiler alert ! when a pod crashes just outside london , our intrepid observer unnamed protagonist is at first curious he watches as a lid slowly unscrews itself , and an alien crawls out he only makes a run for it when green lightening chases down the watching crowd , scorching them all to death he runs home , takes his wife to an out of the way town , and for some idiotic reason heads back home the rest of the book is his adventures on the way back to his wife it also contains a short couple of chapters about the adventures of his brother in london just to add some greater perspective of the story despite the name of this story , war of the worlds is about three pods that land in the london area it is not an en masse invasion i think it 's interesting that yet again wells wrote a book where the characters remain completely unnamed perhaps that 's meant to make the story more autobiographical or simply to say that events , not names , matter when something like this happens i like to think of it as the second choice if you 've read past my spoiler alert , then you do n't mind if i mention that in the end of the book all of the aliens died from bacterial infection because they were not immune to disease on earth i think this ending was quite creative and forward thinking at the time it also gives the reader a feeling of no control no we did n't destroy the aliens with our brains and technology and sheer will to live they were going to destroy us , and that 's that but something completely out of our control is what saved us in the end i thought this ending was quite fascinating when i read the book as a teenager then , when the tom cruise movie came out one of my friends told me do n't see it , it has the stupidest ending , i 've heard so i expected something really darned stupid to happen at the ending when it ended , she turned to me to say i told you so when i pointed out that this is exactly how the book ended she was like it was based on a book ? that gave me a perspective that perhaps an ending outside of our control is too philosophical for most readers movie watchers of the day ? perhaps we just want to see ourselves be in control of our own fate ? i think it 's interesting to note that the ending to independence day also had a similar ending a virus killed the aliens , but in this case it was technological warfare and not a biological infection that we had no control over so metaphorical disease was there , just as in war of the worlds , but the power was in our hands i'm trying to think of some modern books besides outwardly religious ones where a similarly dire situation is turned around by something outside of our control if i recall , there 's a very popular stephen king novel that ends in a deus ex machina sort of way
