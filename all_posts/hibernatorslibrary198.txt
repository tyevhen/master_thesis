let me in , by john ajvide lindqvist , narrated by steven pacey oskar , a year old boy , is bullied by his schoolmates he spends his time fantasizing about revenge and stabbing trees with a knife he obsesses about violent crimes , keeping a notebook of newspaper clippings one day , a strange girl and her father move in next door she seems quite unaware of social norms and completely immune to getting cold her father and she argue loudly and frequently , which oskar can hear through his wall despite the fact that she tells him they ca n't be friends , eli and oskar soon form a bond she encourages him to stand up to his bullies , and he starts growing in self confidence but strange murders are suddenly occurring in his neighborhood , and oskar begins to suspect that eli is more than he thought she was i have been interested in reading this book after reading a fascinating short story of his a few years ago this book did not disappoint it was eerie and consuming it was also very gruesome , and it has some graphic child sexual abuse scenes , so beware luckily , i had read reviews of this book beforehand and already knew about the child abuse , so i was not quite as repulsed by it however , this book lost an entire star because of the child sexual abuse , which did n't appear at all in the movies and was n't absolutely necessary the child abuse did help develop the character of eli 's father as a disgusting and pathetic failure , but i think both attributes could have been manged in other ways or , at least , without the graphic scenes in general , i am pleased with lindqvist 's style it is mysterious and flows well the characters were well drawn and believable in a there be vampires sort of way there dark , dreary mood was set early in the book and retained steadily throughout there was nothing particularly original about lindqvist 's vampire , though eli had some original personality traits and circumstances also , i 've seen this book described as a romance , and i do n't agree with that yes , oskar asked eli to go steady , but that was about it i mean , he was , and those feelings were very naive and not pronounced this was a book about friendship , not romance overall , i was pleased with the book and would read another by lindqvist , though i 'll probably wait before i can get through another that has sexual abuse in it the audiobook was well read the voices were distinguishable and the pacing was quite reasonable stars for flow , eeriness , mystery star lost for child sexual abuse
