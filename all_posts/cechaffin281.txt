one of the first questions i could answer when i emerged from my awful depression was what do you want for your birthday ? without hesitation i said , a guided abalone dive this is a good test question for mental health healthy people usually want things and if they can get those things for free they should have no trouble remembering what those things are if you d asked me the same question over a month ago i would have been absolutely stumped sunday i cashed in kathleen s gift and went stalking the wild abalone that terrifying mollusk of the deep ! it was after pm the water was murky , the swell was picking up strands of bull kelp and sea grass clawed at my head like blackberry vines visibility perhaps ft seawater in my snorkel , damn ! they come sliming , sliggering , slouching , suctioning forward on dirty tongues with the black ruffle around them , the army of angry mollusks pursue their ancient grudge against vertebrates the shell was it , man ! impregnable and now you feast on me i'm gonna go pre cambrian on your ass that s because you evolved far enough to survive and afterwards got lazy beware , vertebrate ! when the abalone attacked i was already fitted with lbs of weights to counteract the flotation of my wetsuit , so that the weight of each additional abalone that grolloped on my bod would drag me further down to davey jones' gym locker no matter what manic counter propulsion my fins attempted here come the limpets on steroids ! the barry bonds barnacles ! belt first ! their general cried i tried to release my belt but the damn clams wouldn t let me get my hands on the buckle in time in ten foot depths i clung to a large rock and hoped that my house the one with a spine and real lungs would not have its subprime jumbo shrimp bluff called on they came , sucking , seeking when my eyes dipped toward the waterline and i took my last breath , i realized that the mask and snorkel were of no use now but before i tossed them a thought arrived what if i were to blow air underneath the abalooneys with the snorkel ! they use water cannons above ground , why not reverse the elements ? i began air goosing every parasitic mollusk i could find clinging to my suit miraculously the damn clams ran from air like black from rice lightened , i rose to the surface frightened , they twirled back to the bottom , licking their tongues and whining invertebrate excuses despite these initial difficulties i managed three legal abalones in my first hour afterwards i bought an abalone hammer and pounded the beasts into delicate strip steaks of firm white flesh for my dear wife who had never tasted abalone it lived up to its reputation she said it was to die for , and indeed , every season five divers agree with her sorry to leave you with the taste of death in your mouths happy halloween , craig erick
