my house is being cleaned i'm banished to the local caribou coffee shop it 's too hot to run , and i have to meet my social worker within the hour anyway i'm listening to minnesota public radio on my headphones , but i can still hear two college age women animatedly discussing their crew teams i'm fascinated by a woman at the next table who , despite missing her left arm below the elbow , is typing faster than i there is a woman with cancer soaking up the sun at a table outside and there are smartly dressed medical personnel sipping , sitting and roaming about such is the case when observing life in a coffee shop across the street from mayo clinic it is a gorgeous , albeit hot , sunny morning i'm feeling fortunate today my house is being cleaned by a friend who charges me far too little for the job she does i dislike cleaning , and when i feel bad , i just do n't do it finding mo , a fellow days of yoga classmate , was a god send she does a great job , and it is so nice to come home to a clean house ! i highly recommend letting someone else clean once in awhile i'm feeling fortunate today i'm about to meet with my social worker , an involved member of my treatment team and even though i do n't always think i need to meet with her , it is nice to have another person keeping track of me she sees me in my surroundings , not an office , and therefore she quickly gets a picture of how i'm doing sometimes , i think she knows before i do when things are sliding downhill like i said , it is nice to have another person keeping track of me i'm feeling fortunate today the sun is shining , and i'm not one of these people taking a break from work i'm enjoying a day off part time work may be a requirement of maintaining my mental health , but at least my career choice allows me to survive fairly comfortably despite working part time i'm also fortunate not to be one of the patients i see around me the lady with cancer sunning herself outside , or the man in the wheelchair who just rolled by i have an ambulatory illness , which right now allows me freedom from a hospital bed i 've been there , done that i'm grateful i do n't need hospitalization today i feel fortunate today to be able to appreciate the fortune in my life i'm not a millionaire i'm not famous i'm not even without struggles it 's the simple things i often take for granted which make me fortunate i'm grateful for my fortune today
