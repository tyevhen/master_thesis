i 've seen , too often for my tastes , unschooling be described by non unschoolers or those very new to unschooling , mostly as a wait 'til they ask , or hands off approach , and that always makes me sigh i wonder if perhaps this arises from the fact that many parents dealings with their children are often confrontational , authoritarian , and generally of a more coercive nature ? perhaps when they think of not forcing kids to do things , they feel they could n't suggest activities or anything at all , because the way they 're used to interatcing with their kids is that of authoritarian parent and teacher of child ! perhaps not i'm just throwing that out there , because i'm really not sure where that misconception came from ! if you have any ideas on that , i 'd quite like to hear them but moving on wherever the misconception came from , the fact remains that it is quite common and it is just so far from the truth ! i think that people get so caught up in the perceived technicalities , the what an unschooler does and does n't , can and ca n't , do , that the core of the philosophy and lifestyle , that of parents and children living and learning in freedom together , seems to be forgotten because that is really what unschooling is all about , and what unschooling looks like a family that actually likes each other exploring the world together emphasis on together when i think of unschooling in my own family , i think of my mom finding an awesome book at a local used book sale , and saying idzie , i saw this book and thought you might be interested it looks fascinating ! i think of an impromptu trip to the library because i asked my mom if we had any books on medieval weapons , and it turns out for some reason that we did n't i think of my mom calling me from the other end of the house , voice filled with both fascination and horror , because she wanted to read an article about gmos to me i also think of countless times when i searched her out to tell her about the intriguing characters and plot of whatever novel i was reading , or to bounce an idea off of her for an article i wanted to write , or to share a song i thought she 'd like , or to read her an excerpt from a book on green anarchy or unschooling point being , learning in my family is a very involved thing i used as examples things just between my mother and i , but i enthusiastically tell my dad interesting stuff as well , and my mum , sister , and i have the most fascinating conversations all the time ! i'm not saying that everything is shared , because it is n't for instance , emi writes a ton of fiction , but she usually only lets her online role playing not the rpg type role playing , but the writing back and forth , collaborative story writing type role playing buddies read it , and both my mom and i respect that as her choice , and do n't try to bug her to let us read it even that though , is involved in that my mother cares about her writing , and happily listens to emi telling her about the finer points of writing , her own writing journey , what she 's discovering about english grammar as she learns a second language , etc she just does n't try and push my sister to do something she does n't want to hands off to me means ignoring kids saying oh , they 'll learn for themselves , then just going about your adult lives without making your kids a part of it at all , or very little i see true unschooling , on the other hand , as a collaborative living process , where each family member shares interests , suggests activities which the other family members can choose to participate in or not , shares cool articles and facts and internet links , and lets the appropriate person know when they come across something they might like my mom has brought emi home numerous books on japanese history , language , poetry , etc , for her perusing pleasure unschooling is nothing more complicated than living , and thus learning , with respect and freedom , together as a family and although this often is n't easy i know that my family has more than it 's fair share of squabbling and grumpiness , it seems to me to be fairly simple ! these are just a few rambling thoughts , so please excuse the general , well , rambly ness of it all ! peace , idzie you might also like blame unschooling ! favorite unschooling posts on this blog of the cons of unschooling misconceptions about unschooling linkwithin
