first , check out roy 's post below from earlier today he tells us how to cure alcoholism ! click here i do nothing of the kind , do n't listen to her so the new york times has a health blog , and if you ask me , today it 's trying to be shrink rap in today 's post , for some bereaved , pain pills without end , the unnamed author talks about the ease with which physicians primary care docs prescribe benzodiazepines for acute grief , the ease with which they refill these scripts often for years at a time , the ease with which these patients become addicted and suffer from side effects powerful benzodiazepines such as xanax , valium and ativan are widely overused in older patients , many experts fear , leading to serious health worries , including sleep troubles , cognitive difficulties , car crashes and falls yet doctors in the survey seemed willing to offer unlimited amounts of these addictive drugs to help patients cope with death the study is small it consists of primary care docs in philadelphia , and interviews with older patients who 've taken benzodiazepines for years said they began taking benzodiazepines during a period of grieving want details ? read the original article here as always , the reader comments are as enlightening as the blog post itself ah , that 's true here at shrink rap as well interesting stuff , but i guess i think the sample here is so small as to be useless half the docs said they 'd prescribed benzos for grief so at least primary care docs and patients started chronic benzodiapine use after a death i'm not surprised , i'm not commenting on anyone 's practice , i guess i just do n't like the tone of the blog post which somehow paints the docs as ignorant , perhaps lazy , may be even negligent or sinister finally , please note that i stole my grief graphic from a red sox blog http redsoxdiary blogspot com
