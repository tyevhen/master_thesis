may be triggering i often ask myself , how many times can i be pushed and pulled between the poles of life and death i find that for the majority of life , this has the been the case and just as you feel you are getting somewhere , you get pulled back again this is something i am used to , but as many of you will know , just because you are used to certain trauma in your life , does n't mean that you will never get tired of it i find that i am in a much better place now than i was a few years ago and for that i am proud i can also say that i am beginning to find happiness again something which i never thought i 'd experience for a long time and even though this is the case , i ca n't help but be haunted by the continuous traumas that i experience in my life and i find myself questioning how many times can my body be put through this and come out alive ? when we face trauma , it is extremely difficult especially those that are continuous like a break up of a family , or the illness of a family member as a you and i both know , that as a sufferer of mental illness , these events do n't impact lightly , nor would it on a person who does n't suffer from such either ! but , when we get pulled back into the pain and darkness that we have felt so many times with our mental illness , it has a detrimental effect because you and i both know that we never ever want to go back to the depth of hell that we have experienced not only that , but when we begin to find happiness again , it 's difficult to comprehend that it might be being taken away all too soon when such repeated traumas come around , i feel exhausted knowing that i 've been experiencing such for over a decade , and there is no escape the fact , that i wonder how much more i can cope with and how much longer i can stay alive as difficult as it is , i remind myself that this is that way it is , as unfair as it may be the world does n't owe me anything it 's just that some people get a better deal of cards than others i remind myself that these are all bumps in the road on the way to recovery and as tired and angry as i get , i remind myself that i cannot change this and i know there must be good to come i just have to go through this pain to get to the other side it cannot be helped no year is perfect you can keep going you are stronger than you think amy xx
