just a brief note tonight to let you all know i continue to be busy , and things continue to go well my mood is good i have to keep myself from wondering when the other shoe will drop , and just enjoy the ride i'm working hard , hours per week the past two weeks , and surviving my puppy , jet , is as hilarious as ever he makes me laugh , as he plays by himself , racing , rolling , and jumping around with his toys in my house , as he is right now , or in the backyard our crappy weather has made running challenging , but i 've been getting my miles in nonetheless and i just returned from my new , twice weekly , strength training class we had a tough workout tonight , and i loved it i think i may be sore tomorrow , and that 's okay life is good right now depression seems relatively distant and i kind of like it that way
