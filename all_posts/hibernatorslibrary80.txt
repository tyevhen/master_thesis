the creation of light , by gustave dore the second chapter of kugel 's tome covers the creation of the world and the story of adam and eve genesis chapters modern biblical scholars theorize that the pentateuch was actually accumulated from four sources j jahwist or yahwist , e elohist , d deuteronomist , and p priestly kugel discusses j and p in his second chapter the p source is concerned with enumerating for instance , counting the days of the creation in genesis and with priestly rules it refers to god as god until the revelation of the name yahweh to moses later in the pentateuch the j source focuses on human corruption and the relationship between humans and the soil it refers to god as lord god for example then the lord god formed the man of dust from the ground genesis this difference in sources explains why there are seemingly two slightly different creation stories genesis covers a day by day account of the creation of the world , ending in a rest on the seventh day in it , god creates plants on the third day and man on the sixth then genesis goes on to explain how the lord god formed man before there were any plants modern scholars consider the first creation story to be from p source and the second creation story , and following story of adam and eve , to be from j source the focus of the creation story in the p source was to display the importance of resting on the sabbath something the p source is concerned about throughout the pentateuch that 's why it counted the days of creation and made such a big point of god resting on the th day on the other hand , j 's creation story , and following story of adam and eve , is an allegory for how humans developed from hunter gatherers to farmers therefore the lord god sent him out from the garden of eden to work the ground from which he was taken genesis historically , as cultures develop agriculture , they also develop more hardy clothing to protect them in their toils this parallels adam and eve beginning to wear clothes when they are sent away to work the ground like kugel 's first chapter , the second chapter discusses inconsistencies that are explained away by readers for instance , god told adam and eve that of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat , for on the day that you eat of it you shall surely die genesis but after adam ate of the tree , he lived to the ripe old age of why did n't he die the same day ? would god give an empty threat ? no of course not because a day in the life of god lasts years but do not overlook this one fact , beloved , that with the lord one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day peter quotes from the bible are from the english standard version esv this is part of a series of posts for my upcoming bible as literature group read click to see how to read the bible chapter notes
