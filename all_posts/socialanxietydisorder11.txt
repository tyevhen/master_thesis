my mother , , who has health and pain problems of her own is trying to not only care for my grandma , with alzheimer s , but also my aunt , her sister , who lives with my grandma and is disabled to the point of being on a walker , not able to use her hands , and both of them fall all the time i have begged her to consider an assisted living facility they can both stay in the same room apt now before it gets any worse than what it is my grandma is paranoid , has tried to leave the house in the middle of the night , in the foreseeable future i believe she will become violent and my aunt can not walk without her walker , her hands are curled in so she can t cook or even bathe herself correctly mom is out there staying about nights a week when both my aunt and grandma need care now not later my mother is only harming herself by trying to over do it in caring for two women who can no longer care for themselves there is even a problem with it being sanitary there as they both have diarrhea and the housekeeper and my mom find feces all over the house and bathroom every single day this is more than my mom can handle and i don t know how to get her to understand that she is not failing her mother who had a tia stroke and then went into this dementia immediately afterward it has gotten out of hand and i don t want my mother to die from trying to care for her own mother who can t say that she would rather be in a nursing home as if she were in her right mind , she would ve said this and also her sister who won t even do physical therapy to try and get better the injuries they sustain from falling alone are beyond mom s ability to care for them any advice from people who have gone through this ? answer i wonder if your mother feels guilty and feels she is obligated to take care of them ? ? ? ? you should ask her why she is doing this , if she knows she has problems of her own i would talk to her and encourage her to at least look at facilities she will find that they are qualified and prepared to take care of your relatives your mother does not need to take on this added burden and everyone will be much happier if they get the support they need in an assisted facility she can visit anytime and she can have peace of mind at the same time question alzheimer s blood pressure trazepam ? my mom is in the last stages of alzheimers in a lockdown memory care facility yesterday , i went to visit her and got there right after dinner the cna s told me she was watching tv i went back and found her bent over with her head nearly between her legs and passed out we tried waking her but the most we could get from her is a blank stare she recognized no one her temp and bp were taken temp was normal and bp was high for her she has a strict schedule for hbp meds cna s told me she had eaten well common , though i know she only picks at food i ve watched many times without her knowing i was there she had been up and walking around before dinner and helping with the patients this is only what i was told so here is my first question what would cause her bp to be so high if she was passed out and there was no fever and meds are taken very regularly ? i got her dressed for bed , changed her diaper and had everyone tell her good night even though it was p m my son , yr old nephew and yr old niece told me grandmas dying ! my brother just didn t know what to think and kept asking me questions oh , one other thing hospice put mom on or trazepam about a month or two ago for sleep problems could that have anything to do with it ? i talked with the facility and mom is back up and has no recollection of last night normal bp is still high but she is now acknowledging when spoken to though her answers make no sense normal could her hbp meds just not be effective any more or the trazepam is interfering with them ? thanks a million caring for mother with alzheimers imo the best thing i ve found out about alzheimer s is there is never a re run on tv ! ! answer i can see you love your mother very much let me assure you that your mother s bp is high , but acceptable besides , at the last stage of alzheimer she may be a bit rigid when bp was measured , which would in turn give her an overestimated bp reading changing bp medicine now may not help her bp and the possible side effect of the new bp medicine and its interaction with her concurrent medications may cause even more problems i think at this stage , you should try to make your mother happy and comfortable , this bp level is not going to give much problem indeed god bless you and your mother
