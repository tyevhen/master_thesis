i'm about halfway through my week grandmas marathon training plan my schedule called for a half marathon race this weekend , so i found the only one i could and ran it the race was hours from my home in a small wisconsin town i drove over with jet last night after work in preparation for the early morning start today it was a nice , small town event benefiting the local veterans' memorial , so there were many vets in attendance i shook as many hands as i could , thanking each vet for his service to our country the older ones always look so surprised when i do that ! i love our veterans , and i'm honored to work with them in my profession i have n't raced since the dallas marathon in early december , and i did n't taper at all for this event , so i was n't sure what to expect today to get the most accurate picture of my fitness i decided to run purely by feel i did not look at my watch , and thankfully there were no clocks on the course , for the entire race i had no idea what pace i was running , which kept me from freaking out about running too fast or too slow i just ran our weird weather continues , so i awoke to snow and degrees a cold wind was blowing , and as i soon discovered , the course was quite hilly conditions were not ideal the wind was in our faces for the first miles thankfully , it was only intermittently directed right at us from there to the finish the hills were tough there were two back to back , long , steep hills between and miles they were really long and really steep i refused to walk them , though many runners did they hurt ! after miles the hills leveled out a bit , and there were long stretches of flat country road unfortunately , that niceness ended just before mile eleven it 's just cruel to put a hill at mile of a half marathon if you ask me ! it was also a little sadistic to put the finish line on top of a long , gradual incline , but that they did i guess it did make crossing the finish line that much more relieving i finally eyeballed my watch as i turned it off at the finish i was very pleasantly surprised ! i ran a , which is a average per mile i placed first in my age division , which was also a nice surprise running by feel turned out to be a good decision i was more relaxed out on the course and spent less time in my head i pushed myself to the max , but i was n't fretting about it like i would have if i had known my quicker than i thought i could run pace it was a good day , and now it 's time for a well deserved nap !
