there are two main reasons that i m trying sjw it hasn t arrived yet , by the way the first is that it is relatively inexpensive compared to more widely accepted therapies i live in a smaller community , though it s by no means remote the options for most specialized needs are usually limited to one or two for example , the counselor i m constantly referring to works at a community funded mental health clinic that adjusts its prices based on the user s ability to pay it is the only affordable option that is less than a hour drive away but when i went i felt locked in to the counselor that they assigned me and i did not like her plus her first solution was medication a medicine that my insurance doesn t cover so , though the cost of the visits are tempered , the prescription isn t the second reason is that i can order sjw through the mail and i never have to look anyone in the eye during the transaction i don t know if its society s stigma against all types of emotional problems or my own social anxiety , but it s a helluva lot easier this way and i m less likely to back out of it so , this is what i m trying i tell myself that i m going to start walking each morning i don t know if i actually will but that s what i tell myself right now i ve designed a life that doesn t require me to leave the house for days at a time and that s probably not the best thing for my emotional health even if it s more comfortable maybe with a combination of these two things the lows won t be quite so low
