i spent hours in the chairs of different dental specialists yesterday afternoon it was the horrible culmination to what otherwise was a lovely weekend away today i find myself overwhelmed and afraid the drama with my teeth has taken another turn for the worse , but i ca n't say anymore about it without breaking down into tears , so that 's all i have to tell you for now i have another dental appointment tomorrow i'm trying to hold it together , keep my fears in check , and put one foot in front of the other until then as far as my weekend , otherwise , it was really nice i spent saturday morning running miles around some remote lakes near my parent 's place it was beautiful , and i felt great the rest of saturday morning was spent helping my mother organize her delayed wedding reception , which took place saturday afternoon after at least years together , my mom and stepfather were finally married in a small ceremony in florida this past spring since their local families and friends could n't attend the wedding , they had a small reception in duluth saturday afternoon it went really well , and i think my mom thoroughly enjoyed it the reception was the only time in the past months that all of my brothers and i were in the same place at the same time it was really nice spending time with my brothers , their spouses , and almost all of my nieces and nephews like many families , i suppose , we have some interesting , sometimes touchy family dynamics , but everyone was on their best , most loving behavior , and it was quite nice actually , the reception was fun it was so fun , we continued the party after the party we all spent the evening together at my brother 's house eating pizza and watching the olympics we have n't had that much fun family time together in a long , long time on sunday , i spent another beautiful duluth morning running miles on a bike path through the woods it was great to be outside , in the woods , feeling good , running again my mom and i then watched the olympic marathon together while i recovered after my run i enjoyed that the afternoon included more family time , as we attended the duluth tall ships festival on the lake superior waterfront i even splurged for some fabulous , greasy , sugary , mini donuts ! why not ? i ran miles on monday , i got some cherished one on one time with my youngest brother i rarely get one on one time with him , as he has two very active young boys we played golf together , on another gorgeous day , for hours my brother is an incredible athlete , so it was fun to watch him hit the ball i'm a beginner , so he gave me some good tips we talked and laughed and simply enjoyed each other 's company like i said , it was a cherished opportunity finally , i spent monday evening having dinner with my good friend , mary it 's always great to spend time with her we go way back and have a special bond she 's one of those friends i can go without seeing for long stretches of time , and yet we pick up right where we left off when we do get together i have very few of those people in my life i value her friendship good times had with family and friends in a place i love , that 's what i'm trying to keep in mind today the stress of the continued drama with my teeth is going to play out however it 's going to play out i ca n't , unfortunately , control that it sucks it 's unfortunate it 's not fair but it is what it is i'm very grateful to have had such a pleasant weekend away with my family those are the moments i need to remember and focus on today
