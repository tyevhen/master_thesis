i'm still in the hospital , where i 've been since last week for this latest episode of depression tomorrow i have my twelfth ect treatment and then plan to head home my friend , wendy , who assisted getting me to the hospital and who is currently watching my dog does n't want me to go home yet she is worried i continue to have the same dark thoughts which originally landed me in here she does n't think those thoughts have resolved enough yet , and she is worried i am going to go home and continue to struggle with my thinking neither of us want that but i ca n't stand to be here for one more minute either ! i really feel anxious to return to my life and my work the new york city marathon is next week i am signed up and have a flight lined up , but i 've decided i'm not going to go this will be the second year in a row that i will miss the marathon , but i just have n't put in the training time to run it like i would like to run it it 's hard thinking about missing it again , but it does n't make any sense to attempt it when i'm not prepared as needed maybe next year i 'll finally get to run it if i can just spend the next couple weeks getting back out onto the road , these next few weeks will be valuable this depression dip has really stolen my running motivation from me i 'd like to get it back that 's about all i have to say at this moment i'm anxiously awaiting tomorrow 's treatment and my return home i'm looking forward to being reunited with my dog , jet , and returning to my daily routine i'm anxious to get back into my own house and my own bed at some point , this depression episode has got to abate that will certainly be cause for celebration , and you 'll hear it here first !
