today 's bipolar poet is samuel taylor coleridge that 's his death mask in the photo like many poets , he is right hemisphere dominant , which you can see by the increased expression grooves worn into the left side of his face , along with the lips downturned to the left in conversation , at least , he was regarded as the greatest genius of his era unfortunately , depression undid him , which doctors treated with opium , to which he became addicted , and he was dependent on others for much of his life after age his literary production did not reflect the genius of his creative mind , which he described as a great surinam toad sprouting other , smaller toads as it moved forward loose quote i recommend his dejection an ode as a great description of clinical depression , interspersed with memories of past highs , and a courageous attempt to overcome his mood , though many take this poem to be about his opium addiction guess what of bipolars are also substance abusers as for myself , i continue in the same state i did go to the gym today and took a body sculpting class for elder boomers , where i was the only man and also the youngest in the room it was nevertheless a good workout for my out of shape frame i discovered , as a depressed person , that it 's much less pressure to simply attend an exercise class than to try to work out on your own i hope to return tomorrow kenyon 's arthritis is getting worse not only his left forelimb but his left hind leg is now showing stiffness yesterday we took him for a hike and had to stop short because he looked exhausted afterwards , swimming , he lacked his usual stamina i hope it was only the hike that reduced his swimming stamina otherwise this represents a significant change i dread the day we shall have to put him to sleep he is kathleen 's familiar they are joined at the hip when i came home today after dropping kathleen at work , he greeted me at the door but continued to sit and wait for kathleen , emitting a low whine when she did n't appear i really worry about kathleen when the dreaded day comes i fear she will be inconsolable but is n't this scenario exactly the kind of thing a depressed person dwells on ? enough ! holding at kilorats , ce
