how does a cross word by a father become a chemical in the child 's brain ? the angry words portend possible danger and rejection there are clues in the tone of voice , the look , and the words themselves what is going on inside the child is that the hypothalamic frontal cortex axis is en gaged to send messages to all other systems to be on the alert this mes sage is sent by chemical courier it is the meaning implicit in the message that begins the chemical transformation in the child 's brain the hypo thalamus then triggers the endocrine system to release catecholamines , making the heart speed up and the blood flow generally the process goes from the perceiving frontal cortex and other aspects of the cortex hearing , sight , etc to the hypothalamus to the pituitary and then to sympathetic nervous system neurons which organize the flight or fight response to danger how does a loving look by the mother at her baby change the baby s brain ? it is responsible for the increased serotonin output that keeps him comfortable when the traumas are severe and early enough the brain and particularly the brainstem , cannot manufacture enough the setpoints may be altered the child then overreacts because it cannot dilute or vitiate feelings this child may become terrified of a slightly angry father , while another loved child would not a deviated personality is on route terror of the father now becomes permanent increases in stress hormone levels the frontal area , now signaling extreme danger , interacts with the medulla in the brainstem to affect heart and lung function in turn , the brainstem maintains the tone and vigor of the frontal cortex , constantly adjusting it to react to stimuli when the brainstem is in a hyper state due to early trauma or lack of love , there is chronic , dramatic overreaction hys teria is the label we attach to this what are you get ting so excited about ? dunno now we know the brainstem has been primed and too ready for action when warmth is expressed in the actions of a parent toward a baby , the baby 's brain is suffused with opiates , resulting in a feeling of well being in her i have heard many of my patients cry out , show me that you want me , mama ! in animal research , the loving handling of speci mens just after birth increases the anti anxiety chemicals such as serotonin this level endures so that later in life there is still an adequate mechanism to handle adversity or stress when a father never touches his infant , is impatient and angry , and demands obedience from a two year old , the frontal cortical neurons are going to be impaired , perhaps for a lifetime hugs and kisses during these critical periods make those neurons grow and connect properly with other neurons you can kiss a brain into maturity a father who never shows happiness to see his baby , never responds with kindness to her cries is forming a new brain in her every action of the parent may exude unhappiness with the child who did nothing more than get born and interfere in his life the stage is already set for later unhappiness and depression she is now on a lifelong struggle to make the father happy to be with her a fruitless effort the baby can feel unwanted long before it understands the concept and what can the baby do about it ? nothing her brain goes on the alert , and stays that way until later on she finds a downer or painkiller and suddenly finds what she needed all of her life comfort and relaxation who can live with such a feeling when you are totally dependent on people who do n't like you ? and in the child s brain that feeling remains intact and present drugs are calming the child , the child who feels unwanted and unliked drugs do exactly what would have happened if the child were adopted out to a loving , kind , warm family drugs become the family , and now if the adult is in a step program he has another family of addicts beside him that support bolsters the second line limbic function and calms pain on that level thus the agglomeration of pain on all brain strata has been reduced on one of those levels making the search for drugs that much less importuning
