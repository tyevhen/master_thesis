holiday time can be a stressful time for most adults , but if you really want to get into the christmas spirit , spend time with children over the holiday so you can experience the wonder of the holidays through a child 's eyes experiencing the wonder of the holidays through a child 's eyes unlike most adults , children are still in touch with the magic , joy , and wonder of the holidays where anything is possible everyday there are small wonders around us , if we take the time to notice them during the holiday season , rather than focusing on how stressed out you feel , try experiencing the holiday as a child even if you did n't have good holidays as a child , you can still enjoy the holiday as an adult when you 're around children we can learn a lot from children children can enter into that transitional space between playing and reality and allow themselves to be immersed in the experience you can take them to see the department store christmas windows and they open up to their beauty in ways that most adults have forgotten if you 're fortunate enough to take a child to see the nutcracker suite , you can see her eyes light up as she is entranced by the glitter and magic of the ballet and the enchanting music maybe she has fantasies about being a ballerina gliding across the stage seeing the world through children 's eyes , especially during the holidays , is one of the best gifts you can give yourself happy and healthy holidays to all josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist works with individual adults and couples josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist photo credit judith garcia
