men are less likely to get treatment for psychiatric disorders , more than half of those who seek help are women men are less likely to attempt suicide but men have three times the number of completed suicides than women they choose more lethal methods are men different ? here 's the beginning of the mission statement from a site called mantherapy org working aged men years old account for the largest number of suicide deaths in colorado these men are also the least likely to receive any kind of support they don t talk about it with their friends they don t share with their family and they sure as heck don t seek professional treatment they are the victims of problematic thinking that says mental health disorders are unmanly signs of weakness and i , dr rich mahogany , am dedicated to changing that part of a multi agency effort , including the colorado office of suicide prevention , carson j spencer foundation and cactus , man therapy is giving men a resource they desperately need a resource to help them with any problem that life sends their way , something to set them straight on the realities of suicide and mental health , and in the end , a tool to help put a stop to the suicide deaths of so many of our men so went to mantherapy and listened to dr rich mahogany i think he 's an actor , the site says he 's not a real therapist , i surfed around his office where there 's a dead creature with antlers on the wall , seating that 's from a baseball stadium , and i took part of his symptom checklist test it 's not the m the site feels like a parody of all things masculine i'm not a man so i'm not sure how to call this but i think if i were a distressed man , this would n't make me feel more comfortable getting help it 's not that listing resources might not be useful , but i just was n't sure if you feel like checking it out , surf over to mantherapy and tell me what you think
