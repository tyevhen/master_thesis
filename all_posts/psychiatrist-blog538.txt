okay , so even i'm sick of listening to me here in maryland , there were hearings on proposed medical marijuana bills on friday and clink and i had an op ed piece in the baltimore sun opposing medical marijuana the governor announced he would veto any medical marijuana legislation that passed the assembly , and while dr joshua sharfstein , the secretary of the maryland department of health and mental hygiene was instrumental in making recommendations for one of the bills , apparently he testified against his own bill so this leaves me as the only person in maryland who is still talking about medical marijuana but i am i felt like i needed to address those comments on the sun paper , and i'm going to do so over on our weekly cpn shrink rap news blog it should appear sometime on around noon , editor permitting here is the link roy i 'll shut up now , i promise , but i wanted to create this space for anyone who 'd rather comment here other posts on marijuana
