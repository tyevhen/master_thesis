i do not like to travel by airplane being hundreds of feet in the air makes me nervous however , my career requires that i travel more than once a month , so i have used my recovery training to make the experience easier recently i was on a flight that became quite bumpy the plane went up and down and left to right it was probably the worst turbulence i ve experienced needless to say , i was in a panic my eyes were blurry my palms were sweaty my body shook my mind raced to my astonishment , the woman next to me sat calmly with her eyes closed after about five minutes the turbulence was over , and when i began to regroup i applied my recovery training i didn t fault myself for my reaction , as dr low reminds us that we shouldn t expect to be comfortable in an uncomfortable situation i endorsed myself for controlling my muscles not crying during the turbulence or disturbing the composure of the woman next to me afterward i remarked to a few people in the office about the bumpy trip , but i did not speak about it excessively before recovery i would have told everyone i met about my horrible flight , thereby working myself up i ve also come to realize that when i worry about the plane crashing i m making a bid to be exceptional there are hundreds if not thousands of flights every day across the world , and only rarely does a plane encounter trouble and even more rarely it crashes instead of worrying about an exceptional event , i need to focus on the average flying experience there will be some bumps , and some flights will be smoother than others but overall i should not give into temper every time the plane encounters some rough air to help me with this , i ve been practicing forced objectivity for example , when i m flying i listen to music , watch a video , or read this way a lot of the little bumps go unnoticed and my mental health is better for it
