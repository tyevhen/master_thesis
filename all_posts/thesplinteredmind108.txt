one way i keep depression at bay in my life is to get out and do things in the sunlight , in public , and nowadays that usually involves me driving somewhere years ago , however , i would be lucky if i could convince myself to take a walk around the neighborhood i simply would n't go anywhere depression was like a dark blanket i kept on me at all times i hid under it i was constricted by it i defined my entire world by it when i began peeking my head outside a bit more , i would allow myself to take trips i would use these trips as a form of medicine i would n't necessarily think , gosh , i'm feeling pretty down i think i 'll take a quick trip to pakistan , but i would deliberately get out of the house to lift my spirits maybe to a bookstore or a movie maybe to a park usually very late at night when not another soul was awake late night walks can be wonderful for clearing the head , wrestling with moral dilemmas , and working complicated decisions out loud , but they did n't always lift my spirits and the darkness had its limits i could n't , for instance , pull out my sketchbook and draw in the dark for that i needed to embrace the light these days i love going for rides during the day to clear my head , and i especially love exploring new places in nature in the past few years i have discovered capital reef , the temple quarry trail , guardsman pass , antelope island , and other wonderful places within utah it is a transition i am glad i made this week i discovered creekside park creekside park may not be as geologically fascinating as a trip to bryce national park , but there is much to explore there the park is a dedicated frisbee golf course , and large portions of it have been allowed to grow wild to a degree i was really quite taken with it i invite you to check out my photos of the trip i only have an iphone to snap shots with , so they are n't art , but i taught my remaining homeschooled daughter a bit about design , framing , and contrast afterwards , as i drove us home , i mused about how far i had come compared to the miserable hermit i used to be i am very relieved that i learned how to think more positively and live more boldly than i had in the past life is good like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe you might also like adhd nocturnal exercises in thinking positive depression ten ways to fight it off , part twelve things you can do right now to fight off depression depression ten ways to fight it off , part linkwithin
