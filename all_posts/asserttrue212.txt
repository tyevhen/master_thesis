antidepressants of the ssri and snri types are very widely prescribed now , sometimes off label , sometimes for milder depression symptoms , often by family doctors rather than psychiatrists anyone who tries one of these drugs should be alert to possible adverse effects , one of which is that they can make you feel worse rather than better , at least initially , if not longer term all of these drugs now come with a black box warning so called because there 's generally a black outline around the warning , in the printed instructions that come with the medication the one for effexor says antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior suicidality in children , teens , and young adults depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening , suicidality , or unusual changes in behavior effexor xr venlafaxine hci is not approved for use in children and teens some mention age as the upper cutoff for the warning do n't be misled into thinking there 's something magical about a particular age limit the year old brain is not that different from the year old brain it 's important to understand that younger people , because they have less life experience , tend also to have less practice dealing with adversity , and thus have a smaller repertoire of coping skills plus they tend to maximize catastrophize adversity , or at least teens do therefore it 's not surprising that people in younger age groups tend to reach for the suicide button a little quicker than the rest of us in the book i'm writing on mental illness , i devote a chapter to suicide it 's a complicated subject , but one of the main things to understand about it is that , across most cultures , suicide risk increases with age the following graph applies to the u s , but many other countries follow this pattern suicide is also much more of a problem in men than in women china is the only country is which women outperform men here in the u s , men complete three times more suicides than women on a rate per , people basis , with elderly white men particularly at risk but back to the black box warnings it 's not that the young adult brain responds to these drugs ssris , snris in some physiologically unique way rather , it 's that a younger person is more prone to play the suicide card to begin with young people make more suicide attempts than older people but not more completed attempts it 's much more their style of coping , than for older adults a mature adult is likely to consider a range of other options first , before reaching for the suicide button many people in the medical community have argued against the black box warnings , basically alleging that untreated depression is more likely to kill you than taking the meds for more on the controversy , see this psychiatrist 's blog also see this article in the new england journal of medicine the black box warnings are there for a reason , though these drugs can make you feel worse the cochrane collaboration a respected group that specializes in meta analyses did its own review of the literature surrounding the use of antidepressants in young people this is what they found we judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias , with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias , high drop out rates and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes , which were often variously defined across trials overall , there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores and higher rates of response remission than those on placebo however , the size of these effects was small with a reduction in depression symptoms of on a scale from to trials n md confidence interval ci to remission rates increased from per to per for those treated with an antidepressant there was evidence of an increased risk of suicide related outcome for those on antidepressants compared with a placebo trials n rr ci to this equates to an increased risk in a group with a median baseline risk from in to in where rates of adverse events were reported , this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant emphasis added the risk of a reported suicide related outcome increased of course , we ca n't know how many people simply felt worse and did n't report it it 's worth bearing in mind that adverse drug events ades involving psychotropic medications send , people a year to the emergency room , in the u s of that number , , ades involve antidepressants a relatively large n study of antidepressant use in patients aged to in finland found , interestingly , that among antidepressant users relative to non users , suicide attempts went up , but completed suicides went down how are we to interpret this seemingly contradictory result ? it 's not that hard first , the increase in suicide attempts clearly shows that these drugs can make you want to kill yourself but if you reach for the bottle of antidepressant pills as a way to end it , you 're far less likely to kill yourself than if you reached for a gun or decided to hang yourself , or jump from a building and this , indeed , is the explanation offered by the study 's authors comforted ? neither am i it 's not hard to find anecdotal accounts online of people who took an antidepressant and tried to commit suicide perhaps the best known recent case was the death of robin williams , who was taking remeron and seroquel at the time he committed suicide it 's impossible to know for sure if the drugs were causally involved in williams 's death he had just started on seroquel , a week earlier but we do know that the relative incidence of self harm events across all age groups is greater following the prescription of ssris than following the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants , and this , i think , gets to the key issue the newer drugs can sometimes in some people cause depression symptoms to get worse , and it 's not just a phenomenon of young people i'm in the process of finishing an evidence based book on mental illness part science , part memoir please add your name to the mailing list and check
