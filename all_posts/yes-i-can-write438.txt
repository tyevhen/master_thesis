sheila i ca n't for the life of me figure out how to turn a name into a link , if someone can enlighten me , that would be awesome ! , who 's blog is http exploratorylife blogspot com , tagged me to tell six random things about myself , so here goes ! i 've been vegetarian for nearing ten years i hate eating anything that is n't organic , or using products that have nasty chemicals , so i'm always looking for natural options to things i love writing , but rarely manage to write stories more than a page long and even the one page ones are rare ! since i tend to lose interest in stories faster than i should s i think hats and scarves are the most amazing fashion accessories ever invented my sister is my best friend in the entire world finding new music that i like makes me unbelievably happy so , as for who to tag , that 's hard none of the friends i know irl have blogs and many of the blogs i read i feel i do n't really know the authors well enough to tag them so my one tag is stella http notanordinaryteen blogspot com now speaking of scarves being an amazing accessory , here are some pic 's i took of scarves and me ! peace , idzie
