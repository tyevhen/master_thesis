animals are ruining my life have you ever noticed how enthusiastic animals are about morning ? they wake up and start running around making noise for no reason they 're all holy crap ! i'm an animal and it 's really fucking early in the morning and i feel great ! ! ! ! i have n't slept more than hours in a night for over a week now and it 's all because of one stupid bird that lives in a tree right outside my window here 's a really shitty picture i drew of my house and the tree and the bird this arrangement is a problem because i'm nocturnal and i go to bed at am and the bird wakes up three hours later and starts making sounds like a retarded alarm clock because it 's so excited to be a bird the bird wakes up every other animal in the world and then all the animals are like yaaaaaayyyy ! we 're animals and it 's morning ! it is completely unnecessary sometimes i try to yell at them to get them to be quiet , but they 're animals so they do n't listen at all i just end up lying in my bed getting madder and madder at them until i'm not even sleepy anymore and then i get up and make coffee and try to remember to go to the store to buy earplugs but that never happens because i start playing online bingo or something and i forget and pretty soon it 's nighttime and i'm like shit ! i did n't go to the store ! and i go to bed secretly hoping that maybe all the animals will get really depressed and they wo n't feel the need to tell the world about how excited they are , but no the moment there is even one fraction of a ray of sunshine in the sky , the bird is wide awake and ready to party p s it 's saturday , so i figured that i should probably post some spaghatta nadle i only made two because my brain was like mmmmmnnnneeaaaaarggghhhh ! ! ! ! noooooooooo ! and i do n't even know if any of this is making sense because i'm so tired that i'm high i blame animals
