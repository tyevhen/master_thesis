things have turned around over the past few days i'm feeling better i'm less isolative and not so easily overwhelmed i'm gradually working more hours and meeting other obligations i feel like i'm crawling back up among the living i had my second maintenance ect treatment yesterday it went very well i'm questioning whether or not to follow through with the next two scheduled treatments they are scheduled for the next two fridays if things continue to progress , i doubt i will put my body through more ect hopefully , things will continue to progress running is still really tough i'm trying to be patient with myself i'm trying to run or walk everyday and this week i hope to return to the gym for some weight training classes , biking , and or swimming boston is rapidly approaching i 've got to start accumulating some long miles speaking of long miles , i had ten miles scheduled today unfortunately it was very , very cold outside with a stiff , below zero wind i attempted to run outside , but i only made it miles i went to the gym to climb on the treadmill for the final eight wow ! it was tough too tough i have to trust it will get easier if i stick with it it always has in the past it 's nice to be in a position to worry about my running until this week , running was just one more thing this recent bout of depression took from me even though it 's difficult right now , and i'm not in running shape , i'm so grateful for the energy and motivation i'm grateful to be back among the living
