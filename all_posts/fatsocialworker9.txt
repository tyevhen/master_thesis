believe me , i have plenty of other things i could be writing right now finals , for one i could be writing about groups i 've run , counter transference , cognitive behavioral therapy , attachment theory and i 've made an honest effort today , but it 's hard for me to shake what is going on in the world out of my mind it 's times like this that convince me that this empathic streak is a curse rather than a blessing why do i feel mournful rather than jubilant over the death of someone who represents the deaths of thousands and a fearful paradigm shift in our country ? death is death is death is death is death it 's never positive it 's never a victory osama bin laden dying does not bring any closure for me any more than it brings home any troops from overseas bin laden is just another dead body in the war on terror and that 's what upsets me so much the man was n't considered a threat anymore , and his body is simply a symbol of revenge i understand and appreciate and honor that many people do probably feel closure or safer after this event , but i find our collective response troubling pamela gerloff put it best in her huffington post piece titled the psychology of revenge why we should stop celebrating osama bin laden 's death celebrating the killing of any member of our species for example , by chanting usa ! usa ! and singing the star spangled banner outside the white house or jubilantly demonstrating in the streets is a violation of human dignity regardless of the perceived degree of good or evil in any of us , we are all , each of us , human to celebrate the killing of a life , any life , is a failure to honor life 's inherent sanctity plenty of people will argue that osama bin laden did not respect the sanctity of others' lives but i say , so what ? what makes us human is our ability to choose our own behavior more specifically , it is our capacity to return good for evil , love for hate , dignity for indignity while some consider osama bin laden to have been the personification of evil , he was nonetheless a human being here 's where it gets further complicated for me i do n't see how celebrating his death in this manner is doing anything except contributing to the same culture and mindset that led bin laden and all other nationalistic mass murderers to do what they have done and will continue to do until we can , as a society , learn how to become sobered by these experiences and learn how to respect all life , and thus respect all deaths with equal sanctity , these cycles of violence will continue we will find ourselves in the very same position we are today , and it 's not a healthy one we are not a better people with osama bin laden dead , and the events of are not undone we can , however , prevent these kinds of attacks in the future from happening again which i feel would be the real honor and the real way those who have fallen can rest in peace by fostering a world where any and all violence government ordered or not is mourned and all human life is dignified
