my poetry blog now has a brand new layout ! i also decided to change my criteria for what i post on it this message is now on the side of my poetry blog when i first started this blog , i only posted poems i considered to be finished but lately , i 've been writing less , and also being much more critical of my work , and always feeling like my poems need a lot more fixing and fiddling with so in the interest of actually posting more on this blog , i am deciding to forget about what 's polished or not polished what i 'll be posting from now on may be entirely unpolished , may need work , may be unfinished i 'll post bits of poems , lines i may one day turn into a full poem , but i also may not basically , anything poetic i write i'm hoping i 'll actually add posts there regularly now ! p peace , idzie you might also like poetry poetry project musings on poetry snow , shovelling , and poetry linkwithin
