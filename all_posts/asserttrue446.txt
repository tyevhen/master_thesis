recent reports in the literature tell of a huge crisis that has overtaken drug research placebos are becoming more effective , and researchers do n't know what do to about it if placebos are inert , how can they be said to be getting more effective ? the answer is contained in articles like the one by walsh et al that appeared in the april , issue of jama here entitled placebo response in studies of major depression variable , substantial , and growing the authors of this paper did a meta analysis of studies on drug treatments for major depressive disorder mdd that were published between and criteria for inclusion of studies in the meta analysis were papers must have been published in english published between january and december studies primarily composed of outpatients with major depressive disorder not bipolar had at least patients in the placebo group lasted at least weeks randomly assigned patients to receive an antidepressant drug or drugs and placebo and assessed patients under double blind conditions reported the total number of patients assigned to placebo and medication groups as well as the number who had responded to treatment , as determined by a reduction of at least in their score on the hamilton rating scale for depression hrsd and or a clinical global impression cgi rating of markedly or moderately improved cgi score of or the results with regression curves are depicted in the scatter plot shown below the response to placebo in these studies varied from to more than over time , placebo response increased by an average of per decade , going from in to in interestingly , it was n't just placebo response that went up in this time frame drug response went up too , at nearly the same rate as placebo response it should be noted that in of the studies included in the above meta analysis , patients were allowed to take concomitant medications mostly benzodiazepines for insomnia and anxiety throughout the studies this is , unfortunately , a common practice in antidepressant trials and tends to confound results , since sleeping better by itself can swing a person 's hrsd score by points the average hsrd score of patients in the studies was it 's also worth noting that of trials in the above meta analysis allowed for a one to two week placebo run in period , to eliminate placebo responders in this period , subjects are given placebo only anyone who improves on placebo during the run in phase is then removed from the study group it 's a way to skew results in favor of the drug , and reduce placebo scores but it obviously does n't work very well the walsh meta analysis is years old , but more recent studies have found the same results , except that drug response does n't go up as fast as placebo response for example , a report by khan et al found that the average difference between drug and placebo in published antidepressant trials has gone from an average of points on the hrsd in to just points in in the u k , antidepressants are considered not to meet clinical usefulness standards as set by the national institute for health and clinical excellence when there is less than a point hrsd difference between drug and placebo in the well known meta analysis by kirsch et al , it was found that ssris improved the hrsd score of patients by only points more than placebo rising placebo response rates are seen as a crisis in the pharma industry , where psych meds are runaway best sellers , because it impedes approval of new drugs huge amounts of money are on the line in a january paper in the american journal of psychiatry , columbia university 's bret r rutherford and steven p roose try to find explanations for the mysterious rise in placebo response rates the causal factors they came up with are shown below increase placebo response decrease placebo response strength of evidence more study sites fewer study sites strong poor rater blinding good rater blinding strong multiple active treatment arms single active treatment arm strong lower probability of receiving placebo higher probability of receiving placebo strong single baseline rating multiple baseline ratings medium briefer duration of illness in current episode longer duration of illness in current episode medium more study visits fewer study visits medium recruited volunteers self referred patients weak optimistic enthusiastic clinicians pessimistic neutral clinicians weak from rutherford roose , am j psychiatry jan of all the factors discussed by rutherford and roose , the one that has the most potential for explaining the rise in placebo response is the way volunteers are recruited into studies in the s and s , study participants were mostly unpaid inpatients today they 're paid outpatients , recruited via advertising in days past , studies were conducted mostly by universities or research hospitals today it 's almost all outsourced to cros contract research organizations , who attract clientele via web , radio , magazine , and newspaper advertising more often than not , cro study volunteers are people without medical insurance looking to make extra money while getting free medical care to boot most are only too happy to tell doctors whatever they want to hear it 's well known that most drug trials have a hard time getting enough sign ups this is mentioned in ben goodacre 's bad pharma as well as irving kirsch 's the emperor 's new drugs this creates an incentive for initial assessment interviewers to score marginal volunteers e g those who are on the borderline of meeting minimum hsrd scores for depression liberally , to get them into a study that can be enough to degrade signal disastrously , in studies that look for a difference between an antidepressant and a placebo kirsch and others have shown that drug placebo differences are relatively faint and hard to detect in less severely depressed patients , across a large number of different antidepressant types , new and old which brings up a rather embarrassing point if antidepressants were anywhere near as effective as drug companies would have us think , no one should have to squint very hard to distinguish their effects from a placebo the fact that the drug industry has a placebo crisis at all is telling it says the meds we 're talking about are n't powerful at all they 're nothing like , say , insulin for diabetes whatever the underlying causes of the placebo crisis , drug companies consider it very real and very troubling they 're willing as usual to do whatever it takes to make the problem go away and that includes
