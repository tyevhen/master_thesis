as a followup to the last post on the benefits of yoga , the following comes from a reader and fellow anxiety sufferer named bonnie who has used yoga as a great resource to overcoming her anxiety i think my anxiety can be traced back to high school i still believe that kids can be a tough crowd ! however , the one thing i have now that i didn t have back then , is coping skills this past year i took the time to get to know me i had been battling some particularly intense bouts of anxiety and was on my way to downright depression most people believe that stress and anxiety occur with bad situations but that s not always the case sometimes my anxiety came from good things , like going out to the movies with friends or taking a road trip with my husband as time wore on , i began to shut things out of my life like friends and activities that i once enjoyed but now i feel like that person i used to be is a complete stranger i took one year to battle my demons i wanted to see how strong i was along my road to recovery i discovered some amazing things about myself and found relief from unexpected outlets a couple of months into my journey , i found yoga yoga encouraged a stillness in me i had never experienced before when i cried on my yoga mat during class one day , i knew i found what i was looking for by having a steady practice and embracing some yoga philosophies i was able to fight through my panic attacks and anxiety here are some things that helped me along the way that i learned from yoga check your ego at the door a big fear of mine that caused immense anxiety was embarrassing myself in front of people what if i got sick or fainted or said something stupid and people saw that ? i spent more time thinking about what other people thought than what i thought keep your ego away and live how you want to live don t worry about other people because other people rarely worry about you perfection is a letter word trying to do everything perfectly is exhausting and you are constantly plagued by the fear of messing up it doesn t matter in yoga if you do a pose perfectly , all that matters is that you feel bliss when you practice do what you can don t strive for perfection because it doesn t always exist stay present my worries were always focused on something i dreaded in the future i was always concerned with what was going to happen next yoga keeps me still and in the moment and when i am so engulfed in what i am doing , i don t have time or energy to needlessly worry about the future , i am too busy enjoying the present i came very far from where i once was i hardly recognize the person i was a mere year or so ago each step in my journey has been an important one and i ve learned from my experiences i still feel anxious every now and again , but i know i can cope i found freedom in yoga and continue to use the philosophies i ve learned to help guide me along the way i know it s scary , but don t ever give up sometimes you find help in the most unexpected places find your freedom you might also like the benefits of yoga why do you look for the living among the dead ? why having an anxiety disorder does not mean you re crazy a few good stress busters linkwithin
