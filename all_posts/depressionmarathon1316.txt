well , it had to end sometime apparently , suburbanites walk with their heads down , or do n't have holes in their pockets , or have more children roaming the streets because not one lonely penny was waiting for me today during my suburban miler i have to admit , i'm a bit sad the odds finally caught up with me today a new streak , i hope , will start again tomorrow maybe it wo n't involve money but i 'll be looking for something to latch onto because there 's been something more than training occurring here i do n't know what but i'm having fun playing along ! if i ca n't change the world , i 'll change the world within my reach catie curtis
