i mistook a vulture for a raven this morning , high above my garden either because of the hour , or because he was very dark on his underside , i was briefly fooled until his flight pattern became evident vultures are some of the smoothest gliders among birds i watched him , without flapping his wings once , afterwards negotiate the high branches of a eucalyptus , tilting slightly to avoid them , banking eloquently on the thermal when i was manic , which began almost a year ago before my great january crash that put me in the hospital for days , i decided to change my favorite bird , the raven , for the vulture , because vultures clean up the detritus of death and their utility in the chain of nature 's degradation is invaluable life issues in death , whatever we do my father used to say , none of gets out of this alive the parsees , who are zoroastrians , have for over a millennium disposed of their dead amid the towers of silence , where they are quickly consumed by vultures , a practice called dokhmenashini their consecrated ground , in the middle of pricey bombay real estate , has now become an embarrassment , i found out through this link apparently the vultures have been devastated by a virus , and without their consumption of the corpses , a stench has risen in bombay deemed a public nuisance nevertheless the orthodox parsees are resisting any interference in their ancient practice , hoping to raise vultures to replace the flock given that timeline , bombay will continue to reek but i hear the city does n't smell too good to begin with i decided to quit smoking today , but quickly succumbed to the habit , as i had four cigarettes left i ratiocinated that it 's better to quit on a day with no cigarettes , i e tomorrow to quote the bard to morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , creeps in this petty pace from day to day , to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out , out , brief candle ! life 's but a walking shadow , a poor player , that struts and frets his hour upon the stage , and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing coincidentally my father used to recite this speech from time to time , a vestige of his brief career as a thespian in college pretty dark stuff from macbeth i do not wish to embrace this existential void , but in my present state i'm much more comfortable with death than life i 've never really been afraid of death it 's life that scares me not that i intend to do anything about it , but when i examine my habits a lousy diet combined with too many cigarettes and only a daily walk for exercise i see that i'm not caring for myself , that i may be hastening my death in a sort of slow suicide in this i am hardly alone but at present i have the willpower of a mayfly , having little to do and resenting whatever is required of me , or i deem required of me like taking out the trash and paying the bills i'm a minimalist , reading mystery novels and chain smoking , for the most part avoiding human contact , though i am not a misanthrope i'm not in a pure depression , as i'm not suffering weeping spells , but i suffer mightily from indecision and anxiety , not to mention the warring voices in my head , which i know are my own , which avoids the diagnosis of schizophrenia i know all of us are plagued by voices in our head , or sometimes tunes we cannot extirpate from consciousness i 've had just such a tune in my head for several days since i thought of going to a studio and recording a new album , something i have n't done in almost two decades , despite the plethora of songs i 've meanwhile written here 's a link to the tune , act like a man it 's a solo acoustic version for which the original title was killing the goddess its beat drums in my head if i go to the studio i will fill it out with harmonies and a bass line and drums and the rest if you listen to it , i hope you will not be haunted by it as i am if i had to summarize my present diagnosis , i'm a nutcase in interactions with others , or even posting here , i can pass for normal , just as ted bundy did so well , though i do n't consider myself a republican , as he did not that i have it in me to be a serial killer , if you discount my drowning raisin bran with milk all for today , ce
