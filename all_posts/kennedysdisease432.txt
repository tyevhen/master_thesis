dr peter saul presented this topic at a ted conference an insightful thirteen minute video link https www ted com talks peter saul let s talk about dying html this is not a pleasant subject , but a necessary one especially for those of us baby boomers i find it is a topic that my brothers and sisters all older than me but one talk about in a roundabout way , but never really get serious about it dr saul said that about in people believe they are immortal of course , no one is and everyone that is an adult today will die within this century he comments that there is no such thing as saving lives doctors can only prolong life people always think there is time to talk about planning for a person 's death only about in a has a plan only about in has a plan about their actual care and treatment should they become terminally ill dr saul believes it us important how we die because how we die lives on in the minds of those that survive us the stress that is caused when a person dies in intensive care is about seven times greater for the family than when a person dies anywhere else unfortunately , about in of us in the u s will die in an intensive care unit the four ways we will die sudden death becoming very rare terminal illness becoming more rare and mostly only to younger people organ failure growing rapidly hearts , lungs , kidneys , etc dwindling capacity with increasing frailty about out of will die because of this an inevitable part of the aging process respecting patient choices educating the patients and their family about developing their death wishes why ca n't we have these kinds of conversations with our loved ones ? dr saul s proposition here is what we can do now to insure we are more prepared ask two questions in the event you can no longer speak for yourself , who would you like to speak for you ? have you spoken to that person about what is important to you ? consider adopting the slogan , my death my way this was not a pitch for euthanasia this is a way to regain some control of how you will die dr saunders who founded the hospice movement had the following quote you matter because you are you , and you matter to the last moment of your life
