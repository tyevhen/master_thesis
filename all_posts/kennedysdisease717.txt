but they sure aren t any fun these days thr rapid progression loss of strength is rather scary early last week my legs started giving indications of a slide for the next four days strength and capabilities diminished by saturday i was not a happy camper i should know better because i have been through more than a few of these battles over the last years , but i still think the worst for a day or two saturday afternoon i had enough of the wallowing in frustration and took an accounting of what might have got me here even though i exercise several times every day , over the last few weeks i often spent four to six hours just sitting i realized this was not my normal routine so , sitting on the throne that afternoon , i decided to change my modus operandi every two to three hours i was going to stand up and perform a couple of short exercises three times that day seemed to make a difference the next morning six times yesterday felt even better i could tell i was on my way back i m not back , but today i feel back to normal i believe henry ford said , if you always do what you ve always done , you ll always get what you ve always got this also holds true in my personal life if i don t like the results , i need to do something different photo giant bomb
