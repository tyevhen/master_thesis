it 's called dojod try this test page on my machine , firefox will load that page in seconds , which is about billion clock cycles too many , for my taste but internet explorer locks up for a full seconds consistently , every time when trying to load the page i'm happy to see ie users brutally punished in this fashion , of course but honestly , this has to be some kind of sick , sick joke , right ?
