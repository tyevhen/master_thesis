previously , we discussed the question of do carbs make you crazy ? , reviewed some literature to suggest that a bolus of sugar to a fasting person could certainly make some people crazy or at least rather rotten tempered , and yet mit researchers suggest the same carby bolus will keep people sane with a nice happy squirt of serotonin personally i think the mit advice to snack on marshmallows and pretzels for serenity 's sake to be misguided , whereas i agree with the wise orthomolecular doctor from new york who told the young mr ellsberg , suffering from insomnia , grandiosity , and bouts of suicidal depression , to cut out the coffee , alcohol , and sugar already music beastie boys santigold do n't play no games that i ca n't win right click in new tab we all agreed , i think , in the comments of the previous posts , that these studies are weakened by some lack of accounting for confounders nutritional status , alcohol , sleep , insulin resistance , etc etc etc etc , and of course one can never just change carbohydrates one has to alter another variable and of course i think inflammation and industrial food and micronutrient deficiencies cause or increase insulin resistance and violence and depression so when one just examines blood glucose level and mood state , one is missing the electrified third rail , so to speak and i have to say , the state of the literature ai n't that great among papers i read for this series , there was one great review paper everything else was rather distractingly haphazard and so we go to two more papers thanks to jamie scott , jackie , ambimorph , and zooko for helping me with the paper chase ! daily negative mood affects fasting glucose in type diabetes and the impact of eating behavior on psychological symptoms typical of long title it 's about pcos and blood glucose and mood the first paper is about a study following people who kept daily food diaries , morning fasting blood sugar measurements , and daily mood records for days what is nice about this study is that the participants were phoned every night to get the data for that day they were also paid for the first week , for the second week , and for the third week , so motivation to keep up with the information gathering was pretty good after gathering all the data , there was really only one major finding there were no real significant correlations between meals , daily mood , and blood glucose except if you had a crappy mood one day , you were more likely to have a higher fasting glucose on the morning of the next day this makes sense if a crappy mood coincides with cortisol increasing , worsening glucose control that is reflected in the next morning 's fasting glucose it does n't seem to say much about a correlation between carbohydrates and mood in diabetics there was no relationship between glucose level on day one , for example , and mood on day two the second paper with the exhausting title is a little more interesting well , sort of this study looked at women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos known to coincide with insulin resistance , reactive hypoglycemia symptoms , mood , and diet pcos affects of women , and between of women with pcos particularly the lean ones have symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia that is , they have a sugar crash feeling about minutes after a high carb meal in this study , women with pcos , controls , self reported women with symptoms of pcos , and men filled out an online survey interestingly , of the pcos group reported having binge and or comfort eating compared with of the control women more of the pcos women were also reporting being on a low gi diet presumably at the advice of their doctors or nutritionists to help control pcos symptoms of the participants , were on no medicines , were on contraception , were on psych meds , were on metformin , and were on other meds typically vitamins or allergy meds reported psychiatric issues usually anxiety or depression , and reported insulin resistance the pcos group was more likely than the controls to have mood or behavioral issues and to have reactive hypoglycemia symptoms in a subset of the study , women with pcos were matched with healthy controls the women with pcos were , again , significantly more likely to have reactive hypoglycemia symptoms women with pcos were more likely to have less energy , more tension , less happiness , and more behavioral symptoms associated with hypoglycemia these differences remained significant after controlling for age , bmi , and eating behavior so what do we find ? women with poor glucose control have , well , poor glucose control , and they have moods and fatigue to match , though underlying inflammation and hormonal badness could cause all of the above and , not surprisingly , women with poor glucose control have more bingeing and emotional eating again , perhaps a symptom and a cause wrapped all in one there were not enough folks on the low gi diet to make any intelligible statistical conclusions here 's my conclusion if you have pcos or type ii diabetes , do not eat grams of carbohydrate a day do n't do it keep it low , keep it nutrient rich , keep it basic happy natural food i'm guessing your moodiness and your glucose control will improve my idea of nutrient rich and the usda 's idea of nutrient rich are rather different i think bone marrow and grassfed beef liver are nutrient rich they prefer skim milk and whole grains you do the math
