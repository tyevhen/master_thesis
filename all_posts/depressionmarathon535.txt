i survived my first day of work yesterday it was stressful and overwhelming , but i was expecting that i think it helped to expect it i certainly was n't surprised , but i was n't comfortable either it 's going to take me awhile to get into the swing of things i spent much of the day trying to absorb all of the new documentation the documentation is almost all computerized , which is nice , but they do n't use any programs i 've previously used it 's going to take a bit to familiarize myself with all of it fortunately , i got to do one patient evaluation , so i was able to play around with the documentation at the end of the day that helped ease my stress slightly i learn best by getting my hands dirty tomorrow i 'll only be there for half the day i have to attend the human resources orientation at another location in the afternoon i'm glad it 's going to be a shorter day i can only handle so much of being overwhelmed before my head begins to ache despite the stress of beginning a new position , i am hopeful that this will be a good fit my colleagues were all pleasant and fun to associate with the facility 's environment , cleanliness , and surroundings are all a step above the facility i just left and most hopeful of all , everyone i met was polite , welcoming , and supportive that will certainly be a nice change ! in other news , i am just over one week away from my next marathon challenge i 've had a good week of running thus far , so i'm feeling hopeful about my prospect for success next saturday i had a very good mile tempo run today on another gorgeous minnesota day if the weather will cooperate on marathon day , i think i should do okay of course , that is the beauty of the marathon you can only control so much , and you just never know what will happen all i can do is prepare to the best of my ability and pray for the best outcome in that respect , it 's not much different than embarking on a new job , is it ?
