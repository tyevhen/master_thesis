the other day , i wrote about the extraordinary amount of evidence going back almost years linking calorie restriction cr to increased longevity the effect has been seen in every species of organism tested , from yeast to worms to flies to rodents to primates organisms that eat ad libitum as much as they like tend to live shorter lives than their peers who are calorie restricted the effect is dramatic the average lifespan of rodents can be nearly doubled by cutting daily calorie intake to a level just above starvation evidence for the cr effect in humans tends to take the form of data showing the life shortening effect of obesity graphs that make the effect clear are available in body mass index and cause specific mortality in adults collaborative analyses of prospective studies the lancet , volume , issue , march april , pages one such graph is shown below kaplan meier age versus survival curves for people of various body mass index bmi classes , based on data for , western europeans and north american adults from the lancet , volume , issue , march april , pages what this graph shows , first of all , is that survival rates go down as body mass index goes up to find your own bmi , consult the chart below if you are morbidly obese bmi of or more , indicating that your actual weight is twice your ideal weight , half of your peers are dead by age if your bmi is to , only of your peers are dead by age interestingly , while there is obviously some lengthening of maximum lifespan with lower bmi , it 's only on the order of for the range of bmis studied at a bmi of to , you still have a chance of living well into your s , though not much of one the oldest fat person is roughly as old as the oldest thin person , but a really old fat person is a rarity certainly that accords with everyday observation you do n't see many fat year olds in real life click to enlarge still , it 's odd how all the curves bunch up at years max lifespan this is at odds with for example the rodent data , which show vastly different endpoints for the cr survival curves it could simply be that we 're looking at two different things the rodent data reflect calorie restriction , whereas for humans we 're looking at body mass index , and a low bmi does n't necessarily imply cr in human populations , variations in bmi could just as easily imply variations in the amount of exercise , or it could simply relate to genetics some people have the fat gene , others do n't in all of the rodent studies , individuals were selected from a common gene pool variations in metabolism were thus slight with the large , heterogeneous human populations involved in the lancet study , there were are undoubtedly huge genetic variations it could also be that there 's a brick wall effect at around years because of some unavoidable buildup of some toxic something in the human body that happens after years of living the possibilities here are many on the other hand , rather than toxic something buildup , we could be looking at something as simple as telomere shortening the lancet study graph does n't show curves for bmis lower than , yet we know that is quite far from starvation the current consensus is that starvation onset corresponds , roughly , to a bmi of in one of the most heavily studied blue zone populations , namely the native okinawans , bmis tend to run from to oddly , though , even the okinawans seldom live past , and centenarians number only per , people about twice the rate of france so even in blue zones , there seems to be a kind of brick wall effect at around to years of age in any case , one thing is certain if you want to increase your odds of living to a ripe old age , keep your bmi as low as possible but no lower than you do n't have to exercise more you just have to eat less and eat smart avoid animal fat and avoid inflammatory foods and if all else fails ? move to okinawa
