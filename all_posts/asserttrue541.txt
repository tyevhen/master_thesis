my love hate relationship with firefox is slowly shifting toward mostly hate one reason about every to days , i get a sudden crash where firefox disappears except for the above dialog sometimes the details button does n't work making me wonder if mozilla will even get the crash report after all clearly , in a situation like this , firefox is crashing after an unchecked error otherwise why does mozilla need a complete crash report ? why not just get the error code ? answer there is no error code the program does n't know why it quit my strong suspicion is that ajax intensive sites like gmail and twitter are running the program out of memory constant client server ajax chatter from endless polling is an invitation to memory leakage plus see this post someday i 'll switch to chrome , but the way i work now is , i use firefox for business related browsing and chrome for personal surfing i like keeping them separate i 'll continue to use firefox until the sad day comes when we part company forever at that point , maybe i 'll send flowers and a short , poignant good bye note never to be seen again
