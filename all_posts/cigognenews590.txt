i have two advanced degrees in the field of mental health despite about years of university i learned almost nothing about how to do therapy it was always hit and miss , never a science it was do what you feel comfortable with , which is a license to do terrible stuff since neurotics are comfortable with neurotic goals and neurotic techniques witness cognitive therapy , intellectuality raised to the level of a principle head lucubrations converted to a theory the training was useless and meaningless and could help no one why ? because it was not and never was a science with testable hypotheses that one could suss out and discover things that would enhance our techniques i was also trained , a residency , at the freudian clinic of the west , a sort of meningers on the west coast also useless i never learned a single scientific principle , nor how to put the therapy to the scientific test the reason was there was no science and still is not except , primal therapy when i do training all of my advance therapists know the minute a mistake is made it is that precise and we do training in science as well so that we are all aware of the scientific method our training never stops it goes on for years because there is so much to learn we have done several double blind studies in europe on our patients and what did i discover ? no one cares it is the syndrome , i won t believe it even if you prove it is this sour grapes ? maybe , but when trying for research funds we are always turned away as unscientific our patients are always our scientific subjects we do vital signs before and after each session i have written earlier on my blog about their importance we have studied the immune system , the brain function , the inhibitory serotonin system , and on and on see primal healing for a discussion of all this but for those shrinks who are left brain the greatest voyage they are ever going to make is to the right brain , and alas , they cannot do it no one can do it voluntarily we need to open the gates between the hemispheres and that takes time and serious scientific therapy we try to make sure that our therapy coincides with current physiology and neurology you will see that i write a lot about that because we cannot concoct a psychotherapy that flies in the face of how the brain works for example , believing that ideas change feelings , when it is just the opposite that is true we have spent something like one million dollars in scientific pursuits , often using outsiders who have no idea what we do but i am convinced that you cannot prove our therapy but these facts alone it has to hit you in the gut and who does it hit there ? those who suffer those who are close to feelings those who cannot make it , who are constantly depressed and anxious they understand my theory right away and come from countries for the therapy i am not sure i would read a book by a curly haired shrink and travel , miles for help but they do and they get help they do not care about statistics they care about their feelings and their misery we are the therapy of last resort , a therapy of misery where patients can finally let their misery out almost every single therapy extant works to push back feelings isn t that strange ? feelings need to be expressed and they push them down the result is more depression and anxiety , more not getting along with others , more dysfunction and later , more serious disease and worse , they have the statistics to prove their case because it is all in the definition of what is success and if they say better social adjustment and self described feeling better , then you cannot beat that because nothing is as infinite as self deception
