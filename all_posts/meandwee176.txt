hi there ! i 've been plugging away and continuing to work on my illustrations and preparations for the new things for my shop i'm thinking i 'll be ready to launch everything by early next week if not sooner yay ! there 's a lot of little details to work out how to use a label printer , how to better keep track of accounting , which paper is best for printing , which labels work for what i want to do , how to paint the way i want in photoshop these are just a few of the issues i 've been researching and tackling head on things are going well , though , and i'm so excited to share the first print with you paige loves blue birdies so , i was inspired to create a little print involving them i wanted to illustrate them with some sort of clothing on , and i just had this image in my mind of these animals as little vintage ladies having tea together it was so fun to draw ! they seemed to come to life instantly when i put my pencil to the paper i wonder what they are chatting about get it here the series of prints i 've been working on personify animals showing them in different scenarios that humans might find themselves in i really enjoy drawing different critters and i 've been having such a great time thinking up different situations for them to be wrapped up in my process is simple in the teatime print , for example , i drew them first in my sketchbook once i was happy with the idea for the layout and how i wanted the birds to look , i used tracing paper to put them into a final drawing i then brought that into photoshop and carefully painted the color digitally i made sure to make the vibrant colors a bit more muted with a white tint to give them a slight vintage quality this softened them a bit i'm happy with the effect i am so thrilled each time a print comes off the printer and comes to life their whimsical quality make them the perfect affordable artwork for a nursery or child 's room i even like them as artwork in my office space ! my mom mentioned she could envision this particular print hanging in the kitchen i like to think they are great for the young and young at heart hopefully you like them too ! i 'll continue to post about each print this week to show you them all i'm so nervous and feel vulnerable , but here 's to being brave ! as usual in the internet world , please no stealing these images to use as your own thanks ! save
