my favorite part of this little family movie vlog is how paige shows everything she packed in her purse she 's never used her purse before and she was so excited to go on this little excursion , she got it out and packed it with her essentials it 's funny to hear her explanations about what 's in my bag i'm sad that she will be six in april time is going too fast ! but , i have to say she is so fun to be with and she says the funniest things love that kiddo save you might also like an interview with paige part baby 's first haircut baby 's first haircut the noah edition linkwithin
