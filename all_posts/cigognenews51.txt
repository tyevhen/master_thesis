i have been wondering why it is that battle in combat did not seem to make me neurotic while seemingly innocuous events during home life did i think i found one answer that old devil need raises its ugly head what happened early in life when need was at its asymptote , our system made sure that even banal events were embedded in our nervous system when we needed holding and touch in the first months of life to mollify the appearance of agonizing pain , we found ways to encase the pain defensesand made the pain bearable when love went missing it seems that it is not like i need a piece of cake every afternoon rather it is something essential to life and development it is part of our biologic development that goes missing need is basic to fulfillment they form an equation and when that equation is unbalanced we become so , as well it is not just what goes into the mouth it is what enters the whole system it is like touch it is not what we feel on our cheeks it is what that does to the whole system the warmth , the caring and love a ruffling of the child s hair can carry with it a note you are loved , appreciated and wanted a mussing up of hair carries a biologic message that says so much you are wanted , i feel close to you and want to be near you one touch contains pages of monologue without any verbal discussion touch is the message without words but words without touch dilutes and vitiates that message into a loss of meaning words without feeling do not travel to the feeling centers the actual message is lost and we are left with vacuous meaning that has lost its power to move others it can no longer convey love it becomes an empty vessel with no place to land one then lives on a barren island bereft of meaning and above all , bereft of love combat is not based on biologic need quite the opposite it is what happens then there is no chance for it so a slap on my face at age five conveyed a new message you are not loved there is need to afraid do not look to me for understanding and compassion beware ! you must obey without question and you slip into obedience as a normal thing you no longer expect kindness , just the lack of rage there is a new normal in life the lack of anger and the lack of danger no needing love needing just to avoid menace and threat
