via hitshrink two feet of snow and baltimore comes to a screeching halt how to get the doctors to the hospital ? this is where telepsychiatry can be very helpful however , there are still so many impediments to using telemedicine billing , liability , documentation , technical that we are still unable to use it when we need it like today , where the hospital will have to send a x to pick up dr chandran to get him to the hospital a broader term for distance mental health services is telemental health services , or tmh proposed new regulations were released last week that would permit and regulate tmh under the public mental health system aka medicaid in maryland unfortunately , the way it is currently written would not permit me to see inpatients on our unit from home during a blizzard still , it is a step in the right direction for more info on tmh , check out the maryland telemental health website
