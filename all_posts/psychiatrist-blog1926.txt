posted by dinah i contemplated putting up a post about the most embarrassing questions patients have ever asked , but honestly , i'm too embarrassed to repeat the worst one and no , i did n't answer and i'm not someone who is easily mortified i will readily admit that i did once show up in clinic wearing my dress inside out , and yes , it was obvious so recently , a colleague insisted i was in training with him i was n't , in fact , i finished years after he did , and it occurred to me that he thinks i'm years older then i am clink says it is n't so thank you , clink this still would n't make me as old as meryl streep , whom i look nothing like , but we do n't have to go there today the day after my time warp with my previously esteemed colleague , i saw a patient i had n't seen in a few months he has a persistent mental illness which limits his life in many respects he is always pleasant , but always answers my questions with a simple yes , no , fine , okay he offers little else and i 've been unable to learn much about him , though he 's seen me in the clinic for many years now so i asked my patient , as i often do , do you have any questions for me ? on this particular day , he asked , how old are you ? well , this was a rather sensitive topic given the weird insight the day before that i could be mistaken for someone years older then i am i responded , how old do you think i am ? please do n't tell my former supervisors this , they 'll revoke my boards certification whew he aged me a few years younger than i am i answered his question at this point , why not ? and then he asked , do you believe in god ? okay , i did n't care if he knew how old i was , but enough is enough i told the story to clink , and she responded with one of her own so in my clinic this afternoon my inmate patient said to me , oh , you 're doing lord of the rings today huh ? i said your dress , he said it 's like what the elves wore in that movie oh , not knowing what the heck i should say to that then i started thinking yeah , yeah i could get confused with liv tyler sure , it could happen at least he was commenting on the dress and not my ears and , roy , what do your patients say about you ? p s i ca n't wait for fat doctor 's stories
