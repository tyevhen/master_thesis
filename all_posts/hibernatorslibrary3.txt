against the tide , by tui t sutherland this is the fifth book in spirit animals , a middle grade fantasy series imagined by brandon mull it continues the story of the four kids who have been paired to the four fallen great beasts rather than to a normal spirit animal i wo n't say more , for fear of spoilers for earlier in the series cute book i like the way this series is written by different authors for each book , because it introduces me to new authors this one was quite enjoyable i got a couple of good laughs , and it was hard putting this short book down
