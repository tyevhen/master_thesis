in his book , life changing foods , anthony william writes about the confusion about inflamtion and auto immune disease some understabd this o mean the body is attacking itself the term autoimmune is is a mistake in greek , auto , 'means 'self so the word is that your immune system is attacking your own self truth is , the body never attacks itself it attacks pathogens because the immune system is going after an invader such as a virus , or other herpetic viruses or in some cases certain bacteria when inflamation is n't the result of an injury , it is also the result of a pathogenic invader for example , in colitis , the shingles virus burrows deep into the lining of the colon , which prompts the immune system to try and fend off the microorganisms triggers for autoimmune disease are direct fuel to viruses already present in a person 's system any antibody activity is your immune system actively attacking a pathogen , not your own body
