the sleep doc thinks i likely have sleep apnea , as i apparently have a narrower than normal airway who knew ? as a result , i am scheduled for the full blown overnight sleep evaluation this wednesday night should be loads of fun hopefully , i 'll be able to sleep the prospect of having sleep apnea is n't appealing , yet it could be a very good thing as i said to the doctor , if i have to wear a c pap machine every night i might as well resign myself to a life of single dom right now ! on the other hand , if this year bout of fatigue is the result of apnea a totally fixable problem the possibilities of the future are very exciting ! i ca n't even imagine what life may feel like without my leaden cloak once again , i find i need to stay in the moment rather than predict or plan for the future i get no benefit out of worrying i get no benefit out of hoping either way , i set myself up for discouragement and disappointment i guess i 'll just pray for sleep , accurate data , and the willingness to accept whatever comes my way
