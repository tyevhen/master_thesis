year throwback i miss you grandma ! this week was n't as eventful as last week i started working with my boss to have a smooth transition out though i'm leaving him in a tight spot , so the transition wo n't be much easier than if i strolled out in the middle of the day and never came back i caught the stomach flu from my sister and was sick a couple of days spent a nice olive garden dinner with a friend , and that 's about it ! posts wild swans , by jung chang the rolling stones , by robert a heinlein the time machine , by h g wells the reluctant romantic challenge currently reading books completed watched nothing ! acquired
