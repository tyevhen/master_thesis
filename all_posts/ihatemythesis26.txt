sometimes , a grad student needs to take a break from the hard work of procrastinating and enjoy a good beer in a pretty place or , in my case , take a photo of a nice beer in a nice place this photo illustrates one of my many definitions of heaven is n't it nice ? it makes me happy just looking at it but it made me happier when i drank the beer ps kudos to those who can correctly guess the type of beer i was drinking ps i think the choice of beer i e , not schlitz or naddy light separates grad students from the common undergrad ps not to brag , but i really outdid myself on this photo three cheers for my camera phone ! ps i apologize for bragging in ps
