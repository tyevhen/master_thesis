its not a new year , but it feels like today is a fresh start , a clean slate its a very hopeful feeling i think its because i am finally starting to feel better , and work is finally calmed down a bit instead of working like a dog i am planning for the next time i will have to work like a dog also my birthday is coming up and that is in the back of my thoughts , so i guess it is almost a new year in some way today i got a magazine subscription offer that i would normally turn down , but it was sent from my little nephew in ohio in his little kid handwriting to help him raise money for his school how can you turn down that ? so i am going to order women 's health and i am excited about it ok so to go along with this great feeling that i have today , i want to share with you one of the most inspirational videos i have ever seen every time i see this video it makes me cry , but it has an amazing message this is a video of a father and son team that runs triathlons to learn more about team hoyt , you can visit their website here the message that i take from this video besides the amazing father this boy has and how special we are all as individuals , is that no matter what you are going through , having a support person be family or friend can help take you to the places where you may not be able to go alone i am blessed to have my spouse that is always helping me to feel loved and appreciated just the way i am i have one or two good friends that will listen to me no mater how silly my thoughts may sound out loud and i also have all of my online friends that share lessons learned and valuable insight to life as cheesy at it may sound , all these supporters bring me higher and closer to reaching my goals than i could ever do alone if you feel all alone in your anxiety or panic attacks , you can stop here anytime for some support if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like celebrate need a little faith and motivation ? personal bill of rights my story linkwithin
