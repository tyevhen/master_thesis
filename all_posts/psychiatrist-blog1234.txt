this is another one of my hypothetical questions so you 're a health care professional if you 're not , pretend and you 're on vacation far , far away but before you left , you arranged for someone to cover your practice and you gave the covering doc an emergency number why ? why not you 're getting some much needed rest and relaxation you 've left work behind and it feels so good not to worry about other people but back home , something bad has happened to one of your patients if you 're a primary care doc , perhaps someone had an unexpected and fatal heart attack if you 're a shrink , may be a patient committed suicide whatever it is , it 's awful , and it 's done there 's nothing you can do now that would change the outcome do you want to know before you return home ? and if you 're the covering doc , do you call ? after all , you were given that emergency number i 've never fully come to peace with this one many years ago , i got a call on vacation that one of my patients had died in a car accident it haunted me and there was nothing i could do i called the mom from my trip , but i had no relationship with the parent , my call seemed to offer no comfort after that , i went for a time leaving my cell phone home and being inaccessible while away this is what coverage is for at some point , i started to realize that i 'd return and get anxious as i turned the phone back on what bad news would i hear ? might it be better to have the phone with me , to keep it mostly off , but to know that no news is good news ?
