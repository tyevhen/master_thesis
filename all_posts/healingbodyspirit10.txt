i believe in god not because someone told me but because i have experienced his love tender mercy in my own life after five years of feeling like i had the drop dead flu and my debilitating battle with chronic fatigue , i finally recovered and then shortly after that found out i had liver cancer small growth , but it was there i knew , and my medical doctor knew i could not do chemotherapy you can read about my recovery from chronic fatigue at http irecoverdfromchronicfatigueandfibro blogspot com after my diagnosis of liver cancer , i thought i was going to die and decided i would spend the rest of my life writing letters to our children and doing genealogy it was while i was at a church family history center where i had gone to sign up to do family history , that i noticed a large portrait of the savior hanging in the foyer seeking peace , i was attracted to the portrait and his image there was no one else around so i paused to look into his eyes in the portrait thinking i was going to die it was then i heard a voice within me his voice call me by name and say , you are going to be okay that was years ago it brought me great peace and i was okay
