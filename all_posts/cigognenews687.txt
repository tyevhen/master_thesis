having feelings and expressing them are two different animals and i choose those words carefully because having feelings means having access to the feeling structures of the limbic system in the brain expressing feelings means access to the thinking neocortex the only time expressing feelings is important is if the state of having feelings precedes the expression of them then the comprehension is an evolutionary outgrowth of those feelings unfortunately , when i was doing insight psychoanalytic therapy i thought that expressing feelings in a session was tantamount to having them not the case in fact , too often expressing feelings can act as a defense against experiencing them smothering feelings in a flurry of abstract ideas when i say it is two different animals , it literally is the primate monkey feeling brain versus the human thinking one animals feel even when they have no means to expressing them i have been writing about this for the last forty years , and just now , new research is coming to the fore to verify this early on i posited the notion that one aspect of expressing feelings was the proper connection between the right and left brain hemispheres now it turns out that this is basically true see science daily , may , why are some people unable to express their emotions italian investigators have found that there is a deficit in interhemispheric transfer with those who cannot express their feelings what that means is that the feelings lying on the right lower brain do not make the trip across the corpus callosum where emotional information is transferred from one side to the other to the left understanding , comprehending verbal side since eighty percent of all emotional information cross the corpus callosum from one side to the other , it seems logical that there is one key locus for the problem of alexithymia , or the inability to express emotions it seems obvious now that for help in expressing true feelings one needs access to right side lower brain sites it does not help to engage oneself in a therapy that is primarily intellectual an interaction through the realm of ideas expressing feelings in words is not feeling those feelings one can express feelings precisely but cannot necessarily feel them what is required is a therapist who has access to her feelings and who can know when someone has access or not so we need a therapy of feeling one that takes feelings into account , and just as important , a psychological theory based on need what seems to be the problem is a dysfunctional cortical frontal limbic circuits in particular , the orbitofrontal area as i have written elsewhere the right orbitofrontal area behind the orbits of the eye contains a map of our emotional life and emotional history it is internally oriented the left , on the other hand , is externally focused it is interesting that panic attacks often accompany this condition alexithymia these attacks usually emanate from deep in the brain the brain stem and are associated with trauma in the first few months of gestation a new study brain s gray cells appear to be changed by trauma of major events science daily june , indicates something i have maintained for decades this suggests that really bad experiences may have lasting effects on the brain i believe that the earlier the trauma , especially during gestation the more widespread and long lasting the effects it seems that the set points for many physiologic functions are established in gestational life these dislocations of function remain fixed and unalterable whereas trauma after birth can often be compensated for in short , there is a permanent deficit in gray matter when traumas occur while we are being carried in the womb we can t get well just expressing our feelings we can only get well by experiencing them
