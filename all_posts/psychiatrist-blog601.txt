in yesterday 's post on e prescribing , the issue of patient confidentiality came up in the context of doctors being able to see a patient 's full medication history in an electronic program , and one commenter brought up that she does n't necessarily want to tell her shrink about a yeast infection , perhaps because she finds it embarrassing the writer of the post , a guest blogger , suggested that this might lead to useful information that should be addressed in therapy , for example the patient 's sexual life years ago , i remember being a bit taken back when a patient brought up some rather problematic to him sexual issues in his marriage it was n't the nature of the issues that surprised me i spent more than a decade consulting to a sexual behaviors unit and i spent several months of residency training on an inpatient sexual disorders unit it takes a lot to shock me what surprised me was that this was the first i was hearing about this issue after seeing the patient for years of psychotherapy he had a secret life there 's not really much to do about this one can only help people with the things they bring forward as problems , and we do n't , as one commenter pointed out , get notified by the bars every time a patient drinks , or does n't exercise , or begins yet another dysfunctional relationship , or surfs over to a porn website oh , and i am so glad when it comes to hiding medications , or treatments , then perhaps that 's different is it okay for a patient to see one doctor for a xanax prescription , and if he 's not happy with the dose , to see another doctor for more xanax ? if he 's not selling it , i do n't think this is illegal , but we 'd meaning docs all agree that this is wrong , that the patient is deceiving us , and would n't prescribe to someone doing such things is it okay for a patient to hide the fact that he has aids , a condition with known psychiatric complications , from his psychiatrist ? we might say that if we 're not aware of the medications a patient is taking , then we ca n't be liable for the interactions , but please in therapy it 's not just about the fears of lawsuits between strangers , it 's also about not wanting to see your patient get sick for completely preventable reasons so where is the line ? is it okay to hide manic behaviors from a psychiatrist it 's none of his damn business if i wanted to sleep with gorgeous women last night and buy them all diamond rings ! is the psychiatrist entitled to know every behavioral transgression ? that he 's worth millions when he 's getting a discounted fee from the shrink ? that mom thinks he 's getting sick again ? every fantasy that pops into his head ? is it okay to withhold your dreams from your psychoanalyst ? i wo n't go on you tell me where the exact line is i have no idea
