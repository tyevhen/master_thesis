just when i thought that prior authorization could not get any worse , i see a fax with that headline i guess the business geniuses who thought it was a good idea to send me that fax never stopped to consider what was wrong with that idea what could that possibly be ? let me see , i have made several comprehensive assessments of a medical and psychiatric disorder that is extremely complicated , selected a medication that was seen as appropriate by medical consultants treating another major medical problem , did all of the medical screening for this particular medication including a meticulous search for drug interactions across different data bases , thoroughly assessed the patient for side effects and complications from this particular medication and stabilized the patient on that medication i also had a detailed informed consent discussion with the patient for this medication and not a general class of medications remind me why my patient is unable to start the medication oh that 's right your patient is unable to start your prescription because we want you to prescribe the cheapest drug or the drug that will get us the biggest kickback from the pharmacy and that is why we are ignoring the fact that you have prescribed a generic drug and we think that all drugs in any general class of medications can be substituted for one another and of course we don't really care about the time and effort expended in the evaluation and treatment of this patient and the fact that it was specific to the drug you prescribed and we don't really care about what happens to this patient because we are in the business of making money and we have no personal responsibility to this person and yes you work for us and you work for free in order for us to be able to do this that simple word phrase says everything about how medical care in this country has been corrupted for the enrichment of companies that make money by denying or interfering with care that has been carefully prescribed for patients by the doctors who know them the best a serious rewrite is needed for their fax cover sheet george dawson , md , dfapa
