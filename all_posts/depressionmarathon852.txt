it 's funny when things are going well , i do n't feel i have much to write about it 's the same way with my art i do n't create anything worthwhile when i'm doing fine i think my creative brain works much better when i feel like crap is that weird ? so i'm not sure what to say today i figure you 've got to be bored with all the triathlon training puck has n't changed not much to say about him the new job is still a few weeks away , so there 's nothing to report on that front my life is rolling along not too fast , not too slow it feels just about right , and i'm feeling quite the same que the sappy , little house on the prairie music now that being said , here 's the latest scoop i'm sitting here drinking my coffee contemplating my day i'm feeling yesterday 's hour workout in which i swam yards , hopped , ran , and panted through the strength circuit , pushed and pulled through resistance training , and finally grunted out the abdominal circuit boy was i tired afterward ! i could barely keep my eyes open once i returned home after napping , i did accomplish some ancient items on my to do list laundry , vacuuming , and even washing my floors are now crossed off it 's nice to be sitting in a relatively clean house this morning it even seems as if my coffee tastes better today i 've got a minute bike ride followed by a minute run it 's called a brick workout i'm hoping it warms up enough to take my tri bike out and ride on some real roads the sun is coming up and the sky is clear , so things are looking good right now other than that , i 'll have a fairly routine sunday i'm expecting a friend to come over to bid on a new patio for the backyard i 'd like to build a very low to the ground wooden deck out there i hope i can afford whatever price he provides i'm still waiting on rebuilding my basement i 've been waiting for more than two years ! every time i think i have someone lined up , they do n't show up it 's been frustrating trying to get someone in here to do the work for a reasonable price at this point , i 'd offer the work to anyone who could get it done ! after all , my exercise room will be down there ! hopefully , things will come together now that spring is on the way speaking of spring , the sun is now shining warmly on my face i 'd better finish my coffee and get going have a great day !
