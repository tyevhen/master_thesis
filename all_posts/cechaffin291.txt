it is a week since i started on the expensive tablet day that my wife insisted we buy , contrary to my best depressive judgment i can honestly say before god and man and the devil that i have n't been depressed in a week i 've cried in grief , but have had no depression it 's a fucking miracle ! as my elder brother chris always says , good to have you back ! ! good to be back ! ! ! ! ! i ca n't tell you how grateful i am to science , luck , my doctor , the demiurge who gave us reason and my darling wife , who insisted on more snake oil at a scandalous price , as well as the support i 've received here know that your encouragements were never wasted , however dark it seemed to me at kilobunnies , ce i do n't know how i fucked up this underlining feature , but not being depressed , i can live with imperfection hoo haw !
