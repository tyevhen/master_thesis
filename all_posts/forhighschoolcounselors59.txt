this year i attended the evidence based school counseling conference and it was truly inspiring to connect with school counselor practitioners and school counselor educators for three whole days made me think about how we should continuously improve our profession on the way home from the conference , my head was swimming with all the things i learned , the great people i met , and how i would apply my new knowledge to sort out all my thoughts , i decided to post my reflections about the conference lessons learned the majority of school counselors are not trained in supervision according to coogan and kozak , the reasons may vary why school counselors lack supervision training some of these reasons include pscs do not think they need supervision this may be due to prior unsatisfactory ineffective supervision experience pscs may be unwilling to serve in a supervisory role lack of supervision training in the masters program makes access to quality supervision difficult pscs are conflicted with their professional identity counselor school counselor educator for school counselors looking for supervision models , here are two that are specially designed for school counselors school counseling supervision model luke bernard , pscs can contact syracuse university to inquire about this model structured peer consultation model for school counselors benshoff paisley , looking for direction on supervision training as a school counselors , contact gwinnett county schools georgia school counseling director , dianne thompson professional school counselor consultation is imperative according to jeff morgan , program director unc pembroke , not all pscs provide consultation since , many school counseling programs have moved away from teaching consultation to students also , there are many different thoughts on consultation which can be confusing to counselor educators and counselors so what are the benefits in consulting ? face to face consultation is useful in directly promoting positive mental health among teachers students consultation can address teacher emotions , micro behaviors , or stereotypes that impede delivery of instruction consultation is a direct path to change consultation is an integral component of leadership consultation increases cultural competence can directly and indirectly impact family school community connections according to dr morgan , collaboration should not be eclectic but should be based on theory e g developmental theory another tip is that collaboration should be evaluated to inform the school counselor of its effectiveness or ineffectiveness motivational interviewing can work well with resistant students dr rice from georgia state university presented on working with resistant students using motivational interviewing process motivational interviewing is a cognitive based model which borrows from carl rogers , cognitive dissonance theory , self perception theory and is consistent with strength based practices paired with the consultation model , it is effective with parents teachers who are resistance even over the phone this technique works well with breaking barriers by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence although motivational interviewing is researched based , there is little research in schools at this time check data trends of your school to see if you are making a difference from our school data , ask yourself am i standing up for kids ? how do i change systems of exclusion ? how are we preparing students to survive when they leave school ? according to dr bailey and dr mcmahon of the university of georgia , pscs should be preparing kids for what 's to come and remember that our way of helping may not be helpful for all kids social emotional learning is every bit as critical to students' success as academic content dr christopher sink gave five strategies on how to increase social emotional accountability in students these strategies include social emotional learning must become part of the school counselor 's focus this is important as students face increasing stressors , school violence , mental health issues , and marginalization in schools school counselors can build connections between the asca mindsets and sel by collecting data school counselors should lead by example and promote sel civility , tolerance , empathy , and openness to feedback school counselors can advocate for sel by team teaching , becoming active in state associations , and supporting sel legislation school counselors should assist colleagues with developing and assessing sel skills and train others to be sel mentors want to know more about social emotional learning ?
