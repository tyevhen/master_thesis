remember how i always say that getting rid of childhood pain is often a matter of life and death , well there is now some evidence about this s entringer et al proceedings of the national academy of sciences stress exposure in intrauterine life is associated with shorter telomere length in young adulthood http www pnas org content e full my position for years is that if we reverse childhood and intrauterine trauma we can lengthen telomeres why is that important ? because it seems that the length of telomeres can determine how long we live i have defined telomeres previously but the importance of this article is that childhood abuse and trauma even while we are being carried will shorten our lives what the research does not say is how to find a way to reverse the damage so we can extend life a long time i believe that there are many ways to reverse the damage in neurologic damage but only one way to do it properly for example , when there is trauma while we are in the womb there is a process called methylation that takes note of the trauma and marks some of the cells stamped trauma here and that will change us forever , including how long we live one way to reverse this damage is to demethylate change the methylation so that the damage is reversed another way is to relive the damage and be done with it this is preferable because it is not one chemical that we are dealing with it is systemic and covers and covers all the accouterments that went with the imprint the imprint , remember , is that mark , that memory that stays with us for a lifetime it is not just a wee mark it has the capacity to change our brain cells , our hormones and the set points and our neurotransmitters our neurotransmitters for life how on earth can we do that ? we know that there are three key levels of brain function and we know that imprints of our life in the womb can be installed deep into the brain stem , limbic system and associated nerve cells these imprints are engraved onto a na ve , innocent and very primitive nervous system as our ontogeny progresses , our personal evolution , information through nerve tracks reaches up and forward to inform high brain levels higher levels of consciousness fortunately , there are descending tracks descending tracks as well that reach down and affect the primitive imprints thus when a patient is reliving something from childhood or infancy that information can descend down deep and reawaken the first line brain stem imprint which joins the fray well , not a fray , but it dredges up a force where serious physiologic reactions physiologic reactions join the second line childhood reliving memory , the feeling , and takes part in the overall primal or reliving event that is the heart rate , blood pressure , temperature , neurotransmitters , and on and on , join the feeling and give it great force it is now part of the reliving part of undoing the damage we see this in so many ways during the reliving the first line which is activated , makes the brainwave amplitude skyrocket , we well as blood pressure and heart rate and afterward after the total reliving experience , there is a drop in all key indices below baseline the body is normalizing and relaxing and healing my guess is that it is also changing telomere length over time what we note here is how resonance works higher levels of brain function trigger off associated lower levels through either chemical affinities or brain circuits or boththat may have similar or identical frequencies much more of this found in life before birth each level adds its specialty the second line adds feelings , the third line cortex adds comprehension and the first line adds basic physiologic force think of it as rods that evolve carrying information upwards as we grow up and later when we vibrate those vibrate those rods they resonate lower down and set off deep biologic reactions we do not see them as such because they are not a separate force they become part of the overall reaction as the rods vibrate they turn anger into fury , disappointment into hopelessness , fear into terror and then as the reactions in the reliving go on there is a final normalization so we relive the deep early imprints without being aware of it is this clear ? that when there is resonance , fear on the top level gathers the lower levels into its maw and uses the new input , like a rolling stone , terror , as part of its reaction that is , the very depths of resonance hit the brainstem where fury and terror exist and then they join the feeling being relived there is no resolution or undoing the damage without reliving all levels the good part is that we are not usually aware that we reliving a speech less level it just signs up and joins the army an army of feelings arrayed against the suppressing forces of the intellect the intellect the first line is giving a big physiologic boost to this army the feeling brain here joins the reptile brain for a wee party and that party is a celebration of the joy of life because that is what is happening we are coming alive again , lifting the yoke of repression and bidding bon jour to joy at being alive we can t come alive in psychoanalysis where only the intellect is engaged ah yes , a few tears but never the first line , which after all , is our life blood my goodness i got off the track the researchers found that prenatal exposure to stress affected the development of the chromosome regions that control cell aging it is as usual said in dry , unenthusiastic language instead of screaming out a discovery that will help us live longer we can be emotional and scientific at the same time mothers need to have a calm , content life while carrying that is for sure but if they don t there is a solution after all , they can t help it if there was a war going on or terrible famine they are fearful and rightly so this study did the obvious relating stress we can all agree on the death of a loved on , for example , but not the deception of a wayward husband what i have seen is that repressed individuals do get sick with all kinds of diseases too soon in life they have no idea they are carrying around a message from the womb letters from the underground apologies to dostoyevski , a message that foretells of an impending death telomere length not only foretells of early death but also of serious disease on the way there diabetes , cancer and heart disease , and i would add , alzheimer s and parkinson s here is how they conclude a rapidly emerging body of human and animal research indicates that intrauterine conditions play an important role not only in all aspects of fetal development and health across gestation and birth , but also in a wide range of physical and mental health outcomes over an individual s entire lifespan how can anyone make it clearer than that ?
