browsing through costco today for some last minute christmas gifts i saw the new self magazine edition for january and hurried to flip through the pages to see if my article was there sure enough , on page a little paragraph about anxiety and my experience with sleeping i was so stoked ! do n't want to buy the magazine but want to check it out ? click here to see it online they took a lot of information that i gave them and tried to summarize it all up in a few sentences so i feel as though its like seeing a movie without reading the book first you get an idea of the plot but there are so many details missing but its still pretty cool ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like i am going to be in self magazine ! january st support group call ! be there ! ! wondering if you have anxiety ? assess your stress monthly challenge october let 's get educated ! linkwithin
