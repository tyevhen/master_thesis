on valentine 's day , we often think of love stories our own and those of others who inspire us with their loving resilience today , my thoughts are with two recently married couples a generation and a world apart in their experiences i got news of both marriages by email and facebook a st century way to spread joyous news and wedding photos the most recently married is the couple with the longest relationship chuck wibbelsman and david hyman have shared their lives for years they have had joyous times , fun times traveling and darker times when illness intervened or when home remodeling challenged their patience and sanity they 've been loving and supportive of each other through the years as chuck 's career as a doctor thrived and as david made a successful career shift from marketing to real estate in the early years , their relationship was private , almost secret , due to families slow to accept their sexual orientation and to public sentiments at the time chuck , especially , kept his private life quiet as he built his career as a nationally known adolescent medicine specialist pediatrician chuck had grown up in a strongly religious catholic family in cincinnati and went to catholic schools through college he worried quietly about his attraction to men , but quickly dismissed such feelings with the rationalization that he just had n't met the right woman yet he married right after his graduation from medical school but the marriage , arranged in haste and coinciding with chuck 's long hours as a medical intern , ended after less than a year chuck and i met several years later forty years ago and shared love , many good times and a dream to build a future together , professionally and personally the professional part of the dream came true with a classic , best selling book the teenage body book and several other books on which we collaborated over the years but our romantic relationship ended when chuck realized , at age thirty , that he was , indeed , gay i was shocked and heartbroken when he moved to san francisco with a man he had met while we were still a couple but we continued our work together and when i married bob , chuck was there at our wedding , wishing us the best and we wished him the best when he met david two years later david , too , had come from conservative roots he was the only child of jewish parents in upstate new york , growing up burdened with many expectations he had a loving relationship with his mother , who died of cancer when he was , and a somewhat more difficult relationship with his father who loved him dearly , yet struggled to understand and accept who david was a quiet man with exquisite manners and taste , david proved the perfect partner for the ebullient , outgoing chuck david hyman l and chuck wibbelsman r and yet , as the years went by , marriage never seemed a possibility they were faithful to each other and loyal as any loving couple would be and , until recently , they seemed resigned to having a relationship that would be mutually cherished , but never recognized legally when i was talking with chuck two years ago , telling him about the wonderful wedding my friend tim 's son , actor stephen schellhardt and his spouse , actor devin desantis , had just celebrated in new york , he looked wistful the wedding , with just close friends and family , was both intimate and elegant their dear friend jessie mueller , now starring with great acclaim in broadway 's beautiful , sang at their ceremony and stephen 's dad tim wept with joy as he gave a toast stephen l with devin as tim toasts them with love and tears it made me remember the time when stephen officially came out to his family when he was and his family embraced him with love and acceptance at the time , tim told me that two thoughts had occurred simultaneously when he heard stephen 's news his first thought was oh , please do n't anyone hurt him ! quickly followed by i hope he finds someone wonderful to love and now that stephen and devin had found each other , their families celebrated with love and joyful tears chuck had tears in his eyes as he listened what a different time this is , he said quietly what a whole different experience those two have had coming out and being accepted by their families right away and having this wonderful wedding with their parents there , celebrating with them i'm so happy for them it is , indeed , a different kind of love story for these two younger men stephen and devin came out at a much younger age they had the support of friends and family members as their relationship grew in the years before their marriage their lives and successes are much more public as their acting and singing careers flourish they recently serenaded broadway legend audra mcdonald at a theatre community tribute to her stephen schellhart l , audra mcdonald , devin desantis and currently , they 're both enjoying star turns in musical revivals at major theaters in chicago stephen starring as the master of ceremonies emcee of cabaret at the marriott theatre and devin starring as dr frankenstein in young frankenstein at the drury lane theater stephen as the emcee in cabaret at the marriott theater devin r as dr frankenstein in young frankenstein at the drury lane theater recently , as both have garnered fantastic reviews in their respective shows , the chicago tribune spotlighted their loving and solid relationship in an article about them being each other 's leading men this would have been unthinkable back in the day when secrecy , double lives and fear of exposure prevailed but times have been changing for quite some time , even for couples whose relationships were shrouded in secrecy during their younger years when chuck recently was lauded for his work as a physician at kaiser permanente , the organization recognized david as his life partner and included him in the tribute it was , at once , a small gesture of respect and a huge step forward and yet older couples , people whose lives have been lived well , but largely out of the public spotlight , quite often still feel most comfortable with quiet , private celebrations when gay marriage was once again legal in california , chuck and david thought why not ? at this point in their lives , they wanted their wedding to be a quiet thing , a private commitment , in tune with the quiet , but profound love that has blessed their lives for over three decades so one tuesday last month , they met at city hall in san francisco and , in a ceremony witnessed only by one of chuck 's co workers , a favorite fellow physician , they were married announcing the event afterwards to friends and family chuck , witness alison niederer and david on their wedding day it was quiet it was huge it was a long time coming after years together , it was an incredibly sweet moment and victory for a loving , devoted couple happy valentine 's day to all couples whose mutual devotion has kept love alive for all the days and years of their relationships and special good wishes to chuck and david , stephen and devin for showing us that it is n't the gender of the person one loves that matters as much as the fact that one is willing and able to share a lifetime of love with another
