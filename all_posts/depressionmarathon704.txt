up early today to run miles with puck it was cold and dark , but he smiled the whole way ! i love looking down and seeing him trot along so happy after dropping him at home i drove to the track club meeting place to finish my long run despite the chill and the wind , it was a very large crowd of runners today there must have been of us there covered head to toe , we were quite a spectacle of glowing jackets and high tech gear once we hit the road it was nice to be surrounded with like minded souls on such a crisp day unfortunately , the whole body fatigue of two days ago seemed to have settled in my legs this morning i was shooting for miles , but by mile i was n't sure i 'd make it i took full advantages of our volunteer water stops , downed some gatorade , bananas and gummy bears , and i pushed onward i kept up a breathy chatter with whomever sidled up to me , and before i knew it we were done my final tally was miles not bad after the run , i decided to join a bunch of runners for brunch i had pancakes it was fun runners can be quite a zany crowd , especially after freezing their buns running for hours ! i'm glad i went that 's not something in which i typically participate , but i decided to stretch my boundaries just a bit unfortunately , the combination of pancakes and chilly miles made me very , very tired it 's been another long day of snoozing besides one load of laundry , writing this post is the only thing i 've accomplished since returning home hours ago i'm tired , not quite as sleepy as the other day , but definitely tired along with the fatigue , i'm a little worried about my thinking it 's a little off i do n't know exactly how to explain it but trust me , it 's off my mind is bouncing around and racing a little i 've had lots of using thoughts i had a drinking dream so real the other night , i thought i had relapsed that really sucked ! i was so relieved when i realized i was still sober but my brain is a bit off , and i'm worried about that hopefully , the fatigue and the thinking will each self correct i have spoken to my sponsor , and i plan to see her at an aa event tonight i hope that helps i think i just need to get out of myself for a little while maybe i 've been spending too much time alone solitude lends itself to stir craziness when my brain 's operating like this my head is best visited only with a chaperone ! i 'll be surrounded by chaperones at the aa event tonight , which is all the more reason i need to go wish me luck
