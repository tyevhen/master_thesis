you are depressed , take a placebo , and feel better conventional wisdom in the psychiatric community would have your depression coming back shortly because we all know that a placebo ca n't make you feel better for very long right ? um , sorry to crash the party , but no a study from arif khan and colleagues in the august journal of psychiatric research debunks this myth by putting together results from antidepressant trials which examined what happened to study participants who a showed a response to treatment in the short term and b continued to take either an antidepressant or placebo in the long term of those who continued to take antidepressants , maintained their improvement weeks to over a year afterwards so did of participants who took a placebo so yeah , people on drugs did a bit better , but about in people taking a freaking sugar pill were still doing well in the long term anyone still want to seriously argue that the vast majority of the antidepressant effect is not the placebo effect ? the authors , who incidentally are not exactly in the peter breggin camp , opine that the widely held and probably erroneous belief that the placebo response in depression is short lived appears to be based largely on intuition and perhaps wishful thinking ouch wishful thinking about psychiatric medications ? hmmm , that is giving me effexor flashbacks for some reason
