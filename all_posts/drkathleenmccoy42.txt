there are hundreds of stories you have shared as the parent of an adult child some of these are heartbreaking , some uplifting there are hundreds of comments you have left some angry , some regretful , some hopeful all of these inhabit the comments sections of my two most read blog posts when adult children become strangers and parents and adult children finding the balance however , i have been hearing from readers recently that it is hard to leave additional comments or to find the most recent comments on both blog posts so here is a fresh start , a clean slate anyone who wants to comment about one of the parents and adult children blog posts or simply to tell his or her own story or share observations about what works and what does n't in building closeness or resolving conflicts with adult children can write in the comments section attached to this post i truly appreciate all you 've shared in the past whether you 've agreed with me or not and look forward to reading many more of your enlightening stories and insights !
