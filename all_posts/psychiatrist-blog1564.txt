my office is in a building with lots of other offices and some stores it 's not uncommon that friends will mention they 've been in the building for a reason , or they might say they 're going to be there and might drop by i generally suggest that they not do that i see patients back to back most days , it 's more than a bit awkward to have my personal life intrude on my professional life , though i do n't want my friends to think i do n't love seeing them , just not during the work day yesterday , between sessions , i got this text message from a friend , i'm in the building u there ? i called and said , i have to see a patient quickly , come up in a little bit it felt like a funny , meant to be sort of thing set up by the cosmos i did n't tell the friend all the details , but i did have a patient scheduled that hour only the night before she 'd called and said she forgot what time the appointment was i told her same time as friend showing up , but as an afterthought i added that i had another time available later if that was more convenient it was , she took it , thereby freeing the cosmic time slot and you know i do n't do med checks but the patient i 'd scheduled into that time is the only patient in my entire practice that i see for brief med checks a patient who came to me completely stable with no symptoms or side effects , no desire for psychotherapy , who could easily be managed by an internist and has been told that but he wants a psychiatrist to write his prescription friend came up and we chatted he sat where the patients sat , i sat where i sit i'm not the quietest of therapists , but when i'm doing psychotherapy , it 's all about the patient i got to talk about me he looked around , asked about the position of the clocks why does n't the patient get to see a clock ? why do n't i have a desk ? we talked about some other stuff i did n't ask if he needed more meds he left when the hour was up i wondered if he felt funny that the patient in the waiting room must have thought he was a patient it was nice to see you , roy
