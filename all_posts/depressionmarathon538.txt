i'm not sure it 's directly related , but it feels like i 've sunk into a bit of a dip since my marathon on sunday i 've experienced post marathon dips in my mood in the past , so i'm always watchful for changes but i 've been feeling so well lately , i'm a little surprised by this tumble i do n't think the dip has anything to do with my performance it was n't that important perhaps it has more to do with extending myself physically and mentally i do n't know but i 've been sad , tearful , overwhelmed , anxious and fatigued for the past two days something is going on i 've contacted my doctor i'm getting extra rest i'm going to work , exercising , and seeing friends well , i'm seeing some friends i did skip a meeting , and work has been particularly challenging but i'm doing what i can and fighting the urge to isolate the last thing i want is for this dip to become a drop i liked the way things were going i want to get back to feeling fabulous as soon as possible
