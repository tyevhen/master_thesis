for the past year , if you clicked the publications tab of my page , you 'd see a trite little message that went something like i'm flattered that you think i'm good enough to be published , but i'm afraid i do n't have anything to put here just yet well , i'm pleased to announce that , as of today , that message is no more after much nagging from my regular readers to check out this whole 'write for cracked thing , i 've finally had an article accepted by cracked com ! boo yeah i do n't have a lot of details for you at the moment i do n't know when , exactly , the article will be published , and i do n't know what title they will choose to publish it under what i do know is that it 's about historic figures who did things right out of horror movies , and that you should start frantically refreshing cracked sometime around halloween thanks to everyone who told me to send in an article ! i 'll post a link to it when it goes live
