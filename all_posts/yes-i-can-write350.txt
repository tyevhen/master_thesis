life by turns continues to be depressing and good lately , sadly , depressing is still leading i wanted to write something , even though the interesting thoughts in my head refuse to be made into a blog post , so i really do n't have much interesting to say so , i figured i 'd put this little piece of randomness in a post , minimally edited the ramblings of my mind as i sat in a car on a grey day in the parking lot of a plant nursery on my mother 's birthday the sky was opressive , and the car smelled of tomato plants the glovebox is full of memories i never even realized that until today depressed , bored , and trying to both distract and amuse myself , i open up the plastic door and start digging around inside the first thing that catches my eye is sackboy he used to hang from a chain on my purse before the chain was broken or lost i do n't even remember which i 'd forgotten that sackboy even existed next , i notice a bright flash of orange a kalahari wrist band that 's been there since february , when we went to the uwwg it was the first unschooling gathering we went to as a family minus my dad the barcode and phone number are wearing off memories keep coming as i pull other things out the card from uncle gene 's funeral , and the words on the back that made me cry when i first read them aloud in the car , a few monthes ago , as we drove home i have lived god knows i have lived a parking slip from st annes what a memory that is i do n't even emember why we were there there 's also a pile of yellow napkins , and a plastic bag filled with salt and pepper pckets , and plastic knives and forks , stolen from some long forgotten restaurant on the side of the highway and a bill from an econolodge we never even ended up staying at i wonder how many words never written are tucked away in my brain , never to be found again hidden memories never to be recalled that 's why i love gloveboxes life is hard smetimes , especially when the way is n't clear , or when your happiness , which it almost always is , is dependant on others i ca n't fix everything i ca n't even change some things and figuring out what is changeable and what is n't can be exceedingly difficult but , i feel bad for complaining , and i really dont want to i do know that things will get better it 's just hard waiting until it does peace , idzie you might also like grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of against the current talk from the toronto unschooling making transitions and following passions this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and linkwithin
