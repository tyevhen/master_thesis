you were here , by cori mccarthy release date march st , this book was given to me by the publisher through netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review in order to deal with the psychological grief of her brother dying , jaycee is on a quest to rediscover him by reliving his dangerous stunts when a group of erstwhile friends gets sucked into her antics , jaycee learns love and forgiveness let me start out by saying this is the best fiction work on grief that i have ever experienced mccarthy is clearly someone who understands the power of grief it seems like everyone in the story is experiencing grief , yet they are all coping in different ways what 's more most of the characters are incredibly wise perhaps a little too wise to be real at one point , jaycee demands of her new old friend whether she should change her grieving process to not weird people out how many adults understand that their grief is a personal process , and that it is not wrong to cope the way they do , even if it emotionally or physically healthy for them at that moment i e it is not wrong to experience grief , though sometimes they must be protected from themselves this book is gritty , and at times brutally honest i would recommend this book to any teenager who wants to understand others' pain , though i would suggest caution to people who are depressed or going through grief at the moment there were times while reading this book that i reexperienced difficult moments for myself however , that is what made the book so powerful to me this book deserves stars , but my rating system does n't go that far up
