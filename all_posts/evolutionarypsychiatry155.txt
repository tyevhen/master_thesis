did i ever mention that i'm not a big fan of the folate cycle ? not because it 's not important , but because it is intensive , poorly understood , and hard to remember probably a bad reason to dislike it , as far as those things go let 's just start with a diagram , and an explanation for those of us who were taught some basic organic chemistry folate does not equal folic acid i know it 's weird for all the other acids , ate equals ic acid such as phytate and phytic acid , but for whatever reason , folate dihydrofolate , and folic acid equals synthetic folate that is used to fortify foods in the us and in multivitamins let me supply you with a handy diagram please click on the diagram to make it bigger ! the blue formulations are those that can be had by prescription or supplement the yellow are the natural forms folic acid is put into grains and multivitamins folinic acid is used in chemotherapy mthf methyltertrahydrofolate , or the active enantiomer l methylfolate is a medical food pharmaceutical grade folate one can get by prescription now why would a psychiatrist care about this pathway ? well , folks with depression have increased risk of having crappy dihydrofolate reductase activity meaning they have a hard time turning synthetic folic acid into dihydrofolate this enzyme is also inhibited by the medication lamotrigine in addition , folks with depression are more likely to have issues with the mthfr enzyme i know it stands for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase but that 's not what i call it in my head either so if you prescribe medications meant to maximize the efficiency of neurotransmitter transmission in order to treat depression or anxiety , or if you just want nature to maximize the efficiency of neurotransmitter transmission which everyone would agree is preferable , if possible , you want plentiful tetrahydrobiopterin in the brain you can see from the diagram that cheap , plentiful folic acid may not aways become the final active product in the brain you can also see that expensive , prescription mthf deplin might be useful for some people , though you may be annoyed if you know that deplin has never been tested head to head against folic acid mthf and folinic acid have had some decent studies increasing response rates to antidepressant therapies , and decreasing cognitive symptoms of depression the results for folic acid supplementation itself have been mixed and , given some genetic polymorphisms such as ct , affecting the mthfr gene , a peripheral folate level which i have drawn routinely will not necessarily tell us about folate levels in the brain but why not just pour tons of folic acid into the system well folic acid has some risks for one , it has been shown to mask some of the first symptoms of b deficiency which i have seen none of my patients with low b have had the classic hemotologic signs that doctors have long relied upon to help diagnose b deficiency possibly because folic acid supplementation is now abundant in the food system in addition , folate is a growth factor , and one has to be careful about pouring growth factors into the system , lest one risk cancer the risk of colorectal cancer being the most studied and the most likely caused by widespread folic acid supplementation the results of the epidemiological studies are mixed however , with this large us study showing no correlation now , if you take a ton of folic acid more than mcg daily mcg being the normal dose in prenatal vitamins , it has been shown that the excess folic acid wo n't be metabolized , and that excess folic acid in the serum actually reduces the amount of l methylfolate that reaches the brain , with a potential increase in depression supplementation with l methylfolate will not mask b deficiency and is less likely to be a risk for colon cancer since the upstream agent , folinic acid , is used to kill cancer but the cost a thirty day supply of deplin can cost as much as at the pharmacy , and the cheapest i have found it is for a month supply direct from the manufacturer as a medical food it is not covered by insurance and yes , in my clinical experience , i have some patients who have not responded to folic acid supplementation who have done very well on deplin folate , real , natural happy dihydrofolate from food is most plentiful in leafy green vegetables , fruits , and ahem legumes cereals and grains are fortified with synthetic folic acid hopefully this article will clarify some things or maybe we will consume few more leafy green veggies and fruit along the way serotonin , dopamine , and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters fava , m and mischoulon , d folate in depression efficacy , safety , differences in formulations , and clinical issues j clin psychiatry suppl frankenburg , fr , folate supplementation is it safe and effective ? letter j clin psychiatry
