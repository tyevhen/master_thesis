things are improving around here i'm physically feeling better i 've still got quite a deep , annoying cough , but overall i'm much better i got out of the house today and back on to the road it felt so good to run once again ! i covered miles , stopping near the end to take in a few minutes of a disc dog competition , before returning home my pace was good , and my lungs survived i'm pretty wiped out right now , but it was worth it i may run a bit longer tomorrow my friend , t , offered me a spot next to her on her mile run , and i just may take her up on that i like running with her it keeps me a bit more relaxed and out of training mode when we share the road i'm not ready to get back into training mode quite yet i 'd like to take a few more relaxed , fun runs prior to getting back on schedule the twin cities marathon , in early october , is up next i spent a fair amount of today 's run re living my grandmas marathon performance it 's funny today i felt nothing but joy and satisfaction , and none of last saturday 's strain and discomfort , during my mental re cap it 's another beauty of marathoning when i run well , the pain and discomfort quickly fades i guess it 's one of many reasons i keep going back for more i'm off to dinner with a friend now i 've been a bit couped up with this virus , so it will be nice to get out and socialize with someone i enjoy i'm looking forward to next week i have just days of work before jet and i will be off to spend days in northern wisconsin with d at his lake home d and i have n't seen each other since mid may , so i'm really happy we 'll have this time together maybe i 'll get back on my training schedule after that
