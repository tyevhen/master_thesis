dear tom , thank you so much for your letter i laughed out loud when i saw the green frog i still use all the little mind tricks myself that quick downshift is a bummer however , for me it 's not as sharp as it used to be i just do n't get the bad hits anymore , just the little mood shifts which are easy to knock off with green frogs i had a bad reaction this year to oxycodene which kaiser prescribed for a back problem i took it for four weeks my brain was fried horrible anxiety and muscle spasms for about months swimming , yoga and massage therapy fixed the back problem and muscle spasms , but nothing helped the anxiety except hypnosis which kept wearing off i knew if i went back to kaiser all they had to offer me was paxil or the like so i opted for chinese medicine instead best thing i ever did for myself i'm now on different vitamins and supplements and never felt better my nutritionist expert in chinese medicine bret moser , poway , ca said that my hormones were probably out of balance all my life and that 's what positioned me for the big hits plus i learned depressive behavior from my father make sure your nutrition is spot on we 're especially needing vitamin d and b complex as we age can i post your pix and letter on my blog or would you rather not ? a b curtiss dear a b , what is this ? a renowned author responding to my little note ? if you were trying to influence my serotonin levels it worked ! ha ! thanks for sharing your hormone vitamin experience , and yes , please post my pix and letter ! after all , my health insurer ca n't drop me for reading a book about depression , right ? tom queally
