the upcoming visit to my family has prompted thoughts of gifts just as we typically do n't gather as a family for holidays anymore , we no longer exchange gifts either i do buy my mom a gift every year , but i do n't feel right about offering her a gift while my brothers stand by and receive nothing that would be odd , do n't you think my brothers do n't want for anything , and giving them more stuff seems pointless i would just be giving out of obligation , and it likely would n't mean much to me nor them i used to love christmas and giving gifts becoming a single person quashed my enthusiasm struggling with a chronic , debilitating illness changed my priorities stuff is no longer very important to me i 'd rather someone took me out for dinner , washed my dishes , or donated their resources to mental illness research obligatory giving makes me queasy fortunately , i discovered a solution today after hearing a story on npr , i checked out this website , which is dedicated to redefining christmas this is a very cool site the following is an excerpt from their homepage give others donations to their favorite charities redefine christmas is neither commercial venture , nor money maker it 's simply a charitable idea , shared by many , that our holiday gift giving could be more meaningful and do more good in addition to the gifts we enjoy shopping for and giving , we 're often compelled to give gifts that are n't so meaningful imagine if we replaced those gifts by giving others donations to their favorite charities and we just request that others do the same for us and then there 's this from another page on the site it 's not about reinventing the holiday it 's about changing the way we look at gift giving and receiving it 's taking money we usually spend on obligatory gifts with little meaning , and creating gifts of charity that give in multiple ways , to the receiver , the giver , and people who truly need seems i'm not the only one thinking about obligatory giving what a wonderful solution i will be purchasing the gift of charity for each of my brothers this christmas now i'm excited again !
