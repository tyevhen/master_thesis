this post was written in my other blog on november , i need to vent a little bit about the last day of our trip in florence october rd , i woke up that morning to discover i was having an apparent miscarriage we 'd happily found out we were pregnant again not long before the trip , so i was a bit nervous each day the nurse at the practice i go to here at home had warned me saying that if i saw even the slightest speck of blood to go to the emergency room she was nervous due to our experience with the cornual ectopic pregnancy i had back in may and thought the odds were higher for a dangerous ectopic again i was scared something bad would happen to me in a foreign country where i did n't know the procedures or speak the language anyway , when i saw the blood i panicked we ran to the front desk where they got us a cab to take us to the english speaking hospital well , when we got there we could n't find anyone who spoke english which i can understand in a regular hospital but i thought people were able to speak some english at the english speaking hospital which was the reason we 'd asked to go there we could n't read the signs or figure out where to go once inside i was in a crying frenzy and we felt so confused anyway , eventually we found a nurse who i managed to communicate with via charades and gestures she found one doctor who spoke english and we were off they hooked me to an iv and took a bunch of blood the next thing we know , he was explaining that an ambulance was going to take us to a gynecological hospital where they had the right equipment so , i get strapped to this gurney and covered in blankets and whisked into the ambulance still crying and in a panic i still could n't tell what anyone was saying and then the sirens came on i thought are you kidding me ? ! we jetted through the streets of florence for about minutes i had to guess that the shocks were out in that vehicle because i swear i felt every cobblestone and pothole we went over anyway , at the next hospital we found that most of the staff did n't speak a lick of english there which we 'd assumed , so i was doing a lot of gesturing and sign language to get across what was happening they wheeled me into this sort of open area with an exam table and an ultrasound machine it was the sort of room anyone in the hospital would have to pass through to get to other rooms so i felt like i was on display to my relief , the doctor spoke enough english where we could understand each other and my exam began it was horrible there was so privacy , no private exam room , no gown to put on , no sheet to cover me nothing i had nurses staring at me , and not at my face which i imagined would be the scene one day when i have a baby , but not now ! and they all looked horrified at the grisly scene and ended up putting a metal bucket under me where i sat at the edge of the table to catch any matter that came out i felt like some sort of cow of course , the ultrasound showed nothing and he told me what i already knew , but confirmed it was not ectopic one nurse could see the fear and panic in my face as i shook and cried she came over to me and stroked my arm and my hair and said soothing words i did n't understand that simple gesture made me feel so much better later , we were released and wandered out in the daylight to find it was raining and we had no idea where we were hmm no coats , no umbrellas , and a crying megan we shuffled through the streets trying to get to a main drag or someplace that looked like taxis would frequent finally , we found a taxi stand at a different hospital and the whole ordeal was done the good part ? from start to finish i was back at the hotel and resting in hours it was quick , efficient , and to the point it was n't what i 'd planned for our last day , but that 's what we got i know now that the pregnancy never really progressed past implantation and that is the thought i cling to it was all a routine miscarriage as they say , except this experience was anything but routine for a girl from a small new england town ! anyway , onward and upward two pregnancies down , hopefully the third time is the charm , right ? i have learned that anything can happen the third may not work out either or it could i always thought that i might be the one to beat the odds and have a healthy normal pregnancy right away and now i realize that trying for a child is a solemn thing that cannot be planned , predicted or controlled there is no fairness involved only the hope that someday it will all work out for the best thanks for letting me vent ! save you might also like flashback loss number one part two flashback loss number one flashback loss number four linkwithin
