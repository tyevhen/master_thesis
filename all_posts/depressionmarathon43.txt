this is one of those posts i hate to write for better or worse , i pride myself on being a fighter , maybe even a role model , for someone out there battling this fucking illness but i have n't been fighting lately despite my recent vow to battle , i have fallen far short for the last several days , the battle has been taken to me rather than the other way around and i'm losing , big time despite knowing better , i 've spent the better part of recent days isolating myself , sleeping whenever i could for as long as i could , eating junk , and stomping around my house in anger this is not typical of me , and it 's concerning , yet i do n't care ! anger is the rule of the day i do n't want to talk to anyone i do n't want to see anyone i do n't want to do anything and i certainly do n't want anyone pointing out what i should be doing i know what i should be doing , but i'm not or more accurately , i know what i should be doing , and i'm not maybe i'm tired of doing what i should be doing yet still feeling smothered by depression 's life sucking force maybe i'm giving depression a big , fat middle finger maybe that 's what this is , fuck you , depression ! i'm tired of behaving perfectly for your sake maybe i just want to be normal for awhile and i'm fairly certain normal people do n't always eat perfectly , exercise regularly , sleep on schedule , and feel honky dory ! i bet normal people even shut off their phones once in awhile , and when they do , it is n't a symptom ! i'm tired of symptoms that 's the problem symptoms this illness requires vigilance to keep my symptoms at bay i do n't necessarily have the luxury of the normal behavior of my friends and that makes me angry i want that luxury , too i do n't want to have to care about life 's every detail but depression demands i care it demands i care and i hate it for that
