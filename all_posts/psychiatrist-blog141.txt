i have one thing to say about mark lukach 's essay , my lovely wife on the psych ward that one thing is read it ! it 's beautiful mr lukach does a masterful job of describing his feelings as he plows through two months' long episodes of psychosis with his wonderful wife when a friend gives him a copy of r d laing 's the divided self an existential study in sanity and madness , mr lukach learns about the world of anti psychiatry and psychiatric survivors he struggles through with wanting to be a good husband , to help his wife get better , but he questions whether what he is doing is right , and he stumbles through with his own guilt and when his wife gets better , they struggle with the bitter aftertaste of what it meant to be her caretaker , to be in control the story is n't all pretty , but the writing and the description of the conflicts is beautifully done yet laing ripped through a conception i had of myself that i held dear that i was a good husband laing died in , more than years before i picked up his book , so who knows what he really would have thought his ideas about mental health and its treatment could have shifted with the times but in my admittedly sensitive state , i felt laing saying patients are good doctors are bad family members botch things up by listening to physicians and becoming bumbling accomplices in the crime of psychiatry and i was an accessory , conspiring to force giulia to take medication against her will that made her distant , unhappy , and slow , and that silenced her psychotic thoughts that same medication enabled giulia to remain alive , so everything else was secondary , as far as i was concerned i never doubted the rightness of my motives from the beginning , i d cast myself in the role of giulia s self effacing caregiver not a saint , but definitely a guy working on the side of good laing made me feel like i was her tormentor
