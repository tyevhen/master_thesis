charles nemeroff , former chair of psychiatry at emory university and key opinion leader extraordinaire has vanished not quite vanished from the face of the earth , but from medscape cme and now from a georgia mental health commission nemeroff was found to have not disclosed a whole boatload of money he received from big and little pharma according to an investigation by senator charles grassley for example , it appears that nemeroff received about , in cash from glaxosmithkline in one month in exchange for promoting gsk products to his peers i have previously written about a number of , um , interesting behaviors on the part of nemeroff , which i recommend you read in order to understand that nemeroff has , on several occasions , engaged in behavior that certainly appears to have placed the causes of his corporate sponsors over science not good for an independent researcher and now , it seems that chuck nemeroff is vanishing dr bernard carroll noted that nemeroff 's continuing medical education offerings had vanished from medscape and offered the following well , good for medscape they came in for their share of criticism , here and here , a while back now they deserve credit for displaying ethical standards meanwhile , we are waiting for another company called cme outfitters to get the message dr nemeroff is slated to moderate a raft of new programs for this company in the coming weeks , sponsored by corporations like pfizer , astrazeneca , and ortho mcneil janssen cme outfitters' logo , after all , is education with integrity sooner or later the pharmaceutical corporations , like the cme companies , will understand that they are not helping themselves by trotting out a shopworn and sleazy kol figurehead like nemeroff for their marketing efforts and other kols who up to now were willing to wet their beaks in these cme forums controlled by the boss of bosses nemeroff will now be leery of associating with him well , cme outfitters is still rolling with nemeroff for example , he has an upcoming program called atypical antipsychotics in major depressive disorder when current treatments are not enough , which is a scary thought given that he appears to have been pulling data from thin air for a prior cme exercise in which he pimped risperidone as a treatment for refractory depression specifically , nemeroff 's presentation claimed that risperidone improved sexual function in a clinical trial , when the published article based on the trial 's results said no such thing in addition , nemeroff 's claim that risperidone had shown efficacy in a short term study versus placebo for depression was also unsupported so i'm thinking the upcoming program on antipsychotics for depression might be a fantastic example of marketing beating the crap out of science georgia appointed a commission to address several issues within the public mental health system they have completed a report interestingly the final version also does not contain the name of commission member charles nemeroff , an emory psychiatry professor who has been a subject of a u s senate finance committee investigation into whether drug company money paid to doctors and academics compromises medical research and scholarship nemeroff , an internationally known expert on depression , did not attend recent commission meetings but nemeroff was appointed to the commission with some fanfare the press release listing nemeroff 's accomplishments is pretty lengthy the georgia state legislator who appointed dr nemeroff said , i am confident that charles will be an asset to this commission and will serve as a strong advocate for the people of georgia being served by our mental health systems yet nemeroff was not on the final report if it were n't for his work on cme outfitters , i would be worried that we might need to file a missing persons report for dr nemeroff update the wall street journal health blog has two interesting posts on dr nemeroff , read them and feel free to file them under bizarre
