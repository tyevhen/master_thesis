i start my new job tomorrow for some reason , i'm really anxious about it i do n't understand why i'm so nervous i 've worked in nursing homes before i 've cared for the geriatric population a lot i 've been a therapist for a long time i do n't get it why am i so anxious ? i'm recovering well from saturday 's marathon my soreness is almost entirely gone today i have n't gone out for a run , or done any other exercise , since the race i guess i'm taking a little exercise vacation i 'll probably start up again tomorrow i am going to sign up for another marathon in august that will give me one marathon every other month , plus one extra marathon in may , for the year initially , i had no plans to do that , but it sort of worked out that way once i got rolling i saw my psychologist this morning my mood has been really good lately it 's nice to be feeling so well of course i feel like i have less to share here when feeling so good , but i'm not going anywhere i'm looking forward to continued stability , getting to know the new man in my life , and training for my next marathon keeping it simple i like it like that
