i'm still thinking about what i'm going to say in my talk about value in psychiatry from the patients' perspective it seems to me that the question of value and getting one 's money worth might include the fact that the cost is different in different settings so someone who gets care at a student mental health center , a va facility , or a public clinic may well pay nothing and in private practice , many psychiatrists do n't participate with insurance plans and people may choose see a psychiatrist when they have no out of network insurance , and thereby assume a cost of hundreds of dollars per session so my question for now is quick , and again , it is meant only for people who have been patients why do you see a psychiatrist who is not in your insurance network ? if this costs more than going with an in network psychiatrist , what makes the extra cost worth it ?
