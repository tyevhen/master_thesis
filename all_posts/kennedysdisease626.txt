old faithful , my permobil c wheelchair , was beginning to show signs of aging the chair has been good to me , but it needed new tires , two new motors and maybe the seat lift also , replace the batteries , new seat cushion , new cut off switch , etc when i priced the total repair bill , the decision was made to get a new chair instead introducing the permobil f corpus , the replacement for the discontinued c i have had it for a week and i am impressed the website describes the f in this way the f corpus offers the smallest footprint of this redesigned series of front wheel drive power wheelchairs its size and agility let users move quickly in and out of tight spaces like busy city streets and crowded areas like malls or even parties the platform has a lower , repositioned center of gravity , which greatly improves stability while traversing inclines or declines with its fully independent suspension , the f provides a comfortable ride and allows users to navigate the obstacles of life the corpus seating system we retained all of the things that you have come to expect from the legendary corpus seating system like the arc legrests , the open armrest design and the unitrack system then , we took the corpus seating system to the next level with advanced features such as the seat elevator and the a p tilt function , which allows for optional , , and of anterior tilt , while maintaining of posterior tilt the a p tilt helps our users with transfers , added reach , and allows them to get closer to a table or workspace i feel having a seat lift is mandatory for someone living with kennedy 's disease sbma and i am impressed with the seat lift the new seat elevator utilizes points of contact and shifts the seat rearward as it elevates to maintain an unimaginable level of stability even at full elevation this allows individuals to get closer to tasks while providing faster and higher elevation is nice it really gets you up there while still feeling stable the fact that the lift motor is three times faster than the c is even nicer many things are similar to the c as well as some nice new additions or enhancements stability seems much greater , even though the c wasn t bad the corpus seating system rd generation is even nicer the footrests are lighter i could go on , but i need to mention the other side of the coin and , as with most everything , there are a couple of things that i do not like as much the armrests , for example , are wider making the chair wider at the arms the first few days i was scraping doorframes right and left and couldn t figure out why the rear wheels need adjusting they are not as smooth when backing up or turning as the c right now because of all the combinations of seat height , leg rest position , back and seat tilt , etc , i am checking into a memory option that will keep three positions for enhanced ease of use as i use the chair more , i ll keep you advised as to my thoughts on the chair
