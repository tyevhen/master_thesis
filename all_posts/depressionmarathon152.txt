it 's been a long weekend my mood has gone from low to no that is , i'm at that point where i feel very little to nothing at all just indeterminate , monotonous gray gray hurts i'm not sure how a color can be painful , but gray hurts gray is empty gray is cold gray is a hole in the middle of my chest and even if i could , i have n't the energy to fill it does n't matter , gray is cavernous , impossible to fill gray is heavy gray is slow gray is isolating , very , very isolating it does n't want to go out and if it must , gray keeps its head down and eyes cast low being seen hurts when gray and i'm gray just gray
