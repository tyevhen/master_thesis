it 's a very lovely monday morning since i do n't have to punch a clock mondays do n't carry the same sort of soul sucking dread that they used to this particular one finds me in my favorite chair , fresh cup of coffee just beside me and a brilliant sunrise blasting over my neighbor 's roof literally , as i typed that the sun rose ! when it has a close , defined line like a nearby rooftop it can happen that quickly i 've got george winstonplaying in my earbuds and all is about as well as it can get in my little world so why , under such circumstances do i choose to be pecking away at my depression blog ? well , it 's only to recipricate some link karma and announce that my little collection of whiny , navel gazing ramblings have made another list of superlative blogs check out top mental health and psychology blogs at universityreviewsonline com i never promote this thing except that i sent the first couple of entries to digg at this point i have no idea why and would most certainly not do such a thing now but somehow it attracts attention and brings in a modest amount of traffic i really do n't know why the writing is sloppy the topics are repetitive and , just like my own mental health , seem to swirl about without reaching any firm conclusion they offer nothing of value to the reader that i can see this is n't meant to criticize regular readers in any way only to express my bewilderment but , like i 've said before , this blog does do something for me there is some therapy in shouting into the void and others seem to enjoy it for reasons that pass my understanding so on we go
