contrary to what it looks like , this is not an arrival gate diagram for an eastern european airport it 's a diagram of secondary structure of a portion of the mrna for the yoqj gene in b subtilis phage spbc click to enlarge the common soil bacterium bacillus subtilis has long been known to harbor an inducible prophage virus called spbc normally , spbc is dormant in the bacillus genome , but heat or treatment with mitomycin c will cause the phage to express itself and start a lytic infection cycle like many bacterial viruses , phage spbc has a sizable double stranded dna genome , consisting in this case of , base pairs encoding genes it 's one of the strangest collection of genes you 'll ever want to meet the spbc genome is strange , first of all , in its base composition the following stats come from analysis of the coding regions of the genome base abundance a t g c notice how the purines , a and g adenine and guanine are about more abundant than the pyrimidines , c and t cyotsine and thymine this is a stark violation of chargaff 's second parity rule which says a t and g c not only for double stranded dna but for a single strand , as well when purine abundance is tallied on a per gene basis , you get the following histogram purine abundance for n protein coding genes in b subtilis phage spbc only genes contain less than purine bases all but out of genes have a message strand purine content above and if you look at the gene sequence data , the genes even look funny to the naked eye , containing , as they do , long runs of bases , with funny repeats , like ttgaaaggaaaaaaagacggcctaaataaa one gets the feeling , when examining the sequence data , that one is looking at trna or rrna data rather than protein coding sequences and yet , they really are protein coding sequences but it turns out there 's a lot of secondary structure info in the sequences see the picture at the top of this post many of the genes contain self complementing intragenic regions i decided to verify this with some custom scripts first , i had scripts look inside each gene for length nucleotide sequences with a matching reverse complement sequence further downstream in the same gene i expected to find one or two or ten hits , based on the fact that any given length sequence of the bases a , g , c , and t can turn up at random in about one in every million base pairs each base is worth about two bits , so a length dna sequence can encode as much info as a length binary sequence to the th is a little over a million what i found was an astounding complementary length sequences within genes when i upped the sequence length to , i still found intragenic complement sequences in genes a length match should happen randomly about once every million base pairs the spbc genome as i said is , base pairs long the high degree of internal complementarity means that when the phage 's dna strands are separated during transcription or replication , they probably assume very particular dimensional structures , and also , the messenger rna made from the phage 's genes are probably rich in secondary structure exactly why those structures are needed is anyone 's guess they may protect the virus from restriction nucleases although frankly this chore is already taken care of by the prophage 's own methylases or they may attract ribosomes in some special way many of the genes form trna lookalike structures they may help with virion packaging or they may do nothing special at all i kind of doubt the latter possibility , though
