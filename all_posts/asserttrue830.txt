this is an incredibly sad day for me dr dobbs journal , one of the great programming resources of the late dos early windows era , has finally died , a victim ironically of the internet 's triumph over pulp and ink the venerable programmer 's magazine has n't exactly gone away entirely it will somewhat sadly continue as dr dobbs report a special software development monthly section in informationweek magazine but that , too , has the smell of death about it to say that i owe a lot to ddj is an understatement ddj was a critical part of my programming education allen holub 's early ddj articles on the newfangled c language taught me a huge amount about programming and profoundly influenced my development as a coder eventually , in , i even wrote an article myself for ddj it 's a sad thing , this disappearance of the printed word , this seemingly unstoppable deprecation of protons and neutrons magazines , newspapers , books , music cds all on the endangered species list is all of human culture destined to be disseminated by coax cable and microwave radiation ? if you 'll excuse me , i have to be alone right now
