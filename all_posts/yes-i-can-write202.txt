continuing my experiments in cooking with dandelions , i decided to try this recipe , shared by gen , author of the guest post on suburban gardening , for fried dandelion blossoms first , you collect the blossoms ! dandelion stems are very bitter , so you cut off all the stem , leaving only the flower plus green flower bit thingy underneath it , so that the flower holds together ! then , rinse the blossoms in lightly salted water pat them dry on paper towels for the batter , mix cup flower , cup milk , egg beaten , and teaspoon salt then dip the flowers and fry them in hot oil ! we did n't quite put enough oil to make them deep fried , but you do need a fair bit of oil blotting off any extra grease is always important when frying things , i find annnnd here is the finished product ! ! they were great ! a lovely , fluffy texture and simple but good flavour we did n't feel a need to put anything on them , and just ate them plain ! i really want to get more into foraging this year i'm starting out with one of the most easy to find plants , dandelions , but we 've had our wild edibles plant books out a lot lately , and have taken more out from the library on walks we 've been identifying edible plants , and i think we 're going to start taking a book or two with us on walks , to figure out what the plants we ca n't easily recognize are far beside the fact that i think finding and growing your own food is a much better way to do things than buying stuff from a supermarket , i just find it immensely fun i 'll gleefully dance around outside , gathering yummy food , and have been more involved so far this year in gardening than i 've ever been before i love cooking , and i find i also really , really love being part of the growing and or finding process in the food that i cook i'm looking forward to many gardening and foraging adventures this summer peace , idzie
