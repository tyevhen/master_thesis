i have a friend with depression and anxiety she 's a good friend , a wise friend , and a generous friend she gives freely of her time to assist others in whatever way she can she 's helped me out multiple times she always provides emotional support when i'm low all i have to do is ask unfortunately , my helpful friend has trouble asking for help for herself a few days ago i realized my friend needs help she 's struggling through tears , she finally let out some of what 's been going on lately i was surprised apparently she 's been struggling for awhile , but i did n't know i could n't know what my friend was going through we have n't seen each other lately , as we 've both been busy , and she did n't mention it when i saw her a few days ago , i had an inkling something was n't quite right it was n't , and by the time she let it out , she was really hurting i felt so bad for her i did what i could in that moment i hugged her and let her cry my friend and i are similar in many ways she does n't like to cry anymore than i do i'm not even sure she liked being hugged , but it felt like the right thing to do and like my friend , i often think i should be able to fix things , like my mood , by myself sometimes i wait too long to ask for help my friend waited too long , too , in my humble opinion i want to help my friend i want to hold her and tell her it will be okay i want to help her clean her house , take her dogs for a walk , or cook her a meal but like me , my friend can be fiercely independent , and it 's tough sometimes to get in that frustrates me she 's hurting , and i want to fix it i did ask her how i could help i spent time with her last evening at a local event , but i could do so much more i could do more if my friend would allow it she does n't have to go through this alone i do n't want her to struggle alone , but i guess i ca n't help unless she requests it right ?
