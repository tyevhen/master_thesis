when i ran my motivate me workshops several years ago , there was an exercise i did that shocked many of the ladies sat in the audience it was an eye opener for all of us and a simple visualisation of how we shouldn t wait for the right time before we follow our dreams or action our goals try it for yourself take a cm length of ribbon and a pair of scissors now ask yourself the following question what is the estimated lifespan of an individual ? when we did this exercise , my group decided that years was about right the actual figure is years so they were pretty close if you agree , cut cm off your ribbon and throw it away you now have a length of ribbon that is cm long , which if you are following my logic means we have years of ribbon left , yes ? stick with me how old are you ? i was born in so if i add years to this date , i get as i m this year , i would cut cm off my ribbon that leaves me with cm left years life expectancy let s think for a moment about our weekends , this might be when we set aside time for family , seeing friends and socialising we probably won t be working on our targets over the weekend , and what about all the time we spend asleep ? to cover this , i would need to cut a third off my ribbon my cm length of ribbon is now cm long that equates to years if i started cutting off all the time i spend eating , travelling and on holiday , i would probably be left with about cm of ribbon cm ! that means i have approximately years to achieve everything i want scared yet ? of course , this is based on the fact that i live to be years old anyone who has lost a loved one , especially someone who was young and had their entire life ahead of them , will understand that the final destination isn t set in stone in truth , we don t know how much time we have left if you do this exercise for yourself , or with friends , i urge you to keep the small portion of ribbon you have left to act as a reminder that life is getting shorter and today is the day to live your dreams , accomplish your goals and live your life to the full i d love to hear your thoughts on this so please leave me a comment in the box below
