jamie scott 's midwinter blues post was the fourth of four unplanned complementary fructose fructan posts on primal muse and evolutionary psychiatry here 's the whole series in case you missed out fodmaps on primal muse ibs , fructose , depression , zinc , and women on evolutionary psychiatry dietary strategies for fructose malabsorption on evolutionary psychiatry midwinter blues on primal muse anyway , i found jamie 's last post both extremely interesting and incredibly expensive he linked this article about sunlight and serotonin , which turned out not to be a paper , but rather the first chapter of the handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin i know most of you might find a new pair of vibrams or hermes perfume or the primal blueprint cookbook primal , low carb , paleo , grain free , dairy free and gluten free an irresistible purchase i have a weakness for impenetrable neurological biochemistry tomes unfortunately my institutional access did not grant me the rights to the chapter which could be purchased for , but i was n't going to pay for a single chapter when i could spend , say , x as much on the whole book hopefully mr dr deans is not reading this post the good news is i get points on my credit card , so eventually i 'll have enough to get a second irobot roomba vacuuming robot , black and silver or maybe even a irobot scooba floor washing robot until then , i have my handbook about serotonin and we 'll start with chapter one evolution of serotonin , sunlight to suicide biochemistry is all about energy and chemical reactions and on planet earth , most of the business of life occurs with chemical reactions driven by sunlight the very first photosynthetic reactions occured with a molecule known as an indole a benzene ring with a pyrrole ring attached it 's not obvious , but that molecule has lots of electrons whizzing around , and the carbon atom at position above is extremely reactive and will lose electrons very easily add light to specific types of indoles , and energy will be created as molecular hydrogen is released it is postulated that this reaction first occurred on earth billion years ago this is the beginning of light based life tryptophan , the dietary amino acid and the rarest amino acid in the diet , according to primal body primal mind empower your total health the way evolution intended and did n't precursor to serotonin , is an indole it happens to be the most fluorescent amino acid under blacklight tryptophan absorbs light energy , and is a vital amino acid for photosynthesis in sea bacteria , algae , and plants the process of photosynthesis creates oxygen from water , using the energy from the electrons whizzing around on tryptophan , among other things this creation of oxygen by photosynthesis changed our planet 's atmosphere and made our lives possible plants evolved a specific energy factory within their cells called a chloroplast , whose function is to capture light for energy , and to create tryptophan chloroplasts are where chlorophyll lives tryptophan is also made in all primitive unicellular organisms and plant systems animals like humans do not make tryptophan and must obtain it through diet the best source for humans is from the meat of other animals , though tryptophan remains tough to get into the brain , as it is the least abundant amino acid in muscle tissue , and it has to compete with all the other more abundant aromatic amino acids tyrosine , phenylalanine , leucine , isoleucine , valine , and methionine for the aromatic amino acid transporter everyone is waiting in the lobby for the elevator , and only a few can ride to the top at a time serotonin is made from tryptophan only in mast cells and neurons however , cells in every single organ have special uptake proteins to capture circulating serotonin from the blood other derivative molecules of tryptophan include melatonin important in the sleep wake cycle , psilocybin the active molecule in psychogenic mushrooms , ergotamine , yohimbine a traditional aphrodisiac , and lsd most of these compounds are active in the human brain because they can stimulate the serotonin receptor a tryptophan based compound called auxin affects cell growth in plants , enabling shoots and leaves to extend out towards the light in order to make serotonin , tryptophan has to go through a couple of enzymatic reactions first , tryptophan hyrodxylase makes tryptophan into htp then tetrahydrobiopterin and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase plus vitamin b and zinc make ht serotonin serotonin is degraded by mao tryptophan hydroxylase may be the oldest enzyme to attach oxygen to other molecules since oxygen is generally quite reactive and toxic biochemically , this was an early way to safely get rid of excess oxygen created by photosythesis in primitive organisms the light receptors in the human and other animal retina are very similar to serotonin receptors and were first thought to evolve a billion years ago serotonin is the oldest neurotransmitter , and the original antioxidant there are different serotonin receptors in the human brain , and serotonin receptors are found in all animals , even sea urchins in other animals , serotonin is involved in swimming , stinging , feeding modulation , maturation , and social interaction in general , it is thought of as a growth factor for animal brains in humans , deficiency of serotonin is implicated in autism , down 's syndrome , anorexia , anxiety , depression , aggression , alcoholism , and seasonal affective disorder light therapy and serotonin increasing medications are both effective treatments for depression that occurs with low levels of sunlight light exposure increases serotonin in humans , and serotonin levels are lowest in midwinter , and higher on bright days no matter what time of year , lux light therapy decreases suicidal ideation tryptophan is an important amino acid , most readily available from animal sources vegetable sources such as pumpkin seeds contain phytic acid which may inhibit its absorption , and its many important derivative molecules work best with plenty of sunlight think of it as your own little bit of photosynthesis sometimes we 're not as different from cyanobacteria as we 'd like to think
