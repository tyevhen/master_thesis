words like bizarre and unexpected hardly suffice when describing the results published this week in pnas one of the most respected journals in all of science by robert h yolken and coworkers from johns hopkins , university of nebraska , and baltimore 's sheppard pratt health system , who wrote about finding a peculiar virus in the noses of a number of individuals the virus they found through dna metagenome analysis was something called atcv , a large dna virus normally associated with the freshwater alga chlorella atcv virions attached to a chlorella cell just to bring you up to date quickly the scientists in question stumbled onto the fact that dna from the atcv virus appears to exist in the noses and throats of a surprising fraction of randomly chosen individuals the study population of people is not large , however , and we should not be too quick to jump to conclusions nevertheless , the mere finding of this virus 's dna in that many people 's noses is shocking , because this is a virus that , until now , was thought to occur only in algae , not higher life forms and certainly not in humans to understand how shocking this is , you have to realize that viruses are generally extremely highly adapted to specific hosts a virus that attacks tobacco plants only attacks tobacco plants a virus that infects bacteria only infects bacteria , and generally only a specific species of bacterium viruses coevolve very closely with their hosts , developing extremely intricate , fine tuned adaptations to a specific organism for a virus to cross species lines let alone kingdoms is unusual , to say the least and thank goodness ! otherwise , you might come down with pox from an insect bite , or get any number of deadly diseases from eating ordinary foods as it turns out , atcv acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus has appeared in this blog once before , back in march , in a post i did called a virus , a worm , and a louse walk into a bar the point of that post ironically was to show that while most virus genes tend to have a great deal of dna homology with their host counterparts , the genes of certain algae viruses actually appear to have greater homology with genes in the human body louse which perhaps should have been a tipoff , of sorts , to the yolken et al findings certainly , it adds more color to the story , knowing as we do that phycodnavirus dna may have have crossed species lines before phycodnavirus is the name scientists have given to the family of large dna viruses that infect algae what do we know about atcv ? it 's fairly large , as viruses go , with a genome of , base pairs , encompasssing as many as genes the fact that the genome has been fully sequenced does n't mean we know how it works , though in fact , we do n't know what most of the genes do some of the genes are as in many king size viruses devoted to dna synthesis functions of a type commonly associated with nuclear expressed genes in the host , meaning that the virus appears well adapted to take over the nucleus of a cell this is not always the case some viruses are adapted to thrive in the cytoplasm , away from the nucleus intriguingly , the yolken group conducted tests of cognitive function among enrollees in its study and found that there was a statistically significant reduction in cognitive ability on the particular measures tested in the group of people that tested positive for atcv to determine if this was just a fluke , researchers evaluated the effects of the virus on mice as it happens , inoculated rodents showed deficits in recognition memory and attention while navigating mazes in other words , exposure to the virus is associated with cognitive deficits in both humans and an animal model this is remarkable , since if true it would suggest that the virus traveled through the blood of humans and mice , crossed the blood brain barrier , gained entry to brain cells , and expressed its dna inside brain cells a type of cell the virus would presumably never encounter in its normal habitat of freshwater marshes and lakes it all sounds and is very unlikely but there you are pnas is one of the most esteemed science journals in the world they published the result it 's as real as can be of course , the work needs to be replicated and extended and i'm sure it will be and i think what we 'll find is that phycodnaviruses have been crossing species boundaries for some time if you go back to my original blog about this , you 'll see an example of a particular gene , encoding a ribonucleoside reductase , in another chlorella virus called pbcv , which shows greater homology to the ribonucleoside reductase of the human body louse than to the same gene in the virus 's normal host , chlorella the homology between pbcv and louse reductases is , versus for virus and chlorella these are protein sequence homology numbers if we check the atcv reductase for homology with reductases in other organisms , we find that the highest scoring non viral match occurs not with chlorella the virus 's host , but with lichtheimia corymbifera , a fungus found in soil and decaying plant matter interestingly , this fungus is known to cause pulmonary , cns , and rhinocerebral infection in animals and humans but there is no known association whatsoever between atcv and the fungus one wonders whether the fungus has learned a few tricks from marine viruses or perhaps vice versa ? if you 're wondering how the people in the yolken et al study could have come in contact with atcv , maybe the answer is as simple as taking a drink of water from a mountain stream , or drinking unfiltered water from a well , or swimming in a lake , or perhaps just walking in a marsh suffice it to say , a good deal more remains to be learned regarding the ecology and life cycles of the phycodnaviruses , and cross species infection transfection generally i feel certain the recent results of yolken et al will stimulate a great amount of much needed followup research in the meantime , would you grab me a bottled water ?
