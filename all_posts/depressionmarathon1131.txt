he mentioned his life partner died a year ago that caught her attention it was her first clue she assisted him as he limped into the hallway with his new walker purposefully she asked , how long were you and your partner together ? it was only a slight variation from the routine question she usually asked after all , most of her patients were elderly midwesterners , and relationship longevity seemed to be their most common denominator she loved interacting with these long term couples the enduring love between them was endearingly transparent coming from a splintered family , a couple of foster homes , and her own dissolved relationship , this endearing love and commitment both touched and amazed her she cherished their stories of first dates , old cars , tough times , successful kids , conquered challenges , fulfilled dreams , and world travels fifty , fifty five , and sixty were common answers to her question , but years was the longest relationship she had encountered thus far fifty three years , he said pancreatic cancer , we only had six weeks his voice trailed off the therapist refocused his attention on the task at hand , which was learning to walk with his new hip he was tall , fit and appeared younger than his years he continued , i did n't think i would make it i still miss and then he said it , the pronoun the therapist hoped he 'd feel free to share it was the reason she followed his lead and used the term partner rather than wife him , he said i still miss him terribly , but i have to move on , right ? that 's why i'm here i wanted to get this done and move on i'm so sorry , responded the therapist of course you miss him fifty three years that 's wonderful ! yes , it was , he replied the therapist felt sad , not only for his loss but for the cautiousness he assumed when he revealed his love and loss fifty three years and he still took care before mentioning the person with whom he shared his entire adult life even one year after his partner 's death , he felt her out before he let the therapist in he had no idea she could feel his losses the loss of his partner and his freedom as if they were her own as his therapist she could n't reveal her background or history he may have assumed , but the truth was likely more complicated than he figured she could n't share her deep understanding of his cautiousness or fear she was like him she was , but now she was n't it was confusing even to her at least , she thought , her patient realized she was a safe person with whom he could share she was glad for that when she treated him again , the patient shared more about his life he was an artist , a lawyer , and a concert pianist his partner practiced healthcare with some of the best they met in the army years ago the army , she exclaimed ! that must have been tough ! they knowingly chuckled together , and with a sly smile he simply said , yes as they continued walking he proudly filled in the details of their life together the therapist was thrilled to listen and learn finally , self consciously , he said , i have a picture of him if you 'd like to see it oh , yes , i 'd love to see him , she enthusiastically replied back in his room she set the heavy briefcase beside him on the bed she watched as he removed an object encased in bubble wrap she could n't help but feel sad it was a framed x of him and his partner two older , smartly dressed , smiling gentlemen stood arm in arm in front of one of the patient 's paintings he apologized for the effects of aging and then said , that was on his nd birthday i wish i had known that was the last picture we ever had taken he did n't make it to seventy three looking up from the picture she said , i think you both look great it 's a really nice picture i'm glad you 've got it she handed the frame back , and he removed a tattered picture from his wallet smiling broadly he said , this is what he looked like when we met the therapist eyed the black and white photo it was a picture of a handsome , young , army man i can see what you saw in him , she remarked he 's quite handsome ! he smiled the smile of a sophomore in love i 've carried that picture for years wow , was all she mustered in response he returned the tattered black and white to his wallet then , gently , he re folded the bubble wrap around the x frame closing the wallet , he stacked it atop the re wrapped frame and placed them both inside the heavy briefcase he closed the case , latched the latch , and locked the lock his love , pride , and grief emanated as he handed the case back to the therapist thank you , she humbly murmured thank you , he replied , for taking an interest and letting me share that with you for a moment they clasped hands she felt honored and sad as she placed the briefcase , which encased the love and loss of his still cautious life , back inside the closet
