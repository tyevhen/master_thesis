when i volunteered to speak about gratitude for my aa group 's anniversary celebration , i had no idea how difficult the topic would be ! i 've been working most of the day on a minute speech , for crying out loud ! and i'm freaking out just a bit ! i 've finally got something put together , but i'm not thrilled with it so i'm pretty nervous about speaking tomorrow night in fact , i ca n't wait until it 's over ! the other focus of my day was working out we 're getting into the middle weeks of our training now , and the workouts are certainly heating up yesterday we did a brick , which was a minute spin class followed by minutes of fast running today i ran outside for minutes and then went to the gym for the strength and ab portion of the program my legs are tired ! actually , my whole body is tired tomorrow , thankfully , i 've only got a minute bike ride , and then it 's on to a jam packed weekend well , i'm off to practice my speech one more time i know whatever happens , it will be okay i could n't be speaking to a more forgiving audience i have to try to remember that tomorrow night wish me luck !
