you know what i am talking about when i say , it was one of those moments that changed a relationship forever those of us living with kennedy 's disease might have a few more than most people , but we all have them when i read the following story written by stan highe , another one of us living with the disease , i knew it had to be a guest post on my blog it immediately struck home and made me flash on several pivotal moments in my life that a relationship changed because of the progression of the disease arm wrestling for food stan highe i knew i had kennedy 's for some time , as did my family , but it did n't matter i decided a long time ago that i would do what i could when i could while i still could , any way i could this is just one of many stories , but sticks with me the most when you are parent with school aged kids , there is always something to do after school it might be dance , a play , sports , scouts or any number of other activities often we would not get home until nine or ten o'clock even though it was late , and we were tired , we always seemed to be hungry , for anything this was one of those nights just like the others before we just got home from a scout meeting , and as always , the first stop was the refrigerator it was a race between my son and i who would get there first to grab the choice snack or leftover would n't you know it , we both had our eye on the last piece of apple pie , and so the contest began to decide who would get it , we 'd arm wrestle for it this was one of those moments of father son bonding that i had to take advantage of while i can my son was only twelve and a little smaller than me , but already out weighed me that is really no surprise since i have only weighed about all my life i am one of those people that have trouble keeping weight on still , i had the strength , or so i thought like so many times before , my son and i lay down on the living room floor and assumed the position of course , my wife and daughter knew what was going to happen and were already laughing my son had that same smile on his face he always got he knew i 'd eventually give in after a few minutes and let him have the tasty treat anyway so , we started , hands and arms locked , but something felt different this time in past competitions , i would get his arm over where it would almost touch the floor , and then let up enough so he could win this time as we lay there , i found i could not push his arm over past mid point i could keep him from moving my arm over , but that was it it seemed like we were there for fifteen or twenty minutes stalemated of course , he 's giggling the whole time , unaware of what is really happening then i started to weaken the pressure was causing my arm to move over more and more , but i could only hold against it i could n't push his arm back the other way a few more minutes passed and my arm went over onto the floor we were done but instead of the usual smile , my son had a puzzled look on his face finally , he says , you did n't let me win that time , dad , did you ? i smiled and said , no , this time you really earned it i do n't know if he realized it maybe he did and did n't let on but i knew what it meant i was getting weaker as he went into the kitchen to claim his prize , i sat in my easy chair and rubbed my arm we would have other moments as father and son in the coming years , but we never arm wrestled for food again i hoped you enjoyed reading stan 's personal story as much as i did his story again points out the emotional impact of the disease on relationships have you experienced one of those moments ? let me know if you have
