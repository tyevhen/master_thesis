struggling along here , i am i 've not even been up to writing in this blog i apologize for that i wish things were moving along more evenly and briskly , but that 's not been the case i'm still struggling with my energy , my mood , and my motivation all three remain quite low and that makes getting through each day quite a challenge i'm doing my best , but my best does n't feel very good right now i'm continuing my twice weekly ect treatments i'm not sure they 're making a difference anymore , but i'm tolerating them very well , and the other option , which would be discontinuing ect , is n't palatable either i plan to continue for a few more treatments and hope for an upswing in my mood i'm also back at work i worked two , hour days last week one day was a bit overwhelming , but the other day went well i'm scheduled to work a couple of hour shifts later this week , too it 's nice to be back working with patients and my co workers have all been fabulous to return to i miss working when i'm stuck at home i'm looking forward to feeling better and better so i can get back to a regular employment schedule i'm looking forward to feeling better so i can exercise more intensely as well i'm doing my best to eat better and ride my stationary bike however , the ect treatments do seem to be taking a physical toll , as i'm less tolerant of exercise than i was previously but i can ride for minutes at a time , so i 've been trying to do that at least once per day regardless of how impossible it seems in the moment i 'd be lying if i said i was n't frustrated with where i'm at i 'd like to have more energy , feel more motivated , and have a much improved mood by now but that 's not reality when the frustration sets in i'm trying to remind myself this is a temporary situation i try to reflect on how far i 've come in just a few short weeks rather than focus on what i 've yet to accomplish it 's difficult i'm a bit of a perfectionist , and i do n't like feeling low but i 'll continue to push forward to the best of my ability it may be a struggle , but i'm not giving up yet prayers are always appreciated
