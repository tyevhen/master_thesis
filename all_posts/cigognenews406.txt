i have written about the critical window for several decades i want to reiterate why it is such an important idea it has to do with the imprint let us suppose you have been totally unloved from birth on , no touching , no care , only neglect that unloved reality is engraved and remains for a lifetime now you marry a carrying , loving person but because you feel unloved you require superhuman caring which no one can fulfill and sooner or later you will divorce because you imagine he does not love you and you believe her demands are over the top you see your mate through the prism of your childhood and cannot escape it all because you were not loved during the critical window the time when a biologic need must be fulfilled according to evolutionary development that evolution dictates what needs have to be fulfilled , when and how they should be fulfilled an example the child is never touched but the parent says you know i love you , only i can t show it well , the need to be held and caressed is paramount in biology from birth on after that the basic evolutionary need is closed for business and another need may take its place later on to be talked and listened to the notion of the critical window means your time is up , and that need can never be filled after that you can be touched by your adult partner all day long but it can never replace the need and fulfillment when you were five years old that deprivation is now an imprint and the only way we can open it up is to feel that need again as that child ! everything in the present is symbolic fulfillment it is not real even though it looks real i have treated dozens of actresses ask them if they still need the audience to love them and if one night there is not great applause they sink into the funk they are always in feeling the old feeling of being unloved once the pain is imprinted , it is there for life because it is now covered over now by repression we must lift the lid of repression in order to let love in and oddly enough , the only way to do that is feel unloved back then thus , to feel loved now we must feel unloved in our past now we come to psychotherapy and the therapist we are hooked on therapy because we get what we lacked in every session someone who cares , who is warm and understanding and focuses only on you that is unbeatable and unreal and you have to go back for more , because it is an addiction , something that calms and assures us therapy as a pain killer it can only be symbolic because the critical period is long gone there cannot be genuine fulfillment we now need to feel unloved back then for symbolic love the minute we don t get it we fall into pain but fulfillment that happened during the critical window lasts forever and that is a major difference it all revolves around the notion of the imprint and the critical window remember , we cannot love neurosis away no matter how much we would like to let s look at the critical window in animals it exists in nearly every animal form this is not some theoretical concoction i manufactured to prove a point it is purely biologic and has all the constraints of our biology the critical window in the first days of a mouse s life is equal to six months of our lives and i leave it to you to extrapolate the implications , but there is a critical window for mice to feel loved otherwise they are doomed for life in order to stave off anxiety , for example , the mouse needs a nurturing mother and she must be loving nuzzling , licking , etc , during those days in order to turn on the genes that will stop anxiety but if the mother is unloving and indifferent to her baby in that period , the genes never gets turned on and the baby will be anxious thereafter afraid of new situations , not curious , and hesitant for this baby , painkilling drugs do help , which shows that lack of love produces pain now the offspring becomes addiction prone there was a study of mice who were not loved early on , and they took to alcohol quicker and longer than their loved pals if we do not understand the concept of the imprint and critical window we cannot understand what mental and emotional illness is all about yes , we need a kind warm environment but that is limited it eases our pain and helps us function but does nothing at all to change the imprint that drives us the imprint that may kill us prematurely
