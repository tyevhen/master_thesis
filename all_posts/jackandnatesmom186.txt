about all i have the energy to say is that jack 's assessment at children 's national medical center has been completed physical exam , ecg , bloodwork , play assessment and iq test he did very well and even handled the blood draw without too much freaking out i will never again agree to do appts at children 's and at kennedy krieger in days ever again it 's not just trying to physically endure it while still working , it 's how emotionally exhausting it is to go through these things with the kids i am proud of both of them , and i am sure they are tired too the fact remains that mommy is the only one that went to all three appointments and my brain is officially fried but mission accomplished , and hopefully this fried feeling is temporary , so it 's worth it but like i said , never again
