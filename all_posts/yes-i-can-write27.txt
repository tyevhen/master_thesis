i ve been wanting to write this post all of june , since it s pride month , and today on a day when my social media dashes are blowing up with rainbows over the legalization of same gender marriage in the united states seems like a pretty good time ! first thing you should know ? i m queer what does that mean to me ? basically that i have the capacity to be attracted to , get crushes on , and fall in love with people of any gender i m pretty much as out as i can be in most areas of my life i even make a point of saying i m queer on my unschooling facebook page every now and then , and i lose likes every single time i ve had people say it s inappropriate to talk about what i do in the bedroom which is such a ridiculous statement , since i ve never said anything more than i did just now in this post i m queer i m into people of all different genders it s not about sex it s about who i like and love , and how welcome and how safe i feel in any given group it s about the internal struggles i ve had to go through to accept this part of myself that i didn t see reflected anywhere around me , that caused a lot of anxiety and fear and a little bit of shame , too it s about how i present myself , how i want to be seen and understood , how i experience the world it s a part of my identity my queerness doesn t wholly define me of course it doesn t but it is part of what defines me as a person , a piece of the idzie puzzle and as with many positive things in my life , unschooling had something to do with where i m at now more specifically , the unschooling community , and all the queer friends i made in it at a crucial time in my life i was really questioning my identity in my late teens , and there were so many patient , supportive new friends who listened to my fears , validated my feelings , and assured me that i didn t have to attain some pinnacle of queer perfection to identify as such basically ? i met a bunch of people who understood what i was feeling , and who welcomed my confusedly queer self with open arms so on this day , a landmark occasion in the us , i figured i d take the time to be even more out , and to remind people that you re surrounded by lgbtqia people , whether you know it or not don t make assumptions about who people are and who they like based on their perceived gender don t assume your children are straight and cisgender leave space in your words and actions for people of all stripes , so that when someone you love is ready to start sharing more of their true selves , they ll know you re there to listen and support them happy pride month everyone ! you might also like being a good parent and a good person means being youth rights , community , and why everyone should care this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and against the current talk from the toronto unschooling linkwithin
