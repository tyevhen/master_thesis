knowing something is in the future is not the same as dealing with it i found that out yesterday in a moderate burst of clarity and energy i cancelled my entries into the new york city marathon and the houston marathon i cancelled the hotel reservations and my nyc flight , too thankfully , i had yet to purchase a plane ticket for houston it did n't matter , the lost money was not really on my mind the lost opportunities were these events were more than just opportunities to run great marathons in wonderful cities several friends from the local running community are also traveling to these races , so two more opportunities to spend time with people i enjoy in energizing and positive atmospheres are also gone there 's more to marathon running than running miles so much more shortly after making all the appropriate phone calls and pushing all the necessary buttons , my mood did take a hit as i explained to my therapist , knowing i was n't going did n't seem to matter taking the actions to actually cancel everything was difficult making it all official really sucked and it really hurt the hurt is all tied up with apprehension and dread at this point , i do n't know if my right achilles will heal i do n't yet know if i will ever be able to run again , much less run a marathon ! i'm missing the thing i love to do the most i'm missing everything about it there 's more to running than just running , and there 's no guarantee i will ever enjoy all the joy and benefits which running has provided ever again that 's scary i'm trying not to be afraid i'm trying to focus on the strides i 've been making i'm tolerating spinning classes and walks with jet with little negative aftereffects that 's hopeful i'm vigilantly working on my stretching and strengthening i'm not anywhere near running , but i'm holding onto the hope this thing will eventually heal i'm focusing my long term vision on running i have to believe i will run again i 'll certainly do everything within my power to make that happen i ca n't waste my energy on fear missing out on the experiences of new york and houston is tough being left behind is a reminder of how far i have yet to go cancelling everything made it all very real but it is what it is , right ? i'm battling i need to continue to battle that 's my plan thank you for your support , my friends
