may all of us remember with love and compassion this day may we grieve with those who still mourn , and share memories with those who cannot forget may we draw strength from those who bravely responded , and gave their lives to save others may we stand with strangers who became neighbours that day , and remember their generosity and hospitality above all god may we remember your faithfulness and learn to trust in your unfailing love christine stine
