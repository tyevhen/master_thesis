you harm anyone , no matter the age , by depriving them of their biologic needs so you abuse a fetus by not recognizing her needs and what are they ? we can tell because we have seen those needs in action in therapy sessions , and the screaming and agony when they go unfulfilled we do not have to theorize about them if we do not know them then there will be deprivation and harm we see the terrible impact when the baby is left alone after birth , and is not held , caressed or touched we see the pain and the result further , in later reliving , we see its lifelong effects the inability to be alone , the nagging emptiness of not being with someone , the need to constantly connect either personally or on the phone all to keep that basic aloneness away we can see how the pains pile up and accumulate reaching inordinate heights , and the symptoms that issue from that aching stomach , migraines and high blood pressure further , we see in the reliving that once that terrible aloneness and isolation has been felt , so much changes both psychologically and biologically and we also know that we do n't get to those imprints until months into the therapy the earlier the pain the more time it takes to reach , as it should be since the more remote the event the more painful it will be and from what i have seen , the imprints from just after conception cannot be seen or often even imagine but they set down their seeds in the earliest formation of cells and those are the most difficult to find and the most difficult to conceptualize and treat , but they may be behind schizophrenia , alzheimer s and some cancers these may be the deepest imbeds , the most remote and ineffable memories engraved in the primitive developing cells we look at them after decades of agitation and try to decipher their causes and how to deal with them but we are long after the fact , and that is the problem the fetus is deprived , first of all , through irresponsible diet by the mother , and then most importantly , the mother is chronically anxious and revs up the baby unrelentingly it is this chronic input , un contained and un circumscribed that does its damage it never lets up , and the baby 's resources can no longer cope this is the harbinger of later disease it is not one fixed event in time that does the damage it is the unrelenting adversity that does it but when we get the perfect trifecta fetal damage , birth damage and infancy harm , there is little doubt that we have a child whose life will be cut short depriving parents tend to be that way all along the child 's development one way we can predict how long that child 's life will be is by the length of her telomeres , the longer the better for longevity the mother 's stress level shortens her telomeres and , i assume , that of the fetus as well your projected lifespan is already set inside the womb that is where the great early harm takes place a fetus who has not way to escape the harm but sets there and takes it , day after day children who grow up in orphanages have very short telomeres and that tendency goes on into adult life it does not have to be in institution a divorcing mother can suffer continuously and over stimulate the baby and we know that the higher the stress hormone level , cortisol , the shorter the telomeres worse , those who had shorter telomeres in childhood could often count on diseases such as cancer in adulthood three times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer and this , i believe , begins during womb life and sets the stage of arcane and recondite illness later on so telomere length is a good index of disease later on those with chronic shorter telomeres were far more likely to end up alzheimer s the point is that those mothers who were heavily stressed during pregnancy had shorter telomeres , which finally affected the offspring thus the remote life endangering events are the very imprints that become life endangering in adult life it is a memory of near death that again can put you near death later on , so long as that memory is not relived and extirpate from the system stress , or deprivation of need , which is the same thing , imprints a molecular mark that trails us for life that is the culprit we must deal with and that is the culprit that is so evasive because it is of such early provenance few of us can imagine that time span few of us can investigate and see the fetal imprint , yet it is there before our eyes if we know how to look at it so we ask patients about their childhood , and usually go not further we leave out real basic causes and content ourselves with what may be obvious it is the non obvious that is the killer
