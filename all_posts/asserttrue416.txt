dna is full of surprises , one of them being the radically different ways in which it can be used to express information we think of dna as a four letter language a , t , g , c , but some organisms choose to speak mostly g and c others avoid g and c , preferring instead to speak a and t the question is , if dna is fundamentally a four letter language , why would some organisms want to limit themselves to dialects that use mostly just two letters ? the dna of clostridium botulinum the botulism bug a common soil inhabitant is extraordinarily deficient in g and c over of its dna is a and t the soil bacterium anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans , on the other hand , has dna that 's g and c think of the constraints this puts on a coding system imagine that you want to store data using a four letter alphabet , but you are required to use two of the four letters of the time ! suddenly a two bit per symbol encoding scheme a four letter code starts to look and feel a lot more like a one bit per symbol two letter scheme what kinds of information are actually stored in dna ? several kinds , but bottom line , dna is primarily a system for specifying sequences of amino acids the information is stored as three letter words gca , atg , tcg , etc called codons there are possible length words in a system that uses a letter alphabet fortunately , there are only amino acids i say fortunately , because imagine if there were different amino acids as there might be in extra terrestrial life , say and they had to occur in roughly equal amounts in all proteins every possible codon would have to be used in roughly equal numbers and there would be no possibility of an organism like c botulinum developing a preference for a or t in its dna it is precisely because only codons out of a possible need be used that organisms like c botulinum with a huge imbalance of at vs gc in its dna can exist as it happens , all organisms do tend to use all possible codons , but they use them with vastly varying frequencies , giving rise to codon dialects note that the mapping of codons onto amino acids means some codons are necessarily synonymous for example , there are four different codons for glycine and six for leucine you might expect that an organism like c botulinum with mostly a and t in its dna would speak in a and t rich codons and you 'd be right here 's a chart showing which codons c botulinum actually uses , and at what frequencies the green highlighted codons are the ones c botulinum uses preferentially with the usage frequencies shown as precentages as you can see , the most often used codons tend to contain a lot of a and or t which is exactly what you 'd expect , given that the organism 's dna is a and t in theory , a letter word in a letter language can store six bits of information but we know from information theory that the actual information content of a word depends on how often it 's used if i send you a word e mail that contains the question why ? repeated times , you 're not really receiving the same amount of information as would be in a word e mail that contains text in which no word appears twice the average information content of a c botulinum codon is easily calculated using the usage frequencies shown above all you do is calculate f logf for each codon and add up the results if you do the math , you find that c botulinum uses an average of bits per codon , about short of the theoretical six bits available one might imagine that the more gc at imbalanced an organism 's dna is , the more biased its codon preferences will be this is exactly what we find if we plot codon entropy against genome g c content for a range of organisms having dna of various g c contents average codon entropy versus genome g c content for microorganisms in the above graph , you can see that when an organism 's dna is composed of equal amounts of the bases g c , a t , the organism tends to use all codons more or less equally , and entropy approaches the theoretical limit of six bits per codon but when an organism develops a particular dialect of gc rich dna , or at rich dna , it starts using a smaller and smaller codon vocabulary more and more intensively this is what causes the curve to fall off sharply on either side of the graph if you have an observant eye , you may have noticed that the two halves of the graph are not symmetrical , even though they look symmetrical at first glance organisms on the high gc side are using slightly less entropy per codon than low gc organisms , for a given amount of genome gc at skew if you 're a biologist , you might want to think about why this is so i 'll return to the subject in a future post
