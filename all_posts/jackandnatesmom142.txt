i am very blessed to have the readers that i do you all are for the most part very supportive and nonjudgemental and i really appreciate that today i appreciate it even more yesterday i wrote about jenny mccarthy i stand by what i said , and i do n't think that anything i said would be considered shocking to the average autism parent i posted a link to my blog in the comments section of an article about this issue on slate com the article was calling for readers to boycott the view because of jenny mccarthy the anti vaxxer http www slate com blogs bad astronomy the view daytime talk show hires antivaxxer jenny mccarthy html never in my life have i been in the presence of such antagonistic , pot stirring cranky people people who very clearly have little to no experience with autism within minutes of posting the article , i was told i was moderating my stupidity , that i was not interested in science , i was accused of claiming to be a medical expert i was told that jenny mccarthy 's son was never autistic , that she diagnosed him herself that cracks me up , because he received aba , and all of the traditional therapies , was diagnosed by a neurologist , and underwent pretty much every biomedical treatment that money can buy he was lucky that way , mom could afford it yes there is talk that he had landau kleffner syndrome , not autism a common misdiagnosis it 's not for me to say or anyone else if the experts do n't know , then we certainly do n't either jenny mccarthy 's website is called generationrescue org it has a link to find a doctor http www generationrescue org recovery find a doctor search here is her page on vaccination http www generationrescue org resources vaccination i see nothing in here that states that she recommends not vaccinating your children looks to me like she is telling people to educate themselves , look at their family history , and consider their options she recommends visiting the website for the national vaccine information center http www nvic org ask eight questions aspx and she recommends that you answer these questions with regard to your family before you vaccinate i understand that people feel she is anti vaccine and who knows , maybe that is her personal view however this is her professional website , this is the platform she presents to the world , and in my eyes , it is not dangerous once again , i am not saying i agree with or support her but the more i read , the more it seems that people are taking her ideals and blowing them way out of proportion i also think that giving one individual this much power that she is a public health risk , yada yada is a tad dramatic yes , she is in the public eye do people realize that she served as a spokesperson for taca www taca org for years ? her personality may be a bit severe at times , but people are taking her stance on vaccines , twisting it , and turning her into a villain and it 's just not true i sure as heck wish i had educated myself a bit more before i vaccinated would my kids still have their vaccines ? i can say without question that the answer is yes i just may have gone about it in a different way
