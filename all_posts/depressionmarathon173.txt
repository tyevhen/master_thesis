i'm just back from a crisp , seven mile , christmas morning walk with my boy , jet we usually spend time running , or as was the case this year , walking on christmas day i like the quiet , practically solitary time together in the city in our hour , minute walk , we only passed two other people and very few cars we had the city to ourselves it was very peaceful it 's just me and jet this christmas , as it has been for many christmases previously i'm okay with that my parents are in florida for the winter , and my brothers all share the day with their own children and extended families i will go to dinner at a friend 's house later this afternoon , but until then i am enjoying the freedom to do what i want , without expectations , and the quiet after work yesterday , i spent some time with a few friends the topic of discussion eventually turned to mental illness , and specifically depression , as several of my friends are fellow sufferers christmas can be a difficult time of year for those of us with mental illness for many reasons dysfunctional or distant families , difficult family memories , friends occupied with their own families , or time away from work and out of one 's normal routine leave many feeling isolated and alone during the holidays i get that i feel very grateful to be feeling well , and at peace , during this christmas season i like the path i am currently on , and i'm feeling hopeful for the future i wish all of you peace and serenity today remember to take care of yourself first , especially if you find this season difficult or challenging take time for yourself , manage expectations , and find gratitude wherever possible create your own traditions and most importantly have a safe , healthy , happy day merry christmas , my friends !
