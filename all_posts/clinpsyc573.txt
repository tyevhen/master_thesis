from the new england journal of medicine nov , allistair wood said it is eye opening to review the list of the top selling drugs and recognize how few of them show any evidence of superiority over generic drugs , even though billions of dollars are spent on them this is truly an indictment of our prescribing practices ya think ? i suppose someone needs to point out the obvious physicians are smart people , almost by definition , yet prescribing practices are often nonsensical who can really claim that advertising to consumers and physicians , providing travel junkets for physicians , and provding free merchandise and free meals for physicians and their staff and the list goes on does not lead to incredibly wasteful prescribing practices ?
