drug may help overwrite bad memories sciencedaily may , recalling painful memories while under the influence of the drug metyrapone reduces the brain 's ability to re record the negative emotions associated with them , according to university of montreal researchers at the centre for studies on human stress of louis h lafontaine hospital the team 's study challenges the theory that memories cannot be modified once they are stored in the brain metyrapone is a drug that significantly decreases the levels of cortisol , a stress hormone that is involved in memory recall , explained lead author marie france marin manipulating cortisol close to the time of forming new memories can decrease the negative emotions that may be associated with them the results show that when we decrease stress hormone levels at the time of recall of a negative event , we can impair the memory for this negative event with a long lasting effect , said dr sonia lupien , who directed the research thirty three men participated in the study , which involved learning a story composed of neutral and negative events three days later , they were divided into three groups participants in the first group received a single dose of metyrapone , the second received double , while the third were given placebo they were then asked to remember the story their memory performance was then evaluated again four days later , once the drug had cleared out we found that the men in the group who received two doses of metyrapone were impaired when retrieving the negative events of the story , while they showed no impairment recalling the neutral parts of the story , marin explained we were surprised that the decreased memory of negative information was still present once cortisol levels had returned to normal the research offers hope to people suffering from syndromes such as post traumatic stress disorder our findings may help people deal with traumatic events by offering them the opportunity to 'write over' the emotional part of their memories during therapy , marin said one major hurdle , however , is the fact that metyrapone is no longer commercially produced nevertheless , the findings are very promising in terms of future clinical treatments other drugs also decrease cortisol levels , and further studies with these compounds will enable us to gain a better understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the modulation of negative memories my comments i think that if you deprived anyone of the elements that go to make up anxiety or stress , you can diminish the reaction the same if you suppress or cut out key brain areas , you also diminish the response to pain and this is what emdr does you conger up an old painful memory and then the therapist distracts you so that you cannot fully react , and it is called cure here , what is blocked is the anxiety alert vigilance chemicals so you trick the body what are they doing ? preventing a full reaction you have an aborted reaction here one is chemically prevented from retrieving the memory of course , if we cut out reactivity we are also a bit less human
