i remember very well almost like it was yesterday i believe most of us remember where we were when it happened my wife and i were watching abc news that morning when the first report was aired along with the video we were stunned it was unbelievable that a plane could fly into the tower minutes later , when the second plane did its damage , we were both speechless this couldn t be happening not here throughout the rest of the day we watched the ongoing reports of the events unfolding including a third plane and a fourth for days afterward , it was the only conversation we grieved together everything else seemed so inconsequential we came together as a nation then , just as we did after pearl harbor why does it take something of that magnitude to make us all realize united we stand divided we fall ? when politicians try to separate us into groups making us feel one is better than the other , they do more harm than good it is easy to segregate us by focusing on the differences by doing so , they try to fortify their own ranks to gain a following and votes these people who want to be our country s leaders seem to forget that first , and foremost , we are americans many of our ancestors , as well as many who arrive today , came to this country because they were different or not accepted in their homelands they came because they saw something in america that wasn t available where they previously lived yes , we are not a perfect nation there is no such thing and , yes , we are an evolving nation we are only years old and still have a long way to go but , we will never become better as long as we focus on our differences strength comes through unity and , no matter what , i believe we are one nation under god photo lucas franco
