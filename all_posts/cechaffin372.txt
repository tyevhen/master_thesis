in my logopoetry essays i divided poetry into a mandala of form , substance , meaning , and feeling with the intersection of the four being the center of artistic excellence now i have been visited with a second mandala , whose four corners are inductive , deductive , open , and closed i do n't know how to reproduce it here in the blog , but just imagine that the following five elements are spread at degrees from each other with 'x' in the middle for the intersection of the mandala deductive closed x open inductive deductive poems use figures of speech to support their assertions , however surreal inductive poems spring from an actual experience that generates elaboration open poems invite the reader to join the author in his journey , avoiding easy conclusions closed poems end with a summarizing statement , however disguised by technique , wrapping the work in a nice red bow keats' ode to a grecian urn is proof that closed poems can be great and ought not to be despised , even in our present relativistic culture yeats writes many closed poems , like byzantium there is likely no poet more open in english than emily dickinson , whose insights are so subtle and stuttering you feel like you 're dancing with a shy wallflower until you see her great heart and intelligence eliot 's early work , like prufrock , is more open , though certainly deductive his later work is more closed , especially four quartets shakespeare 's sonnets are almost entirely deductive , using figures of speech instead of surrendering to the experience of the moment , and mainly closed as well and spenser and johnson are in the same club , while donne can be more inductive , as in the flea closed and deductive were the expectation of those times wordsworth could be inductive or deductive , though his early work strives to be inductive , as in tintern abbey , and especially the prelude , while the lucy poems , for instance , are deductive coleridge was more deductive , even in natural settings as in this lime tree bower my prison elizabeth bishop was best when inductive , as in the moose , or fish houses , or the fish strand is mainly deductive , though often disguised but his settings are mainly created like stage scenery wallace stevens is mainly deductive as well but is he open or closed ? i think more open in his uncertainty matthew arnold is closed and deductive , a combination that puts his poetry out of favor in this age same for pope , dryden and johnson same for milton shelley often transformed the inductive into the deductive , by exalting an experience , especially of nature , into an epiphany that exceeds the experience ode to the west wind blake is almost purely deductive but is he closed ? i think his childlikeness makes him open even when a poem , like the sick rose , tells us the entire story we want to leap into childhood with him and his diction despite his rhetoric , he is more open than closed he wants us to believe in his world , and it shows zymborska is mainly open , though she can be inductive and deductive , like most poets , though i think if we analyzed all poets , most would tilt towards one quality or the other rilke was mainly deductive in his sonnets for orpheus , but more inductive in his duino elegies neruda , without reviewing him in detail , strikes me as beyond these classifications in general , but later in his career , as a dogmatic communist , he wrote more closed and deductive poems his best work is open i will stop here perhaps i 'll write an essay about these four corners , perhaps not if an editor wants it , i 'll likely do it but that requires a query letter , which i find tedious and am loathe to write any editor who visits these pages need only drop me a note and i will flesh out my theories for her pleasure anyway , i wanted to share this alternative approach in understanding poetry which is complimentary to my logopoetry essays , still available in the melic archives food for thought i 'd like to hear your thoughts ! ce
