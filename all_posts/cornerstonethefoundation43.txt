learning to live with the unexpected onset of a disability or chronic illness is a challenge i lost all hearing in my left ear at the beginning of combined with the thunderously loud tinnitus , i felt as though my head was submerged in deep water i was forced to rely upon my right ear , my bad ear my left ear felt like a lump of dead flesh on the side of my head , a sensation exaggerated by the fact that i could no longer hear any sound when i rubbed my hand against the ear one of the worst aspects of the disability was that i became extremely self conscious , always aware that something was out of kilter i was disturbed by the fact that so many of my thoughts gravitated around me and my situation , instead of upon jesus and those around me being the master procrastinator that i am , i delayed making another appointment with the ear specialist and spent the new few months learning how to live with the disability social gatherings became almost impossible , but my church friends made special allowances for me i remember going to a home group meeting , and as the church was a japanese language christian church , the minister was speaking in japanese one of the other australian guys , who spoke japanese , came over to translate what the minister was saying for me which is your good ear ? he asked kindly , and then stood at my right side being unable to function as part of a team , i resigned as the church pianist , a step i had been loath to take as i been a church pianist for almost twenty years i also stopped listening to music , since hearing music in one ear instead of in stereo was unbearable i think this was one of the hardest things to get used to , as music has always been one of my greatest passions i kept trying to talk to people at church , but felt like a freak because i had to turn my head sideways so my right ear could hear them who wants to talk to someone s ear ? there was one funny thing , though one of my friends in the church was deaf in her right ear sometimes we would stand side by side and attempt to converse with the other , yet not be aware of it at first we had a good laugh and swapped sides so that i stood with my right side towards her left one thing that helped me greatly was something i had learned while recovering from depression back in the early s my counselor had taught me that to be in deep surrender to god really meant to never look back with regret upon the past , nor forward to any wish in the future comparing ourselves to what we used to be , or what we wanted to be , was a hindrance for resting in god 's will each day i was to pray i'm content to be who you made me to be , today i'm content to be where you put me today , and i'm content to be how you made me to be today these past few weeks i have been reading one liter of tears , a young girl s fight for life , the diary of aya kito , published by ibc , from the age of fourteen years , aya began exhibiting the symptoms of incurable degenerative disease , spinocerebellar degeneration the disease acts as a prison , as the person retains full mental capacity although they progressively lose all physical control i was moved to see aya s mother give that same advice to her my mom and i talked about my future according to my mom , unlike people who cannot see or are handicapped , the things you were able to do before never leaves your mind you think hard about why you ca n't do it anymore , and you become emotional so it always starts with the struggle in your mind even if others may view it merely as a machine like radio exercise , it is actually a struggle in your mind , it s training aya , i think that as long as you live every day to its fullest , you 'll have a future aya , you cry alot , and when i see you cry , i feel so sorry but looking at reality , you have to understand where you are right now and make your life full , or else you 'll never live with your feet on the ground and it is the same advice that paul gave us , one of the theme verses of my life i know what it is to be in need , and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength philippians niv p s an operation in sept restored about mid range hearing to my left ear , and reduced the tinnitus at the moment , i can just get by , though i really need to get myself some hearing aids long story my right ear , however , is slowly getting worse will it last until my sixties , or suddenly go deaf like my left did ? i do not know , but i will not spend today worrying about what might or might not happen tomorrow and should trouble strike in the future , jesus will be there , reading and able to help me cope with it at that time p p s i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday , today and forever , and that his healing power is still available today and although i will never cease asking to be healed of my infirmities , i take care to ensure that my faith and hope is placed in christ , and not in the possibility of being healed for his grace is sufficient for me
