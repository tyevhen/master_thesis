photo taken by code martial lately my work has been unbearable days spent crying in the bathroom , power struggling with my micromanaging boss he seems to win every time and a little part of my freedom or even my job duties are taken away i spend time whispering with others who are struggling about a revolution that can t happen soon enough its to the point where finding another job is starting to sound like a good idea , even though in my position i should just wait it out and hope for the best my last job i was in the same boat and i left to come to this job but i don t have the same luxuries i did then , now right now my emotions are through the roof and i can t control them like i used to i get annoyed so easily and i don t hide all the anger i feel anymore maybe it s funny at home but it s dangerous at work so instead of talking to my boss because i worry about saying something i would definitely regret , i just fester with the hatred today i feel like i have been soaked in this toxic poison called negativity and hatred i reek with it the worst part is that i think my comrades in arms are getting sick of me too they are tired of the complaining , the whispering , and the negativity i m tired of it too it s so unproductive but it seems like every time i try to put on a happy face , turn that frown upside down , or just try to be alone to get away from the situation , my boss pops in with some outrageous request , some conniving power play , or some horrible new thing he is implementing , and it s like he s winding me up like a toy the annoyance starts at the sight of him , the anger starts bubbling up as he speaks , and all i can do is quietly nod and glare so that i don t start having a tantrum the worst part about it is his boss who i should go to talk to about it , loves him , and thinks that we are all just not giving him a chance so there is no point going to talk to her because it will reflect poorly on you as not being a team player , or being insubordinate , etc so here i am sitting at work completely unmotivated , feeling depressed about the situation , with not much i feel like i can do about it then i start thinking about how i don t like me like this , with the poison inside , but i don t know how to get rid of it if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like my story celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip if it 's your birthday , you can be more prone to panic what to do when feeling overwhelmed linkwithin
