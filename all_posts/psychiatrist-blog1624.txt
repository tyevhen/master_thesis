here is the congressional budget office 's analysis of what the costs will be some highlights h r would prohibit group health plans and group health insurance issuers that provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits from imposing treatment limitations or financial requirements for coverage of mental health benefits including benefits for substance abuse treatment that are different from those used for medical and surgical benefits enacting the bill would affect both federal revenues and direct spending for medicaid , beginning in the bill would result in higher premiums for employer sponsored health benefits higher premiums , in turn , would result in more of an employee 's compensation being received in the form of nontaxable employer paid premiums , and less in the form of taxable wages as a result of this shift , federal income and payroll tax revenues would decline the congressional budget office estimates that the proposal would reduce federal tax revenues by billion over the period and by billion over the period social security payroll taxes , which are off budget , would account for about percent of those totals the bill 's requirements for issuers of group health insurance would apply to managed care plans in the medicaid program cbo estimates that enacting h r would increase federal direct spending for medicaid by million over the period and by million over the period in addition , assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts , cbo estimates that implementing h r would have discretionary costs of million in , million over the period , and million over the period under current law , the mental health parity act of requires a more limited form of parity between mental health and medical and surgical coverage that mandate is set to expire at the end of thus , h r would both extend and expand the existing mandate requiring mental health parity cbo estimates that the direct costs of the private sector mandate in the bill would total about billion in , and would grow in later years that amount would significantly exceed the annual threshold established by umra million in , adjusted for inflation in each of the years that the mandate would be in effect their analysis does not appear to take into effect the increased tax revenue resulting from increased wages and productivity from improved mental health treatment , nor does it seem to reflect the reduction in state and federal payments for uninsured individuals resulting from folks reaching their current discriminatory maximums this analysis seems a little incomplete , judging from the summary
