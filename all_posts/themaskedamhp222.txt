it was on a friday afternoon in november it was raining outside i was looking forward to the weekend then the phone rang miranda was she lived alone in her own bungalow she had never been married she had a long history of involvement with mental health services , and had been transferred to the older people s mental health service when she became she had a history of detention under the mental health act , had had many admissions over the years , and had variously been diagnosed with psychosis and bipolar affective disorder she was currently on an interesting combination of an antipsychotic , two mood stabilisers and an antidepressant she had been seen a month ago by her consultant , who had suggested an admission to hospital , which she had politely declined earlier in the week she had been seen by a gp who had diagnosed a suspected urinary tract infection and had prescribed her an antibiotic her community nurse had been to see her earlier in the afternoon she had found miranda working her way through a bottle of wine , writing a list of music she wanted playing at her funeral she passed her a suicide note , and asked for her favourite gp to sign her death certificate after the weekend she was not prepared to go into hospital i spoke to the duty gp , who had not seen her today , but was prepared to come out if required i talked things over with her nurse , and we decided to visit her together so that i could make at least an initial assessment the nurse had arranged for a bed to be available if needed we stood outside miranda s bungalow in the november rain , waiting for her to answer the door she looked at us both , then let us in , seeming resigned to a visit from mental health professionals she had finished the bottle of wine , and now had a glass of ginger wine in her hand although her bungalow was cluttered and somewhat neglected , she had a high quality sound system in her living room , with piles of classical cd s covering most available surfaces bach s mass in b minor , sung by the sixteen , filled the room tears were flowing silently down her face she was still working on the list of music for her funeral it was tasteful but melancholy music bach , handel , four , and some solemn , mournful medieval plainsong for the most part miranda , i said gently , what s happened ? why are you feeling like this ? she told me she had been feeling bad for a few days and that she did not know why she could not think of any incident or trigger she subscribed to a postal cd company , and had received the cd she was playing that morning when i have listened to it to the end , i will end my life , she said slowly and with the exaggerated dignity that only the intoxicated can manage since it spread over two cd s and lasted nearly two hours , i estimated that we had some breathing space at least things were stacking up against her as i had gone through the bungalow , i had noticed that her bed was piled high with junk , and had clearly not been slept in for some time i went into the kitchen to talk to the nurse , and she showed me miranda s empty fridge there was evidence that she was neglecting herself the nurse told me that miranda did not usually drink , so her drinking today was perhaps a symptom of her underlying mental condition rather than the cause i was unhappy about the odd assortment of medication she was taking , and thought that a review of her medication would be a good idea i was also mindful of the effect a urinary tract infection might be having on her mood and general mental state what was clear was that she did need to be in hospital for assessment and treatment , and for her own safety it was too dangerous to leave her over the weekend she seemed to have every intention of killing herself before the weekend was out i was prepared to use compulsion if need be , but wanted her to have the opportunity to preserve her dignity miranda , i said to her i think you need to go into hospital for a while you know what my function is you know i can detain you under the mental health act if i need to but i really don t want to do that you will have more control over your admission and stay if you go in voluntarily can i take my music with me ? she asked the nurse nodded yes you can there won t be any problem , if you have a portable cd player and headphones miranda looked into my eyes then she looked down very well , she said her community nurse and i helped her pack an overnight bag and we found a portable cd player she got into the back of the car , with her nurse sitting next to her miranda seemed relieved , if anything she talked about the music she loved and gradually her tears dried we took her uneventfully to hospital
