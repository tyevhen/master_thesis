genes get around sometimes they go from organism to organism to organism take gene ecb of e coli b , for example this baby 's been around the world pristionchus pacificus the handsome guy on the right is a nematode , magnified here about times by outward appearances , ecb is just another hypothetical protein gene which is genomic for we do n't know what the heck this thing does , one of genes of unknown function in e coli b but here 's the funny thing and boy is it odd if you copy the dna sequence of that gene and translate it into an amino acid sequence using the online translation tool at http web expasy org translate , you 'll get six different translations of the sequence , based on the six possible reading frames in which you can parse dna one of the six translations , namely the reverse translation expasy org calls it '' frame looks like this syrasgciaafqdasmlmrinhdpvrthrsaalgnatidhhfavnaravslqykltgfhg dvisglndh fdapdipapgggfvfkpatvrmfchagvrrrrrwceliridsgqrkgslq iaaqtqqhhlltfrwsppcagitraqrqpadpvgfkvarfhptkpvfpvhfgdytyadqi gdkahdfg lcvhrymmtaenlfitscklwyrwyklikg kttnrwinecyesnkf yi c ifkhpgsgtcrmdfhywscynfgddsykstiq this is the amino acid sequence you get by reading the wrong strand of the dna notice there 's pink highlighting every time a sequence begins with the letter 'm' because methionine is associated with the start codon of a gene , but the highlighting ends whenever a hyphen representing a stop codon is encountered if this gene were translated in vivo as shown , it would be in four rather pathetic chunks if this is truly the correct dna strand , we 're looking at a pseudogene but now comes the real magic i promise you , this part is amazing go ahead and select and copy everything in the above sequence from papggg to ykstiq , then go to http www uniprot org ? tab blast and paste the sequence into the blast field , but before you click the blast button , be sure to remove the hyphens from the amino acid sequence , as otherwise you 'll get an immediate error after seconds or so , the blast search will come back with a short list of hits at the very top , with an identity score of , is an uncharacterized protein belonging to pristionchus pacificus parasitic nematode yes , the backwards translated e coli gene is actually a forward gene in a worm it 's not a fake hit or a ruse this is a genuine gene , wrongly annotated as to dna strand in e coli , but definitely existing in both a bacterium and a worm the fact that the amino acid sequence identity is not , not , but is striking confirmation that the gene really exists and is conserved in both organisms you 're probably wondering how an e coli gene gets into a nematode 's dna in the first place i'm glad you asked , because the answer is fascinating the gene , it turns out , originates neither with e coli nor with the nematode if you search online databases , you 'll eventually find that the gene is actually a baseplate assembly protein from the enterobacterial phage fels fels bacteriophage virus the gene occurs in a part of the e coli genome that happens to contain a large cluster of prophage genes recall that viruses can coexist with hosts in two ways the familiar lytic cycle where the virus takes over the host cell , eventually exploding it to release thousands of new virions , or the stealth mode lysogenic cycle , wherein a viral genome integrates itself into a host genome , where it can remain dormant for anywhere from a few hours to all eternity , depending at some point in the past , fels integrated itself into the e coli b genome , where parts of it have remained for probably millions of years , although intriguingly not a single amino acid has changed between the nematode version and the e coli version but how did it get into the worm ? you 're asking well , in the wild , p pacifica likes to hang out with scarabs nematodes are often mistakenly identified as parasites of beetles the truth is , they like to feed on dead beetles , but they do not attack beetles directly rather , the so called dauer larvae of the worm a durable , environmentally hardened larval form bring with them bacterial stealth payloads , some of which are toxic to the beetle and can kill it the dauer larvae patiently wait for the beetle to die so they can begin feeding beetles are in constant contact with dung and enteric bacteria of course , scarabs are dung mongers , and as such , they 're no strangers to the likes of e coli , but the xenorhabdus bacteria carried by nematodes can be deadly to the beetle as it happens , e coli and xenorhabdus are both enteric bacteria , and both carry the ecb gene in fact , some version of this gene exists in a wide variety of enteric bacteria , including members of salmonella , yersinia , klebsiella , and other genera it could be that each bacterium acquired the phage gene separately , through individual lysogeny events , but a more parsimonious view is that the common ancestor of these bacteria acquired the first copy , many millions of years ago , and passed it down through the ages somehow , at some point , the gene for the phage baseplate protein made its way into a nematode 's reproductive cells nematodes can feed on microorganisms , and it 's possible a nematode engulfed an infected bacterium infected with the fels phage , a bacterium that then underwent lysis inside the nematode host cell , releasing thousands of virions fels brings with it its own recombinases and integrases , enzymes that would have facilitated transfer of the phage dna to the nematode by chance , the baseplate gene stuck why a baseplate gene ? who knows phage proteins are often multifunctional , and what appears to be nothing more than a structural protein a baseplate protein can sometimes turn out to play other roles no doubt , the so called baseplate protein plays some kind of useful role for pristionchus pacificus and for the various bacteria in which the gene exists today otherwise , according to evolutionary theory , the gene would have been lost eons ago one thing seems likely the gene has probably been around a very long time , probably as long as dung pushing beetles and the nematodes that eat them when they die have been pushing balls of dung and that 's a long , long time indeed if you enjoyed this post , please share the link with a friend thanks !
