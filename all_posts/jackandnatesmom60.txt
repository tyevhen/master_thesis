i woke up this morning to discover that my post memantine one week in , http jackandnatesmom blogspot com memantine one week in html has become my most frequently read post ever what this tells me is that parents are desperate for information on the drug and interested in trying it in their children with autism unfortunately , the study that we participated in was prematurely to us closed because forest labs had enough data so they screwed the families that had committed to the study and spent countless hours doing assessments , lab work , interviews , and ummm driving not that i'm still bitter or anything so here is some info on namenda i posted right before we started the study here is some anecdotal info on namenda oh , and i should mention that this study , which is taking place at multiple centers nationwide , just increased it 's enrollment from participants to seems it is pretty promising http autismliveshere com namenda month https imfar confex com imfar webprogram paper html here is the study we are participating in http clinicaltrials gov ct show nct i am not a fan of giving my child drugs that being said , this year has been very very difficult for both myself and jack 's father to watch his difficulties in the school setting are almost painful to see , and knowing how smart he is and knowing how much the noise is getting in the way of him functioning at the level he is capable of is just awful i have tried b , gaba , inositol , dmae , melatonin and magnesium in terms of natural therapies i have tried focalin and intuniv in terms of adhd therapies nothing has helped , or at least not significantly so this is where we are this is the next step and at least with the study , he will be closely monitored ok , so the first thing that comes to my mind is , wow , they kicked like kids off of this study early ? ? ? ? that is insane makes me more angry than i already was in terms of jack on namenda i know that one area of interest for this medication is language i cannot really speak to that with regard to jack his language is excellent and has been since he was about a year old he is hyperverbal if there is such a thing although quite a bit of it is quoting our goal was to work on sensory issues and social issues it is hard to look at the progress with jack , as one has to look past his penchant for perseveration , which frankly is really hard to do to look at social interaction with jack , one would have to catch him in a moment when he is not busy spouting facts at you about his current area of interest the fact that this has not changed i guess is one telling piece of information this drug has definitely not impacted his obsessiveness at all the mood swings ? it has n't effected that much although i will say that when he was removed from the drug at the study cut off , he experienced a period of really labile behavior so much so that our pediatrician prescribed the medication for us so far the insurance is covering it social jack continues to struggle with this aspect of life when we are in a calm moment we have definitely noticed that he is better capable of carrying on a back and forth conversation these are brief moments , but they are there , which is better than in the past as he gets older and his peers get older we are already noticing a decreased tolerance for his constant talking and how shall i say , information sharing we are working really hard at redirecting , but i 'll be honest , his will is much stronger than ours he has worn us down i almost fell over laughing the other day when jack was telling our next door neighbor some fact and then asking him if that was right our neighbor said exactly like that that is one of the few responses that satisfies jack and one that john and i have said in unison many a time since he has taught us the appropriate responses , clearly he is now moving on to our neighbors attention he struggles with this the most which always intrigues me how can he be soooo hyperfocused on some things and yet be unable to attend to something as simple as spelling words for more than seconds ? he continues to require constant guidance and redirection at school by an aide we have an upcoming iep meeting and if there was any suggestion of changing this i would likely pass out at some point we may have to bite the bullet and try another adhd medication , but i am terrified after our initial experience jack is very sensitive and i just do n't see it ending well there have been some bright spots i have seen more empathy from my little boy this year without question he saw a child in a wheelchair and cried because he could n't walk one day i caught him crying in the back seat , and he asked me to change the song i assumed that the sound was bothering him sensory but when i asked he said no mom , it 's a really sad song pink just give me a reason that is very new he tells me more about his day now he tells stories his day is no longer in the vault as it used to be but here 's the thing it 's been a year , right ? who 's to say that this is n't development that would have occurred without the namenda ? how can i draw any conclusion based on these small changes ? the truth is that i really ca n't for us , namenda is not the answer did we have some baby steps ? yes was it because of namenda ? i doubt i will ever be able to answer that i do want to mention one other thing which is nate and his aricept study with nate we are looking at language i would estimate him to be at maybe a mo level when it comes to receptive and expressive language i will have a more exact number after our next nih visit , which is the second week of april he will also stop the medication then , and they will continue to monitor his development for the next year , to see if there is any long term increase in rem sleep from this short period of giving the medication , and how it affects his development mommy is really worried about the medication stopping now , keep in mind that we are also treating chronic infections in nate right now , and we have seen marked improvement in his engagement since starting antibiotics and antifungals that all being said , we have seen an increase in speech with nate i can say that definitively not only does he have more words , but he also seems to get the concept of repeating if you ask him to say something , he quite often attempts it this never happened in the past he also , for lack of a better way to say it , follows commands more consistently he claps hands , stomps feet , puts on his coat , goes to the door when i say it is time to go , says bye bye consistently when we walk to the door , i say open door and he says open when we get to the car , i tell him up and he says up if he is ready to leave he says go spontaneously he says i want , however the item is always fry inna no , we do n't know but if we work with him for a few minutes , and makes suggestions he will usually identify which food item he wants chip , chicken , toast , etc which means he also attempts to say these words chicken is wicken which is just so cute he is more opinionated about say , the programming on tv let me rephrase he throws a fit if he does n't get what he wants this is all since about december i can honestly say that if i had the option to try either namenda or aricept , my choice would be aricept , hands down here 's a little food for thought these two medications have actually been used synergistically for alzheimer 's http www alzheimersreadingroom com does combination of aricept and namenda html http news frx com press release rd news jama reports alzheimers patients treated combination namendatm memantine hcl a interesting , right ? so those are my thoughts for now , for what they are worth it 's all anecdotal obviously , but i consider myself to be fairly observant in general , my assessment skills as a nurse are pretty well honed , and well , when it comes to my kiddos , just call me eagle eyes
