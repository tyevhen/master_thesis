some of you may have noticed that i removed my last post i apologize for the broken link to any subscribers i had mentioned some gripes about work and accidentally left the company name in the post a coworker found the post by googling the company name and so i thought it would be best to remove it before my company removed me ! lets catch up this weekend i took a trip to vegas to watch a football game its tradition that we always go to the away game to vegas and dress up like idiots for the game everyone stares at you and either cheers you on for being so gutsy or just stares in amazement this time when we went i wasn t looking forward to it because i was worried about my anxiety flaring up and ruining the trip needless to say the morning of i took a little clonozepam and it helped when i felt anxious the next morning i just did what i wanted to do and didn t force myself to do anything i only ate what was comfortable and i made it through panic attack free it was a fun little trip our team won go byu ! and we had fun talking in the car that s one of those great things about road trips you don t have so many distractions and you can actually talk to each other we talked about where we see ourselves in the future , what we want to accomplish , and even went on a tangent about if we killed someone how we would do it and how we would cover it up so anyone reading this that knows me , if i am ever found deceased at an early age , check for poisoning ! tomorrow is national love your body day sounds like a good excuse to pamper yourself to me ! you might also like level panic , but i survived bbq update another small victory to add to the tally a year later same scenario , different outcome linkwithin
