today was the first day that i could wear summer cloths outside and still be comfortable it was wonderful , bright , sunny , warm i sat on the front steps , soaking up the sun , then walked down to the park and swung i love swinging it 's one of the things i miss most in the winter time , swinging then i took a walk with friends not long after i got home , the sun set i watched it 's light fade with sadness but now , i'm glad it 's night time , although the temperature is considerably colder now and i'm feeling a deep longing in my heart for summer nights sitting around with a bunch of friends at past eleven at night , talking and laughing truth or dare games in the dark , that quiet down with loud hushing and smothered giggles as soon as a parent comes near walking around the streets at past midnight , walking through pools of light cast off by streetlamps , talking about deep , profound things lying around in people piles on the lawn , staring at the stars sitting on top of the car in the middle of the night listening to the wind , and feelings the spirits pass through the trees i ca n't put into words how much i love summer nights and i know they 're coming soon spring awakens such joy in me , such love for life i love seeing all the new life , feeling it all and i love that summer comes next , with long , hot days spent in the sunlight or the shade , watching the sun set from the front steps , which give off stored heat from the day long after the sun is gone , followed by long nights , friends , laughter , stars the house still smells of outdoors now , even though the windows have been closed against colder temperatures i love spring i love summer i love life and i just felt a need to put some of my joy into words , or at least attempt to i hope everyone else is loving springtime as much as i am , and i ca n't help but wish that those wonderful summer nights are coming very soon ! peace , idzie you might also like images of spring gratefulness summer rules ? life is good linkwithin
