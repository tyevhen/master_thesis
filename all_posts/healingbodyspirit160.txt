my two year old grandson , paxton , likes to check me over when i go to visit like a horse trader who is about to buy a new horse , he opens my mouth to see if i have any missing teeth i do he tells me about it he checks my eyes and pulls on my ears he gently runs his finger over wrinkles on my face he pulls on moles and a small skin tag below my neck his eyes are so good he does n't miss a thing still , with all my blemishes and signs of aging , he loves me just the same ,
