update i did it ! please visit part two to see the completion of this challenge i was challenged to post a video of myself doing twenty two push ups a day for twenty two days by my friend , matt coombs , on facebook the kill challenge is intended to bring awareness to the estimated twenty two veterans every day who take their own lives as somebody who has struggled with suicidism since i was fifteen years old , i know how hard it can be to carry this burden on your own i believe kill 's plan to bring awareness to this veteran plight is a noble one i never served in the military , but my brother , ryan , did the day he finished infantry training at camp pendleton , a drunk driver plowed into the van he and other marines were in , ending their liberty , and for some , their service my brother died the next day , so i accept this challenge to honor his memory and to help raise awareness for suicidal vets to you veterans who served , you served with honor , and we do not forget you do n't carry this burden alone reach out and let people help you if you do n't have family or friends who you can rely on , try veterans crisis support many times , suicidism is something you can ride through , like a hard campaign with heavy shelling you can do this for today , i challenge my friend , nathan he does n't bother with social media , so i 'll make sure he sees this video you can read of other ways to support suicidal loved ones in my book , saying no ! to suicide below you 'll find the rest of the week each video has a short message at the end thanks for your support ! day two day three day four day five day six day seven you might also like kicking suicide in the teeth the problem with drive by suicide notes are you cool enough for the suicide club ? suicide no one cares ? it depends on who you listen to linkwithin
