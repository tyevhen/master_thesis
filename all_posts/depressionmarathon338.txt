tomorrow , i'm embarking on a weekend away i'm looking forward to a few days with my boyfriend , d , in milwaukee this is kind of a big deal , as we have n't seen each other since mid october , in between my first and second hospital stays , this past fall and since i was in the midst of ect at that time , my memories of that weekend are n't as clear as i would like so i'm really looking forward to seeing him this weekend i am also scheduled to run miles this weekend i'm actually kind of looking forward to that , too i 've already had three good runs this week , including an intimidating minute tempo run today i really did n't know what to expect , but i set the treadmill at minutes per mile and let 'er rip i not only ran the entire minutes at that pace , but more importantly , i felt good while doing it ! since my doctor decreased one of my meds , the one that caused weight gain , i have physically felt better and running has gotten easier that 's why i'm kind of looking forward to my miler i'm hoping it feels good , too in other news , i did get my baby tooth pulled on tuesday , and thus began the month process of pulling the permanent tooth into position and straightening my teeth i do n't have braces yet they are still about months away what i have is an appliance , kind of like a retainer , covering the roof of my mouth and my molars , which is supposed to gradually expand the space where the permanent tooth will fit it 's kind of a pain in the butt i have to wear it hours per day , and it makes it very difficult to talk normally or eat anything but i know it 's temporary , and i 've put up with a lot worse than this in the past few months , so i think i 'll be okay that 's the news for today my mood remains good , and i'm grateful for that i'm looking forward to a nice weekend carry on , friends !
