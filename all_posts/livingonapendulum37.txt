please read this post , followed by this post first my new phone wind mobile wind mobile the saga continues the last time i spoke to them , on august th , they told me that in days , all my issues would be resolved sure one is to expect business days but since they do business on weekends , that means that by today , i should have a resolution i should be able to look at my account and see the changes to the amount i still owe i get that the total outstanding would not necessarily be as there may have been some miscalculations on my part but it should be a lot lower than this includes my payment of note that the point of sales manager never sent me an email about the credit nothing , nada , ziltch see a pattern here ? looks like i was lied to again folks an here i keep giving them the benefit of the doubt this means of course that i have to call then again ! stay tuned ! august , weeks from when i first transferred to wind mobile july , i check online for my balance owed the good , my balance went down by the bad , my balance went down by only i can only assume they have decided to charge me for that week of usage and taxes i call wind today to find out what 's going on it 's been after all days since they told me all would be resolved take days of weekends and it 's still more than days i waited a few extra days to give them a fighting chance before calling them i spoke to anna i am now taking note of the names i ask anna what is going on she tells my case is escalated but there is still no resolution she did n't tell me about the she gave me a case c and said she sent an email to escalation to get an update of course no one will bother calling me i know the routine by now my son was to get a cell for his birthday we wo n't be going with wind quite a few of my facebook friends and their friends will not be going with wind either , no matter how interesting their advertised prices are my home computer has since died , making it more difficult to update my file dealing with wind has been trying and exhausting to the extreme stay tuned some more october , just checked my wind account today still waiting for a resolution on september , i spoke with a wind representative and they told me all was resolved and i had all my credits looking at my account , the credits have yet to be applied yet , they send me texts on a regular basis nagging me to pay my outstanding amount can you see the irony ? ? ? they nag me for an amount they owe me this company is run by a bunch of ignorant teenagers october , i called wind to find out why my credit has not been applied the first call , after waiting minutes to reach a representative , i get an obviously uninterested woman girl ? she informed me that i did not qualify for the credit as i did n't port my number over i flipped are there not notes on my file ? i asked to speak to her supervisor she is obnoxious and put me on hold , for minutes and then i am flushed so i call again this time i get an agent right away , is name is sebastian , she mumbled her name , i asked to repeat twice and i still could not get her name i asked about my credit he puts me on hold , reads the notes comes back and says he sees the escalations but obviously the wrong resolution was reached as they denied my request he offered to send it back up to escalation with more details he felt that i should have my credit thanks sebastian for agreeing with me , now if only i could actually get to speak to these escalation people i have asked and never succeeded they are supposed to call but never call just like they never respond to their texts so i am still waiting for an acceptable resolution october , i got a text hey ! your account is still overdue we need full payment within hrs to avoid full suspension of your service give us a shout to keep our relationship alive i guess my account will be suspended in hrs worst company ever ! october , after contacting the media in regards to my problems with wind mobile , i went on twitter to give them fair warning after all the same bullshit was said , i think we reached an a ha moment the temp has not been considered in my recent exchanges with them it definitely was in older exchanges though another wait and see also i found out today that telus is charging me for exiting my contract days early days that i paid ! did they really have to be this punitive ? i figure being with wind was punitive enough to follow an update on wind mobile
