stress and anxiety can wreak havoc upon your body it can lead to problems with childhood physical development , and affect the immune , endocrine , gastrointestinal , and cardiovascular systems it can exacerbate diabetes stress affects the mind as well , a tragic example being ptsd , where an individual might relive a traumatic event over and over stress can be either good or bad event such as marriage or a divorce low levels of stress can actually be a good thing for instance , a small amount of stress might help you prepare for an upcoming exam better than you otherwise would have but sometimes stress becomes overwhelming , and biological systems in your body that would usually only slightly increase during good stress , go into overdrive potentially on a long term basis in order to understand why long term stress can be bad , we need to understand what immediate effect stress has on our bodies under stress , the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal system hpa axis is activated the hypothalamus releases corticotrophin releasing hormone crh crh stimulates the pituitary gland the pituitary then secretes adrenocorticotrophic hormone acth the adrenal cortex then produces the stress hormone cortisol in humans anatomy of hypothalamus pituitary adrenal system top left , the pituitary gland is red top right , the hypothalamus and pituitary glands are connected bottom left , the adrenal glands are bright red bottom right , the adrenal glands are the yellow cones on the kidneys cortisol activates the fight or flight response the sympathetic nervous system shuts down anything that your body does n't need during a traumatic event where you might need to fight or run away from a threat that means your stomach stops digesting , you stop producing semen ovulating , your immune system which requires a huge amount of energy slows way down tissue repair also another drain on energy halts activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to release of the adrenaline epinephrine and noradrenaline norepinephrine these hormones circulate through the body and increase rate of the heart and of glucose metabolism that gets the oxygen and energy flowing so you can use your limbs for fight or flight cortisol is the hormone that prepares the body for fight or flight thus , it is a good hormone to have around in an immediate danger however , if stress continues , and cortisol is not turned off , the long term effects of suppression of vital bodily functions is quite detrimental to the body usually , after immediate stress , the cortisol has a feedback inhibition mechanism , in which it signals to slow its own production however , if the stress continues for too long , cortisol 's feedback inhibition loop can be deactivated thus allowing the adrenal cortex to continue pumping out cortisol and keeping the physiological effects of the sympathetic nervous system still active since the immune system is inhibited by the sympathetic nervous system , individuals experiencing long term stress are susceptible to infection by viruses and bacteria the best known physical side effect of stress is cardiovascular problems as mentioned earlier in this post , the sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate so that blood pumps more quickly throughout the body not only can this increase blood pressure directly , but it can also lead to damage of the blood vessel walls the high blood pressure leads to tiny tears in the blood vessel walls these tears are susceptible to accumulating circulating junk such as particles of fat and cholesterol this accumulation pictured n yellow above can decrease blood flow through the vessel , or completely block flow as seen above when the heart does n't get enough oxygen , then a heart attack may occur another problem with decreased blood flow is that if the brain does n't get enough oxygen , this can cause a stroke as you can see , stress can have a huge impact on your health does n't that stress you out ?
