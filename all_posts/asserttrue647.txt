the web browser is much more standards based than any desktop application any of us normally uses , which makes it a compelling platform for developing personal web apps certainly much more compelling than something like eclipse , say which is theoretically an anything platform but there are still quite a few things browsers do n't do well and or do n't do in standardized fashion , or do in a just plain irritating fashion one is data persistence another is file i o another is cross domain ajax if you try to do certain types of supposedly insecure things in a browser app , you 're pretty much hosed at the outset i 'd like to be able to open an xml file on disk , read twitter user ids from it , and then make ajax calls to twitter to either follow or unfollow those user ids i actually do this now using greasemonkey scripts but the scripts complain about the file url scheme of the xml , unless you set a particular config value greasemonkey fileisgreaseable to true in the about config screen of firefox , as i wrote previously here but what i 'd really like to be able to do is run the same greasemonkey script in chrome instead of firefox but chrome does n't have a greasemonkey fileisgreaseable security setting that i can override basically i ca n't trigger a script to fire off of opening a file i have to serve myself the file over http which means i have to install and run an instance of apache or another web server just to serve myself these xml files so they 'll trigger the script properly which is a lot of nonsense sometimes i wish chrome and firefox and all the rest had a master security setting call it useragreestoholdtheentireuniverseharmlesswhilehekillshimself that would , with the flip of a bit , let me disable all the ridiculous child proof bottle caps of the browser world i want to pull the mattress tags off , ignore the surgeon general warnings , and run wild eyed down the hallway with scissors in both hands let me test the no user serviceable parts hypothesis let me decide if my browser should do file i o in an ajax call , let me decide if a script will fire when i manually open a file , yes let me decide if one of my own scripts should be able to slurp the cache using about cache or persist a bit of user data in an insecure way folks , i want to drive over the speed limit i want to have unsafe file i o sex cover your ears i am going to shout now hear me o browser thought police , whoever you are , wherever you are , and let me knowingly flip the sanity bit i'm tired of being treated like a retarded child stand the fuck back and let me cram the mentos in the goddam bottle already
