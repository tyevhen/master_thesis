i hope you all had a very pleasant , comfortable , and gratitude filled thanksgiving i worked part of the day , watched football and went for a walk with puck in the early evening , i had dinner with some sober friends i said a prayer for those who spent the holiday alone i was grateful to be sober and to be surrounded by people for whom i care and who care about me puck and i just got in from another walk tonight it was beautiful out many homes were lit up for christmas it was so nice and so serene , i had a very difficult time continuing to walk i really wanted to run ! then i stepped off a curb and pain shot through my left lower leg that was a good reminder of what i was trying to accomplish by resting no more pain ! but i really , really wanted to run ! nothing but walking for me yesterday and today , as the pool was closed i 'll be back splashing around tomorrow get this ! i actually swam miles on wednesday ! yup , miles ! i could n't believe it ! i set out to swim for an hour , but at an hour i was already over miles i swam the first half mile with flippers so i decided to keep going surprisingly enough i finished fairly easily not sure what got into me , but that was quite a little achievement for me ! remember , when i started years ago , i could n't even swim one lap without stopping and gasping for breath swimming is slightly less annoying now that i can do it , but i 'd still rather be running down the road ! here 's hoping my leg heals quickly
