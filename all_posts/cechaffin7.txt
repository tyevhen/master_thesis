i changed my password but think spammers still get through do n't know how to stop them as for my condition , i am paralyzed with fear despite copious medications it 's a little better at night with some brandy and numbness and television i read pulp fiction during the day attend a couple jc classes that i do n't understand and am too anxious to actually study for i'm in therapy but it is more hand holding to prevent suicide if it were n't for the love of my wife i would no longer be here kathleen is a saint i do not understand how people can get up in the morning , stretch and mutter carpe diem i have no interest in anything and nothing to seize i do my utmost to avoid pain and responsibility , but in the end they are inescapable i am in hell the smallest tasks fill me with trepidation showering brushing my teeth it 's a miracle i practice personal hygiene at all i ca n't seem to organize anything or make decisions about anything it 's as if i 've lost my soul , at least my conscious deciding ego sometimes i just flip a coin to make a decision , as it does n't matter to me , and randomness is as good as anything since i ca n't think clearly terrified beyond kilorats into some fear state i cannot adequately describe and how was your day ? ce
