it has been nearly years since i painted my grandmother 's bathroom with a moss green colored paint i was a young mother and my son played in the living room as i painted , not knowing i was using a lead based paint in a closed room i felt light headed as i drove home but just thought i was tired i fell alseep quickly that night and was awakened to an incredible terrifying feeling of panic , i could feel my spirit being pulled out of my body and i was bound down i could not move a muscle , i could not say anything or make any sound i wanted to cry out but could not i could see my head on the pillow , but could not help myself then it came to me and in my mind 's eye i saw myself raising my hand to the square and in the name of the lord i dismissed the spirit that had bound me down immediately my spirit returned to my body and i felt an incredible spiritual light fill the room and fill me with peace and amazing christ like love
