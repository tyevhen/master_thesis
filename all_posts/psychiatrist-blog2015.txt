those of you who watch the simpsons may be aware that cartoonist matt groening started out drawing a comic strip by the name of life in hell its characters were little blob like mutant bunnies , although one of them bore a strange resemblance to the future marge simpson anyway , as the relative heat index here in charm city approaches degrees i find myself thinking about life in hell or more specifically , about life in a year old prison with no ventilation and no air conditioning in one particular life in hell strip the character akbar says to jeff , give me one good reason i should n't kill myself jeff disappears , leaving the suicidal akbar alone staring at nothing for nine panels finally jeff reappears in the last panel , hands akbar an ice cream cone and akbar says , mmm new flavor suicidal crisis averted by ice cream gotta love it i wish it were that easy sometimes the small things do keep you going though , like the pharmacy nurse who donated her own fan to my clinic one morning just as i was about to recreate the final i'm melting melting scene in the wizard of oz or the administrative assistant who brought me a cup of my favorite amaretto royale coffee in less life in hellish days just as i was on the verge of rolling a cop for his dunkin donuts cup i am constantly touched that the people who show the most humanity and concern are the people at the bottom of the political totem pole speaking of life in hell , i saw this link show up in omnibrain in keeping with dinah 's tradition of stealing er following up on other people 's posts i thought i 'd mention it i also figured someone would see this and suggest it to me as an ideal clinkshrink vacation , so i'm beating everybody to it an entreprenuer in northeast moscow is looking for investors to turn a former prison camp into an extreme reality vacation destination vacationers can spend up to three days in prison and experience an almost authentic gulag complete with watchtowers , guards armed with paintball guns , snarling dogs , rolls of barbed wire , spartan living conditions and forced labour what , no commissary ? foo , i'm in if you 're in i put up my own pic this time to spare dinah the work
