i'm a little overwhelmed and busy i picked up my new puppy , month old black lab mix , jet , on saturday he is incredibly cute , and he is all puppy ! he 's not totally house trained yet , plus he has a bladder infection , which makes training a little more difficult when he drinks water , he literally has to go out approximately every minutes , or less , for about an hour afterward and his need to go out is immediate ! he 's only had two accidents so far , and both times were when i let him out of my site for just a few seconds ! my fault considering the infection , and the limited supervision he had in his foster home , he 's actually doing quite well jet is extremely playful , which is quite fun , but exhausting fortunately , he is kennel trained , and he can stay alone in his kennel for at least hours without difficulty he also sleeps in his kennel , through the night , as long as i pick up his water a few hours before bedtime and he travels silently in the car in his kennel , also very nice ! we just finished over an hour of playing , and he 's apparently finally tired out , which is why i have this moment to write unfortunately , he has had little to no socialization up to this point he 's fine with a single dog , such as bill and cindy 's golden retriever , after a bit of warming up , but he viciously growls and barks at every dog at first he 's kind of scary he also barks just as viciously at strangers at first he 's timid i think that 's where the aggression comes from it worries me i took him to work at the nursing home on monday in order to expose him to many people and even another dog it worked out okay i think i 'll take him again tomorrow i absolutely do not want an aggressive , or even aggressive sounding , dog ! we 're working on sits and downs we 're working on staying off the furniture we 're playing fetch as i said , it 's fun , it 's a little overwhelming , and i'm very busy i 'll keep you updated on the saga !
