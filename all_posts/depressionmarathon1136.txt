it 's not meant to be not right now , anyway picking up the pace to beat the do n't walk sign yesterday just about made me scream my right leg needs time to heal , i guess , so no marathon for me no running at all , i think i have a doctor 's appointment next week to check this out , but ultimately , i think i just need to rest i love rest , but i hate forced rest ! i also hate the fact that i was in great shape to run a good marathon only to be thwarted by the weather ! and now , injury blocks my path , but what can i do ? i could be an idiot and attempt to ignore my screaming leg , but that would be , well , idiotic ! i think i 've pushed it as far as i can living life on life 's terms is the best option i have left it 's funny before i entered recovery , living life on life 's terms was never a valid option it may have been an option for you , but it was never a valid option for me as a person and as a runner , i always wanted to be in control donning my freudian glasses , i might surmise that growing up with abuse , where personal power or control are nonexistent , my former need for control makes perfect sense but i 've never been a big fan of freud , though i always envied my brothers' ability to pee standing up ! freud 's unique perspective notwithstanding , i now realize that many of us battle with living life on life 's terms , regardless of our upbringings over the past month , my life has been pretty bumpy there 's all the stuff you guys already read about senseless death , anniversary of senseless death , running highs , running woes , fatigue , injury , and puck 's penchant for rupturing major knee ligaments as well as some garbage i have yet to reveal like i said , pretty bumpy previously , any one of these life events could have triggered a depression dive or drinking excuse as of today , neither of those things have happened instead of sliding into the abyss of darkness or drink , i 've coped sure , it has n't all been perfect i 've slept a little more , run a little less , probably eaten more chocolate than usual , ignored cleaning my house , and watched more tv at the same time , i 've met my commitments , made it to the gym , and attended more aa meetings to survive this month relatively unscathed is a miracle i 'll take a wider ass and a messy house over depression and drunk despair any day ! a couple days ago my therapist noted , you seem to be taking this all in stride i remarked , yes , what else can i do ? i ca n't change it , so it does n't do any good to worry about it at which point she said , right ! but that has n't always been the case oh i get it living life on life 's terms cool take that , sigmund !
