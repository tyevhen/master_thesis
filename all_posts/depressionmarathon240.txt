i had a brilliant run saturday morning for the first time since last october i ran long , miles ! i ran , one mile segments with one minute walk breaks between each mile on a beautiful , crisp winter day it was difficult but totally doable , and i was thrilled unfortunately , the thrill did n't last within a few hours of finishing my pain free run my left knee began to ache and swell by saturday evening i could n't walk without limping it hurt ! i iced it , medicated it and tried to no avail to figure out what the heck was happening i was totally frustrated ! since saturday my knee has continued to ache and frustrate the swelling and pain have been slowly improving , but my running comeback has been abruptly halted i was forced to swim on sunday , also frustrating as i have n't been in the pool for at least a year , so i was pooped after just a few laps by monday i was able to gently spin on my stationary bicycle , but my hopes of running with a braced knee on tuesday were quickly dashed i walked a couple of miles on the treadmill instead last night i tried a kinesiotaping method and was able to bike a bit more aggressively i'm currently contemplating if i 'll be able to do a light run today or not it 's not yet clear , but i 'll probably tape myself up again and give it a try if i ca n't run i 'll at least be able to walk , and that may ease some of my frustration i'm fairly disappointed with this setback and while i know it 's not the end of the world , and i know it will get better if i treat it , and myself , smartly , i'm still worried the mile run felt so good i felt freedom from the post op heaviness for the first time my body felt the familiar freedom of clicking along at a decent pace , step after step after step i allowed myself to look ahead , again for the first time , at the upcoming marathon schedule i even penciled grandmas marathon in june into my schedule to be brought to a screeching , bewildering halt after all of that is disappointing i'm hopeful the pain will pass soon i'm equally as hopeful i 'll be able to figure out how to keep it from returning my guess is i have some residual right hip weakness , as a result of my surgery , which is altering my gait just enough to irritate my left knee i have no plans to discontinue the hip strengthening program i 've been performing for at least four weeks hopefully , increased hip strength and continued taping of my knee will resolve the issue permanently i pray it will be so , and i 'll keep vigilantly working to make it so i wo n't let a minor setback stop me in my tracks no worries , my friends , forward is still the only way to go
