i'm happy to report i ran for minutes today , on the alter g treadmill , at of my body weight i ran minute miles without pain i'm cautiously optimistic i 've turned a corner in my recovery from my right achilles tendon tear this is the first time i 've been able to increase the body weight percentage , from to , without my achilles revolting at least a bit and at of my body weight , i finally felt like i was actually running more than floating like i said , i'm cautiously optimistic i'm now beginning my th month of no running if you had suggested at any time in my past that i 'd be able to survive months without running , i 'd have called you crazy i would n't have believed it i'm actually quite amazed with myself that may sound silly , but it 's true in fact , perhaps all the cross training , biking , and weight lifting will actually help once i'm back on the road at least that 's what i'm telling myself that being said , i ca n't wait to get back on the road ! i'm doing well , otherwise my mood is better than it was over the weekend i'm not in a funk anymore i'm busy between work , exercising , and taking care of jet , i 've got little time for much else work especially has been busy with some challenging patients they 're keeping me on my toes i am taking some time to go to a play on sunday with the young man i mentored several years ago he 's in his mid twenties now it 's cool to spend time with him all grown up i'm proud of the person he 's become , and i'm really happy he 's still in my life all these years later it will be nice to spend some time together that 's all that 's happening around here things are good my life is pleasantly boring again , just the way i like it hope everything is pleasantly boring in your lives , too carry on , my friends
