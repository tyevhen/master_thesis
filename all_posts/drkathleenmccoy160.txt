this time of year assumptions abound any plans for mother 's day ? the supermarket cashier asks cheerily my reflexive answer is well practiced well , who knows ? i reply , smiling mysteriously i'm going to lie low and just see what happens she smiles me , too , she says though i'm hoping for a surprise from my kids i hope you get a good one ! i say , turning to leave i know surprises are quite unlikely for me this mother 's day or any other i am a childless year old woman and my own mother has been dead for more than three decades childless it was a radical thought back in the fifties when just about everyone was married with children with a few notable exceptions including my beloved aunt molly but i always considered her our third and best parent and , for many years , especially after our parents died , mike , tai and i honored aunt molly with a special outpouring of love , affection and an excellent brunch at her favorite restaurant on mother 's day there was one childless couple living in our neighborhood as i was growing up shel and sybil frye , a middle aged , long married couple lived two doors down from us their baby was a wonderful golden retriever named honey some people whispered that , as childless folk , they must be very selfish or else , perhaps , there was something terribly physically wrong with them but they seemed normal to me shel had a great sense of humor and loved to go fishing with my father sybil was always very sweet to neighborhood kids she was quick with cookies , agreeable to my brother running away from home and hiding in her hedge all day as long as he was home by sundown and honey was a neighborhood favorite i invited her to my birthday parties and she was the most popular guest there still , i pitied them at times their life was so quiet , their house so orderly , their life together so predictable i never aspired to be them all these years later , bob and i are them but with cats instead of a big golden dog how did this happen ? i never smugly chose to be child free instead , it seemed somehow predestined much to my distress growing up i remember seeing three coins in the fountain as a child and being greatly affected by a scene where one of the female characters weeps because she 'll never have a child i cried myself to sleep that night knowing somehow without knowing that this would be my own fate in college , as my suitemates dreamed out loud about husbands and children , i sat by feeling , once again , that what they dreamed so easily would not happen quite that way for me i heard myself saying something snotty and bitter to soothe my overwhelming sense of anticipatory loss lorraine sat beside me and put her arms around me you 're scared that it wo n't happen for you , are n't you ? she asked , so wise for her years do n't worry i just know somehow your life is going to be wonderful , that things will work out just right for you what was just right ? i had decided that i did n't want to have children unless i could find a man who wanted truly wanted children i did n't want to relive the eternal tension between my parents my mother who had longed for children , my father who largely loathed parenthood but things just did n't seem to work out with parenthood michael lynn , my first post college boyfriend longed for marriage and children but i was n't ready to settle down in my early twenties and he went on to be a loving stepfather to the children of the woman he eventually married and the absolutely devoted grandfather to their children i had an unplanned pregnancy with dr chuck thanks to a malfunctioning iud though it was unplanned , it was far from unwelcome chuck , a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist , loved and wanted children but the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage shortly before our relationship began a seismic shift at age , chuck came to terms with the fact that he was gay and we veered away from romance , marriage and children and continued on as friends and professional partners instead , producing several classic books instead of babies i was in my thirties when i met bob , who was divorced and who had had a vasectomy during his first marriage he had helped his first wife to raise a daughter by her previous marriage and he had no desire to repeat the experience nevertheless , our relationship was so loving , so nurturing , so much what i had always wanted i chose to spend my life with bob and this choice meant i would be childless but being childless has n't meant that our lives are closed off to children as the years went by , bob became a dedicated big brother to three generations of little brothers during his years in the program his three little brothers paco , david and ryan all became a part of our life together in particular , we both love ryan immensely and forever he became bob 's third and last little brother as a small child more than years ago and is the closest we 'll ever have to a son he calls us on mother 's day , father 's day , and many other times during the year to say i love you ! and to share the adventures of his young adult life and we 'll be headed back to los angeles soon to share his joy as he receives his master 's degree in social work a major step toward his goal of becoming a psychotherapist in some ways , my life , too , has been devoted to young people for many years , i wrote almost exclusively for or about teenagers for years , i was a part time admissions officer representing northwestern university in california , arizona and nevada , interviewing several generations of promising young students some of these young people , whether or not they eventually attended northwestern , became part of my life but there were times , particularly after my parents died , when i felt existentially alone and wished that my lifestyle could be more traditional there were times when i yearned for that closest of connections , for that love both fierce and all encompassing then i would host a parent fleeing from the stress of adolescent parenting for a week , or watch a toddler meltdown in public and think that being childless had its advantages but still , i 've never identified with the militant child free folk when i read books about being the wonders of child free living , i always came away feeling unsatisfied and ashamed the mind set invariably seems to be that there was something the matter with children they are savages , cost too much money to raise , and , in more promising times , interfered with a jet setting yuppie lifestyle these all seemed to be such superficial reasons to bypass a major aspect of adult life and these were n't the reasons i was not a parent when i thought about why i had made the choices i made , it came down to me perhaps it was the memory of my father 's bitter words marriage with children is the complete life catastrophe ! or my mother 's wistful sighing about the career she had loved and left behind for motherhood deep down , perhaps , i did n't feel i had the courage and willingness to make the sacrifices necessary to be a mother in my darkest moments , i 've feared that something of my father might lurk malevolently in my emotional dna but perhaps it was simply my destiny to fall in love with ryan and with my nieces and nephew to be , to give warm support and guidance to children and teens with my books , and with my college admissions work instead of being a hands on parent there are times of wistfulness , of wondering about what that road not taken might have been like , as well as times of feeling comfortable with my choice i see how children of friends have become wonderful adults , a source of joy and comfort to their parents , my peers i see my friends and neighbors enjoying their grandchildren i see multi generational families and smile and sometimes feel wistful i 've rejoiced as my siblings both became late in life parents tai gave birth to nick when she was and mike was when he and amp had maggie he will be pushing when their son henry arrives this summer despite her traumatic childhood , tai is a loving , supportive mother to nick , delighting in her strengths , talents and eccentricities alike and i marvel at mike 's and amp 's patience with their little maggie she 's two and a half , a bright and beautiful child and i look forward to seeing and knowing the growing person she will be but i struggle to imagine how one copes with the demands , with the energy it takes , to be a parent of a toddler especially in one 's sixties my brother , who had a much more difficult childhood than i , handles these demands beautifully the love he and amp have for maggie is an all encompassing love i will never know and yet i rejoice in being an aunt , a mentor , a writer young people can trust i love reading stories to maggie and encouraging her to talk i love sharing the insights and adventures of young adults i first met in the college admissions process as they venture out into the post college world i love hearing from long ago readers i still sometimes get emails of thanks via my website from middle aged adults who recall my 'teen articles or growing up with one of the seven editions of the teenage body book it warms my heart to know that what i 've written over the past years has been helpful sometimes warm feedback can take me by surprise i got an email on my birthday a few weeks ago from a high school friend suse harper yates , whom i have n't seen in nearly years she reminded me that we had played mother and daughter in a school production of i remember mama late in our senior year her email read , in part for 'i remember mama' on her birthday ! oh , the comfort , the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with another person , having to neither weigh thoughts nor measure words i love you ! suse what a gift suse 's words were to me both bringing back wonderful memories and letting me know as yet another mother 's day approaches , that i had been a temporary mother , a source of comfort to her , all those years ago the memories flooded back i had played mama and suzy had played christine , the middle daughter i remembered being delighted by the warm chemistry i had with her it felt natural onstage to snuggle with her , to admonish her firmly but with affection , to meet her smile with my own i had no way of knowing then the secrets she was holding the painful truth of her life at home i had no way of knowing then nor did she the challenges she was to face in the years to follow but for that very brief time , in a very different place in both our lives , i had been a good mother to her i had helped her to feel warm and loved and safe what a blessing this was to hear and to know that these feelings had stayed with her all through the years maybe my dear , long deceased college friend lorraine was right all those years ago my life has been wonderful , indeed , turning out the way it was always meant to be just right
