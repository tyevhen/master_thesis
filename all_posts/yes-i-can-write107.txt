i have n't felt satisfied with the bio i had on the about me and the family page for a while now it was a couple of years old , and though still pretty much accurate , just did n't really feel right anymore so today , i wrote a new longer one ! i also updated my photo on that page and my family 's bios go check it out ! or just read my updated bio below my name is idzie desmarais , and i'm a year old lifelong learner who lives in montreal , quebec with my wonderful family very short bio i'm an unschooling vegetarian animistic green anarchist feminist hippie child i'm a writer , thinker , dreamer a woman , a sister , a daughter , a friend i'm also an unschooling advocate activist , a lover of food , and a radical much longer bio i'm a kindergarten drop out who , excluding those six months of kindergarten , has never been to school instead , i grew up following my passions and figuring things out in my own time in my late teens i became fascinated with the education often referred to as unschooling i 'd grown up with , and started reading everything i could about unschooling and freedom based education , going to unschooling conferences , and writing the blog i'm unschooled yes , i can write at this point , as well as still doing all of those things , i'm also very involved with the freedom based education movement in my home city , as well as the wider unschooling freedom based education community through the making of connections and friendships with people scattered across north america and beyond ! basically ? i think unschooling is really , really cool , and that the ideas found in that philosophy can be a powerful tool of both personal and social transformation i'm a radical creature , a green anarchist and feminist , who leans strongly towards anti civ thought i'm against hierarchy and rulers , imposed authority , capitalism , patriarchy kyrarchy , and similar nasty stuff i try to be as aware as i can of oppression and privilege in the interest of knowing where i'm coming from in my writing , i'm a white , cisgender , able bodied , lower middle class , not quite straight woman , and to basically just not be an asshole i'm currently super interested in radical sustainability communal , cooperative , collective , and community based living especially intentional communities queer and gender stuff feminism getting stuff for free living on very little no money i love food as in , really love food ! i 've never been very successful at actually doing so , but i am interested in growing food , foraging , and dumpster diving , as well as sharing and trading food , farmers markets , and basically anything that involves me getting food i love cooking , cooking for others , and eating i love trying new foods , new restaurants , and i even like doing food prep i'm vegetarian , and have been since age eight , but though i do n't really plan to change my diet anytime soon , or start cooking with meat , i'm no longer as attached to the idea of always being vegetarian as i used to be though i know if i do start eating meat at some point , i will be very picky my spirituality is closely tied into to the realization that all life is of equal worth , that the earth nature is sacred , and that humans are animals , and like all animals , we belong in functioning living communities sometimes i use the term animist to refer to my spiritual beliefs i often say i'm a hippie , which is n't really a word with a clear definition , but when i use it it basically just means that i'm a radical , tree hugging , non shaving , organic farm loving person who sometimes likes to wear tie dye i value honesty and genuine expression greatly , and only really feel comfortable when i feel i'm being genuine i seek to share my trials and difficulties in my writing , how i'm actually feeling about things and my true opinions , not just what will sound good , or what will get the best reactions i feel like i'm mostly successful in this , though not always i love getting comments , though i do n't respond to them nearly as often as i should same for emails i can be contacted at unschooledwriter gmail com , and though i read every single email i get , i am very bad at responding to them i usually respond eventually , but it takes me a very long time ! if you really want to talk to me , the best way to do so is through skype just email me unschooledwriter gmail com to set up a specific time , or add me idziee two e 's , and just poke me when i'm online i really like meeting and talking to new people , and i'm happy to answer questions ! i can also be found on twitter youtube tumblr i'm unschooled yes , i can write facebook page you might also like making transitions and following passions against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference favorite unschooling posts on this blog of insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging and writing from the heart linkwithin
