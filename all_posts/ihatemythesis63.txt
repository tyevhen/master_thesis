you know that disgusting feeling you get at hour of a cross country road trip ? it 's the body 's rebellion against confinement , lack of blood circulation and road snacks and the byproduct is a queasy , lethargic feeling where everything aches that 's how i feel now of course , i'm not in a car , but at my kitchen table studying i can put up with pain , but the lethargy is hampering my productivity so how do i cure this ? i do n't feel like there is time to do a big yoga session i should really just power through but if i'm not going to be productive anyway , then no sense in forcing myself to suffer
