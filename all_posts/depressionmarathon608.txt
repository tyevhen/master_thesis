i'm so tired of writing this things are n't good my mood , which rebounded for my visit with d over the weekend , tanked again by monday evening things have only worsened from there tuesday , a longer day than i thought possible , left me in tears wednesday 's long , busy day at work temporarily distracted and then exhausted me and this morning , i 've awoken heavy and sad mornings are usually my best time feeling like this so early in the day is quite foreboding i do n't know what to do i can barely move i'm so tired of writing this shit ! the rollercoaster of good , bad , good , bad makes me nuts i never know what to expect it 's disheartening , exhausting , and soul crushing every time i fall and it 's not just a fall , it 's a free fall so fast it does n't make any sense it is , i guess , my illness at this moment rearing its ugly head i'm so tired of writing this that i'm going to stop writing now in a few days , if the rollercoaster continues to race , i may be telling you how wonderful i feel stay with my on the ride , my friends
