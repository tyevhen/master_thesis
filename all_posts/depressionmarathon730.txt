i started the new year right getting my year medallion at my home meeting i'm so grateful to be sober today , especially today ! no hangover , no regrets , no worries that 's pretty remarkable considering it 's new years day the scenario was likely quite different five years ago i hope you all had a safe , happy , and joyous new year ! here 's hoping brings more joy than sorrow for all of us it 's a below freezing , windy day here i mention that because i had a mile long run scheduled , and i did it ! i just could n't face the treadmill for miles , so i bundled up and headed outside it was doubly difficult because we had a small ice storm last night , so none of the usual paths were available to me i ended up running my entire run in about a square block area up and down my neighborhood streets i went i'm sure i was quite a sight , all bundled up with frosty , frozen eye lashes running back and forth in front of the neighborhood homes it was quite the run , but i got it done now i'm clean , dry and bundled in my sweats my recliner is calling , and football is on the agenda i have no special plans for the day , and tomorrow i'm back to work i 've maintained my stable mood despite the holidays , and despite spending most of it alone perhaps that 's my christmas miracle this year i'm grateful for it now it 's on to january , which can be quite a challenging month around here it 's long , dark and cold i 'll have to take it one day at a time and remember that it , too , will eventually pass happy new year , everyone !
