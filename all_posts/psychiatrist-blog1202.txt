later this month , shrink rap will celebrate years and we 're coming close to the post mark i'm not sure if we can get them to coincide we have news signed , sealed , and delivered , the shrink rappers have a book contract so far , the tentative name is off the couch how psychiatry works and what psychiatrists think it wo n't stick , no one likes it , but for now , it 's a provisional title the book will be published by johns hopkins university press , sometime in since it 's not written , it 's hard to have an exact release date when i asked our readers for thoughts about a sample chapter , i got a lot of conflicting feedback , but one theme was voiced by several the book is more serious , more dry , not light and witty the editorial feedback we 've gotten when we tried to mimic the blog was clear we have weird doctor humor and there was concern that we trivialize mental illness other than that , they loved it and it was approved unanimously , what can i say ? so the book will be different than the blog , it will be a look at how psychiatry works , but it will be a serious endeavor , not banter if you like you shrink rap , you may or may not like off the couch if you like shrink rap , i have good news we 're staying here in the blogosphere , we 're staying free , and we 're staying weird ducks , chocolate , and all and what about our my three shrinks podcast ? that 's a good question , one i 've wondered about myself we have some podcasts in the can waiting for production i do n't know when they 'll go up , i do n't know when we 'll resume on a regular schedule one thing i do know is that we will be resuming my three shrinks with renewed enthusiasm , but it may not be until after we finish the draft of the book that 's due in june of , and we 're aiming to have it done a few months earlier so clinkshrink is off climbing every mountain roy is looking for the next gadget to count gigabytes on i'm signing on to a year as president of our state psychiatric society and thinking that between that and writing the book , i 'll be tired of psychiatrists pretty soon we 're all excited about the book thank you for reading shrink rap and for all your comments and insights our readers really are what fueled our interest in writing about our work
