i'm city folk , all the way i 've never lived in a small town much less anywhere rural and while baltimore sometimes feels oddly provincial , we have lots of docs lots with johns hopkins , the university of maryland , and sheppard pratt as the forces in academic psychiatry , there are also many community hospitals which offer inpatient and emergency psychiatric care , plenty of psychiatrists in private practice , and i'm fond of saying that in my neighborhood there are more psychiatrists than cockroaches how many shrinks can fit in one community pool at a time ? oh , a bunch i 've always thought it would be hard to work as a psychiatrist in a small town where everyone knows everyone if there 's only one psychiatrist , does n't that mean that he probably treats some of the other docs , some of the people he may run into socially ? and what if the only psychiatrist , or his family member , has a mental illness where does he go for treatment ? and what if he needs psychotherapy who does he talk to ? and what about professional consultation on difficult patients , a friend to blow things by see my post on camel , or finally , how does he get together to do podcasts for his blog ? so when i put up my post on the things i do n't like about being a shrink , there came a reply from mellowdee , a small town psychiatrist i liked her response so much , i wanted to put it up as a guest post and here you have it , insights from a small town shrink mellowdee said i , too am blogging when i should be working ! in addition to all the biggies , like getting shafted by insurance companies , what i find annoying about being a shrink relates directly to the fact that i live in a tiny town there are only four other psychiatrists in private practice , and one of them is my husband there is a small local hospital which i would never in a million years use if a patient needed admission , the care is so abominable lack of referral resources means i'm taking care of super sick people that should be referred to a more intensive setting , but there is no such place to send them there are many patients in the practice that are n't going to get better as a result , when they might if the resources were available it 's extremely frustrating firing patients for not paying , and then seeing them at the post office , the movies , a restaurant , at my kid 's school , etc and having them come over , to tell me how much they need my services without mentioning the outstanding balance , while everyone around is listening with ears flapping it would be a challenge for emily post having local idiot gps change my patient 's psych meds either because a the patient calls sees him her for psych symptoms instead of me while extremely annoying and grounds for firing the patient , the patient is still the patient and ca n't be expected to be reasonable , or b the gp is an arrogant idiot who has boundary problems and changes psych meds during an annual checkup or whatever when the patient crumps , guess who has to deal with it ? prescribing off label doses standard practice since i get the sickest of the sick of the one medicine the patient has responded to , which , even though i take the time to fill out the proper paperwork , the insurance refuses to pay for being a doctor , even if only a shrink , in a small town makes me a celeb , and all my behaviors my husband 's and my kid 's are observed with great interest it 's taken me years to stop worrying about it , and simply to live early on , i had a patient tell me that the state of my husband 's car was a disgrace he 's a slob , it was undoubtedly littered with take out bags , empty cardboard coffee containers , dirty snotrags , drifts of articles , sneakers and exercise equipment i had to laugh ! i shrugged , and commented that when you 're married , you have to pick your battles the patient did n't agree with me getting stuck with a patient that should be a clinic patient i e does n't pay reliably , is very needy , has constant drama in his her life , calls and pages a lot but the clinic is so overwhelmed it would take six months to get the patient there , and the patient is n't behaving in a way that 's obvious enough to justify refusing to continue seeing them sigh i have to stop there 's more , but why go on ? as you may have guessed , i wo n't be moving to south dakota anytime soon
