update this article was featured in my book saying no to suicide , with added commentary recently apple has made changes to siri to address the problem of suicide let s take a look at those changes and see if they will be effective using siri can be fun and even useful , but one of the downsides to siri is that everything you ask her is sent to a server out across the internet through the wires , switches , and tubes where your question is parsed by apple s servers before an answer is sent back to you this is a downside because the conversation is often a stilted one like those you have on walkie talkies you need to keep your query simple so siri won t be confused , and you have to wait for her to get back to you if the internet is down , you re out of luck the upside to all of this is that apple gets to look over the types of questions people are seeking answers for apparently , a lot of people are asking siri for help with suicide saying i want to kill my boss may not produce a useful reply , but now telling siri i want to kill myself , i want to commit suicide , or simply suicide hotline calls up information for national suicide prevention lifeline siri tells you if you are thinking about suicide , you may want to speak with someone at the national suicide prevention lifeline they re at shall i call them for you ? saying or tapping yes calls the number saying or tapping no causes siri to search for suicide prevention centers near you if she can t find any , she offers to search the web this is a great way to leverage technology to help those struggling with depression and suicidal ideation something i ve personally struggled with , too logic always wins out in the end for me , but not everybody is able to reason with themselves when they are in the throes of severe depression a cry asking siri for help with suicide can instead bring up the help they truly need unfortunately , to get the desired help , one has to ask the magic questions telling siri i want to die gets you help , but not i wish i was dead , or i just want to die telling siri i want to jump off a bridge points you to the lifeline , but not i want to jump off a roof or i m gonna jump i want to shoot myself , yes , but i'm feeling suicidal , no even just using suicide in a sentence doesn t necessarily trigger help i asked siri how do i commit suicide with a reese s peanutbutter cup ? , and siri simply wanted to do a web search for me not that i blamed her for not knowing her responses are not a simple keyword response to the sentences with suicide or commit suicide in them , but are likely keyed to preprogrammed sentences researching all these expressions left me feeling a bit queasy my daughters especially had little patience for this exercise , but i wanted to know what type of questions would spawn the proper responses was apple just anticipating people 's needs , or were apple 's servers being bombarded with people asking siri for help with suicide ? saying i want to blow my brains out into my iphone was strangely unsettling when siri was new most of us had fun asking random questions looking for offbeat answers , but as siri has matured it has become more useful and more sensitive to people 's needs this isn t as fun , but it is more socially conscious none of this will be helpful for me because i am thankfully beyond the days of suicidal ideation , and i m not likely to ask siri for help on the subject she s no zola on aol this is a good thing because i don t believe siri has my best interests at heart just between you and i , i do n't think siri likes me much when i told her , i hate myself , she glibly replied , noted gee thanks , siri
