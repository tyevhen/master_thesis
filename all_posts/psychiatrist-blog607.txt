if you check out the today 's posts over on kevinmd , you 'll notice that kevin picked up my post on the ethical dilemma of the college student and the internship application you 'll also notice that the post was tweeted times , and that no one likes it on their facebook page the story on the therapeutic value of touch got likes and the art of alzheimer 's got likes my story is alone in it 's unlikability and now that you mention it , our posts on shrink rap do n't have many likes and our fan page does n't have very many fans friends you know , i would take it personally , but when we first put the page out , one of our readers mentioned that if they liked a psychiatry book , all their friends would see and would wonder why is it true ? i do n't think too hard about what other people like but for the non stop political stuff but then again , i have a socially acceptable reason to like a shrink rap book i think , my kids would probably say it 's bragging to like your own book so maybe people do n't like shrinky stuff because they do n't want to worry about the message it sends and the questions this might open , either aloud or in the viewers head or maybe i just write boring stuff and this is my way of defending my ego against demoralization just in case you 're wondering , people liked my analysis of the angry birds addiction when it was posted on kevinmd maybe that was a safer like but who 's counting ?
