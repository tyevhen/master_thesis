yesterday i showed how i handled the problem of noise description in a scene from a comedic novella code name b a t t y i'm working on i thought today i 'd present the entire scene free book sample ! along with an explanation of what the scene does and why it 's constructed the way it is i wanted to accomplish a number of goals with this scene the main character , tyler schremp , has been talked into having a quick drink at joy joy a fictional restaurant bar in palo alto on the way home from work schremp has group therapy at seven , so the drink has to be a quickie both schremp and his buddy matt dixon are young engineers working for a hot toy company startup in silicon valley called hoitytoyty they have a love hate relationship with their jobs they love creating high tech toys , but their boss an insufferable ass has them working on such idiotic projects as a scent emitting unicorn doll fresh scent cornelia you put glade scent packs in the unicorn 's ass , and then , assuming the batteries are fully charged , the doll spurts air freshener in microprocessor controlled bursts out its anus all day the goals for the scene are show that schremp and dixon are best buds of long standing male bonding show their dissatisfaction with work , their eagerness to go into business for themselves have them talk about schremp 's main problem , which at the moment is how to reconnect with the beautiful and mysterious puppet toting redhead he met a few nights ago do all this in a lighthearted way the entire scene is a segue from an office scene to a group therapy scene it has to cap off a lousy day at the office while paving the way for group therapy the redhead will show up at group therapy here 's the whole scene the crescendo of cacophony at joy joy had n't yet reached full on happy hour earbleed level , but the din was prodigious so much so that dixon had to go back out the front door to the sidewalk to check his voicemail while schremp , securing the last empty stools at the bar , fetched two tall glasses of buttface amber one of the featured microbrews of the day from the red suspendered , all too jolly bartender du jour as dixon finally shuffled back inside , tucking his iphone in his pocket , schremp asked anything important ? dixon , accepting a beer from schremp hitler called , he wants his youth back other than that schremp raised his glass , said a heil mary , and took a sip dixon did likewise dixon what about you , ? any word from not a peep beginning to think i popped the clutch schremp licked foam off his upper lip and looked in vain for a coaster on which to see his beer , finding , instead , only a soggy cocktail napkin you know , maybe i just i would n't worry about it , dixon said , with a dismissive flip of the hand it 's only been , what , a week ? yeah not even schremp was having to speak loudly now , to be heard over the background noise but you called her , right ? schremp nodded as he drank i do n't feel right leaving , you know , a hundred messages or something , though do n't want to come across as a stalker how many times have you called her ? twice plus one text message pffah dude that 's not stalking take it from someone who knows dixon held his glass up and admired the three concentric rings of foam in the empty upper third look , chug lines schremp sighted across the chug lines and down the crowded bar , taking in the pot luck assortment of helter skelter hairdos , the predominantly northern european profiles punctuated by the occasional soft rounded oriental face , checking , meanwhile , for redheads with puppets , drooping parallel e cigs , some hint of a chocolate suede sole society ankle boot but alas , no joy , as the fighter jocks say i mean , sometimes i think maybe i am a bit obsessed with her , in a way , schremp said , fiddling with his glass i keep replaying that night over and over in my mind the flashbacks are on a tape loop sometimes , like when you ca n't get a song out of your head ? dixon nodded earworm very dangerous one time i got devo stuck in my head for two days that happened to me with bryan ferry 's 'boys and girls ' do n't know that one well , do not listen to it , my friend understand ? you 'll go insane like that movie what 's it called ? where there 's this videotape , and if you watch it , you 'll die seven days later schremp nodded before making concentric chug line no in his glass the ring that 's exactly it , that 's what 's happening to me and it 's been almost seven days yeah , but you 're not going to die just because marcy did n't call you back molly not marcy what 's that ? i ca n't hear you joy joy was fast approaching the fire marshall 's room capacity limit or so schremp supposed , the place packed now with clamorous roisterers intent on pushing the decibel envelope beyond airline baggage handler recommended maximums cocktail glasses three in a waitress 's hands at once clinked and clacked , cash register slamming shut as someone 's stool leg stuttered across the floor nearby what can i getcha ? , burly guffaws competing with soprano laughter , a sudden swoosh of street noise as fresh celebrants burst through the main entry door , wine cork 's thoppp ! providing a grace note to a distant woman 's rising arpeggio of giggles the thrum of a vox humana orchestra tuning up schremp swirled the remaining two ounces of beer in his glass he scanned the crowd , eyes finally falling on dixon at the first lull in the background noise he said we could fix the noise problem , you know yeah , we could go outside no , i mean we could fix it with technology dixon was game go on an array of microphones in that wall over there schremp motioned with his head and an array of speakers in this wall over here right ? invert the signal , drive the anti noise through the speakers , time it so the noise gets canceled for these people right over here dixon mused on it , nodding , far away stare , feigning comprehension interesting idea see , if you have enough microphones , you can triangulate the origin of any individual sound in this room or all of the various sounds dixon 's brows unfurled , an aha moment slowly washing across his face and likewise , with an array of speakers , you can focus calibrated anti noise on any location in the room barroom active noise suppression bans exactly dixon slapped the side of schremp 's shoulder freakin' brilliant dude , you 're a genius , you know that ? the two clinked glasses and then knocked back the rest of their beers dixon grabbed a half soaked cocktail napkin from the bar and used it to wipe his mouth this , he said , is exactly the kind of stuff we ought to be working on instead of unicorns with april fresh anal glands schremp nodded , half smiling yep it 's just about that time dixon glanced at his watch group therapy ? no i mean , yeah , that too but what i meant was , it 's just about time for us to turn the page you know ? put hoitytoyty behind us dixon smiled ordinarily , the last thing i want to put behind me is a herd of unicorns but in this case , my man , you 're absolutely right i'm with you all the way
