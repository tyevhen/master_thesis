hi friends ! today 's print was inspired by my love of ducks after seeing them waddling with babies all around the bronx zoo i imagined them wearing preppy dressy clothes seersucker anyone ? and headed off to someplace important as a family like church if that 's not your thing , perhaps you can imagine them going to a sunday picnic ? as with the others , this affordable art print is great for nurseries , a child 's room , or someone who just likes cute illustration and ducks you can get a print at the meandwee etsy shop save
