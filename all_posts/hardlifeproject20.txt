man is least himself when he talks in his own person give him a mask , and he will tell you the truth oscar wilde i'm a very self conscious person i'm anxious and tend to assume i'm being judged for the worse i believe people do n't like me and will attack me if i show my true face i'm so good at pretending , sometimes i do n't even know what my true face is give me back my face ! i 've been thinking about the issue of self consciousness and judgement quite a lot lately , trying to come to terms with self judgement and my fear of others' judgement i 've been trying to look at it from a nihilist perspective nihilism says that reality is devoid of intrinsic meaning or purpose most people assume this to mean a world that 's despairing and empty , which is certainly one of nihilism 's faces but , it 's easy to forget the word intrinsic in the definition nihilism does n't say reality has no meaning , merely that it has no intrinsic meaning , a vast difference i believe the meaning of life , its purpose , comes from us i also think the answer to the question , who 's judging me now is no one but myself in the film watchmen , a group of dark superheros watch over humanity , protecting us and exacting justice they do a pretty piss poor job of it , because most of the heros are sociopaths who are far more screwed up than the people they are supposedly watching out for also , why does every superhero have to wear a cape ? i do n't get it similar to the alternate reality of watchmen , we all want someone to protect us to love us , to pleasure us , praise and approve of us someone to be the parent protector we never had , although i'm glad none of these heros were my parents i have enough problems already maybe the price we pay for the continual seeking of others' approval , to be filled up with another 's love , is that we become more vulnerable to their and our own judgement think about it basing your self esteem on someone 's approval gives them a huge lever on you everything has an opposite love hate praise scorn hero antihero lately , i'm preferring to keep the opposites inside myself i'm tired of projecting the lover , the destroyer , the redeemer onto other people , asking them to play out the roles that are really just projections of various internal selves like dr manhattan says when he tells his story , i am tired of earth these people i'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives who 's watching me ? i am
