some days i do n't want to be here any more that 's the honest truth that everyone would rather i lied about some days life just stretches on and on like an endless desert in my mind and i struggle to see what the point is when i 've just dragging myself inch by inch toward a horizon that will quickly shift once i get ten feet further yesterday was one of those days so is today maybe i did n't take my omega fatty acid or whatever that shit is called some component of the carton of pills i have to take to keep myself somewhat stable sometimes i can figure out what might be wrong , sometimes i ca n't my body is a mystery to me even though i constantly inhabit it , like that picture in my science textbook of the world before human life giant pools of ooze and meteors ricocheting through the dark sky i do n't know what it needs to be satisfied treating my illness is all trial and error , though my psychiatrist would never care to admit it every time i think i 've turned a corner , i plunge back into darkness again the worst part is that i feel so alone in my fight my psychiatrist barely knows anything about me she answers my emails with a couple of words i have to pay just to spend minutes talking to her so why go unless you 've run out of refills ? my friends i do n't have friends i feel like i can talk to when i'm hurting they 're too wrapped up in themselves or they get uncomfortable i 've tried saying things in the past and i only get more hurt by their lack of responsiveness my mother is supportive but i already feel bad with how much of my emotional crap i 've dumped on her over the years and she can only do so much my counselor is great but i can only see her for minutes once a frickin' week how much can you accomplish in minutes ? so much happens outside of that minute window that i do n't get to talk through i mean , over two decades of things have happened before i even started getting a minute window to process through all of my shit i do n't know what i'm supposed to do if i feel bad between sessions i do n't know if i'm allowed to schedule an extra appointment my counselor told me once to go to the er if i ever feel like ending my life , but there 's no way in hell i'm going there i 've heard the stories about how they treat people with mental illness and every time i go for my minutes of fame , i leave with more work to do i leave with a realization of yet another way in which i am falling short i leave with another vague idea of what i need to do to improve myself i leave with another technique for how to handle my shit the next time it comes up , which is usually the second i step out of that freaking office sometimes it helps , overall counseling has been a force for positive change in my life , but i have to admit that it leaves me unbelievably frustrated at other times lately , i feel like therapy leaves me with this burden to fix myself and what a crushing burden that is i ca n't possibly accomplish it i do n't know how when i say that , i hear in my voice the ghosts of my evangelical christian past saying , that 's because only god can fix you but i 've been disappointed beyond words with the results i 've gotten from him over the years i still capitalize the h because we still have a relationship , god and i it feels so wrong to put us together like we 're equals , but it sounded catchy , but i have trouble trusting him the way i used to and it does n't help when his followers are so unfeeling and ignorant , badgering me about when i'm going to come back to church instead of asking me why i left i guess i'm tired of being responsible for my well being that sounds immature and , well , irresponsible , but it 's so frustrating to spend every day monitoring your thoughts and keeping careful watch over your coping mechanisms and pushing yourself to self advocate and making your gratitude lists and recording your latest mood and taking your pills on time and then waiting thirty minutes to eat and doing your mindfulness exercise when you get upset and remembering to do your deep breathing when your anxiety flares back up it 's all on me my counselor says that my mood and my self concept are in my control like it 's a good thing , but frankly it 's an overwhelming responsibility i want someone else to take care of me i want something good to just fall into my lap for once instead of having to work for it i want a friend who will call me and ask if everything is okay i guess they call that co dependency though my counselor keeps telling me that i have to become more content with myself and secure in who i am so i 'll have good energy and attract people who appreciate me for who i am i guess that makes sense , but how the heck am i supposed to do that ? and it all sounds like just another mammoth task tacked onto the end of my to do list another way in which i fall short not confident enough in myself even though i'm a hell of a lot more confident than most women and men i think the arrogance act is just a coping mechanism for rampant insecurity i 've met which then makes me feel even worse about myself , which is ironic since the whole problem is that i do n't feel good enough about myself how am i supposed to feel good about myself when i am going to this therapy because i know there 's something wrong with me ? people are always telling you to end on a positive note , even the mental health advocacy people well , i 've spent too much time spinning my mental illness in a positive light because i was scared to let people see how bad it really was in the recesses of my depressive mind who was i trying to protect ? my counselors ? my psychiatrists ? my family ? well , i only hurt myself by keeping them from giving me the support i needed i could feel proud of how much of my own weight i have borne in the process of dragging myself to this point , but i mostly just feel lonely i wish i could have had some company the worst part of depression is the isolation nobody gets what 's going on in your head and no one can make you feel better but i do n't really trust people fully any more it seems to me that they can leave you even more burned it seems like there are some things you just have to muscle through on your own is it wrong for me to say that ? i hope if you 're hurting you can find help i hope you 're not alone certainly you 're not alone in feeling alone i hope this post shows you that as for me , i 'll close the computer and go to sleep so i can stop thinking about thinking for a while it will be a nice relief the only trouble is i wo n't even be awake to appreciate it i guess this is a bit of a morbid , dark post i made the mistake of reading poetry earlier i think it rubbed off on me but at the end of the day , i just want to be honest because i think people who are suffering deserve to know that they 're not crazy they 're one of many their feelings are legitimate when we put trigger warnings on posts and tell people to remain positive all the time when talking about mental illness , we 're being like the rest of the world and denying them the opportunity to feel those feelings and speak that life is n't always a walk in the park sometimes it 's an afternoon hiding behind bottles in dark cafes
