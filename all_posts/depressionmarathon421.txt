i had a great run today at the med city marathon ! i bumped into my friend and co worker , maureen , at the starting line , and we quickly decided to help each other she was attempting to re qualify for boston , for which i am already qualified , and was looking to run around per mile perfect as i stated in my post yesterday , my plan was to run just under minutes per mile for at least the first miles so we started the race together around mile , we began conversing with a third woman , beth from des moines she was also running our pace , so the three of us ran and talked together for the next miles unfortunately , maureen dropped off the pace just before mile , so beth and i continued together we ran stride for stride , chatted , and quickened our pace with each successive mile beth dropped back just before mile , so i went ahead alone it had begun to rain around mile , and by mile it was raining steadily with the temperature only in the mid 's , a stiff wind , and the soaking rain , it got a bit chilly , but i did n't mind i ran mile in minutes , seconds after slowing to the next mile , i ran miles , , and at each i felt great despite the rain mile was my fastest mile of the day , , and i finished the final two tenths of a mile at a strong , but still comfortable , pace it was great there is nothing better than flying toward the finish of a marathon and feeling good all the while i finished in a very respectable i was the th of women overall and th out of women in my age group that was all nice , but i was most pleased with running a huge negative split i ran the second miles of the race minutes and seconds faster than i ran the first miles ! that was pretty cool i am quite pleased that i stuck to my plan i ran conservatively for the first miles i was easily able to drop my pace after that , and running as fast as i did over the last kilometers was a bonus i did not expect i enjoyed running with maureen and beth we talked the entire way , and the miles quickly clicked by i rarely run with other people , and almost never do i chat during a race , especially a marathon ! but i was comfortable , relaxed and having fun it was fun ! i'm now feeling more confident about my current level of fitness i'm feeling more confident about the possibility of running well at grandmas if my training over the next four weeks goes well , i may just try to run a personal best we 'll see that 's more than i need to think about right now i think i 'll continue glowing about today for just a few more minutes first
