graham lee , someone living with kennedy s disease , posted a link to medscape , another resource on our condition , on the kd uk facebook page many years ago , i visited medscape , but found it lacking on information concerning kennedy s disease the reason could have been that medscape shows it as kennedy disease no 's if you search for sbma , kennedy 's disease , or anything similar , it wo n't provide any information the information found on medscape isn t new to most of us , but it is comprehensive and i found it to be an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma if you haven t visited this resource recently , check it out i believe these pages would be an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about this condition
