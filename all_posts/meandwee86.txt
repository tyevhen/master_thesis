my almost daily walk to our little village post office takes only about minutes but it 's packed to the brim with the most beautiful sights and sounds trees everywhere bursting with blooms , birds of all kinds singing their songs , the soft breeze blowing through the grass i love this time of year it 's so wonderful to stop and enjoy the blessings around us shipping orders to my awesome customers could be a chore but is n't thanks to the loveliness along the way ! my faithful post office travel sidekick my neighbor 's wonderful tree another neighbor 's awesome tree the historic farmhouse at the end of my road one of the flowers in front of the post office the great tree in front of the post office the view at the desk while my parcels are weighed i hope you enjoyed our virtual journey to the village post ! save
