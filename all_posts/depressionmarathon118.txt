i 've been doing this awhile since my depression began in november , , i 've been through the whole gamut of symptoms and treatments , medications and therapies , and as you know , multiple hospitalizations i 've been through dips , and lulls , and catastrophic crashes in my mood i 've lost time , friends , jobs , and financial stability yet i 've gained perspective , humility , trusted relationships , and educational opportunities it 's been quite a ride and while it 's not what i envisioned , it is my reality , and i try my best to live through it all with honesty , compassion and integrity despite all these experiences , and especially despite all the depression relapses i 've endured , i find myself amazed at the sense of desperation i feel this is not a new feeling it 's very familiar i do n't always recognize it , but i'm pretty sure it almost always accompanies an extended drop in my mood i'm noting it today because it 's been quite prevalent over the past several days i do n't know any other way to describe it it 's a sense of desperation you 'd think , with years of this illness under my belt , i 'd be better able to ride out the intermittent storms without the sense of panic and doom i currently feel after all , i 've made it this far history reveals that even my most severe depression episodes have passed of the time one hundred percent of the time ! i 've felt hopeless and suicidal i 've been isolated and incapacitated i 've been knocked so low , nobody would have blinked if i had n't managed to get back up but i 've always gotten back up so why do i feel so desperate ? i feel scared , alarmed , and surprised by my current symptoms , even though my current symptoms are nowhere near the worst i 've ever experienced i am questioning my ability to function and persevere i feel hopeless , alone , and lonely , yet i find it impossible to reach out it 's physically painful to be out in public , something i 've experienced many times before , but today it 's freaking me out and worst of all , despite all evidence to the contrary , i find myself convinced this episode is not going to pass it will pass it will i do know that as uncomfortable as it is in the moment , i know it wo n't last forever so why do i feel so desperate ? does anyone else experience this ?
