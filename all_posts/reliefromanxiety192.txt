mental health always seems to be surrounded by the word 'medication' it 's true to say that there are many people with mental health that do n't take medication , but there are those that do and that 's nothing to be ashamed of what we must remember is that mental illness can affect people in the same way as a physical illness and should be and gradually is being treated with the same respect it 's also important to remember that one in four of us are going to experience a mental health condition in any one year , so why should those with the conditions not have the same help ? hence , if someone needs medication to live a 'normal' life then they have every right to do so and the medication is just a part in trying to heal and repair a part of the body this is just like if someone were to take blood pressure tablets it 's all helping i must admit that i was very reluctant to take any medication because of stigma and future prospects , but in the end it was a matter of enjoying my life once more or to carry on struggling in the end after months , if not years of deliberation i decided to take medication i know there are some out there who say natural remedies are best , medication is n't good and so on but , i had tried everything possible herbal remedies , exercise , breathing techniques , visualisation , changing my diet , cbt , hypnotherapy and counselling although the cbt was the one thing that benefited me the most , nothing was making a massive difference the continued absence from school and nothingness in life was no way to live and thus it was advised that medication was the way to go luckily , the first medication i was prescribed was the one for me it took a few weeks for it to work and to get the dose right , but after that it has been a great help i can only describe it like a miracle i am now going to school more often and it is less of a struggle than it was , i'm also doing things i used to do with more ease i 'd be lying if i said i do n't struggle anymore , but anxiety is less present i still have bad days and there are things that anxiety still interferes with and things that i struggle to do and avoid but , this is just something i still have to work on what people often forget is that mental illness is often an imbalance of chemicals and medication helps to balance this out , just like taking medication for thyroid , for example i think people see it as a problem because people cannot see mental illness and thus do n't believe in the devastating effects it can have on the person , there is still the use of stereotypes and there is also the belief that all medication is addictive and makes you lose yourself of course , this is n't true medication has improved my life more than i could have imagined i was extremely skeptical at first , but it 's better to enjoy life a bit more than to worry about the stigma please do n't forget if you feel you are struggling , see the doctor and do what 's right for you do n't give up best wishes , amy xx
