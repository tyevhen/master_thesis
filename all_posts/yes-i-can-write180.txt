welcome to the first ever guest post monday ! it wo n't be a super regular thing , but you will be seeing a couple more guest posts in the coming weeks for this first edition , i'm very happy to give you a short piece about unschooling from sara mcgrath , unschooling examiner and author of unschooling a lifestyle of learning ! to me , this concept of unschooling , which i have chosen as a project focus , really refers to everything in life i may check the education box or the homeschooling box when pressed to classify an article or interest area , but really i choose to focus on unschooling because it integrates all aspects of my life learning inseparable from living and parenting inseparable from living , etc i chose prior focuses , such as the continuum concept and attachment parenting , for similar reasons where western culture expects parents to use day care and school to exclude children from adult activities , cc and ap show a way of life that includes children as integral i have children whether or not they 're present with me , they 're an inseparable part of my life whole life or radical unschooling further dissolves the boundaries that define conventional lifestyles with lots of rules and regulations i do n't set and enforce bedtimes or mealtimes for myself or my kids , for example , because i'm going to help us all get what we need regardless i 've felt drawn to radical unschooling for its simplicity i do n't do unschooling it 's not an action plan i just live with my kids we communicate freely i help them figure things out they help me do routine tasks such as housework , cooking , gardening , shopping , etc we do n't have to think about schooling or parenting we just live a simple , whole life together you might also like guest post , anyone ? guest post answering negative questions does n't need to be a priority guest post eat be free guest post the future of unschooling by jeff landale linkwithin
