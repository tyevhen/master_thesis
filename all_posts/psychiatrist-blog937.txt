sarebear has been commenting on our posts for years now , since the very beginning of shrink rap she sent us a link to one of her blog posts on pie bolar served w flavors of anksia tea and the post was a detailed discussion about her session that day with her psychiatrist lots of details and lots of sadness and angst , but a wonderful glimpse in to what happens in a session with a psychiatrist i especially loved that sarebear started her account in the waiting room where she sat with her family the psychiatrist was running late and two drug reps were sitting there talking ! what does a patient think about when such things intrude on their care ? with permission , here 's sarebear 's thoughts on drug reps in the waiting room my psychiatrist was twenty minutes late today , which means that she got in to the office at , which was when she was supposed to see me , but her first appointment , her , was still waiting to be seen , so i had to wait longer ugh ! ! she said , i'm sorry i'm so late ! ! , and the other patient said , do n't worry about it , but i said absolutely nothing lol can you tell i was a little peeved ? in early morning traffic , it takes about minutes to get there , so we had gotten up early , and had gotten there minutes early , even , not wanting to shave it right to the minute i suppose everyone has an off day , though it 's still annoying for me , as the patient ! guess i was n't very patient , heh while i waited , just after the first patient went in , a pair of drug reps , one in training , came in , and dropped off some samples in her back room , then sat down to wait i vowed that i 'd get seen before them , because patients are more important they talked alot of business , and about where each of them had worked , and some of the details of the software they were using on the laptop , that they wish they 'd had at the previous place , and stuff it was interesting to listen to them talk drug reps are a sadly necessary evil of the medical practice , because they provide drug samples for the doctors , without which you would n't be able to start some of the initial doses of certain medications , and sometimes the samples are used to help some patients afford the medications , although they do not replace the pharmacy , not at all the drug reps also provide coupons and promotions for the patients to redeem for free two week or one month supplies of the medication , with prescription , at the pharmacy , whenever their companies are offering such coupons and promotions , so again , these things are good for the patient 's pocketbook , their bottom line , for being able to afford the medications , when the insurance situation is n't ideal obviously some of these do n't last very long , while other programs will , say , take half off the cost of the medication for a year , but whatever can help the patient , is a good thing it 's just , the whole salesman aspect of the thing , seems a little smarmy it also feels a bit intrusive , to have salesmen in the medical setting like that , but as i say , it is a necessary evil , even if one wonders about the influence that they may have over a doctor 's prescribing practices the most ethical doctors will not be influenced , but no one is perfect anyway , sitting there for awhile , listening to them , i did n't think they worked for pfizer , the makers of geodon , the medication i had been reduced in dose after my recent bad experience on , and was here today to be likely removed off of and put on possibly something else , but if they did , i wanted to tell them i thought it sucked so , i asked them eventually , do you work for pfizer ? they said , no , so i continued anyway , since they 'd still have an interest , and they did , and i said , well , geodon sucks they said , we think so too , we sell a competing product i said oh , okay i hate it , because i had unexpected side effects they then expressed their regrets to me that i 'd had a hard time , and again said that they did n't like the med i thought the whole interaction was a little bit funny , hee normally i would n't , as a patient , have any kind of interaction with drug reps at all , but since my psychiatrist was late , and since they 'd been chatting for awhile so freely in front of my husband , daughter and i in the waiting room after all , this is the type of location that is basically their workspace for the whole day that , and their car , so one ca n't expect them to just sit there silently , so their chatting had encouraged me to eventually strike up a conversation , since there was nothing else to do while i waited for the doctor when she eventually came out , as she walked past them to the front desk , she asked them if she needed to sign something , i assume as in , to sign for the samples they 'd dropped off in her back room and they stood up and handed her a clipboard and started talking with her , the one in training did i wondered if he 'd bring up with her anything about the competing product for geodon , since he knew she 'd be bringing me off of that one , and potentially on something else , but it seems they had enough discretion not to go there , which amazed me slightly , for salesmen they just brought up the coupons and promotions that are so helpful for patients , and got the signed clipboard back , and in the middle of signing it , she called me in to the office , which helped let the drug reps know that she 'd not be spending a lot of time with them , and made me feel like i was her priority i did n't feel badly that she 'd signed for the samples , because otherwise these men would just be sitting around for another minutes doing nothing , when just minutes of her time took care of the whole matter
