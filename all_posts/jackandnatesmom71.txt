lately i feel like i have been doing a crappy job at many different things i think all mommies feel this way at times it s inevitable how many hats can one person wear ? forget about wearing them well just getting the basics done is overwhelming lately it doesn t help that all of our routines seem be to flying out the window the past few weeks have been extremely complicated for this working mommy and many other mommies too the boys have not had one normal day in the last two weeks this week school is two half days , two days off , and then finally friday i thought would actually be typical but then i came to find out that it s the last friday of the month , and nate s center is closed in the afternoon today the kids went to cisco center for the day , thank god , so i had just my job to do during business hours but every other day , they have been here i have been caring for them for part of the day while working , every day for the past two weeks this is insane when your job is telephonic not only am i under tremendous pressure to get my job done , but i feel as though i am plopping my boys in front of the t v and praying they will keep quiet bad mommy on top of that , all of the housework that i usually get done during my lunch break , etc , has gone out the window so the house is a mess which stresses me out beyond belief jack has been off of memantine for several weeks now , and i think it has affected his sleep it is soooo much worse right now it seems like every other night he is up for hours it started at am yesterday morning at least every minutes until , well , until my mom got here at to help so i could get my calls in for work i am required to make outreach calls to my patients each day try accomplishing that with my little aspie under foot he wakes nate up during this process too and both boys really seem to like climbing on me , especially in the middle of the night i am freaking tired nate is sliding backward a bit less repetition , fewer words although he is also messing with me he keeps laughing and shaking his head no when i ask him to say something and if i push him hard enough , he does it , but we are talking five minutes to get one word out of him much more pointing and in there , in there , in there where i am pulling everything out of the cabinet trying to find what he wants this is so frustrating i am thinking of some new interventions for the boys reading a new book thinking i have my mom reading the same book so she can tell me if i m crazy i need a check person my next step is to remove soy from nate s diet two of his go to foods have soy in them this may not sound like a huge deal , but with a picky palate like nate s , rest assured , it is but it can t be worse than removing dairy that boy was addicted to milk he was like a junkie looking for a fix for the first week we eliminated dairy if we can handle that , this should be easy by comparison we are also losing both of the boys private ot s they are both moving i actually think this is harder on me than it is on them as a parent , especially when your child cannot tell you what goes on , you put an enormous amount of trust in these practitioners especially because they are pushing your kids and urging them to do things that are uncomfortable at times nate s ot in particular has been with him since the beginning i don t think he had even been officially diagnosed when they started working together he can say her name and just to show how significant that accomplishment is her name is amanda not exactly simple nate is also finally having his private speech evaluation next week i am totally psyched for this i put it off for quite a long time , then we were on a waiting list for months before this fall , he wasn t ready his sensory issues were the primary focus he couldn t attend long enough to do anything productive in speech he can now j i am going to be picking him up from cisco center during my lunch hour , running him to speech which is about minutes away , and then bringing him back when he is done that s bound to cause some meltdowns unfortunately , this is the only nearby practice our insurance will cover , and it s the only time they have available , so we will just have to make it work onward ! right ? ? maybe , just maybe , everyone will sleep tonight we are due for a break in that department
