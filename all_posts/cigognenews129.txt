yesterday was december , the anniversary of the start of wwii and now i have good friends who are german scientists before they might have designed bombs to kill americans now they are working on the cure for cancer my how life gets changed and how enemies have changed , but watch out because we can turn anyone into an enemy whether blacks or muslims or foreigners we just need a little encouragement and it will take hold if we live in our brain and do not have much of ourselves and are not based in our feelings primo levi the great italian writer who was in a concentration camp for a long time wrote to create and maintain a war you first need to demonize the other side make them the enemy the attackers , etc , so that they are bereft of any humanity then we can do inhuman acts to them and not feel anything that is the basic capacity of humans not only to humans but animals and babies too where so many doctors previously felt that they never felt pain the first job of war is to dehumanize the enemy it is called brainwashing for good reason we have extracted the brain and left the body behind that might together with is feelings , indicate to us the truth and we see wild rejoicing in the booga booga therapies because they imagine that they have been liberated just like those who have mastered their breathing in mindfulness , which i call mindlessness in france this is called nonmbrilisme we no longer live in a social world we inhabit a solipsistic one where only we exist ayayay then we are satisfied to have access only to our thoughts and not to our feelings we continue what our unfeeling parents believed that feelings are an anathema to be discouraged and disparaged that is how hitler convinced the germans that the jews had to be destroyed and how we convince patients that feelings have to be either destroyed or ignored they become the enemy we don t have to say it we just ignore it and that sends the message feelings do not count we need to extract their humanity out of them then we are not hurting humans and it is very true of extracting our own humanity out of ourselves so that we can inflict pain on others with impunity with not a drop of feeling as we grow up and undergo lack of love we hurt , but soon cover it over with repression we cease to feel for others and above all , for ourselves we lack humanness if that could be stopped or averted we would not have a population that could hurt others , or go to hunt and kill animals and call it sport above all , one could feel the needs of children and fulfill them what a world that would be so how do we dehumanize ? oh wait i know we call people depressives or obsessives and now we treat a cerebral category , not a person or we call our child son or boy ? these are tricks of the mind and from this we can see how a parent can inflict damage he is son or daughter and they are treated as such theirs not to question why theirs but to do or die they are there to take orders because they are my child should we let children cry it out ? we only ask that because children are no longer people should we cry it out ? of course we ask that if we never have and were forbidden to and worse , we stop our children from expressing any feeling strongly we dehumanize it is the neocortex that can dehumanize ourselves and we then enter a therapy that is basically inhuman the property of a brain that thinks but does not feel and where do we get well ? in our head the body is left out of the equation we become dehumanized and think we are so much better when all we have done is shift around the thinking cortex to adjust to our unconscious pain the feelings remain but are deeply hidden , and so is our humanity literally navel gazing
