i ran another race today eleven miles , out and back , pure torture ! okay , i'm exaggerating it was n't all torture , but the last miles were a death march god , i wanted to stop and walk something fierce ! i did n't yippee she said dripping with sarcasm ! here 's how it went down it was a beautiful , cool morning perfect running weather i trolled through the first miles with two other women in my age group , one of whom chatted most of the way it was nice we had fun i knew , however , that they were both running stronger and easier than i at the turnaround , i let them go i did n't see one of them again it was the same woman i locked up with , and who outlasted me , last weekend she looks great ! i caught and passed the other woman about miles from the finish i felt really strong when i caught her i think i was even speeding up unfortunately , that did n't last by the time i hit miles to go , my feeling was more uh oh than yippee the last two miles , as i noted , were torturous hell i'm disappointed both with how horrible i felt , and how slowly it turns out i ran i averaged about per mile contrast that with the 's i averaged in a mile race just two months ago , and you can see why i'm disappointed i certainly felt like i was running a whole lot faster ! that 's never a positive thing the intense effort and poor result makes me concerned that this new anti fatigue med is causing the same problem the old med , it 's cousin , did that is , increase my resting pulse rate when i ran the mile race , my resting pulse had finally returned to a reasonable i quit taking the old med in december my current resting pulse is in the mid 's , although it was in the mid 's the week before i started the new med , too nonetheless , racing today felt a lot like racing last year did tough , and last year it was due to the old med 's side effect but i realize i ca n't jump to any conclusions , because the other reality is i 've hardly trained since grandma 's today 's result could be nothing more than that wait and see , i guess wait and see
