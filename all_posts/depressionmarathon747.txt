i found out tonight that the domain name , depressionmarathon com , which i thought i owned , and for which i have been paying the last three years , is being used by somebody else it 's not a real big deal , but it is frustrating i reserved the name when i began this blog i reserved it , and have been paying to keep it inactive , so that i would own it if i ever wanted to move to my own website i e off of blogger how it got into somebody else 's hands , i do not know it was supposed to automatically renew every year they the hosting company have certainly been charging me every year ! now i'm not too smart when it comes to stuff like this , but i thought this was pretty straightforward , and i thought i was doing what i needed to do to keep depression marathon mine apparently not i suppose i should be honored someone thought enough of my site that they went out and stole the name but i'm just frustrated i 'd hate to have people think that was my site i certainly doubt they are making any money off of it ! maybe they hope i 'll come begging to buy the name back nope that wo n't happen either so it 's just an annoyance and i guess it prohibits me from ever navigating away from blogspot com , but that probably was n't going to happen either obviously , i do n't understand this whole domain system well enough to do that !
