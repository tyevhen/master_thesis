i wo n't pretend that i have a lot to contribute to discussion about the spitzer prostitution scandal it seems to be the biggest crisis to hit the usa since according to the bizarre media fascination with the event on this blog as well as many other blogs to which i frequently link , much more important issues are discussed , yet the media typically chooses to ignore such issues in favor of covering stories that feature more t a for example , i 'd say the growing number of states suing eli lilly over its marketing of zyprexa and its alleged coverup of the drug 's risks is more newsworthy than two adults having consensual sexual relations yes , spitzer is a gold medal winning hypocrite who damaged his family his behavior was immoral duh but why should a crime that included so very few victims become such a blockbuster media sensation when there are problems of much grander scale occurring at the same time about which the public is essentially unaware ? for more on the incredibly strange logic involved in all of the spitzer rigamarole , please check out glenn greenwald 's smokin' hot post
