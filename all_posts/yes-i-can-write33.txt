i'm seeing a tag going around , proclaiming today to be national start homeschooling day in honour of that , i figured i 'd share my top reasons to start unschooling i understand that , for any number of reasons , unschooling just might not to be doable in your life if that 's the case , i hope you can still glean inspiration for doing your best to devalue standardized assessments and instead place value on passion lead , self directed learning , no matter where it takes place if , however , you are considering leaving school or taking your kids out of school , i hope these reasons will prove so inspiring that you actually do it ! building a self directed education forget teachers and standardized curriculum dictating what and how and when you should learn instead , learn about whatever really interests you , what you feel is truly important and relevant your learning then becomes truly personalized , unique to you and based on what you want and need you get to spend as much time as you want doing whatever it is that you wished you could be doing instead of sitting in a classroom , bored by the current lecture learning and growing without externally imposed timelines when you control your own learning , timelines of when certain things should be learned become irrelevant your child is n't a late reader , and you 're not behind in math when you 're no longer comparing yourself or your kids to others , based on what the school system thinks you should be learning instead , you can learn and grow at your own pace , and in your own way we all learn differently , and unschooling allows us to truly embrace that recognizing that we all have knowledge and skills to both learn and share in school , there are teachers there to impart knowledge , and students attending in order to have knowledge imparted to them outside of school , you start to recognize that everyone can fill both of those roles at different times , and that the relationship between those who are teaching and those who are learning can be a cooperative , collaborative , and respectful one improving relationships between parents and children parent child relationships , especially parent teen relationships , can often be contentious fights often revolve around issues of homework , bed time early school days seem to require one , and other school related things when you remove school from the equation , and when parents start striving to trust , respect , and truly listen to their children , relationships can change dramatically , and teenage rebellion can become a thing of the past socializing on your own terms the forced socialization of schools , complete with bullies both other children and sometimes even teachers , a lack of freedom of choice and movement , and an inability to choose more or less socializing based on each individual 's needs , does not exactly promote the development of a healthy social life as an unschooler , socializing can be based on the emotional needs of each child , and you can build a social life that truly feels good to you learning in the real world instead of learning in a single , age segregated building , unschoolers learn in the real world you can learn at home , in nature , at the library , at museums and community centers and yes , in classes the world opens up , and you start to see all the myriad opportunities that are all around you for learning that feels relevant and important in your life growing in an environment that feels supportive and safe for many students including lgbtq people , disabled students , and students with mental illnesses schools can feel anything but safe or supportive people learn best and are most creative in their learning when they 're not stressed and afraid , so if family life is nurturing and loving , home can make a much better base for learning having time to daydream instead of being pushed to focus constantly , school free learning leaves plenty of time for relaxing , processing , daydreaming , playing , and quiet introspection as an unschooler you can reject ideas of laziness and choose to value the whole learning process , including boredom , not only the parts that look most active and productive doing real work when you 're not simply studying for a test or producing a project or paper that will never be seen outside of a single classroom , you can instead focus on work and creation that actually feels real you can volunteer doing important work in your community , get a job or apprentice in a field that fascinates you , write blog posts and articles for an actual audience , create visual art for a community exhibition , and otherwise share yourself with the world you have the time to do things that feel genuinely meaningful , and that make a real impact on the lives of others all of these are compelling reasons why many of us have chosen unschooling for ourselves or our families i hope that they encourage you to choose a freer , more personalized , more exciting way of approaching learning in your own lives , as well
