curio , by evangeline denmkark arc provided by publisher through netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review grey haward lives in a world where people ca n't digest food unless they drink a potion provided by a tyrannical ruling group when her friend whit gets punished for saving her life , grey discovers a hidden trait inside herself she is a defender who protects people from tyranny just as she 's discovering her new powers , she is thrown into a strange new steampunk world in which she must find the mad tock in order to escape curio had unique plot line and world building , and the mystery remained throughout the book it was good , clean fun with no sex and minimal violence both worlds in the book were quite fascinating , and i wish i knew more about each however , i did have some difficulty because the transition from the first world to the second was quite abrupt i was just starting to get emotionally involved in the first when it was taken away , and i suddenly had to start from scratch learning the rules of a foreign world i would have preferred reading two books each with one world than one book with two it was a little confusing overall , i think denmark has a lot of potential as an author , and will keep a look out for other books by her
